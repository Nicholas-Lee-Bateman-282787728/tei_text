                         </placeName> has known its share of socially conscious clergymen-from Henry
                         Ward Beecher, who preached in the 1840s, to William H. Hudnut, the
                         minister-mayor who helped to reshape the city in our own time. In this
                         issue, the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> offers contrasting interpretations of the
                         legacy of another Hoosier man of the cloth: Oscar McCulloch, of the
                         city&apos;s Plymouth Congregational Church. For Brent Ruswick,
                         McCulloch&apos;s turn, in the 1880s, away from an early focus on the
                         evils of &quot;pauperism&quot; presages his importance to
                         subsequent generations of social-work professionals. Elsa E Kramer points
                         to a different legacy: the twentieth-century eugenics movement, which
                         relied, as she shows, upon a reworking of McCulloch&apos;s research.
                         These differing sides of McCulloch&apos;s legacy remind us not only of
                         continued controversies over the origins of social inequality, but also of
                         the possibility of drawing distinct historical insights from similar
                         sources.</p>

                    <p>On April 25-26, the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> will cosponsor &quot;Thomas

                         result in a special issue of the <hi rend="i">IMH</hi>, brings scholars
                         from around the country to examine Benton&apos;s 1933 masterpieces and

                         these historians, McCulloch is notorious for his enthusiastic promotion of
                         the idea that a distinct subgroup of poor persons - the paupers - were
                         biological degenerates, beyond hope of reformation or partial improvement.
                         McCulloch also became one of the first Gilded Age reformers to implement
                         restrictions on charitable relief and to speculate that forcible
                         restrictions of matrimonial and reproductive rights might be the best
                         method of dealing with the biologically unfit. </p>

                         construction and operation of the Indianapolis Charity Organization

                         presented at the influential National Conference of Charities and
                         Correction. The conclusions McCulloch derived from his work in <placeName>

                         that they obtained by deceiving charities - were biologically degenerate
                         persons. As such, they were destined to spend their lives as unrepentant

                         who craved evidence for their contentions that pauperism was fundamentally
                         different from ordinary poverty, that it constituted a grave national
                         menace, and that it necessitated extreme invasions of privacy and
                         restrictions on charitable giving.</p>

                    <p>By the late 1880s, however, McCulloch shifted his emphasis away from
                         biological pauperism and redefined the tenets of scientific charity to
                         focus on the social origins of all forms of poverty. The national leaders
                         of the movement soon followed his ideas, abandoning their commitment to a
                         hard biological distinction between the worthy poor and the unworthy
                         pauper. Relocating McCulloch&apos;s charitable work in <placeName>

                         research changes our view both of the man and of the movement. The study
                         reveals how the term &quot;pauper&quot; went from being defined as
                         a nuisance to a menace, before being abandoned as antiquated and
                         inaccurate. It brings us a more complete appreciation of the significance
                         of McCulloch&apos;s innovative work in <placeName>

                         regarding the poor. More importantly, McCulloch&apos;s transformation
                         demands that we reconsider the national scientific charity movement as more
                         dynamic and complex, and eventually more progressive and historically
                         influential, than the moralizing, repressive movement that historians
                         typically depict.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>

                              charity in the form of food and clothing to the local poor since 1835.
                              Distribution occurred face-to-face, with persons reportedly of the

                              McCulloch had begun his professional career as a traveling salesman in
                              the American West. Biographer Genevieve Weeks speculates that his
                              encounters with diverse characters in this line of work might have
                              been responsible for his movement towards a more liberal theology.<hi

                              career in favor of becoming a minister, and enrolled at the

                              crystallized his new theology. Weeks points out that from the start of

                              &quot;A Case of Poverty,&quot; described <quote
                                   rend="blockquote">a family composed of a man, half-blind, a
                                   woman, and two children, the woman&apos;s sister and child,
                                   the man&apos;s mother, blind, all in one room six feet

                         <p>It is uncertain just how McCulloch came upon this family, which he soon
                              dubbed the &quot;Tribe of Ishmael,&quot; but their shocking
                              condition both disturbed and moved him. He investigated the
                              family&apos;s history at the township trustee&apos;s office,
                              where all records of public poor relief were kept. There he discovered
                              the astonishing extent and historical depth of the family&apos;s
                              dependence on public relief. Generation after generation of the
                              Ishmael family had grown up depending on charitable or public relief
                              and suffering from the full gamut of social dysfunctions. To
                              McCulloch&apos;s eyes, the Ishmaelites were not worthy people
                              suffering ordinary poverty, but paupers living wanton and debased
                              lives. But why did the pauperism recur, with one generation repeating
                              the sins of its ancestors?</p>

                         <p>McCulloch thought that some of the answer lay in the family&apos;s
                              biological history, and he began more extensive research designed to
                              show that a predisposition towards pauperism was heritable. Beginning

                              environmental influences that surrounded a child. In other words, a
                              window existed in which a good environment might overcome the effects
                              of bad heredity. If a child of paupers passed through her first few
                              years without learning the willful idleness and the unclean lifestyle
                              popularly associated with pauperism, she might grow up without that
                              tendency being activated. However, in the absence of early
                              environmental intervention to counteract the tendency, heredity became
                              an irresistible force.</p>

                         <p> This understanding of the interplay of environment and heredity upon
                              the pauper fit well with McCulloch&apos;s larger synthesis of
                              science and religion. Although he held great hope for human
                              improvement and progress through personal and environmental reform,
                              McCulloch also repeatedly warned in his sermons and diaries that
                              God&apos;s laws were unforgiving to those who violated them. In a
                              diary entry from 1877, for instance, he explained that &quot;death
                              according to nature ought to be at the end of a full life and as
                              painless as birth. That it is not, is due to the disobedience of
                              natural laws.&quot; While such laws existed &quot;for
                              good&quot; and &quot;to bring about a habitable
                              world,&quot; they served the collective good &quot;and did not
                              stop to consider ignorance or weakness. ... They make no mistakes and
                              forgive none.&quot;<hi rend="sup">21</hi></p>

                         <p>His research into the &quot;Tribe of Ishmael&quot; convinced
                              McCulloch that he possessed scientific proof of the looming disaster
                              of hereditary pauperism. The work also made him a star among national
                              charity reformers and arguably the most prominent private citizen in <placeName>

                              </placeName> during the 1880s. McCulloch came to national attention
                              with an address he delivered to the 1880 session of the preeminent
                              national body for social scientists and social reformers, the National
                              Conference of Charities and Correction. There McCulloch used his
                              initial research into the Ishmael tribe as proof that pauperism was a
                              degenerative condition passed from parents to offspring, activated by
                              a poor environment. If a child with a hereditary predisposition to
                              pauperism grew up in a family of paupers, her predisposition would be
                              activated and she would descend into a lazy, mendacious lifestyle. The

                                        statements closely resemble phrenology, popular in <placeName>

                                        </placeName> a generation earlier. McCulloch cited the work
                                        of British phrenologist George Combe in his Tribe of Ishmael
                                        paper, but there is no other evidence to indicate an abiding
                                        interest in the subject. See Hilts, &quot;Obeying the
                                        Laws of Hereditary Descent,&quot; 62-77.</item>

                              escaping the pull of heredity. Hostages to their appetites, paupers
                              would then breed armies of mendicants, who would say or do anything to
                              acquire the charitable relief necessary to avoid working. McCulloch
                              concluded that charitable and public relief must be reformed in order
                              to guarantee that the deceitful paupers were identified and denied
                              relief, and he endorsed the removal of young children from pauper
                              families in order to prevent their predisposition from activating.</p>

                         <p>McCulloch spared no rhetorical expense in arguing for a hereditary basis
                              to pauperism. Citing Ray Lancaster, a British biologist popular among
                              leaders of the scientific charity movement, McCulloch declared that
                              &quot;[t]he law of degeneration is as active as that of
                              gravitation&quot;-and just as universal.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> In
                              a comparison that became famous within the movement, McCulloch
                              announced that the pauper had an analog in the biological kingdom:
                              parasitic crustaceans which &quot;fasten themselves to a hermit
                              crab and live on the juices of his body; their legs drop off, they
                              lose their original form&quot; due to a life of ease. To make sure
                              no one missed the comparison between parasites and paupers, McCulloch
                              pronounced that <quote rend="blockquote">[n]o social student will
                                   question the existence of such a law of degeneration in society,
                                   or has failed to see such degraded forms of life. He sees the
                                   social parasite, the pauper in whom the instinct of self-help has
                                   disappeared. He sees the children, under the same law, becoming
                                   like their parents; and all this he is powerless to help.<hi

                              Ishmaelites to independence had failed because, he claimed,

                              self-dependent.&quot; Like the parasite, their sense of self-help
                              had disappeared, along with &quot;all the organs and powers that

                         <p>The theory of the hereditary pauper had real consequences for how
                              scientific charity reformers approached the problem of poverty. The
                              theory taught that the pauper class was biologically and socially
                              distinct from the ordinary, &quot;worthy&quot; poor, and
                              therefore should not be dealt with in the same way. While the worthy
                              poor might be set back on the path to independence through carefully
                              administered relief, giving charity to a pauper only sustained his
                              biologically ingrained laziness, enabling him to father the next
                              generation of paupers. His depravity necessitated a new type of
                              charitable giving, not motivated by sympathy but based on objective,
                              scientific investigation of the conditions of poverty. Scientific
                              charity aimed to see through the pauper&apos;s dissembling, to
                              identify him and to disqualify him from receiving any charitable
                              relief. It is no overstatement to say that the crux of charitable
                              reform in the Gilded Age rested on efforts to distinguish the common,
                              worthy poor from the duplicitous and degenerate paupers.</p>

                         <p>From 1877 through the early 1890s, scientific charity reformers
                              established Charity Organization Societies in over one hundred
                              American cities in the hope of distinguishing cases of real need from
                              cases of pauperism by carefully investigating every request for
                              charitable assistance. Leaders envisioned a COS in each city acting as
                              an administrative hub that collected information from every charitable
                              and public institution on all persons who had requested relief. The
                              COS would send out its volunteer investigators, known as
                              &quot;friendly visitors,&quot; to inspect the merit of an
                              applicant&apos;s request for relief, collect data on the
                              &quot;true causes&quot; of the person&apos;s poverty, and
                              act as a moral exemplar to train the poor in proper middle-class
                              virtues. If the visitor deemed the applicant <list type="footnotes">

                              the COS notified the appropriate cooperating charity of what relief
                              should be given. If the applicant was deemed an unworthy pauper, the
                              COS asked all cooperating charities to refrain from assisting. The COS
                              kept a file on every applicant, so as to keep track of case histories,
                              to chart progress or signs of pauperism, and to prevent duplicate
                              giving amongst charities. The COS aimed to end all public welfare and
                              all indiscriminately given private relief and to make a willingness to
                              work the first condition for receiving any charity.</p>

                         <p>While COS leaders framed their work as a return to the individual
                              connection between private giver and recipient, in practice their work
                              was more novel than traditional. They sought close working ties with
                              civic leaders, business executives, and government officials, and
                              sometimes they appropriated functions of local government and
                              business. Societies in <placeName>

                              working poor and won the right to remove children from families
                              declared to be habitual paupers, all the while claiming that their
                              investigations would reveal scientific laws governing pauperism.</p>

                              comprehensive, and nationally most significant of all the societies.
                              In 1878, the governing board of the Indianapolis Benevolent Society
                              narrowly avoided disbanding when its members voted McCulloch their new
                              president. By the end of 1879, McCulloch concluded that IBS officials
                              could not manage the tasks of registering and investigating relief
                              applicants while simultaneously distributing relief to the worthy
                              poor, and he took steps to establish a charity society that would
                              shoulder those responsibilities. With support from Mayor John Caven,
                              IBS member Benjamin Harrison, future <placeName>

                              attached to distinguishing the biologically hopeless and morally lax
                              pauper from the noble and potentially redeemable poor. Their demand
                              that no aid be given to anyone suspected of being a pauper did little
                              to rebut their tight-handed reputation. McCulloch declared in the
                              society&apos;s first public statement: <quote rend="blockquote"
                                   >The prevention of pauperism is as important as the relief of
                                   poverty. While the poor we will always have with us, it is our
                                   fault and our disgrace if we have the pauper. ... He hangs upon
                                   the city, sucking thence his sustenance and giving nothing back.
                                   .. He propagates children who are after his kind, recruiting
                                   armies of vice. . . . It is folly to dole out charity, year after
                                   year, without making an effort to cut off the source of this
                                   deep, black river of pauperism. The first thing necessary in the
                                   administration of charity is to know who are the poor and who are
                                   the paupers.<hi rend="sup">28</hi></quote> The statement clearly
                              indicates that at this time, McCulloch believed that pauperism was so
                              strongly rooted in a person&apos;s biology that it could not be
                              cured, once activated. Charity should instead concentrate on
                              prevention: preventing the pauper from receiving charity and
                              preventing him either from having children or from raising his
                              existing offspring.</p>

                         <p>Prevention, in turn, meant investigation, and the COS quickly developed
                              arrangements with most of the city&apos;s existing charities to
                              scrutinize the moral, social, and economic circumstances of every poor
                              person who requested relief. The COS sent out its volunteer
                              &quot;friendly visitors&quot; to meet with the applicants, to
                              ascertain their situation, to offer advice on matters of good
                              childraising, housekeeping and thrift, and to inform the COS of
                              whether the applicants should be approved for relief from the relevant
                              cooperating charity.</p>

                              spanning November 1, 1883, to October 31, 1884, for instance, the COS
                              received 1,070 applications for aid concerning 3,579 family members.
                              In every case COS committee members determined the
                              &quot;condition&quot; and social status of the applicant, and

                              &quot;Condition&quot; was defined in three categories denoting

                         <p>The COS further divided these three categories to identify different
                              causes of poverty. For instance, &quot;worthy of relief&quot;
                              included four subcategories of those beset by circumstances beyond
                              their control: orphans with no living parents or one parent unable to
                              support, the aged, the incurable (presumably referring to a
                              permanently disabling condition), and those incapacitated by temporary
                              illness or accident. In the 1883 - 1884 report, the 379 cases worthy
                              of relief included only 1 case listed as an orphan and 6 as incurable.
                              Of the remaining 372 cases, 50 were aged and 322 had temporarily
                              fallen ill or experienced an accident. As the unknown author of the
                              report put it, &quot;Such belong to the poor whom it is a

                         <p>When charity reformers divided applicants into distinct categories of
                              worthy poor and unworthy paupers, they passed not only a moral
                              judgment but a biological one as well - the unworthy were biological
                              degenerates. The scientific charity movement&apos;s interpretation
                              of pauperism, however, granted the significance of environmental
                              factors in the onset or prevention of this biological predisposition.
                              It therefore allowed more potential than commonly appreciated for
                              divergent interpretations about the true role of heredity in
                              poverty.</p>

                         <p>Over the 1880s McCulloch began to rethink the relative influence of
                              biology in creating paupers, and thereby also reconsidered what it
                              meant to be unworthy. This rethinking of biology, morality, and
                              poverty came about as a facet of a larger political awakening that
                              McCulloch underwent in 1885 and 1886. By the end of 1886, his interest
                              was moving away from biological pauperism and gravitating towards the
                              environmental factors that brought about chronic and intergenerational
                              poverty. McCulloch&apos;s thinking evolved to the point where he
                              abandoned his concern for the pauper almost entirely, focusing instead
                              on systemic economic and social causes of poverty that required
                              systematic, progressive reform, but that held promise for permanently
                              ending all poverty. Pauperism became, for McCulloch, a remedial
                              condition, a misdiagnosis of poverty that was due not to bad biology,
                              but to larger social and economic factors. While this redefinition of
                              pauperism never became a mainstream position in American thought, it
                              did signal the beginning of the end of the &quot;pauper&quot;
                              as a distinct moral and biological category used by charity reformers
                              and students of the poverty problem. McCulloch became the first
                              prominent member of the scientific charity movement to adopt this
                              view; he would not be the last. By the early 1900s the scientific
                              charity movement had recast its work away from detecting and punishing
                              paupers, in favor of providing adequate relief to the poor.</p>

                              inequality, and the lack of assimilation of immigrant labor. As Weeks
                              notes, &quot;this viewpoint toward the laboring classes . . .
                              changed radically as he studied laboring conditions and the relation

                              </placeName> ministers the following Sunday, however, described the
                              parade as an inexcusable desecration of the Sabbath and a violation of
                              the rights of others to worship undisturbed. Such controversies over
                              observance of the Sabbath were not unusual, and the Rev. J. Albert
                              Rondthaler of the Tabernacle Presbyterian Church proclaimed that all
                              Christians &quot;must keenly feel the disgrace put upon the
                              city.&quot; The Revs. James McLeod, R. V. Hunter, and E. A.
                              Bradley likewise weighed in with a condemnation - Bradley
                              unequivocally and McLeod with moderation.<hi rend="sup">39</hi></p>

                         <p>McCulloch addressed the condemnations in his next sermon. In defense of
                              the parade, he reminded his listeners that the Knights had aimed to
                              hold the festivities on a Monday but could not secure the grounds.
                              Since the factories would not accommodate any other day, Sunday
                              remained as the only possible choice. Furthermore, the parade had been
                              scheduled to conclude before church services began, but rain pushed
                              back the starting time. McCulloch then defended both the
                              workers&apos; overall conduct and their theological right to hold
                              the event on a Sunday.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> His words inspired the
                              Central Labor Union to offer him a formal vote of thanks and to attend
                              his October 10 sermon as a body. The <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi>
                              remarked that &quot;the workingmen owe it to themselves and to the
                              cause of labor to sustain Mr. McCulloch in his work, as the advocacy
                              of humanity&apos;s cause is sure to gain for him the ill-will of
                              other ministers.&quot;<hi rend="sup">41</hi> Indeed, McCulloch
                              received much criticism for his defense of the Knights&apos;

                              of attendant controversy, lay ahead when McCulloch weighed in on the

                              strikebreakers, killing four. The next day, a peaceful, city -
                              authorized gathering turned into a calamity when, as a riot squad
                              began forcefully dispersing the crowd, someone threw a bomb into the
                              scrum. The explosion killed a policeman, and police responded by
                              firing into the crowd, injuring at least one hundred spectators and
                              some of their fellow officers. Six more policemen, and an uncounted
                              number of civilians, died in the aftermath. Newspapers reported that
                              foreign anarchists were responsible for the bombing.</p>

                         <p> The percussive force of the bomb, slight even by the standards of the
                              1880s, deeply shook many Americans, including McCulloch. Three days
                              later, he wrote in his diary that &quot;the one thought on my mind
                              is the Labor Trouble. I wish that I could speak on that and nothing
                              else. When I read of the anarchists in <placeName>

                              </placeName> I said &apos;They know not what they do.&apos;
                              The law and order of society must be preserved, but they have suffered
                              much.&quot; While most Americans demanded swift justice, McCulloch
                              speculated about the possible biographies of the alleged
                              bomb-throwers. &quot;What was their history, first at
                              home?&quot; he asked, and &quot;What had they
                              suffered?&quot; McCulloch wrote that the immigrants likely came to <placeName>
                                   <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                              </placeName> with the feeling of hope and &quot;with the idea of
                              liberty.&quot; Imagining how they must have felt upon waking up to
                              their impoverished situation, McCulloch empathized, calling the
                              immigrant radicals &quot;frankensteins of modern
                                   society.&quot;<hi rend="sup">42</hi></p>

                         <p>Considering the &quot;hang-them-all&quot; mentality that

                              </placeName>, McCulloch wisely kept his thoughts to himself for six
                              months. Not until his post-Thanksgiving Sunday sermon did he speak
                              out, arguing that the death sentences recently given the anarchists
                              were unjust and that they deserved a new trial.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>

                              which to utter unmitigated hogwash.&quot; He described
                              McCulloch&apos;s quotation of Jesus&apos;s words on the cross
                              as &quot;a gratuitous insult to common intelligence&quot; and
                              argued that rationalizing the bombing was &quot;to talk

                                        While McCulloch rarely addressed matters of race in his

                                        he considered the plight of African Americans and
                                        immigrants, with similar conclusions. In a tantalizingly
                                        brief diary entry, he wondered of African Americans,

                              The criticisms seem to have hurt McCulloch&apos;s position in the
                              community. In a diary entry from early December, he wrote that
                              &quot;it was reported that my church was broken up.&quot;<hi

                              of illness, kept McCulloch from engaging in such heated public

                         <p> By 1886 McCulloch had honed a social critique of the labor question and
                              its relationship to poverty. As his interest in these issues grew over
                              the next six years, McCulloch reevaluated his understanding of
                              scientific charity and pauperism. Foreshadowing the national
                              scientific charity movement&apos;s transformation at the start of
                              the twentieth century, McCulloch came to argue that the people he had
                              once identified as being biologically degenerate and irredeemable
                              paupers were, in fact, treatable like the ordinary, worthy poor. Like
                              the labor unionists and immigrants who turned to social disruption and
                              even violence, the pauper&apos;s woeful condition was also a
                              symptom of greater social problems that could be alleviated or even
                              abolished through concerted social reform. While no part of this
                              revised interpretation threatened the paternalistic assumption that
                              the middle class knew best how to aid those in need, it did suggest
                              different means for reaching that goal. For instance, in a committee
                              report to the NCCC&apos;s 1889 session, McCulloch presented a
                              paper that summarized a decade of progress and restated &quot;the
                              principles which underlie . . . scientific charity.&quot; In 1880,
                              McCulloch had emphasized the work of detecting paupers, elevating the
                              morality of the poor, and restricting charitable relief. Now, however,
                              he also called for &quot;the reform of abuses in existing laws,
                              the securing of justice, and the modification of conditions which make
                              for poverty and crime.&quot;<hi rend="sup">47</hi> A broader
                              understanding of how and why charity groups operated also led

                              term, at the centerpiece of the scientific charity movement from its
                              inception and indeed of the very term &quot;Charity Organization
                              Society,&quot; had referred to the coordination of relief between
                              previously distinct private charities. Scientific charity leaders, led
                              by McCulloch, now began to think of organization more broadly, so that
                              it also included the activity of both private and public institutions
                              toward improving social conditions. The Indiana Board of State

                              </placeName>, the turn away from identifying and suppressing pauperism
                              in favor of concerted social reform can be seen in the course
                              McCulloch charted for the COS, and in his sermons. Among its
                              charitable projects, the Indianapolis COS sponsored a savings and
                              loan, designed to provide new social services to the poor. Established
                              in March 1887 at McCulloch&apos;s behest, the Indianapolis Dime
                              Savings and Loan Society represented one of the COS&apos;s earlier
                              side-projects. According to a flier announcing the society&apos;s
                              first meeting, &quot;much of the suffering of the poor is due to a
                              lack of habit of saving small amounts, and to a lack of opportunity
                              for laying by small amounts weekly.&quot;<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
                              Contributing to that lack of opportunity, said the flier, the
                              city&apos;s deficit of savings institutions gave small wage
                              earners no opportunity to learn the habits and virtue of thriftiness,
                              while high fuel prices ate into what little income they did
                              possess.</p>

                         <p>The Indianapolis COS intended for its savings and loan to function more
                              as a community resource for the poor than as a normal bank. To help
                              inculcate the habit of thriftiness, the society sold $25 shares, to be
                              bought incrementally through small dues. Collectors inspired, or
                              perhaps enforced, the saving habit by calling on members at their
                              homes for their ten-cent dues each week of summer, &quot;when work
                              is more plentiful,&quot; and permitting withdrawals only during
                              the winter. By one measure at least, these visitations eventually
                              eclipsed the number of visitations conducted each year by the COS. The

                              proper objectives of the scientific charity movement were accompanied
                              by a new analysis of the relationship between biology, religion, and
                              poverty. The <hi rend="i">Open Door Sermons</hi>, a collection of
                              Sunday sermons from 1890 and 1891, the last two years of his life,
                              contain several theological commentaries on the place of poverty in
                              the modern world. Many of these commentaries emphasize his belief in
                              the potential for all to be forgiven and saved, for poverty itself to
                              be abolished through concerted action, and for the moral necessity of
                              charity projects. In the sermon &quot;Abundant Life,&quot; for
                              instance, McCulloch expresses a new understanding of the plight of <placeName>

                              actual want that a week out of work, or a month&apos;s sickness,
                              brings hunger and cold, or debt.&quot; He also evinces a new
                              optimism, going on to say that &quot;to all these a fuller,
                              happier life is possible. Nature is kind.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                                   >51</hi> The use of the word &quot;all&quot; and the
                              omission of any distinctions between poverty and pauperism are
                              noticeable. Now, when McCulloch looks at the poor he can see that
                              &quot;[1]ying dormant in these souls are capacities for art,
                              music, intelligence, skill, success.&quot; The same point is
                              expressed most explicitly in &quot;The Ideal in Man,&quot;
                              where McCulloch argues that an &quot;Ideal Human&quot; exists
                              in all souls. He cites an experiment by a <placeName>

                              whom McCulloch once would have classed as an irredeemable pauper, is
                              now described as having &quot;a new seriousness ... in his face
                              and a new light in his eyes, like the recovery of one who is lost and
                              regained.&quot; &quot;Here is a man,&quot; McCulloch told
                              his parishioners, &quot;who says he will try to live a better
                              life. I myself think the experiment would be a hopeful

                              such individuals were unworthy, degenerate paupers. Since the worthy
                              poor would not dissipate their body or savings with drink, drunkenness
                              must be a sign of the moral and biological failings of a pauper. In
                              his sermon &quot;The Mission of the Son of Man,&quot; however,
                              McCulloch turns that analysis on its ear, arguing that &quot;the
                              causes of intemperance are other than the individual will,&quot;
                              and that &quot;the greatest cause of intemperance is poverty,
                              absolute misery of life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">53</hi> His change in
                              perspective led him to see traits like chronic poverty and
                              intemperance as consequences of broader social failings, and, based on
                              that assumption, to gain a new understanding of charity. In
                              &quot;The Discontent of the Fortunate&quot; he explains that
                              charity is changing: &quot;It used to be pity. It is not pity now.
                              It is the equalization of opportunity. The new religion takes the
                              social as well as the individual into its life.&quot;<hi

                         <p>In these late sermons, we see McCulloch describing all poor people as
                              worthy and capable of redemption, given the proper social
                              organization. But what of the biological determinism by which he had
                              defined the pauper class? In his sermon &quot;The Law of Mutual
                              Aid,&quot; McCulloch rejects the scientific premises of his
                              &quot;Tribe of Ishmael&quot; work in favor of a new
                              interpretation of biology. Here he seeks to harmonize Jesus&apos;s

                              also vindicated his changing analysis of scientific charity and
                              poverty. On May 18, 1891, a gravely ill McCulloch penned his final and
                              definitive statement on scientific charity and poverty, &quot;The
                              True Spirit of Charity Organization.&quot; The moving prose
                              revealed an almost complete abandonment of his earlier positions
                              regarding biology and pauperism. The man who had compared paupers to
                              parasites and envisioned &quot;armies of vice&quot; now wrote:
                                   <quote rend="blockquote">I see no terrible army of pauperism, but
                                   a sorrowful crowd of men, women and children. I propose to speak
                                   of the spirit of charity organization. It is not a war against
                                   anybody. It is not an attack against any armed battalions. It is
                                   the spirit of love entering this world with the eye of pity and
                                   the voice of hope. It sees in men and women, despairing,
                                   disfigured as they may be ... simple fragments of humanity. They
                                   show the incompleteness of men, the partial losses of life. It
                                   is, then, simply a question of organization, of the best method
                                   for the restoration of every one. ... Therefore, I say, we look
                                   upon men, women and children, whom we call paupers, or now
                                   distinguish into paupers and poor, pitifully, but hopefully; for
                                   not one but may be brought back by persistent effort.<hi

                         <p>Two things make this statement extraordinary. First, McCulloch rejected
                              his earlier biological pessimism, which had led him to believe that
                              paupers could not be rehabilitated other than by saving them as small
                              children before a debased environment activated their hereditary
                              predisposition. Second, in changing his assessment of pauperism, he
                              implicitly rejected the biological and social distinctions between the
                              potential pauper, actual pauper, common poor person, and

                              nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American commentary treated
                              the poor as essentially different from nor- mal persons, and paupers
                              as distinct from the poor, McCulloch suggested that the pauper, though
                              presently abnormal, was potentially normal. In doing so, he became one
                              of the first scientific charity advocates to bring all of the poor
                              population within the parameters of normalcy.</p>

                         <p>McCulloch marked the pinnacle of a lifetime&apos;s involvement in
                              social reform and science by presiding over the 1891 meeting of the
                              National Conference of Charities and Correction, held that May inside
                              of Plymouth Church. There he proposed a national scientific survey of
                              philanthropy patterned after the recent geodetic survey, and a
                              national register of dependent, defective, and delinquent persons.<hi
                                   rend="sup">62</hi> The proposal capped his progression towards
                              treating poverty not as an individual&apos;s failure, but as a
                              social problem that required the proper organization of charitable
                              resources and concerted national effort.</p>

                         <p>He died half a year later. McCulloch had long suffered headaches,
                              fatigue, and ill health, when in January 1890 he noticed a tumor in
                              his groin. McCulloch wrote that he wanted to take a year off, but
                              could not find the time. Instead, he and his wife Alice led a
                              three-month tour of European cities for the Plymouth Church Travel
                              Club. While in <placeName>

                              arriving on September 25. He preached once, but was too ill to deliver
                              the funeral address for an old friend two days later. Doctors
                              recommended surgery, but he and his wife declined. In late October his
                              doctor diagnosed McCulloch as suffering from nervous exhaustion. With
                              wrenching detail, Alice chronicled his deterioration in his diary, and
                              at 5:50 in the morning on December 10, McCulloch died at age
                              forty-eight. The doctor diagnosed the illness as &quot;localized

                         <p> Ironically, Oscar McCulloch&apos;s work ultimately enjoyed far more
                              lasting influence nationally than it did in <placeName>

                              the Indianapolis COS wrote, with great understatement, that
                              &quot;in respect to some of the underlying principles of social

                         <p>McCulloch had authored some of the foundational documents that
                              characterized the national scientific charity movement&apos;s
                              pessimistic and restrictive interpretation of pauperism in the early
                              1880s, but he died before he could see his progressive
                              reinterpretation take hold at the turn of the century. Few historians
                              have called attention to the pragmatic flexibility found in the
                              scientific charity movement even in its early, more dogmatic years, or
                              the fluidity and complexity that characterized the
                              leadership&apos;s thinking in later years. The most influential
                              leaders of the national movement at the end of the 1890s, especially
                              Edward Devine at the New York City COS and Columbia University, and
                              Josephine Shaw Lowell of the New York City COS and many other reform
                              movements, came to concur with McCulloch that they could find no

                              the first decade of the twentieth century, scientific charity leaders
                              regularly expressed their disbelief in a distinct pauper class, even
                              as they continued to accept the reality of criminal and feeble-minded
                                   classes.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> In the minds of the leaders of
                              American poverty reform, pauperism was no more. The term itself
                              quickly disappeared from their discourse, as Chart 1 indicates.</p>

                         <p>While I do not want to overstate McCulloch&apos;s influence on any
                              particular individual at the national level, his &quot;Tribe of
                              Ishmael&quot; work had been a cornerstone on which rested the
                              beliefs that paupers could and must be distinguished from the common
                              poor, and that charitable relief must be strictly monitored and, when
                              necessary, severely restricted. As national leaders came to identify
                              other, subtler causes of chronic poverty beyond the temptation of
                              easily available charity, they, like McCulloch, moved to emphasize
                              economic and social reform over repression, and loosened their
                              prohibitions against giving charitable relief. One of the most notable
                              outcomes of this new view of poverty was that the chronic poor escaped
                              the worst of the eugenic sterilization movement of the twentieth
                              century. McCulloch&apos;s work illustrates how interpretations of
                              scientific, political, and religious doctrines interacted to shape and
                              reshape reformers&apos; approaches towards treating the poor. As a
                              prominent national figure in scientific charity, he signaled the <list

                    <p>It was coincidence that had brought about this key shift in the well-known
                         minister&apos;s attitude: According to McCulloch, his pastoral visits
                         to the poor had acquainted him with the members of one family whose dire
                         poverty so disturbed him that he sought to secure them emergency aid at the 
                              Center Township&apos;s
                          Trustee&apos;s office. There he learned, instead, of the
                         family&apos;s - and their friends&apos; and relatives&apos; -
                         long history of relief applications. At about the same time, he read a book
                         about &quot;the Jukes,&quot; a <placeName>

                         </placeName>. The book&apos;s author, Richard L. Dugdale, a researcher
                         interested in the causes of poverty and crime, had become curious about the
                         frequency of family ties among inmates he encountered while inspecting
                         county jails for the New York Prison Association. Although
                         Dugdale&apos;s study of criminality among the Jukes (the fictitious
                         surname by which he identified the clan) conceded that environmental
                         factors were as influential as hereditary causes in &quot;giving
                         cumulative force to a career of debauch,&quot; McCulloch concluded that
                         charitable aid targeted only at alleviating deficits such as hunger and
                         homelessness encouraged the proliferation of degenerate families such as

                         began to argue for compulsory social controls designed to prevent the

                         Children&apos;s Guardians. The collaboration he created between public
                         and private charities infused the former - which gave relief without regard
                         to an applicant&apos;s character-with the latter&apos;s strategy of

                         be making poverty their profession. Notes from interviews conducted and
                         other public records gathered by these visitors of the poor were ultimately
                         collected in McCulloch&apos;s family study, which was intended to
                         provide evidence of &quot;a constellation of degenerate
                         behaviors-including alcoholism, pauperism, social dependency,

                         <p>Because most Hoosiers opposed taxation to support public services such
                              as education and health care, newly arrived immigrants were largely
                              unschooled and their infant mortality rate was high. Those who could
                              not afford the cost of a marriage license, or were prohibited from
                              marrying by anti-miscegenation law, or had been prohibited from
                              marriage while indentured, simply cohabited - behavior considered to
                              be evidence of moral degeneracy.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Propertyless
                              laborers tended to vote for working-class politicians who championed
                              individual freedoms, further alienating middle- and upper-class social
                              reformers and their candidates in both political parties, all of whom
                              advocated increased governmental regulation of personal behavior. Many
                              immigrants also provoked the state&apos;s native-born middle-class
                              citizenry by ignoring temperance and sabbath laws.<hi rend="sup"
                                   >18</hi> Economist G. A. Kleene later observed that those who
                              sought and accepted charity assistance &quot;became abnormal,
                              pitied, perhaps, but socially outcast. A despised beggar class began
                              to form, with traditions and methods of its own. Poor relief became a
                              problem ... an affair between strangers . . . with all the distrust
                              and deception growing out of this relation.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>As McCulloch and other charity reformers looked for a new, more
                              scientific way of understanding and implementing their work, they
                              found inspiration in Charles Darwin&apos;s theory of natural
                              selection and in Sir Francis Galton&apos;s 1865
                              &quot;Hereditary Talent and Character.&quot;
                              McCulloch&apos;s writing shows the impact of this new knowledge
                              upon the traditional, widely held belief that God determined
                              individual human traits. &quot;The science of racial integrity and
                                   progress&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi>gave church and other

                              reproductive choices to heredity. Although some people embraced the
                              idea of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as a reason to
                              encourage high-achieving members of society to have many children,
                              others, equally worried about &quot;survival of the

                                   large, raw-boned class, coarse, rough in their manners and ways
                                   of life, and primitive in their eating. All was fish which came
                                   to their net. They lived in the hills, and hunting was the chief
                                   occupation. . . . That the family was of a low and thievish bent
                                   is a natural conclusion, and such was the case. ... It was an
                                   ignorant family. There was no pretense of education among them.
                                   They were classed separately, and their associates were few
                                   except such as they found among the outlaws of the hills and the
                                   indians. Their features have always been the same in general
                                   outline. Narrow, retreating foreheads, eyes which &quot;look
                                   like the eyes of a pig&quot; .... When on the road they are
                                   free and easy, full of a sort of glee and happiness which is not
                                   easy to describe unless one can appreciate the lawless feeling
                                   which they have when they find themselves travelling so
                                   constantly that officers of the law have no terrors for them. . .
                                   . The Ishmaels never seem to try to accumulate property to any

                                        Dr. Wishard graduated from Indiana Medical College in 1874.
                                        He became the city hospital&apos;s eighth superintendent
                                        in 1879, at the time McCulloch began his Ishmael study and

                                        eventually renamed, was thus helpful to Estabrook in

                              &quot;She did not take kindly to a civilized life,&quot;

                         <p>The Indiana Notes blamed dependence on charitable aid, rather than
                              poverty itself, for these environmental conditions.
                              &quot;Misapplied charity is a millstone about the necks of those
                              to whom it is given, and (not entirely their fault either) drags them
                              down from a low level to one yet lower, -frequently to the lowest
                              possible level. ... A diet of pauper bread breaks down the best of
                              poor families, and the greatest unkindness to the poor is to encourage
                              them to ask and accept charity - something for nothing.&quot;<hi

                              as the other members of [his] family who went into the army was nearly
                              ruined by it; for there they were cared for by the Government, and
                              thus they had no care upon their minds .... The drudgery of army life,
                              and the monotony of the camps, as well as the excitement of the actual
                              clash of arms, was suited to their natures; but the monotony of civil
                              life, coupled with the necessity of planning and thinking ahead . . .
                              was too great a task for such sluggish intellects, and so, on their
                              return from the war where they made good soldiers, they came back to
                              civil life where they certainly were not good citizens.&quot;<hi

                              was &quot;very ignorant and very happy in his ignorance.&quot;
                              Another, a barber, &quot;is something of a dude. Parts his hair in
                              the middle.&quot; One woman eloped with a fellow dubbed
                              &quot;an equally precious scamp.&quot; Comments were just as
                              likely to be scathing in their insensitivity: One man &quot;was
                              one of the most beastly and degraded of characters, and there was
                              probably nothing too vile for him to do that could be
                              suggested.&quot; Another was an &quot;idle river
                              rat.&quot; One who lost an arm and a leg in a train accident was
                              &quot;more unindustrious and shiftless than before.&quot;
                              Especially dismissive criticism was reserved for the women; most were
                              generally unchaste, engaged in incest or prostitution, or
                              &quot;specifically diseased,&quot; a euphemism for sexually
                              transmitted infection. One was &quot;mentally weak, but this may
                              have been the result of her vicious life or it may have been the cause
                              of her own degradation.&quot; Another was &quot;a rather nice
                              old lady, everything considered.&quot; Yet another &quot;made
                              many gypsy trips and was never happier than when tramping. That she
                              was a prostitute goes without saying.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>Such remarks typify the Indiana Notes, which lace benign facts with
                              innuendo, add insults to the injuries of poverty, and condemn morals
                              when there is no other information available. Estabrook&apos;s ERO
                              Notes delete some slurs but otherwise rely on vague attributions:
                              &quot;he was spoken of as,&quot; &quot;she was reputed to
                              have been,&quot; &quot;they were considered to be.&quot;
                              The note takers&apos; generalized conclusions demonstrate the lack
                              of scientific method in their records. &quot;Assuming, as is the
                              rule in these pages when nothing is known to the contrary, that the
                              family was in no wise objectionable, the only explanation for the
                              entrance of this man in this book is upon the Emersonian theory that
                              sometimes all the virus of a family is drawn off in one
                              vial,&quot; say the Indiana Notes. &quot;It has never been
                              charged that she was a prostitute but it was a life she knew all
                              about, as most of her associates were of the vilest possible
                              character.&quot; One woman is described as having been seen by
                              others cutting rings off the hands of victims killed in an explosion.
                              Of one family member &quot;there is nothing known ... except that
                              he was a very worthless man with some bad habits, lazy, and some
                              vicious tendencies.&quot; Another woman &quot;is lazy, dirty,
                              and untruthful, and I have never doubted but she was unchaste after
                              her marriage.&quot;<hi rend="sup">74</hi></p>

                         <p>Any sex outside of legally sanctioned marriage was regarded as immoral
                              and criminal in that era. Yet while &quot;one of the strange
                              things in the history of the Ishmaels is that separations and divorces
                              were not so common as would be expected among such people,&quot;
                              the families were also said to &quot;monopolize the divorce
                              courts,&quot; where cases were seldom concluded because of the
                              petitioners&apos; inability to pay for the proceedings and
                              lawyers. Nevertheless, the &quot;laws governing marriage and
                              divorce ... are too lax ... [and] should be tightened,&quot; Frank
                              Wright wrote in his essay that appears in the ERO Notes.
                              &quot;This stratum of society seems to thrive by neglect, and
                              cannot be crushed out by the laws which we have. Heroic treatment is

                              while Estabrook acknowledged that the Ishmael families were largely
                              dispersed or assimilated by 1920, he nevertheless asserted that they
                              were &quot;still as dangerous to society from the eugenic
                              standpoint,&quot; so long as the feebleminded among them continued
                              to reproduce with others of the same mental ability. These
                              feebleminded individuals, he wrote, could be easily recognized by
                              their un- or underemployment; low income; history of
                              institutionalization; history of application for relief; lack of
                              training or education; below average mentality; and laziness,
                              shiftlessness, improvidence, and lack of ambition. Estabrook believed
                              that preventing procreation by such persons would eliminate many
                              social ills, including the problem of poverty itself.<hi rend="sup"

                              several days duration. The features of the campmeeting included
                              emotional displays of religious fervor, extemporaneous preaching
                              directed toward conversion and spiritual renovation, and spirited

                              the marriage). There Eli was born in 1794, the second of six
                              children.</p>
                         <p>Eli&apos;s early life reads like an adventure novel. As a boy, he
                              narrowly escaped death in an accident caused by runaway oxen. His
                              parents&apos; home was burned twice by Indians. When his father
                              lost his property to a swindler, the despondent man turned to whiskey,
                              and with the whiskey came fighting. Eli and his brother and his mother
                              kept the family going through times of poverty. The family moved
                              frequently, always looking for a better opportunity, and eventually
                              returned to <placeName>

                              father.</p>
                         <p>At age 18, Eli attended his first school and learned to read and write.
                              In one account, Farmer led a student rebellion when the teacher
                              proposed not to give the class a &quot;treat&quot; (time off)
                              for &quot;the holiday.&quot; The teacher was physically
                              overpowered and tied to a bench until he capitulated.
                              Farmer&apos;s first contact with religion came at the age of 19,
                              when he attended a campmeeting in <placeName>

                              taken by his conversion as Eli was. His parents refused his offer to
                              hold &quot;family prayers.&quot; Apparently there was no
                              Methodist class in the community, and with his new-found faith
                              faltering, Eli heard of another campmeeting and traveled to <placeName>

                              </placeName> to be a part of it. His faith was revived by the
                              preaching, and he committed himself to helping others (&quot;I
                              worked almost constantly at the altar&quot;).<hi rend="sup"
                                   >14</hi> Like many of the early meetings, the gathering was
                              marked by emotional excess. Farmer recalled having to restrain one man
                              who was shedding his clothes because he was on his way to heaven and
                              the Bible taught, &quot;take nothing for your journey.&quot;
                              The year was 1813.</p>
                         <p>Eli&apos;s conversion was short-lived. Without religious
                              encouragement, he slipped into his old ways and found himself in a
                              &quot;backslidden condition.&quot; The terminology is
                              significant. Presbyterians and Baptists did not
                              &quot;backslide.&quot; As Calvinists they believed they were
                              chosen as the elect and were therefore secure in their salvation.
                              Methodists, with their understanding of &quot;free grace&quot;
                              (free will), were free not only to receive salvation but also to lose
                              it. For the next seven years, Eli moved from one job to another. He
                              entered the army in 1814 but encountered no British soldiers, and he
                              spent much of his time participating in pranks and fighting among
                              fellow soldiers. His time of service ended just as his regiment was

                         <p>Few of the people who entered Farmer&apos;s life at that time were
                              &quot;religious.&quot; The men were Indian fighters,
                              hard-drinkers, and frequently physically violent. Farmer joined in
                              some of their activities, but even as a backslider, he did not swear
                              or drink whiskey. He did, however, frequently resort to trickery,

                                        adaptations were working their way into Methodist (and
                                        evangelical) practice and theology. Within months, perhaps
                                        weeks, after <geogName key="tgn_2218757" reg="Cane Ridge"

                                        &quot;altar,&quot; and the theology which
                                        accompanied it, had been introduced into revival culture.
                                        Methodist &quot;altar&quot; preaching redirected the
                                        theological emphasis of worship from the act of God to the
                                        response of the individual. Preaching was directed toward
                                        decision-making and the altar became the place where
                                        decisions were made. In practice, the
                                        &quot;altar&quot; could be a railing, a bench, a
                                        stump, or even a spot in the grass. The altar call was an
                                        appeal for persons to come forward to the designated area
                                        and offer themselves to God. The altar experience was the
                                        great equalizer: social, racial, gender, economic
                                        distinctions held no significance. As campmeetings became
                                        more organized, the altar service became a special service
                                        within the larger meeting. The whole area around the altar
                                        became a space where penitents were prayed for and
                                        encouraged until they experienced salvation.</item>

                              dissatisfied with his life and convicted of his sinful condition. When
                              the boat arrived at <placeName>

                              </placeName>, Farmer determined to look up the famous Methodist
                              preacher Henry B. Bascom. On Saturday he bought cloth and sewed
                              himself a pair of &quot;pantaloons&quot;; on Sunday morning he
                              attended Bascom&apos;s church, but it was a disillusioning
                              experience. The preacher was wearing the &quot;most fashionable
                              apparel,&quot; the &quot;violation of what,&quot;
                              according to Farmer, &quot;I then esteemed the proprieties and

                              Disappointed with the Methodists but still seeking spiritual
                              fulfillment, Farmer sought out the Baptists, and traveled for ten days
                              with a Baptist preacher, but he was unconvinced by Calvinist
                              doctrine.</p>
                         <p>In despair, Farmer then sought out another Methodist campmeeting, this

                              women with whom he shared his &quot;aching void&quot; and his
                              predilection to sin, especially fighting. One of the women exhorted
                              him to go directly to the altar to be prayed for. Farmer went but
                              initially felt uncomfortable because of &quot;strange scenes and
                              motley throngs&quot; (probably a reference to emotional excess).
                              Finding no peace, he began to weep, sure that he was going to hell.
                              Then he considered that perhaps God wanted him to go to hell to preach
                              to sinners, and he responded that he was willing to do so. With that
                              he broke into uncontrollable laughter,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> and peace
                              came. Farmer spent a sleepless night &quot;holding sweet communion

                              meant conversions, or &quot;souls.&quot; The passion for souls
                              must be understood as a crucial motivating factor in the dynamics of
                              early Methodism. This desire for souls also helps to explain
                              Methodism&apos;s egalitarian nature: because Christ had died for
                              all, believers should make no distinction between rich and poor, black
                              and white, male and female. At the first uniting conference of
                              Methodism in 1784, preachers were charged as follows: <quote

                         <p>Farmer &quot;took a very active part at the altar in laboring with
                              the mourners&quot; the next day. Preaching to a young couple whom
                              he considered to be as wicked as anyone in his acquaintance, Farmer
                              bargained with God that &quot;[i]f He would convert these people,
                              I would take such conversions as an indication that was my duty to
                              preach the gospel.&quot; They were converted, and Farmer committed
                              to preaching as his calling from that day forward. After the
                              campmeeting, Farmer gave witness to his mother, who &quot;came out
                              brightly on the Lord&apos;s side,&quot; and then to his
                              family&apos;s neighbors, most of whom were Baptist and considered
                              the new preacher &quot;entirely too enthusiastic.&quot;<hi

                              calling, Farmer became disturbed and refused the license. The decision
                              provoked inner conflict, and Farmer began to backslide, evidenced by a
                              fight after a &quot;flash of anger&quot; overcame him. He
                              &quot;whipped&quot; his adversary but was so full of guilt he
                              went before the church and asked for a church trial. He was exonerated
                              but found himself in spiritual darkness.</p>
                         <p>Whenever Eli Farmer experienced a spiritual crisis (which was
                              frequently), he looked for another campmeeting. In a denomination with
                              an emphasis on &quot;experience,&quot; religious life was
                              often a cycle of highs and lows, and there was always a need for
                              revivals. So in 1823 Farmer sought out a meeting near <placeName>

                              </placeName>, determined that if God endowed him with the power he had
                              once known he would officially become a preacher, &quot;even
                              though the attempt would slay me.&quot; Once again, the
                              campmeeting provided the necessary spiritual rejuvenation. Farmer was
                              &quot;reclaimed and the spirit returned to me. I determined to cut
                              loose from the world. I told my wife I had to go into the work
                              now.&quot; But Matilda, who had always encouraged him, now
                              suddenly asked him to delay. A few weeks later she became ill and
                              died.</p>
                         <p>After his wife&apos;s death, Farmer began to preach in <placeName>

                              Methodism had, in theory and in practice, a form of church government,
                              with bishops presiding over large geographical areas that were
                              subdivided, in turn, into the care of elders, deacons, preachers, and
                              exhorters. But on the frontier, individual preachers and exhorters
                              often experienced considerable freedom in initiating, adapting, and
                              improvising the rules. Preachers created and sometimes abandoned
                              circuits. They scheduled campmeetings and revivals on the basis of
                              inspiration. A revival that was going well might be extended,
                              sometimes for several weeks, with the circuit schedule adjusted
                              accordingly.</p>

                                        Farmer, like other circuit riders, viewed every religious
                                        family gathering, class meeting, and Sunday school gathering

                              annual conference was the examination, approval, credentialing, and
                              appointment of ministers. Members of the conference (all ministers and
                              all men at this time) licensed and/or ordained
                              &quot;exhorters,&quot; local pastors, deacons, and elders.

                              be rearranged, circuits could be added or split, and pastors were

                              There were no roads and no landmarks except rivers and homes. Many of
                              the cabins he discovered in the wilderness had not been visited by any
                              other person.<hi rend="sup">30</hi></p>
                         <p>The circuit rider&apos;s mode of operation was simple: he visited
                              homes, inquired after the health of the family, and asked if they
                              would welcome family prayers or even a religious service. Services
                              were often held on the spot with neighbors invited. The next step was
                              to ask if the people would be interested in regular services. If so, a
                              new &quot;preaching point&quot; was added to the circuit.
                              Converts were formed into small groups, and each class was assigned a
                              class leader. Some met in homes; larger groups might move to a school,
                              a barn, or even a tavern. If the classes remained successful, the
                              converts would then organize a church, which would eventually erect a
                              meeting house.</p>

                         <p>Back on the Bloomfield circuit, Farmer continued a pattern he would
                              follow throughout his career as a Methodist preacher: he immediately
                              called for a campmeeting. Despite the work of some of the
                              area&apos;s best preachers, the meeting did not begin well (in
                              Farmer&apos;s words, there was no &quot;stirring of the
                              Spirit&quot;). This time, Farmer looked into the audience for the
                              solution, calling on the &quot;old sisters&quot; who could
                              pray to &quot;come within the altar and unite in prayer for God to
                              remove the obstacles to success.&quot; Before the women could
                              begin their prayers, some of them began to &quot;feel
                              happy&quot; and could not restrain their feelings. At that point
                              revival broke out, and the meeting was a success. Farmer held his next
                              campmeeting at <placeName>

                              early circuit riders, Farmer knew noone in the region. His task was to
                              go amongst strangers to win souls and establish churches. Farmer
                              calculated that he rode four thousand miles that year on the circuit
                              and frequently preached twice a day.</p>
                         <p>During his year on the Vermillion circuit, Farmer evangelized the
                              &quot;Creek Nation,&quot; which he identified as a large band

                              robbed, burned houses, and were generally &quot;unconscionable
                              scounderells.&quot; Farmer&apos;s friends urged him to avoid
                              the area, sure that he &quot;would lose his horse if he managed to
                              escape with his life.&quot; But Farmer was, as always, determined
                              to seek out converts. He visited houses until he found one that was
                              willing to have preaching, and he scheduled a revival meeting.
                              Neighbors slowly &quot;warmed to the message,&quot; although
                              some remained outside the house, listening through the windows. When
                              the breakthrough came, it was dramatic and several people fell down
                              &quot;as though they had been shot.&quot; Many converts
                              &quot;were soon in the enjoyment of Christian faith and
                                   happiness.&quot;<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>
                         <p>Farmer&apos;s next &quot;attack&quot; was on the adjoining
                              settlement, the &quot;stronghold of the bad fellows.&quot; For
                              this he recruited a &quot;working auxillery&quot; of six young
                              ladies, from other churches on the circuit, who were to &quot;sing
                              and pray, after which, when the altar would be visited by seekers of
                              mercy, they would labor at the altar with the sinners surrounding
                                   it.&quot;<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The meetings were held;
                              Farmer preached; the ladies prayed and sang; and when the altar filled
                              with mourners, the ladies &quot;labored at the altar.&quot;
                              Farmer had found a power over people that was far greater than the
                              physical prowess of his youth: &quot;If ever I loved a people in
                              this world, I loved these good people, for the power of the Lord was
                              with them continually ... I found good which bloodshed could not have
                                   gained.&quot;<hi rend="sup">35</hi></p>
                         <p>As fall 1826 approached, Farmer planned a circuit - wide campmeeting
                              which would include the folks of the Creek Nation. His friends
                              discouraged him, fearing trouble, and the presiding elder would not
                              offer his support. Farmer persisted but took the precaution of
                              selecting some converts to serve as guards. Farmer later reported that
                              he had never attended a meeting with better order and that many people

                                        economic distinctions were blurred at the altar, it also
                                        stood to reason that gender distinctions would be blurred.

                                        1784-1845,&quot; in <hi rend="i">Methodism and the

                                        135-73. Brekus argues that while Methodists held ambivalent
                                        feelings about women in leadership positions, there was a
                                        strong sense that endowment by the Spirit gave women
                                        authority to minister in areas previously granted only to
                                        men. The argument was soon expanded to allow women to
                                        preach. When the radical revivalist Wesleyan Methodists
                                        broke with the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1844, they

                              went so well, in fact, that Farmer suggested a variation on the
                              customary rituals: <quote rend="blockquote">About the time we were
                                   ready to close the meeting, I announced we would engage in what
                                   we called a &quot;holy march.&quot; . . . We would march
                                   around the encampment, on the outer side, three times, singing as
                                   we marched along, and that all who desired to go to heaven, were
                                   urgently requested to join the procession of singers. Many of the
                                   brethren and sisters became so happy during these closing
                                   services that they seemed to be kept upon the earth only by a
                                   miracle. I also announced, that just before the last march around
                                   the camp, I would stop and shake hands with them as they made the
                                   last circuit. I did so, and as soon as many of them had taken me
                                   by the hand, they would file around me and come up again and thus
                                   hover around me, loath to leave me. Some would be crying, while
                                   others would be shouting and praising God.<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>Farmer&apos;s revival success masks another aspect of this story.
                              Despite the flexibility of the Methodist system of organization, the
                              denomination possessed a distinct hierarchy. Those at the bottom of
                              the system, the exhorters and local preachers, were answerable to the
                              deacons, traveling elders, and bishops at the top. As
                              Farmer&apos;s ecclesiastical superior, the presiding
                              elder&apos;s support was crucial. But Farmer was obviously still
                              an independent man. If he felt led by the Spirit to hold a
                              campmeeting, he would do so, with or without the elder&apos;s
                              approval. Eventually, it would be conflict with the
                              &quot;authorities&quot; that would lead Farmer to break with

                         <p>At the next annual conference in 1827, however, Farmer was still a
                              dedicated circuit preacher, and his success in remote, rural circuits
                              may have contributed to his appointment to the Crawfordsville Circuit,
                              largely uncharted and unevangelized, stretching all the way north to

                              controversial of all the frontier campmeeting preachers, with a

                         <p>In early 1828, adversity befell Farmer and his wife. They both became
                              ill, and, at the age of 33, Eli was forced to give up his circuit.

                              illness but poverty. Like most Methodist circuit riders, he had few
                              independent resources, and his yearly assignments had been to the

                              wintery winds, we shrank into our sordid hut of cheerless

                              and a blanket hanging where a front door should have been. The

                              is made,&quot; Farmer saw himself as engaged in warfare with the

                                   condition, whispered many times in my ears, &quot;You have
                                   given away your once strong and healthy constitution, gave up

                                   of food we had, and it was eaten one morning at breakfast.
                                   Confined to my bed I confronted my fate, by watching the openings
                                   of Providence with a prayerful heart. About dinner time of that
                                   day an old lady, the mother of the Rev. Draper Chipman, came in
                                   with a basket well laden with just such edibles as sick folks
                                   ought to be supplied with, and spread them out before us, and it
                                   was just at the right time, too. Joy springing up in my heart, I

                              attend the yearly conference. He sent a request that he be
                              &quot;located&quot; (not given an appointment). The bishop

                              have to kill off the existing population and replace them with
                              different people. The only organized religion in the area was

                              results for Farmer, who, undeterred, proposed a campmeeting in
                              &quot;the valley of the <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White"
                                   >White River</geogName>.&quot; &quot;Certain authorities
                              of the church&quot; tried to stop the campmeeting but Farmer,
                              again exhibiting a disregard for authority when it suited his
                              purposes, held the meeting anyway. Farmer related that he
                              &quot;counted at one time sixty young men at the altar seeking
                                   salvation.&quot;<hi rend="sup">42</hi></p>
                         <p>Farmer was able to attend the 1830 annual conference but, still on the
                              edge of poverty, had to sell the family cow for funds. Perhaps the
                              &quot;authorities&quot; finally realized that if they were to
                              keep Farmer on a preaching circuit, they would have to send him
                              somewhere where he could not only save souls but make a modest living.
                              Farmer&apos;s appointment that year was to the White Lick circuit,
                              ten miles south of <placeName>

                              </placeName>. During the year he was able to pay off most of his
                              debts. His wife (now with two children) added to the family&apos;s
                              income by knitting and making shoes. Farmer&apos;s ministry also
                              prospered. Here he enjoyed the support and assistance of his presiding
                              elder, James Armstrong, and added 350 members to the church during the
                              year.</p>
                         <p>In 1831, Farmer was appointed to another more populous and prosperous
                              circuit, the Franklin circuit, which included <placeName>

                              </placeName>. Armstrong, Farmer&apos;s supervisor once more, had
                              told the people of the circuit that if they agreed to pay a
                              &quot;satisfactory&quot; wage, they would have the privilege
                              of choosing their own minister for the coming year. They chose Farmer,
                              whom they had known from campmeetings. By the end of the year Farmer
                              had taken in 555 members. He also paid off his debts, saved eighty
                              dollars, bought a two-horse wagon, and moved his family to his farm
                              near <placeName>

                         <p>Farmer&apos;s next appointment, in 1832, was to the Greencastle
                              Circuit. While riding the circuit, he was persuaded to invest his
                              savings in a merchandise business in <placeName>
                                   <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington"

                              </placeName>. When the firm ran into problems, Farmer bought out a
                              partner and sought to save the store. Once again, this time for
                              reasons of business rather than health, Farmer
                              &quot;located,&quot; i.e., gave up his circuit. In his
                              autobiography, Farmer does not write of how his location affected his
                              calling to preach or his relationship to the Methodist church, but it
                              was obvious that his life had taken a different turn.</p>

                         <p> Farmer&apos;s location was intended to be temporary, as he handled
                              his business investment. The business did well. Farmer relates that he
                              was helped by his 15-year-old son, who, unlike his father, had some
                              education and was able to do &quot;all my calculations for
                              me.&quot; By 1836, Farmer was preaching again, evidently part-time
                              and without official sanction, as he continued his business. He chose

                              (his) own ... developing (his) ideas pretty fully.&quot; The words
                              may have sounded like an ultimatum, and the leaders were, in

                              members into the church. But relations with the denominational
                              hierarchy continued to sour. At the first quarterly meeting, Farmer

                              year&apos;s end, a campmeeting was being held at the fourth
                              quarterly conference, under the leadership of the same elder, who
                              bypassed Farmer and scheduled other preachers. Not one succeeded in
                              stirring up a revival. One speaker, by Farmer&apos;s account,
                              &quot;destroyed the devotional feelings of the audience&quot;
                              by his &quot;wretched blunderings.&quot; Finally, at the
                              insistence of the crowd and a group of preachers not tied to the
                              circuit, Farmer was called upon to preach. He asked some of his
                              supporters to join him in the woods for a prayer meeting, where he
                              sought forgiveness for his &quot;ugly&quot; spirit. When a
                              bugle sounded for the beginning of the service, Farmer began to work
                              the crowd: <quote rend="blockquote">After this I now jumped over the
                                   rear railing of the preachers&apos; stand and extended a
                                   general and pressing invitation for sinners and backsliders to
                                   come forward to the altar and seek forgiveness for sin, and there
                                   was a general rush to the altar. They came by platoons, yes, came
                                   by companies, and even battalions .... The laborers at the altar
                                   were divided now with my brethren, excepting the traveling
                                   preachers, all of whom stood aloof, refusing to lend a helping
                                   hand. More than forty persons professed religion ... all of whom
                                   joined the church.<hi rend="sup">46</hi></quote></p>
                         <p>Farmer had challenged the presiding elder and his supporters and, on the
                              grounds of the campmeeting, had won a temporary victory. But the
                              presiding elder often played a determining role in yearly
                                   appointments<hi rend="sup">47</hi> and at the 1838 conference,
                              Farmer was appointed to the Danville Circuit. It was an undesirable,
                              struggling circuit that paid little. To make matters worse, it was
                              divided into two parts, and Farmer was given the larger, undeveloped
                              part. Feeling that he had been &quot;trapped&quot; by a
                              &quot;designing and cruel enemy,&quot; Farmer was ready to
                              locate again, but his wife admonished that they had &quot;never
                              abandoned a work assigned us till our labors were finished.&quot;

                              Farmer extended the meeting to seven days. Forty of the converts
                              became Methodists, but forty more had existing associations with other
                              churches. Farmer sent out for help from his Methodist

                         <p>Perhaps as a result of rejection and conflict from within his own
                              church, Farmer began to experiment with a new idea, one he would
                              eventually call his &quot;Christian Union plan.&quot; He
                              visited three other preachers in the area, two Presbyterian and one
                              Baptist. If the men would work the revival with him, he proposed, he
                              would not attempt to make Methodists out of the forty non-Methodists
                              already converted at his meeting and each would receive into his
                              church those that so desired. According to Farmer, the experiment was
                              a success: &quot;All prejudices gave way, every heart was filled
                              with love and union sentiments and all were happy and
                                   joyous.&quot;<hi rend="sup">50</hi> The meetings continued
                              for five more weeks, followed by a two-week-long joint
                              campmeeting.</p>
                         <p>At the 1839 annual conference, Farmer located. He offered himself for
                              revivals and campmeetings, but few shared his vision of cooperation.
                              When he agreed to preach a revival for the Baptists he was criticized
                              by the Methodist leadership. When the Methodist preacher in <placeName>

                              Farmer defended the Campbellites and got caught between the two
                              groups. Farmer attempted to sponsor a joint revival held on neutral
                              ground at the town courthouse, but the revival faded quickly.<hi

                              Presbyterians but no Methodists to the faculty. Wylie was fighting his
                              own battle against sectarianism, caught up in an Old School/New School
                              controversy with the Bloomington Presbyterian Church. Wylie and

                              Indians there. He made a trip south where he stayed for some months
                              and held revival meetings among the slaves. He started his own
                              denomination (Christian Union) based on his principles of cooperation.
                              He continued to sponsor, organize, and hold his own revivals and
                              campmeetings. He was elected and served three years in the state
                              senate (and got into a fist fight). He ran for the United States

                         <p>Historically, Christian denominations grew or were established in new
                              territory by one of several methods: 1) by biological growth, that is,
                              the faith was passed from one generation to another, so that as
                              families grew the church grew; 2) by missionary growth, in which
                              missionaries persuaded villages, clans, tribes, or even nations to
                              convert to the faith; 3) by migration, as ethnic or church groups
                              (including Quakers, Mennonites, Brethren, Reformed, and Lutherans)
                              colonized new lands; or 4) by state sponsorship, when princes, kings,
                              or governments imposed or sponsored (by education, for example) a
                              state-related religion.</p>
                         <p>Methodism grew in the American West through conversion, that is, by
                              persons turning from no faith or lapsed commitment to faith. In the
                              new country on the frontier, the advantage went to the group with a
                              convincing message and an effective organization. For Methodists, and
                              then for many of the groups that interacted with them, the means to
                              conversion growth was revival. Jesse Lee claimed that in the first
                              twenty- five years following its establishment, the Methodist
                              Episcopal Church grew entirely through revivals.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
                              Although Lee&apos;s claim ignores an inevitable
                              biological/familial element in two-and-one-half decades, the
                              percentage of members added by revival conversion must be in the
                              overwhelming majority. Certainly Eli Farmer&apos;s career conforms
                              to this pattern. From the time of his own conversion in 1823 until he
                              left the Methodist fold in 1839, Farmer relied on a constant cycle of
                              revivals in every one of his circuits and, in one difficult assignment
                              after another, his methods met with impressive results.</p>

                    <p>I&apos;m not sure I can imagine modern masculinity without James Dean.
                         Sure, Marion Brando had angst. In his films of the first half of the 1950s,
                         including <hi rend="i">A Streetcar Named Desire</hi> (1951), <hi rend="i"
                              >Viva Zapata!</hi> (1952), <hi rend="i">The Wild One</hi> (1953), and
                              <hi rend="i">On the Waterfront</hi> (1954), Brando visibly suffered on
                         screen, torn by psychological demons and tortured by moral choices. But he
                         suffered in a manly, hairy-chested manner, a mixture of grunts, grimaces,
                         and testosterone. Dean&apos;s suffering was somehow womanlier. He
                         cried, whined, moaned, buried his face in his hands, collapsed into a fetal
                         ball, and just fell apart. Brando&apos;s angst threatened others. At
                         any moment it might explode into violence. Dean&apos;s threatened only
                         himself. Brando&apos;s was existential; Dean&apos;s nihilistic.
                         Dean&apos;s emotional androgyny became one of the pillars of the
                         counterculture and helped to define the sensitive New Age guy.</p>
                    <p>Two questions immediately arise for a biographer. What were the sources of
                         Dean&apos;s on-screen presence? And how does one write a biography of a
                         man who had become a fable even before the automobile crash that took his
                         life? Three films transformed Dean into an American icon. In <hi rend="i"
                              >East of Eden</hi> (1955), <hi rend="i">Rebel Without a Cause</hi>
                         (1955), and <hi rend="i">Giant</hi> (1956), Dean played variations of the
                         same role: the lost, confused, suffering, ultimately hopeless man-child.
                         His body was an exposed nerve, his psyche a basket case. Watching the films
                         today, one is struck by how badly he overacts. His inability to make eye

                         emotionalism approach irritating mannerisms. (Which, of course, makes one
                         wonder what it was that so attracted audiences.) But his films, including
                         two released after his death, made Dean into an icon, freezing him in a
                         particular role at a particular cultural moment.</p>
                    <p>In <hi rend="i">James Dean: Rebel with a Cause</hi>, Wes D. Gehring attempts
                         to separate the actor and the person from the icon. In the process, he
                         takes a stab at the central biographical questions. Unlike previous
                         biographers, who either blurred the line between Dean and the roles he
                         inhabited or played fast and loose with psychological theory, Gehring does
                         not see the on-screen Dean as a mirror reflection of the off-screen Dean.
                         Gehring&apos;s Dean is remarkably well-adjusted: nice, loving toward
                         his aunt and uncle (Ortense and Marcus Winslow) who raised him in <placeName>

                         </placeName>, respectful toward his leading ladies, humorous around his
                         friends, and delightful in his ability to mimic others. He fits the old
                         Hoosier ideal: &quot;It&apos;s nice to be important, but
                         it&apos;s more important to be nice.&quot; Yet Dean was also a
                         serious Method actor, trained in the famed Actors Studio under the
                         direction of Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan. Method acting demanded total
                         immersion in a role, and it trafficked in the antihero rather than
                         traditional leading man. The Method antihero tended toward dumb
                         inarticulateness and painful vulnerability rather than quick, decisive
                         actions. Dean absorbed the Method style, but in the end, Gehring insists,
                         it was a pose, not who Dean was.</p>
                    <p>Gehring makes a good case for the psychologically healthy Dean, but at times
                         he goes too far. His volume is part of the Indiana Historical
                         Society&apos;s Indiana Biography series, and perhaps he credits
                         Dean&apos;s years in <placeName>

                         </placeName>, and Dean&apos;s time there was not the prison sentence
                         that several other biographers have speculated. But Gehring stretches the
                         point when he writes: &quot;One cannot help thinking that the moxie
                         Dean showed in leaving his Hoosier haven for college in <placeName>

                         </placeName> (the site of so many painful memories), and hopefully an
                         acting career, was born of the non-stop support he had received in <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031771" reg="Fairmount"
                                   >Fairmount</settlement>
                         </placeName>. Long before Dean was famous, he was the proverbial big fish
                         in a small town. And sometimes that makes all the difference&quot; (p.
                         79). Perhaps, but it is just as likely that he left <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031771" reg="Fairmount"

                         </placeName> to find something that was just not there.</p>
                    <p>Beyond this single quibble, Gehring&apos;s book is a model of
                         craftsmanship. He has written numerous other biographies of actors and
                         actresses, and he knows <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013837" reg="Hollywood"
                                   >Hollywood</settlement>
                         </placeName> and the motion picture industry. His discussion of
                         Dean&apos;s three major films, as well as of Dean&apos;s
                         relationships with directors and fellow actors, is consistently
                         insightful.</p>
                    <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-104-1-102"/>
                    <p>For the most part, Gehring chooses not to delve too deeply into
                         Dean&apos;s iconic place in American cultural history or the
                         actor&apos;s importance at a particular historical moment. The question
                         of how Dean altered the nature of modern masculinity or invented a new
                         &quot;type&quot; that helped to reshape <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013837" reg="Hollywood"

                         </placeName> is largely outside of the scope of the book. At no point does
                         Gehring promise to deliver more than he does - a fresh, sympathetic treatment
                         of <placeName>

                    <p>On April 19, 1861, eighteen-year-old Ambrose Bierce enlisted with the Indiana

                    <p>David M. Owens&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Devil&apos;s Topographer:
                              Ambrose Bierce and the American War Story</hi> confines itself largely
                         to this itinerary, considering Bierce&apos;s life after the war only as
                         it relates to the writing of his short fiction and memoirs of his time in
                         service. Owens contends that Bierce was jolted into writing his vivid and
                         ironic tales of heroism and desperation by reading <hi rend="i">A Narrative
                              of Military Service</hi> (1885) by Hazen, Bierce&apos;s admired
                         superior officer during the war. The table of contents for Hazen&apos;s

                         </placeName>. Owens further argues that Bierce&apos;s work as army
                         topographer (his book reproduces several of Bierce&apos;s detailed
                         maps) holds the clue to his literary achievement in such famous stories as &quot;<placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013598" reg="Chickamauga"
                                   >Chickamauga</settlement>
                         </placeName>&quot; and &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek
                         Bridge.&quot; Bierce&apos;s &quot;habit was to write about
                         places as they were when he saw them, regardless of whether the events of
                         the story are based on real incidents or purely invented&quot; (p. 5).
                         The topographical details of Bierce&apos;s stories, the concreteness of
                         their geography and even time frame-&quot;places as they were <hi
                              rend="i">when he saw them</hi>&quot;-suggest to Owens that
                         &quot;Bierce&apos;s war stories are primarily a reflection of his
                         own journey through the war&quot; (p. 19).</p>
                    <p>Such a thesis has some powerful implications for an aesthetic assessment of
                         &quot;the American War Story&quot; invoked in Owens&apos;s
                         subtitle. In his preface and again in the afterword, the author discusses
                         war stories as relying essentially on the author&apos;s
                         &quot;having been there.&quot; Bierce really was there, to be sure,
                         but Owens does not rest satisfied with the basic knowledge that Bierce
                         fought in this battle, or even with Bierce&apos;s own published
                         non-fictional recollections of his experiences. He wants to find which <pb

                         symbolically laden settings for &quot;An Affair at Coulter&apos;s
                         Notch&quot; and &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.&quot;
                         (Owens concludes that the notch and the bridge are fictional, but based on
                         topographic prototypes observed by Bierce). While it is important to know
                         how powerfully actual experience determined Bierce&apos;s aesthetic
                         practice, Owens finally invests too much in the concept of experience. When
                         Owens suggests that his &quot;personal research retracing
                         Bierce&apos;s steps through the war in substantially the same sequence
                         as he took them&quot; (p. 5) can deliver essential critical insight, he
                         reaches for an ideal of experience- as chronologically mappable, as capable
                         of re-creation and communication -that Bierce&apos;s fictions explode
                         time and again when they describe the ironic consequences of the fact that
                         experience is as much a function of distorted perception as it is of
                         topography.</p>

                         </placeName>. Interest in Lewis&apos;s death has hardly subsided in
                         recent years; indeed, the two-hundredth anniversary of the expedition seems
                         to have sparked a new fascination with the famous explorer&apos;s sad
                         ending. Fortunately, <hi rend="i">By His Own Hand?</hi> offers a highly
                         readable, well- researched account of the controversy surrounding
                         Lewis&apos;s death that is valuable to both general readers and
                         scholars alike.</p>
                    <p>It would have been hard to find three scholars more qualified to discuss this
                         topic than Guice, professor of history emeritus at the University <pb
                              n="99" id="VAA4025-104-1-105"/>of Southern Mississippi; Holmberg,
                         curator of special collections at the Filson Historical Society in
                         Louisville, Kentucky; and Buckley, assistant professor of history at
                         Brigham Young University.</p>
                    <p>Mirroring a courtroom setting, Holmberg argues the case for suicide, Guice
                         attempts to refute him, and Buckley gives instructions to the jury of
                         readers. This format makes for fascinating reading. Holmberg, for example,
                         offers a systematic review of the ten contemporaneous sources supporting
                         suicide. As he points out, these sources &quot;can be separated into
                         two groups: those who were with Lewis in the days before his death and
                         those who knew Lewis and believed he was capable of suicide&quot; (p.
                         30). In this careful study of primary documents, Holmberg also deals with
                         questions commonly raised by critics of the suicide theory. In a
                         particularly poignant passage, Holmberg compares Lewis&apos;s death to
                         the demise of Peter Grayson, a prominent lawyer and politician who took his
                         own life in 1838-at a <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007825" reg="Tennessee"
                                   >Tennessee</region>
                         </placeName> inn-to save himself &quot;from the horrors of the
                         madhouse&quot; (p. 67).</p>
                    <p>Defense attorney Guice, by contrast, argues that certain details of the
                         suicide hypothesis are presumed to be solid when they are actually rather
                         shaky. Several accounts, for instance, claim that Lewis cut himself with a
                         razor, but neither of the two most important witnesses said anything of the
                         kind. In addition, &quot;Many writers echo the charge [that Lewis was
                         an alcoholic], but none point to creditable evidence&quot; (p. 78). If
                         one is to present a single, unified theory that Lewis&apos;s wounds
                         were self-inflicted, such anomalies must be accounted for. Still, Guice
                         himself maintains that Lewis was &quot;probably&quot; the victim of
                         outlaws without offering a scenario of exactly what happened.</p>
                    <p>Buckley adds a deft touch when he compares the controversy surrounding
                         Lewis&apos;s death to a &quot;defining moment&quot; during the
                         expedition -when Lewis and Clark had to decide whether to take the western
                         or northern branch of the <geogName key="tgn_7014086" reg="Missouri River"
                              >Missouri River</geogName> (in present-day <placeName>

                         </placeName>). Today there are good arguments on each side of the debate.
                         Buckley also offers a thorough review of recent studies of Lewis&apos;s
                         death and points out quite perceptively that &quot;murder theories can
                         only do damage to the suicide theory one at a time. They do not
                         accumulate&quot; (p. 133). Buckley also supplies the most comprehensive
                         bibliography ever compiled on this topic.</p>
                    <p>A valuable documents section includes nine primary documents related to
                         Lewis&apos;s death. I wish, however, that photographs of some of the
                         original manuscripts had been supplemented by typed transcriptions. I also
                         believe that the courtroom analogy can be pushed too far. After all,
                         historians are not required to prove their interpretations &quot;beyond
                         reasonable doubt&quot;-they simply have to show that a given theory
                         garners more support from primary sources <pb n="100"

                    <p>It is often said that journalism is the first draft of history. For
                         historians concerned with urban poverty in twentieth-century <placeName>

                         </placeName>, sociology has more often and more reliably filled that role,
                         from the Chicago School studies of the 1920s and beyond, to Kenneth
                         Clark&apos;s social psychological profile of the urban ghetto in the
                         1960s, to William Julius Wilson&apos;s examination of the ruinous
                         impact of de-industrialization in the 1980s. Aside from the prescriptive
                         role social science can play in understanding contemporary problems, this
                         historical function is also a vital one, because the dearth of conventional
                         primary sources often makes the experiences of the poor particularly
                         fleeting.</p>
                    <p>Sandra L. Barnes, associate professor of sociology at Purdue University, has
                         produced a compelling study in this same tradition, focusing on one of the

                         the corporation&apos;s chairman. As historian Jon Teaford has
                         recounted, the city was promoted as the &quot;eighth wonder of the
                         world&quot; and referred to in 1909 by <hi rend="i">Putnam&apos;s
                              Magazine</hi> as &quot;the magic city.&quot; Barnes provides
                         some historical background to the tragedy of <placeName>

                    <p>Barnes contends that contemporary <placeName>

                         </placeName> residents are far from the &quot;other Americans&quot;
                         mired in the deflating culture of poverty depicted by Michael Harrington in
                         the 1960s, asserting instead that those she studied &quot;do not
                         exhibit present-time orientation, feelings of hopelessness, despair,
                         inferiority, low aspirations, and fatalism, but rather appear to
                         concentrate their efforts and resources toward the future of their
                         children&quot; (pp. 188-89). Her subjects here are more frequently
                         examples of the &quot;working poor&quot; -those earning meager
                         wages, an unfortunate and unexpected event away from disaster, cobbling
                         together what support systems they can in an era of more limited public
                         assistance in the wake of the welfare reform legislation of 1996. Barnes
                         criticizes the official federal poverty threshold as an inadequate
                         measuring tool, but she accepts this as her functional definition of
                         poverty, and focuses less on those who are endemically unemployable and
                         destitute-e.g., the mentally ill or the chemically dependent-than on those
                         nearer the poverty line.</p>
                    <p>Barnes spotlights the stories of selected women and their families as
                         exemplary, including the frustrations of a college-educated African
                         American woman struggling to find a decent job, weighing the costs of her
                         loyalty to <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary">Gary</settlement>
                         </placeName> and the employment opportunities in outlying areas, along with
                         the case of a Latino mother of three who patronized <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary">Gary</settlement>
                         </placeName> businesses when possible but kept her children out of what she
                         judged the city&apos;s inferior school system.</p>
                    <p>Race is clearly a factor in the poverty detailed by Barnes, but not so much
                         in differing daily experiences among racial minorities as in the
                         outmigration of businesses to surrounding areas. Barnes produces staggering
                         statistics about the growth of suburban retailers at <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary"

                         </placeName> expense, and she offers an extensive examination of the
                         difficult choices residents must make when shopping for food and
                         clothing.</p>
                    <p>This important work is among the first to provide a close-range examination
                         of life for poor urban residents in the post-welfare reform era.
                         Nevertheless, while the book jacket proclaims that the study
                         &quot;offers broad findings that apply to other similarly impoverished
                         Rust Belt Cities,&quot; Barnes provides little comparative discussion,
                         and sadly, in spite of her convincing conclusion that <placeName>
                              <settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary"

                         </placeName> residents bravely maintain hope for their individual futures,
                         the study leaves the reader with the impression that aside from the
                         determination of many residents, <placeName>

                    <p>Traditionally, the study of Abraham Lincoln&apos;s legal career has been
                         limited by two obstacles. One was the lack of accessible primary sources-
                         historians assumed that few legal records had survived relating to cases in
                         which Lincoln was involved, and that those few were scattered in
                         courthouses and county offices throughout <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region>
                         </placeName>. The second was a lack of technical knowledge. The
                         complexities of the law in general, and of nineteenth-century <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region>
                         </placeName> law in particular, have lain beyond the expertise of most
                         professional historians, who left the subject to be addressed by lawyers
                         with an interest in Lincoln. These writers, including John J. Duff, John P.
                         Frank, and more recently Frank J. Williams, understood the law but in turn
                         lacked historical training. In 2000, the first obstacle was overcome with
                         the publication of <hi rend="i">The Law Practice of Abraham Lincoln</hi>,
                         the culmination of a ten-year search that yielded over 100,000 pages of
                         original documents relating to Lincoln&apos;s legal career. The
                         appearance of <hi rend="i">An Honest Calling</hi>, written by a
                         professional scholar of both law and history, suggests that the second
                         obstacle is falling as well.</p>
                    <p>This is good news, and not just for Lincoln aficionados. Steiner addresses
                         the central issues in Lincoln&apos;s legal career in ways that enhance
                         our understanding of the role of lawyers and the law throughout antebellum <placeName>
                              <country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country>
                         </placeName>. In particular, Steiner devotes a chapter to the troublesome
                         Matson case, in which Lincoln represented a slaveholder trying to retain
                         possession of Jane Matson and her family, who claimed that they were freed
                         when their master moved them to <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois"
                                   >Illinois</region>
                         </placeName>. How could the Great Emancipator do this? Steiner uses this
                         case to illustrate his central thesis: that Lincoln was a Whig lawyer,
                         devoted to the process of law as the source of social order. Lincoln,
                         Steiner argues, was not an ideologue like Salmon Chase who saw the law as
                         an instrument for social justice. Neither, however, was he the
                         &quot;railroad lawyer&quot; portrayed in Gore Vidal&apos;s
                         novel, using the law as a means of advancing business interests at the
                         expense of workers. Lincoln, and by implication many other Whig lawyers,
                         saw themselves primarily as agents of order, representing any client who
                         came to them (slave or slaveholder, railroad corporation or injured
                         worker), and using mediation as much as litigation to maintain social order
                         and uphold the shared values of the community.</p>
                    <p>The chapters of <hi rend="i">An Honest Calling</hi> address the
                         historiography of Lincoln&apos;s legal career, his legal
                         self-education, the influence upon his <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-104-1-109"
                         />practice of his Whig values, and the range of cases he handled, with
                         particular focus on the Matson case and on his legal work for and against
                         the Illinois Central Railroad. A provocative final chapter suggests that
                         the rise of corporate capitalism and the impersonal market economy in the
                         1850s was rendering obsolete Lincoln&apos;s community-oriented style of
                         lawyering. The diversity of the chapters gives the book something of the
                         feeling of a collection of articles rather than a cohesive whole, an
                         impression amplified by &quot;Conclusion&quot; sections at the end
                         of four of the chapters, instead of a concluding chapter to pull everything
                         together. The book is heavily footnoted, in the style of a law review
                         article, with citations to cases found in <hi rend="i">The Law Practice of

                         </placeName>. Historically, most of this tension has centered on housing
                         and on the maintenance of neighborhood racial boundaries by whites. Thus it
                         is no surprise that the practice of relegating people of color to areas
                         crowded with polluting factories and other locally unwanted land uses-
                         environmental racism- is also widespread in that city. Sylvia

                    <p>Drawing from Michel Foucault&apos;s concepts of power/knowledge, as well
                         as from biopolitics and theories of racial formation, Washington argues
                         that non-whites are constructed outside of the parameters of the body
                         politic. Since racialization is a socio-historical process, many groups
                         previously defined as non-white (e.g., Irish, European Jews, and other
                         immigrants) were later reclassified as white, in the process becoming less
                         vulnerable to environmental racism <pb n="104" id="VAA4025-104-1-110"/>This
                         argument represents a significant contribution to environmental justice
                         studies and suggests a comparative and relational ethnic studies approach
                         to future treatments of the subject.</p>
                    <p>Washington notes that few environmental historians have paid sufficient
                         attention to the problem of environmental racism; many of those who do
                         locate the birth of the environmental justice movement in the late 1970s or
                         early 1980s. However, Washington offers clear support for her contention
                         that the movement was evident as early as the late nineteenth century, when
                         European immigrant populations in <placeName>

                         close proximity to their homes.</p>
                    <p>Readers also learn that the Chicago Urban League was deeply involved in early
                         environmental justice struggles through its Urban Conservation Movement
                         effort in the 1940s and 1950s. The League developed a range of responses to
                         the local environmental racism that African Americans encountered, which
                         included dilapidated and segregated housing and proximity to many vice
                         operations. The League rejected the idea of restrictive covenants,
                         advocating for African Americans to have the freedom to live where they
                         pleased, and it challenged the laws that had produced the city&apos;s
                         &quot;Black Belt.&quot; On the other hand, by embracing the
                         development of racially exclusive public housing projects for African
                         Americans (believed, at the time, to be a progressive way to fight blight
                         and achieve healthy neighborhoods), the League reinforced racial
                         segregation and restricted group mobility, which later enabled contemporary
                         environmental racism. The League also sponsored anti-litter campaigns and
                         &quot;block beautiful&quot; contests, wherein residents would
                         compete for the honor of having the most impressive gardens. This is what
                         some environmental sociologists have termed a
                         &quot;cosmetological&quot; approach - activism that fails to
                         challenge the institutional practices that produce environmental
                         inequalities. However, taken together, this combination of tactics paints a
                         complex portrait of an organization some might otherwise consider
                         exclusively devoted to civil rights or social service, when in fact, the
                         Urban League was much more than that.</p>
                    <p>The book&apos;s title suggests that external forces may be responsible
                         for &quot;packing&quot; people of color into polluted
                         neighborhoods, but Washington maintains that African Americans and European
                         immigrants often voluntarily &quot;packed&quot; themselves into
                         spaces that were later burdened by polluting businesses or industrial
                         wastes. Some scholars will find this claim controversial, but others will
                         applaud Washington for presenting such viewpoints and evidence. <hi

                    <p>In this richly detailed accounting of the ways of another time, Dwight Hoover
                         shares with us his youthful experiences of life on an <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007253" reg="Iowa">Iowa</region>
                         </placeName> farm in the 1930s. The work was often difficult, even
                         grueling, but for a bright and thoughtful boy it was the stuff of a strong
                         foundation and, for us, a fine memoir.</p>
                    <p>The book is divided into the seasons of the year interspersed with chapters
                         called respites, which add depth and context to the story. Few of us have
                         had anything like the experiences of the author, and whatever our
                         romanticized notions of the workings of a family farm may be, they are put
                         to the test by this keen remembrance of both work and respite.</p>
                    <p>Although quite different in style and purpose, the book calls to mind Hamlin
                         Garland&apos;s Middle Border stories of the late nineteenth century.
                         But this work is written by one of the country&apos;s leading social
                         historians about a time of great transition on the farm. It is, in a way, a
                         memorial to a whole order of American experience. The changes in farming
                         brought on by social and economic conditions and perhaps most of all by
                         mechanization are laid out by one who grew up in the midst of them. Not
                         always knowing how to cope with the often mind-boggling changes underway,
                         shackled by mortgages, the family weathered on, and indeed persevered, by
                         employing what Hoover declares to be, &quot;A Good Day&apos;s
                         Work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What did that work entail? The plowing and disking of fields, the stages of
                         cultivation of corn, haying from the planting to the loft, are all covered.
                         Livestock care, management, and slaughter are vividly described, sometimes
                         too much so for urban sensibilities. Ever wonder why there aren&apos;t
                         as many barns in today&apos;s countryside? Read this book. It also
                         provides an understanding of a farm boy&apos;s relationship to
                         organizations that taught a life of agriculture. The author competitively
                         raised and showed sheep while participating in 4-H and Future Farmers of
                         America. His remembrances of these clubs indicates that they taught him
                         valuable lessons.</p>

                    <p>After World War II and graduation from college, Hoover concluded that farming
                         was not for him, and he gives a heartfelt description of this crucial
                         choice. There are basic truths to Hoover&apos;s story beyond the life
                         of an <placeName>

                    <p>In 1927, Uncle Dave Macon recorded a song that included these lyrics:

                         work at the farm.&quot; Dwight Hoover&apos;s choice was not as
                         simple and direct, but he still chose not to work at the farm. He became a
                         historian instead, and his boyhood experiences helped him to do so.</p>

                         The founders bickered about the peculiar institution during the
                         Constitutional Convention, laying down markers that would frame debates for
                         generations, but after 1790 those issues were safely swept under the rug.
                         In 1819 slavery briefly returned to politics with the debates over the
                         Missouri Compromise, but the issue really did not enter national political
                         discourse until the 1830s, and the sectional crisis emerged as a serious
                         threat only in the 1850s. Or so the story goes.</p>
                    <p>In this deeply researched monograph, Matthew Mason challenges conventional
                         wisdom by shifting our gaze from the immediate antebellum years to the
                         first decades of the Early Republic. Through a close reading of political
                         speeches, pamphlets, and newspaper editorials, Mason demonstrates that
                         slavery never disappeared from public discussions. Politicians on both
                         sides of the political aisle routinely found ways to use the peculiar
                         institution to their advantage. In the early nineteenth century, national
                         and international debates about slavery shaped regional differences between
                         the North and the South (and within <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-104-1-113"/>the
                         North), while also becoming a crucial aspect of Anglo-American
                         dialogue.</p>
                    <p>In the immediate post-Revolutionary decades, slavery expanded steadily across
                         the South without significant popular resistance even while abolitionist
                         sentiment, framed largely as a principled opposition to the slave trade,
                         gained a foothold. After the Louisiana Purchase, some Federalists dabbled
                         with tarring Republicans with a pro-slavery brush, but the issue gained
                         little political traction. With the War of 1812, New England Federalists
                         expanded their critique of slavery, adding a more emphatic moral critique
                         to their assault on the Republicans while assailing the constitutional
                         system of slave representation, thus raising sectional tensions. These
                         discussions posed particular challenges for northern Republicans, who
                         sought to defend their party without yoking it to a defense of slavery. The
                         Anglo-American conflict shaped debates, as Americans smarted at charges
                         that slavery illustrated a moral deficiency, prompting nationalistic
                         counterattacks while also exacerbating sectional tensions. Mason also notes
                         the significance of African American agency. Black rebellions and
                         repressive responses by southern whites provided an important context for
                         national debates about race and slavery.</p>
                    <p>The years between the War of 1812 and the passage of the Missouri Compromise
                         saw the coalescing of the sectional conflict, triggered by the postwar
                         expansion of slavery. The various regions within the North diverged in
                         their responses. Mason finds that New Englanders, safely insulated from the
                         taint of slavery, &quot;struck a note of complacency,&quot; whereas
                         whites in the Mid-Atlantic acted to cleanse themselves from the
                         institution&apos;s enduring remnants. Residents of the northwestern
                         states saw a real peril in slavery&apos;s dramatic expansion. What was
                         to keep it from crossing the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River"
                              >Ohio River</geogName> and corrupting their shores? In response to
                         rising antislavery rhetoric, southern whites perfected new aggressive
                         strategies, including a strong case for states&apos; rights.</p>
                    <p>These political debates came to a head in the extended discussion of the
                         Missouri Compromise. Mason&apos;s core claim is that the sectional
                         arguments that emerged in 1819-1820 had their roots in the previous several
                         decades, but that during those vigorous national debates the two sides
                         honed their rhetoric, dispensed with the worst contradictions, and
                         generally upped the ante. In the subsequent forty years, the slave debates
                         grew more vociferous as the sectional crisis mounted and the nation sped
                         towards civil war. Along the way, the debates over slavery evolved and grew
                         more heated, but their fundamental rhetorical shape remained in place. <hi

                    <p>Mitch Kachun draws on a rich collection of primary sources to explore the
                         ways in which African Americans sought to &quot;create and
                         perpetuate&quot; a usable past through public celebration and
                         commemorative ritual (p. 7). Beginning with the abolition of the Atlantic
                         slave trade and ending with the fiftieth anniversary of the abolition of
                         slavery, Kachun explains how African Americans sought to use such public
                         displays both to celebrate emancipation and to commemorate their
                         distinctive past. Kachun also argues that the scope and nature of freedom
                         festivals changed in the wake of emancipation. In addition to the
                         traditions of activism and protest that had characterized antebellum
                         celebrations, African Americans also sought to foster race pride and uplift
                         as Reconstruction gave way to Jim Crow. In the author&apos;s hands,
                         these freedom festivals become a vehicle for understanding how African
                         Americans strove to agitate for emancipation, to create a coherent racial
                         identity and history, and to combat the postbellum proliferation of racist
                         caricatures (p. 6).</p>
                    <p>In presenting this larger narrative, Kachun deftly reveals the
                         often-overlooked complexity and tension that lay underneath this history.
                         Freedom festival organizers simultaneously struggled to craft a distinct
                         African American identity while demonstrating a basic Americanness to the
                         broader society. Like other recent works in African American history that
                         accentuate the complexity of racial identity, Kachun&apos;s work helps
                         to give greater dimension to African Americans&apos; struggle to carve
                         out a place in American society. The study also raises important questions
                         of class. As festival organizers pushed first for emancipation and then
                         nondiscrimination, they became increasingly concerned with eradicating
                         slave culture and instilling Christian morality (especially in freedmen).
                         Kachun also explains, however, that festival organizers subscribed to
                         &quot;a moral vision that was often at odds with the lives of the <pb
                              n="109" id="VAA4025-104-1-115"/> masses of black Americans whose value
                         systems had been largely shaped under the peculiar institution&quot;
                         (p. 5).</p>
                    <p>Though the voices of women are mostly silent and the issue of gender is
                         largely absent from this book, <hi rend="i">Festivals of Freedom</hi> is a
                         very good study of how African Americans have sought to use public space
                         and the public sphere to advance freedom and equality. Kachun&apos;s
                         use of editorials from African American newspapers and the texts of Freedom
                         Day speeches is particularly engaging. Readers interested in African
                         American history, African Americans&apos; transition from slavery to
                         freedom, African American identity and historical consciousness, and
                         African American institutional life would benefit from reading this
                         book.</p>

                         Beecher Stowe, Wood includes an exciting cross-river chase with a slave

                         holding views which reflect those of the author himself. Even with its 1862
                         publication date (Manassas being the only large-scale clash to have taken
                         place during its composition), <hi rend="i">Fort Lafayette</hi> contains
                         the classic Civil War motifs of brother killing brother and friend clashing
                         with friend. Despite the cliches, what is of great value about these
                         characters is that their views are fairly nuanced and give the reader some
                         feel for the variety of opinions that existed prior to the war.</p>
                    <p>In his preface, Blondheim claims that &quot;<hi rend="i">Fort
                              Lafayette</hi> is at one and the same time an action-packed thriller
                         and an intellectually complex and intriguing literary work reflecting
                         important trends in political thought ... [it] can surely stand on its own
                         as a gripping story and a profound ideological statement&quot; (pp.
                         viii-ix). Fortunately, in the comprehensive and very readable introduction
                         that follows, the author does not mount a defense of the novel as great
                         literature, but instead sets it in historical, political, and biographical
                         (for indeed Benjamin Wood&apos;s own life was rife with material for
                         several page-turners) contexts. Blondheim also places the work within the
                         current field of border studies, effectively demonstrating both the
                         significance and moral unity of the variety and type of North-South border
                         crossings associated with Wood&apos;s novel, his newspaper, and his
                         life. Ultimately, claims Blondheim, <hi rend="i">Fort
                              Lafayette&apos;s</hi> &quot;line crossing comes to signify the
                         point of conflict between the morally sanctioned and humane [i.e.
                         Wood&apos;s anti-war views] and the tyrannical and criminal
                         [Lincoln&apos;s refusal to tolerate secession] on the other&quot;
                         (p. 28).</p>

                         decidedly un-literary, and instructive look at the Copperhead movement.
                         Menahem Blondheim has added real value to this deservedly forgotten

                         >IMH</hi>, but readers may want to know more about what came after that
                         first step. Susan Currell and Christiana Cogdell&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                              >Popular Eugenics: National Efficiency and American Mass Culture in
                              the 1930s</hi> offers an interesting look at what happened to the
                         national eugenics movement in the years that followed.</p>
                    <p>The book&apos;s edited contributions cover a wide spectrum of eugenic -
                         influenced movements. Indeed, as Currell and Cogdell explain, the 1930s was
                         a pivotal period in American eugenic thought, as the movement began to
                         grapple with how to widely apply its vision to the country. Should it
                         continue to focus on preventive, or negative eugenics? Or, could the
                         American environment be altered in order to produce a eugenically sound
                         populace? As the various authors show, this debate was far from academic,
                         as by the 1930s the notion of eugenics affected virtually all of American
                         culture and life. Americans were looking at the world around them and
                         debating the problems associated with the Depression in eugenic terms.</p>
                    <p> The contributors to the volume discuss this dialogue in very different and
                         interesting ways. From looking at the Cooper Hewitt trial; to examining the
                         meanings that Americans assigned to Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s triumph
                         over polio; to a study of the notion that a better educated gener- al
                         populace might create a eugenic utopia; to a look at the effects that
                         eugenic thought had on the South (the book includes three wonderful
                         chapters on this region)-the first section of <hi rend="i">Popular
                              Eugenics</hi> offers a varied yet intriguing analysis both of how
                         eugenics was understood and of its complexity as a movement. The second
                         section of the book deals more specifically with the degree to which
                         eugenic thought permeated American visual culture. Readers will be treated
                         to discussions of statuary, the colon as a eugenic device, the eugenic
                         dimensions of teeth (and its relationship to criminality), as well as a
                         look at how Hollywood, both in its horror films and musical comedies, dealt
                         with eugenics. The book ends with a chapter on what became of an exhibit,
                         popular in Nazi <placeName>

                         that eugenics took.</p>
                    <p>In short, a variety of readers will find this book to be of use and interest.
                         Currell and Cogdell do a wonderful job of showcasing the <pb n="112"
                              id="VAA4025-104-1-118"/>complexity of the eugenic movement during the
                         1930s. More importantly, they do a service to readers by showing that even
                         as eugenicists endured a widening public critique, they never lost their
                         general sense of racial and class superiority or bias. In many ways, even
                         as the movement changed, it stayed remarkably the same. That eugenics moved

                    <p>Catherine Rymph has produced a tightly focused monograph on the role of
                         Republican women in shaping the political culture of the party over the
                         course of the twentieth century. Rymph is concerned with describing the
                         moral crusades of GOP clubwomen - women who operated outside the party
                         structure and who concerned themselves with advancing an agenda of female
                         consciousness. She also suitably describes the activism of party women who
                         operated within the party structure and sought to shape its internal
                         policies and platforms.</p>
                    <p>The book is focused mostly on the tensions between clubwomen and party women
                         in constructing policies, both within and outside the party, that might
                         maximize benefits for women. Rymph has done a solid job contextualizing the
                         disputes between women&apos;s factions and documenting how these
                         disputes, typically over issues of full integration within the wider party,
                         or issues of morality and &quot;women&apos;s concerns,&quot;
                         fit within the wider GOP landscape.</p>
                    <p>The book works best in detailing the varied attitudes of clubwomen and party
                         women on a variety of different topics, from suffrage to abortion. Rymph
                         explores the political tumults over control of the National Federation of
                         Republican Women, particularly over the controversial dispute between
                         conservative Phyllis Schlafly, who lost the presidential election of the
                         organization in 1967, <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-104-1-119"/> and the more
                         liberal delegates to the convention.</p>
                    <p>One of the author&apos;s more interesting stories concerns those GOP
                         women who remained committed to feminist causes including abortion rights
                         and the Equal Rights Amendment, even as the party shifted to the Right on
                         such issues during the 1970s. As the overall party became more
                         conservative, the women within the GOP became more liberal; one result of
                         this shift was the election of liberal activist Mary Louise Smith to the
                         leadership of the Republican National Committee in 1976. Conservative women
                         like Schlafly, who still remained a Republican delegate, focused their
                         attention on grassroots activism outside the party (such as STOP-ERA and
                         Eagle Forum).</p>
                    <p>In the end, as Rymph relates, the conservative factions would prevail and
                         drive feminists away from the GOP. Rymph concludes that &quot;what was
                         required for women finally to become a force in the party was the context
                         of the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s (both on the left and the
                         right)&quot; (p. 249).</p>
                    <p>This book makes a contribution to understanding women&apos;s limited
                         roles within party politics before the &quot;second wave
                         feminism&quot; of the 1970s. It is a well-researched example of how
                         gender concerns can be integrated with political history. But it leaves one
                         hungry for a more encompassing explanation of how activist women- on both
                         the Right and the Left- increasingly operated outside of party
                         politics.</p>
                    <p>Increasingly, the history of women&apos;s grassroots activism, as it has
                         been treated in books like Donald Critchlow&apos;s <hi rend="i">Phyllis

                         activism, religious beliefs, and social issues affected women&apos;s
                         activism in politics than does Rymph&apos;s complex study of the
                         internal dimensions of women&apos;s politics in the GOP. That does not
                         make her study any less important. But <hi rend="i">Republican Women</hi>
                         is limited in what it sets out to examine and, in the end, unsatisfying in

                         interrelated themes of change, community, and memory. Specifically,
                         Archibald meditates on the ways in which <placeName>

                         together.</p>
                    <p>Archibald begins the book with a discussion of the importance of place in
                         human life. He explores how narratives embedded in place give meaning to
                         artifacts, creating communal history as well as establishing a connection
                         between localities and their museums. In fact, one of the best features of
                         the text is the evocation of spaces from Archibald&apos;s own past-

                         argument for stewardship of the land as part of historic preservation.</p>
                    <p>The lush, oral quality of Archibald&apos;s descriptions reminds readers
                         that the book began as disparate lectures, which, unfortunately, is the
                         source of the book&apos;s greatest weaknesses as well. There is nothing
                         particularly original about Archibald&apos;s argument that development
                         is ruining the land and breaking up communities; similarly, his insistence
                         that progress is not necessarily good is trite. Despite editing, the
                         chapters repeat each other. References to the Luddites recur, as do such
                         pat phrases as &quot;a burden and a legacy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Archibald&apos;s chapter on diversity, &quot;Sharing the
                         Story,&quot; stands out for bringing into the text an understanding of

                         </placeName> history functions as an intersection for the narratives of
                         privileged whites, such as Thomas Jefferson, and the experiences of
                         minorities, such as the African Americans who used the city&apos;s
                         segregated, public Homer G. Phillips Hospital. Archibald&apos;s
                         strategies for diversifying the Missouri Historical Society, also
                         documented in this chapter, create a model for other institutions to follow
                         in their creation of a place where all community voices might be heard, or
                         a &quot;new town square.&quot; However, this chapter in some ways
                         contradicts Archibald&apos;s repeated emphasis on the commonality of
                         human experience as a necessity in building communities and preserving
                         public history. Archibald stresses these commonalities even as he decries
                         the homogenization of American life. This emphasis is further problematic
                         because it overlooks the fact that, throughout American history, a reliance
                         on shared aspects of culture has led to the valuing of dominant beliefs and
                         practices over the discordant or different. For instance, he criticizes the

                         buildings, without noting that the denizens of some of the tenements he
                         romanticizes lived in unhealthy conditions.</p>

                    <p>An assemblage of North
                              America&apos;s best railroad historians has produced an
                         exceptionally fine reference source on the industry they (and millions
                         around the world) love. The encyclopedia includes more than one thousand
                         pages of alphabetical entries on railroad companies, railroad executives,
                         railroad technology and engineering, construction, management, labor,
                         operations, locomotives and cars, railroad builders and suppliers, railroad
                         business practices, railroad regulation and political economy, and more.
                         Entries on railroad signaling and operations are extensive enough to show a
                         complete novice how it all works. The emphasis on North America allows
                         for extensive entries on <placeName>

                              Central America and the
                              Caribbean, although the encyclopedia is primarily <placeName>

                         </placeName>-oriented.</p>
                    <p>Among the entries are a number of unexpected but fascinating items- for
                         example, those focused on agricultural development, argot (slang),
                         architecture, and art - and that is just the letter A. There are entries on
                         the circus, cinema, even opera - the latter including a wonderful picture
                         of diva Mary Garden and the entire Metropolitan Opera entourage high in the
                              <geogName key="tgn_7024618" reg="Bitterroot Range">Bitterroot

                         the West Coast. There is an entry on Alexander Hamilton, who died long
                         before the railroad was invented but whose policies laid the foundation of
                         the great national economy that the railroad would eventually make
                         possible. There are entries on women, sports, health, even the fish cars
                         that were used to stock distant water- <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-104-1-122"
                         />sheds. So much information is packed in each of these entries that the
                         extensive index is indispensable.</p>
                    <p>One of the best features is a series of introductory essays - one on railroad
                         development, one on the social impact of the railroad (the many ways it
                         touched the lives of people), two on technology, and one on the
                         transformation of the railroad since 1970. These essays give a thoughtful
                         overview of matters that many who care about trains often know little
                         about.</p>
                    <p>This work is not only packed with information, but it is just plain fun to
                         flip from entry to entry, letting your curiosity wander. It is a must for
                         anyone with a mature interest in railroads. It is also an excellent point
                         of entry for anyone developing an interest in railroads (starting at about
                         age 12).</p>
                    <p>Problems are trumped by the book&apos;s great strengths. There is not
                         nearly enough on the economics of railroads - what the companies and their
                         workers actually did for a living. The maps are weak, not because they are
                         bad maps but because they are placed in a single appendix at the back of
                         the book. Telling a railroad story requires a map specific to the details
                         under discussion in front of the reader. Statistics are weak - like the
                         maps, they are grouped in a single appendix. They are minimal and break
                         nothing down by individual railroad. Some entries seem not to have grasped
                         the changes that have transformed the industry in the last thirty years.
                         For example, an entry on marketing talks only about the promotion of
                         passenger trains through the 1950s. Today the concept of marketing is a
                         tool to sell freight service that includes a precise knowledge of costs, so
                         that a railroad knows exactly how low it can bid on particular kinds of
                         traffic and still make money. There is duplication. For example, an entry
                         on Canadian railroad development plows much the same territory as the
                         entries on the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railways that precede
                         it. There are disturbing omissions. For example, on the list of significant
                         railroad accidents, the wreck of the <hi rend="i">Broker</hi> in 1951 is
                         not included, even though the Pennsylvania Railroad was indicted on
                         eighty-three counts of manslaughter in <placeName>
                              <region type="state" key="tgn_7007565" reg="New Jersey">New

                         </placeName> and a national spotlight was thrown on the enveloping problems
                         of what was then the nation&apos;s premier carrier.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, this volume is a must investment and an important addition to
                         any railroad library.</p>

                                             developments is marred by a significant error on page

                                             greater emphasis on research instead of classroom

                                             intellectual atmosphere at many universities
                                             manifesting itself in university curriculum. Such

                                             Anglo-Saxon males in cultural and political development
                                             and seeks to portray women and others who are not of
