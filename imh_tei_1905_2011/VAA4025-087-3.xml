            <p>Abraham Lincoln, in an autobiographical statement written for John L. Scripps in June, 1860,
                    discussed the Lincoln family's move from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to Indiana in 1816. Lincoln wrote, "This removal was partly on account of
                    slavery; but chiefly on account of the difficulty in land titles in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    many of his neighbors, because of the antiquated system of metes and bounds surveying and the
                    resultant confusion in recording land entries.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> In Indiana, where the land was
                    owned by the federal government and was surveyed into rectangular townships before sale, there was
                    promise of a clear land title.</p>
            <p>As important as land transactions are to the Lincoln story in Indiana, such transactions have never
                    been fully investigated and explained. In his 1928 biography of Abraham Lincoln, Albert J. Beveridge
                    refers to Thomas Lincoln's land dealings only in a lengthy footnote, in which he
                    misinterprets some of his findings.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Francis M. Van Natter in his 1963 work on

                    vague understanding of a topic significant not only to the Lincoln story but also to the settlement
                    of Indiana. A careful examination of the primary sources on the Lincoln land transactions reveals
                    the relationship between an early nineteenth-century frontiersman and the federal government. Thomas
                    Lincoln emerges not as the indolent, ne'er-do-well backwoodsman who was easily victimized
                    by the legal system but as a typical Hoosier pioneer who used the land laws of the country to his
                    advantage and who was involved in some complicated maneuvering to acquire the land he sought.</p>
            <p>The Land Ordinance of 1785 was the initial legislation that assured Indiana pioneers such as Lincoln
                    a clear title to their land. The ordinance provided for the survey of government land into townships
                    six miles square before it was offered for sale. David Sanford and Arthur Henrie had surveyed the
                    land that Lincoln would claim in Indiana—Section 32 in Township 4 South of Range 5
                    West—in 1805. Sanford in his field notes had observed of Section 32: "Land
                    level, oak and hickory, medium growth is hazel and other brush very thick. The timber on this mile
                    is chiefly destroyed by fire."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Lincoln purchased his land under
                    provisions of the Land Act of 1800, which provided for a minimum sale of 320 acres for
                    $2.00 per acre. The purchaser was to pay one-twentieth down, onefourth in forty days,
                    another fourth in two years, another in three, and the last in four years from the date of sale. A
                    year of grace was allowed after the last payment was due before forfeiture would result. The
                    interest charge was 6 percent. In 1804 Congress reduced the minimum purchase amount to 160 acres and
                    created several new land offices in the Old Northwest, including one at <placeName>

                    26, 1817, Lincoln paid an additional $64.00 to make his total $80.00. He

            <p>Lincoln, like hundreds of pioneers, had taken advantage of a credit system that promised a clear land
                    title at a future date. Although without doubt this system contributed to the rapid settlement of
                    the West, it was obvious from the beginning that many settlers would not be able to meet their
                    obligations. The government granted relief to some debtors by extending the time of forfeitures, but
                    defaults on land payments became so numerous after the Panic of 1819 that the problem could no
                    longer be ignored. On April 24, 1820, Congress mandated a sweeping change in the method of
                    government land sales. After July 1, 1820, settlers could purchase tracts as small as eighty acres
                    for a minimum price of $1.25 per acre, payable in <hi rend="i">cash only.</hi>
               <hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Land Act of 1820 did nothing, however, for people like Lincoln, who had not made any additional
                    payments on his land since December, 1817. The observations of James Hall in 1838 illustrate the
                    typicality of Lincoln's situation. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The whole population trembled upon the brink of ruin; and had the federal government proved a
                            rigid creditor, this extensive and beautiful country must have presented a vast scene of
                            desolation. The purchasers of land had become settlers; they had built houses and opened
                            fields upon the soil, the legal title to which remained in the government. A few could have
                            saved their homes by the disposal of other property; the many could not purchase the roof
                            that sheltered them, at any sacrifice which they might have been willing, or perhaps able,
                            to make. Yet it is not to be inferred that the people were destitute, or desperately poor;
                            far from it—they were substantial farmers, surrounded with all the means of
                            comfort and happiness—except money. To have driven such a people to extremity,
                            would have been ungenerous and fatally unwise; for now that the crisis has passed, we may
                            say without offence [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] or danger, that there is no calculating the
                            extent of the private misery, and the public convulsion, which such a policy would

                    1821, with "An Act for the relief of the purchasers of public lands prior to the first day
                    of July, eighteen hundred and twenty." Section one of the law allowed the purchaser to
                    relinquish land on which the whole purchase price had not been paid; all sums paid on account of the
                    land relinquished would be applied to complete the payment on one or more half-quarter sections of
                    land being maintained by the debtor. Section two remitted the interest on public land debts accrued
                    before September 30, 1821. Section three divided the debtors into three classes determined by the
                    percentage of the debt that remained. The first class consisted of those who had paid only
                    one-fourth of the debt and granted them eight additional years to complete payment. Those in the
                    second class had paid one-half the debt and would have six additional years to pay, while the third
                    class had paid three-fourths of the debt and would have four additional years. All the debts would
                    bear an equal annual interest of 6 percent. The act also provided a 37<hi rend="sup">1/2</hi>
                    percent reduction to any debtor who paid in full prior to September 30, 1822.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be eligible to benefit from the relief act the debtor had to file his written consent to it before
                    September 30, 1821. Lincoln made a trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to do so on September 12. He evidently did not have the cash to take advantage of the
                    discount provision of the law. Also, he had not built up enough equity to relinquish some land in
                    payment for another portion. The only option available, therefore, was to apply for further credit
                    in class one. This Lincoln did on <placeName>

                    "Thomas Lincorn," but the signature was "Thomas Lincoln." Added
                    under Lincoln's name, in a different handwriting, is "alias Linkern."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> At this point Lincoln owed three-fourths of the original $320.00
                    debt, or $240.00. As a class one debtor he would have eight additional years in which to
                    discharge his obligation. The eight equal installments would start on March 31, 1822, and successive
                    payments would be due every March 31 until paid. Lincoln's annual payment would be
                    $30.00.</p>
            <p>On December 3, 1820, individuals who had claimed public land on credit owed the <placeName>

                    cut this amount to $10,544,454.16. While this was a significant reduction, the debt was
                    still excessive. As a result, on February 18, 1824, Congress passed a law allowing debtors who had
                    applied for further credit to relinquish land by April 10, 1825. By June 30, 1825, the debt had

            <p>The settlers did derive one advantage from staying in debt: they could avoid payment of state and
                    local property taxes. From the beginning of the credit system questions had arisen about levying
                    such taxes on property being purchased from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government on credit. The title to the property remained with the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> until the land was completely paid for and a patent was issued. If a state taxed the
                    property and the person buying the property refused to pay, the state had no recourse since it could
                    not seize federal property and sell it for back taxes. The states, however, were expected to provide
                    services to these citizens who were not paying taxes. As a result the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> agreed to grant to the states a small percentage of the revenue generated from land
                    sales. According to the Enabling Act of 1816, Indiana received 5 percent of the receipts from the
                    sale of public lands. The state was to use three-fifths of the receipts to build roads and canals
                    within the state while the remaining two-fifths was to be expended under the direction of Congress
                    on internal improvements to and through the state.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>By the spring of 1827 Lincoln had not paid any additional money on his land debt. It can be assumed
                    that he had paid no property taxes on the land either. The situation changed as he took advantage of
                    the relief law of 1826. As noted, the Lincoln obligation was originally set at $320.00
                    for a quarter section of land, or 160 acres. In 1817 he had paid a total of $80.00,
                    leaving a balance of $240.00. On April 30, 1827, Lincoln traveled to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to conduct his most complicated transaction. At this time he relinquished the east 80
                    acres of his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName> land (E1/2, SW1/4, Sec. 32, T4S, R5W) and was given credit in the amount of
                    $160.00. This action simply canceled his purchase of this portion of his land, and his
                    debt was lowered to $80.00. Lincoln also relinquished 80 acres of land that he had
                    acquired in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Posey County</region>

                    this land, which paid in full the remaining 80 acres of <placeName>

                    </placeName> land (W1/2, SW1/4, Sec. 32, T4S, R5W). On this document it appears that Lincoln signed

                    owed $240.51. On February 2, 1820, he assigned this land to the heirs of Memorial
                    Forrest. The heirs—Matilda, Melton, Sally, Levicey, and Thomas—relinquished
                    the east half of the quarter on September 17, 1821. This lowered the debt to $160.34. The
                    heirs applied for further credit on September 29, 1821. On April 25, 1822, Matilda married James
                    McCrery in a ceremony performed by James Martin. By 1826 the court had appointed McCrery guardian
                    for all of the other heirs. On April 2, 1827, a special <placeName>

                    heirs' remaining property. Three days later, on April 5, McCrery assigned to Lincoln or
                    Linkern, for "valuable consideration," the W1/2, NW1/4 of Sec. 3, T5S, R12W.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> With this acquisition Lincoln obtained a credit of $80.17 paid on
                    the land and a debt of $80.17 owed on it. He then relinquished the land on April 30,

                    and left a credit of $80.17. He then applied an $80.00 credit to the debt on

            <p>One additional piece of property in Thomas Lincoln's Indiana land
                    transactions—the SE1/4 of Sec. 31, T4S, R5W—must be examined. This land
                    bordered the western boundary of the Lincoln farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer County</region>
                    </placeName>. Louis A. Warren appears to have been the first to identify Lincoln's
                    connection with this property. In March, 1937, referring to William H. Herndon's efforts to
                    trace Lincoln's Indiana land dealings, Warren wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In tracing this property from Thomas Lincoln, the original patentee, down to the division of
                            the section into town lots by Lewis, one fact discovered by the editor of Lincoln Lore
                            [Warren] many years ago, which had not been generally known, was brought to light. Thomas
                            Lincoln owned twenty acres of land in section 31 adjacent to his eighty acres, giving him a
                            full hundred acres apparently free of debt. This twenty acres sold to Thomas Lincoln, was
                            patented May 9, 1817, by David Casebier. There is some evidence that when Lincoln moved to <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                            </placeName>, he traded a few acres of land to John Romine for a horse and this may be this
                            land. On March 11, 1834, James Gentry sold to Joseph Gentry, the southeast quarter of
                            section 31 and the deed states "there being twenty acres of the said last quarter
                            section of land sold by David Casebier to Lincoln."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> The actual wording of the deed is: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            one hundred and forty acres inland it being the west part of the south east quarter of
                            section thirty one, there being twenty acres of the said last quarter section of land sold

                    the 20-acre Lincoln portion. National Park Service Historian Edwin C. Bearss found in a deed from
                    James Gentry to Edley Brown dated 1836 what is, no doubt, the description of the property. It

            <p>The only documentation found to support Lincoln's ownership of the twenty acres in section
                    31 is the one reference in the 1834 Gentry deed. It seems strange that a man who knew from past
                    experience the importance of accurate land records would not have recorded this transaction, yet no
                    other extant documents relative either to buying or selling the land connect Lincoln to this
                    property. The government tract book, located in the Bureau of Land Management, provides the history
                    of the land prior to 1834. On May 9, 1817, David Casebier claimed the quarter section and paid the
                    requisite $16.00. On May 23, 1817, he paid an additional $64.00, which
                    completed his first payment of $80.00 and left a balance of $240.00. On April
                    20, 1819, $80.00 was credited to the balance ($79.66 in cash and
                    34¢ in cash discount), and on June 11 of the same year a further $160.00 was
                    credited ($141.94 in cash and $18.06 cash discount). This completed the
                    payment, and Final Certificate No. 1462 was prepared on June 11, 1819; however, James Gentry is
                    listed as the assignee of David Casebier, and the patent was issued to Gentry on April 14, 1820.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Apparently sometime between 1817 and 1819 Casebier assigned his interest in
                    the land to Gentry; thus, Casebier never officially owned the twenty acres in question and could not
                    legally have sold it to Lincoln. Lincoln's connection with this Casebier/Gentry property
                    is, therefore, a matter of speculation. While it seems clear that Lincoln had no legal ownership of
                    the land, he obviously had some kind of claim, for Gentry used it as a means of description for the
                    parcel four years after Lincoln left Indiana. There is a good possibility that Casebier agreed
                    informally that Lincoln could use the land, especially the spring thereon, and that Gentry continued
                    unofficially to recognize that agreement. Warren's story that John Romine traded a horse
                    for some land cannot be documented. It is not impossible that this entered into the informal
                    agreement, however, since Romine was the son-in-law of James Gentry.</p>

            <p>Thomas Lincoln had come to Indiana with the expectation of getting a clear title to land that he
                    could retain without fear of loss. This he did, and his land transactions in the Hoosier state
                    typify those of many of his contemporaries and serve to illustrate the often complex relationship
                    between frontier settlers and the national government. Neither indolent nor ignorant, Lincoln, like
                    his neighbors, kept informed on the latest land legislation and made the difficult journey to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Land Office to take advantage of it. In fact, the number of times that Congress amended
                    the land laws to accommodate those like Lincoln who were unable to comply with their obligations
                    perhaps best suggests how typical he really was. The federal land records further indicate that
                    Lincoln's actions were representative. Thirty-two parcels of land were relinquished in
                    Lincoln's township (T4S, R5W) as a result of the relief laws of the 1820s. Eleven occurred
                    in 1821, five in 1825, twelve in 1827, and four in 1829.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Of the thirty-three
                    parcels of land in the township still claimed after the relinquishments in 1825, eighteen were paid

                    meet the economic challenges of the frontier and to deal successfully with the federal government.</p>

            <p>Indiana's population in 1850 included distinctive and significant ethnic and racial
                    minorities. The state's foreign-born and black Hoosiers, however, have not been as

                    local concentrations of ethnic and racial minorities, particularly those with unusual or unique
                    characteristics, such as the French at <placeName>

            <p>The published census report for 1850 clearly reveals one factor that distinguished Indiana from its
                    neighbors in the Old Northwest: its small foreign population. In 1850 approximately 55,000
                    foreign-born inhabitants in the Hoosier state comprised less than 6 percent of the total population

                            inhabitants to identify the state or foreign nation of their birth. Following the 1850 and
                            1860 censuses the published census reports provided statewide nativity data based on this
                            information. No nativity data for counties were published until after the 1870 census, and
                            then only a few of the most frequently named states and countries of origin were listed.
                            Data for this paper were collected by hand tallies of nativity origins as listed in the 1850
                            manuscript census schedules. Public access to these original census schedules has been
                            granted for extant materials through the 1910 census, and microfilms of the census
                            manuscripts are available in many public, academic, and historical or genealogical
                            libraries. They also can be purchased from the federal government. For information

                            (those inhabitants not born in the state in question) in a state or county, rather than the
                            foreign-born proportion of the entire population, yields a standardized measure for
                            comparative purposes. Because the percentage of each state's or county's
                            population native to that location varied primarily with the date of settlement (giving
                            older states or counties higher native proportions), calculations that retain the native

                    advertised and that potential settlers were going elsewhere. In 1837, for example, businessman and
                    land speculator Henry L. Ellsworth wrote: "Very little is yet known of the valley of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName>…." Five thousand persons left Buffalo in one day to go up the lake,

                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName>." Similarly, Governor Joseph A. Wright claimed in 1851, "There is
                    less known abroad, this day, of Indiana, in her great elements of wealth, than any other State in
                    the Union of her age and position."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Indiana may also have failed to
                    attract larger numbers of settlers because much land in the Hoosier state was opened to white
                    settlement just shortly after land in <placeName>

                    </placeName> was also made available for sale. In fact, Indians ceded the southern and central
                    two-thirds of Indiana during the same years that the federal government acquired title to all land
                    in <placeName>

                    "settlements commenced about 12 or 14 years ago, and have made considerable progress,

                    the unhealthful reputation of wet lands delayed settlement despite excellent agricultural potential
                    and the salesmanship of some land speculators whose involvement likely raised land costs.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Thus, when foreign-born immigrants began arriving in the <placeName>

                    state, a view perhaps in part reflecting its heavily southern population, its strong nativist
                    sentiments, and its uniquely "Hoosier" character.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

                    </placeName> (only natives of Indiana surpassed their number). Since Germans accounted for over half
                    the foreign-born in Indiana in 1850, it is not surprising that counties in which Germans exceeded
                    the statewide average and counties in which foreigners exceeded the statewide average were
                    distributed similarly (Figure 2-A). All but four of the counties having Germans in excess of the
                    statewide mean were located in southeastern and southwestern Indiana. As was true of the
                    foreign-born population as a whole, counties with river, canal, lake, or road access and with urban
                    centers tended to be the most German (there were important communities in <placeName>

                    the state also divided Germans from Prussians, but, unexpectedly, census canvassers in forty-eight

                    from each of the five most often identified principalities as revealed in the manuscript schedules.
                    The table must be viewed as a count from a limited record rather than as a definitive total (those
                    immigrants simply identified as Germans came from one or another of the principalities; thus, the
                    total given for each subdivision underrepresents the actual number from it); nevertheless, the
                    figures are informative. Among the German principalities listed in the 1850 manuscript census
                    schedules, Prussia provided the largest number of settlers (782) to Indiana, and Prussian immigrants
                    accounted for high proportions of the German total in <placeName>

                    Further, as was the case with the German immigrants, this partial sample may not accurately
                    represent the actual balance among Canadian provincial birthplaces. However, since different

                    outnumbered natives of other provinces, although those simply identified as Canadians typically were
                    largest in number (Table 2). No real pattern of Upper Canadian- versus Lower Canadian-dominated
                    counties emerged. For example, none of the three counties that contained early French-Canadian
                    settlements—Allen, Knox, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>

                    In keeping with the general distribution of British Americans, however, counties with more Upper
                    Canadian settlers and those with more Lower Canadians were both concentrated in the northern part of

                    state's in-migrants; and most counties with Scottish natives exceeding the statewide mean
                    were located in southeastern Indiana, where the highest nativity percentages were found in Jefferson

                    undoubtedly underrepresent the county's Swiss ethnicity. While many of the first Swiss
                    pioneers had arrived between 1800 and 1810 and likely were deceased by 1850, their Hoosier-born
                    children probably retained at least some of the old country's culture. Natives of <placeName>

                    percent) that the presence of just a couple of Welsh settlers could push a county above the
                    statewide mean. The Welsh, too, tended to concentrate in southeastern Indiana, especially close to
                    the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. One county, Jennings, had 33 Welsh natives, and only one other,

                    state's comparatively greater number of black inhabitants in 1850: Indiana was officially a
                    free state, it was close to and accessible from the South, and it had many Quakers.</p>
            <p>Although Article VI of the Ordinance of 1787, which provided the basis for governing and developing
                    the territories and states of the Old Northwest, stated in part that "there shall be
                    neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory," scholars have pointed out
                    that this phrase did not immediately end slavery in the Northwest Territory and that it certainly
                    did not assure equal treatment for blacks, former slaves or not.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> In fact,
                    slaves were part of Indiana's population until after 1840. In 1800, 135 slaves formed 46.3
                    percent of the black population in Indiana Territory (which included all of the Old Northwest except <placeName>

                    in Indiana Territory (then coextensive with the state of Indiana); and in 1820, 190 slaves formed
                    13.4 percent of the black population in the new state of Indiana. Eventually, as slaves died, were
                    taken from the state, or were freed, and as challenges to slavery mounted, their number dwindled to
                    zero. By 1830 there were only 3 slaves in the state compared to 3,629 free blacks; in 1840 there
                    were still just 3 slaves but 7,165 free blacks. By 1850 the published census recorded no slaves in
                    the state.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The presence of slaves in Indiana of course violated the Northwest Ordinance's Article VI,
                    which was copied nearly verbatim into the state's Constitution of 1816. Before statehood a
                    number of leaders had asked the federal government to permit slavery in Indiana ostensibly at least
                    to provide workers for the labor-poor frontier and to attract southern slaveholders to the state.
                    Although the request was denied and although enslavement of free blacks did not occur in Indiana,
                    for many years various legal maneuvers and subterfuges maintained involuntary servitude or indenture
                    among slaves who were brought into the state. These local laws evolved into Indiana's
                    so-called "Black Code," which restricted the rights <list type="footnotes">

                    to support themselves, blacks were required to register with the clerk in the county where they
                    resided and to post a $500 surety bond. They could not vote, join the militia, testify in
                    court against whites, or send their children to public schools. Finally, in the ultimate

            <p>Despite the presence of slavery and involuntary servitude in Indiana during much of the pre-Civil War
                    era, Hoosiers' opinions about slavery and blacks were ambivalent and complex. Described
                    generally as "neither proslavery or antislavery but as anti-Negro," attitudes
                    differed across the state and among nativity or cultural groups.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Many Yankees
                    in northern Indiana and Quakers in the central and southern sections of the state overtly or
                    covertly opposed slavery or indenture, encouraged better treatment for blacks, and even helped
                    blacks settle nearby. Crucial to the status of blacks in Indiana, however, were the views of the
                    state's southern-born in-migrants, the largest nativity group originating outside the Old
                    Northwest. Southerners were the first settlers in most portions of the state, were the progenitors
                    of most Hoosier natives by 1850, and heavily influenced the state's social and political
                    climate. Most were upland southerners who had not been slaveholders but who had witnessed the
                    expansion of slavery from the lowland into the upland South. They had experienced the deleterious
                    impact of cheaper slave labor on the value and competitiveness of the products of their own free
                    labor and had migrated to Indiana in part to escape the economic effects of slavery. Although these
                    Hoosiers probably would not have supported the introduction of slavery into Indiana, which was
                    unlikely beyond those already enslaved, they also opposed an influx of free blacks who might devalue

            <p>Whatever its legal and social treatment of blacks in 1850, Indiana was a free state. This fact,
                    combined with its frontier status and its nearness to and accessibility from the South, made it a
                    relatively attractive destination for free blacks and fugitive slaves. Various land and water routes

                    state, as did other migrants, in search of inexpensive and fertile land. The unique relationship
                    that existed between southern Quakers and blacks provided yet another impetus for migration. By the
                    late 1700s many Friends in the South had found it impossible to reconcile their religious beliefs
                    with slaveholding and had freed their slaves. Many of the freed blacks lived among their former
                    masters, received financial or moral support from them, or had been helped by them to migrate to
                    free states. As the slavery system became more deeply entrenched in the South, Quakers found it
                    increasingly difficult to live as tacit abolitionists, to guarantee that their former slaves would
                    remain free, and to compete against slave labor. Many decided to migrate to the Old Northwest and
                    encouraged their black neighbors to accompany them. Here, it was hoped, they could all live
                    undisturbed. Whether or not the Quakers' decision to migrate resulted more from the slavery
                    issue than from the desire for inexpensive and fertile new land (the former would seem dominant for
                    free blacks), the link between Friends and blacks in Indiana is unmistakable.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

            <p>As indicated, the 11,296 blacks living in Indiana in 1850 accounted for 1.14 percent of the total
                    population. Counties with black population percentages in excess of the statewide mean were found
                    largely in three loose clusters in the southern half of the state (Figure 4-A). Located in east
                    central (including <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> counties) and in southeastern Indiana and along the southern half of the western
                    border, the clusters were all easily accessible from the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> or its
                    tributaries, an especially important factor for the mostly poor black settlers. Each cluster also
                    contained at least two major cities in 1850: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the southeastern, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the southwestern. Black migrants, whatever their economic or educational status,
                    could find work in urban centers where labor was typically in short supply. In fact, throughout
                    Indiana at mid-nineteenth century blacks were proportionally more common in urban than in rural
                    areas. In each of the six centers mentioned above, for example, the black percentage of the urban
                    population easily surpassed (and in half the cases was over twice) the black population percentage
                    in the balance of the county. There were a number of blacks, however, who lived in rural areas and
                    worked as farmers or laborers.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> Most counties in each cluster included <placeName>

                    </placeName> natives well in excess of the Indiana averages for those states, which were also the
                    dominant nativity sources for black in-migrants.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Each cluster of counties also
                    had at least some Quaker residents although most Friends settlements, which were often the focus of
                    concentrations of black farmers, were located in the east central area.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>Using the statistical mean as the basic indication of distribution in cases where the mean is low, as
                    it is with blacks in Indiana, obscures minor but significant variations from this value. Standard
                    deviations about the mean provide a more informative picture of black population percentages in
                    Indiana in 1850 (Figure 4-B). Fourteen counties had percentages of black settlers in excess of one
                    standard deviation above the mean (1.92 percent or greater), and each of the three clusters of black
                    population contained at least four such counties. Blacks comprised the largest percentage of the
                    population in <placeName>

            <p>As was true for the general population in Indiana in 1850, blacks born in the state comprised the
                    largest portion of the black population. The percentage of Hoosier-born blacks tended to be highest
                    in the southern part of the state, which had been settled the longest; however, only 39.8 percent of
                    the blacks in Indiana were natives of the state compared to 56.0 percent native-born Hoosiers among
                    the general population. The proportionally more rapid growth of the state's black
                    population due to migration between 1820 and 1850 resulted in a larger in-migrant percentage, and
                    therefore a lower Hoosier-born percentage, for blacks than for the general population.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Because the census canvassers' choices in the "Color" column on the
                    manuscript schedules were limited to "white, black or mulatto," blacks are the
                    only racial minority that can be accurately identified from the 1850 census.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Whether the 12 Asian natives counted in Indiana in 1850 were ethnically Asian or the 26 Latin
                    American natives were ethnically Hispanic is impossible to determine. Certainly the racial
                    minorities in Indiana at midcentury included Native Americans, but the exact numbers of Indians
                    cannot be discovered because no provision was made for separating them from the general population.
                    A count of individuals bearing traditional tribal names could, of course, be done, but such a
                    procedure would exclude from the tally Native Americans with English or French names. Unexpectedly,
                    however, the manuscript schedules of the 1850 census did yield some numerical and nativity data for
                    Native Americans. The census canvasser in two counties, Miami and <placeName>

                    surprising to discover that most Native Americans still in Indiana in 1850 had been born there;
                    given the dislocations and relocations that many of them had suffered, however, neither should it be
                    unexpected to find birthplaces outside the state.</p>
            <p>It is unlikely that there were only 99 Native Americans in Indiana in 1850, just as it is unlikely
                    that they all lived in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Miami</settlement>

                    </placeName> counties. A number of Indians were scattered throughout the state in 1830, when well
                    over fifty villages existed in the northern half of Indiana alone; but the remaining Native American
                    lands in the state, most of them in the form of reserves, were under heavy pressure. Most of the
                    influential Miami tribe, for example, had ceded their reservations and left the state by 1846;
                    nevertheless, the federal government recognized 302 Miami residents of Indiana as late as 1854.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> As part of the published 1850 census the commissioner of Indian Affairs
                    supplied an enumeration, dated November 10, 1853, of Indians by tribal groupings. Unfortunately,
                    these tribes were not divided by or assigned to states; therefore, the number actually residing in
                    Indiana cannot be determined precisely. According to the enumeration, in 1853 the total national
                    population of the four major tribes that had at least some members in Indiana included 7,000
                    Potawatomies (including Chippewas and Ottawas), 766 Miami and <geogName>Eel River</geogName>
                    Indians, 475 Kickapoos, and 151 Wea people. Certainly there were not 7,000 Potawatomi and related
                    tribespeople in Indiana in 1853, and it is also probably untrue that they were all
                    "formerly in Indiana, now in Indian Territory West" as a footnote to the
                    enumeration table suggests. Another footnote also claims that of the Miami and <geogName>Eel

                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> because of the Indians' general absence elsewhere, their assimilation by the
                    rest of society (although blacks and mulattoes were separately enumerated), a notion that their
                    numbers were too few to be significant, or an attitude that the Indians did not really matter. A
                    curious comment in the table enumerating the Indian population in 1853 suggests that the last two
                    factors may have been paramount: "showing the past and present location of the Indian
                    tribes" would be "very interesting," stated the superintendent of the
                    census, J. D. B. DeBow; but "they are not included in any of the Census enumerations,
                    except in a few individual cases, which cannot affect the general correctedness of the

            <p>One dominant factor emerges from a study of Indiana's racial and ethnic minorities in 1850:
                    more than any other state in the Old Northwest Indiana at mid-nineteenth century was populated by
                    white natives of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The Hoosier state, in fact, ranked far below all its neighbors in both numbers and
                    percentages of foreign-born in-migrants. <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in particular had far more ethnic diversity. Racial diversity, difficult to measure
                    accurately for groups other than blacks, was proportionally and numerically greater in Indiana than
                    in other states of the Old Northwest except for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>; nevertheless, blacks constituted only 1.14 percent of the Hoosier state's
                    total population in 1850. The statistical view at midcentury presaged future developments. The
                    Hoosier state in 1900 retained essentially the same position relative to other states in the Old
                    Northwest that it had held in 1850: it was the least ethnically diverse but included a comparatively
                    greater black population. By the end of the nineteenth century, despite increased urbanization and
                    industrialization, Indiana's population was only 5.6 percent foreign-born compared to 5.8
                    percent in 1850. <placeName>

            <p>James H. Kinley was a Union soldier in the Civil War for forty-seven months. He participated in two
                    major campaigns, several battles, and a number of skirmishes. According to his obituary in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <hi rend="i">Daily News-Times</hi> of February 17, 1919, he served two
                    enlistments, the first with "Co. E, 7th Missourians," the second with
                    "Co. A, 13th Indiana veterans." After the war he was a member of the Grand Army of
                    the Republic. Oddly enough, however, Kinley's name cannot be found on any army roster.</p>
            <p>When he was seventy-seven and I was five years old, James H. Kinley was my next-door neighbor and
                    good friend in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName>. I knew that he had been in the Civil War because he told me stories about pranks that
                    he and other soldiers had played during the conflict, but he said nothing about the battles depicted
                    in the pictures hanging on the Kinleys' front parlor wall. In one of the stories Mr. Kinley
                    related how some captured Yankees would torment their Confederate guards. One of the prisoners would
                    hold a silhouette cutout so that the light of the campfire would reflect a large black-and-white
                    portrait of Abraham Lincoln on the white wall of a nearby building. The guards would always respond
                    the way the prisoners hoped they would—yelling mad. The evening that Mr. Kinley told me
                    this story he demonstrated how the cutout worked using the glow from the coal stove in the living
                    room to reflect the portrait on the wall. He then gave a copy of the cutout to his entranced
                    listener. My mother tucked it away for safe keeping after writing on it, "Given to Mac by
                    our neighbor, Mr. Kinley, who had been a prisoner in Libby Prison during the Civil
                    War—this was made by a fellow prisoner."</p>
            <p>It was this cutout that had me reading Mr. Kinley's obituary seventy years after his death.

                    again brought back memories of the stories and that long-ago friendship. A Civil War buff, I decided
                    to learn about Mr. Kinley's military career and the cutout's relationship to it.
                    There in the obituary was the initial information that I needed—the identification of the
                    units in which Mr. Kinley had served. This is the story of my search, a search that did not reveal
                    what I presumed it would.</p>
            <p>The Indiana State Library had no record of a James H. Kinley's having served in Company A of

                    alias of James H. Beanton. The records for Company A accounted for Private James H. Beanton from the

            <p>Not until Mr. Kinley's pension packet arrived from the National Archives did the mystery of
                    his war service really begin to unfold. In his petition for an invalid pension, filed April 11,
                    1892, Mr. Kinley claimed service in both the 7th <placeName>

                    service pension and dated March 21, 1898, he explained the Beanton alias. Although James H. Kinley
                    was his proper name, Beanton, he said, was the name of the family who had raised him, thus the name
                    he was known by where he enlisted. Later, in a personal <list type="footnotes">

                    near Port Gibson, eight miles eastward from Bruinsburg. In the ensuing battle Logan's two
                    brigades helped turn the enemy's right flank, thus playing an important role in routing the

                    bridges across Bayou Pierre northwest of Port Gibson. The brigade discovered not only that the

                    in, "and a noisy firefight ensued between the Missourians in blue and those in

                    duel lasted until almost four o'clock. At that time Stevenson had his troops break off
                    firing and return to Port Gibson. The 7th Missourians must have dug in well as their only listed

                    gathering. Advancing on a three-column front, with McPherson's XVII Corps on the Federal
                    right, the army did not meet any serious opposition until May 12. The XVII Corps's
                    objective on that day was to occupy the town of Raymond. While the other two corps' only
                    trouble came at the end of the day's march and was slight, McPherson's XVII had an
                    almost all-day battle. As the XVII moved out in the predawn darkness, its cavalry screen soon met
                    fire from Rebel cavalry. As the morning advanced, the cavalry action became more intense. By nine
                    o'clock, the horsemen having more than they could handle, McPherson ordered the cavalry out
                    to the flanks. Two infantry regiments from Logan's 2nd Brigade were deployed as
                    skirmishers, and the corps again moved slowly ahead. Shortly before ten o'clock the
                    skirmish line was moving cautiously down a gently sloping open field when about one hundred yards
                    from a belt of timber along Fourteenmile Creek it was met by rifle fire followed by cannon fire from
                    a ridge about one thousand yards farther back. The skirmishers hit the ground, and the Battle of

                    Jackson.</p>
            <p>Sherman and McPherson had arranged to attack Jackson together on the morning of May 14. The
                    defenders, whose job was to delay the Union forces as long as possible to cover Johnston's
                    withdrawal, did their job well with the help of a torrential downpour. It was late afternoon before
                    Jackson was in Union hands. The all-morning rain began as the Union forces were approaching. It
                    rained so hard, in fact, that McPherson could not see what was happening; in addition he was afraid
                    to have the troops load their guns for fear of getting the cartridges so wet that they could not be
                    fired. When the rain stopped, McPherson discovered that Sherman was attacking and that the defenders
                    were in the process of withdrawing. He immediately ordered Brigadier General Marcel-lus M.
                    Crocker's brigade to attack. At the same time the 3rd Brigade was sent to cut off the
                    retreating Rebels, but it was too late or did not move quickly enough to do so. Except for this bit
                    of activity the brigade, including the 7th <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> and presumably Hall, had been held in reserve all day.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of the capture of Jackson, Grant learned that Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton,
                    commanding the Confederate troops at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had left the Vicksburg defenses to join forces with Johnston. Grant sent orders to
                    McClernand to move the XIII Corps at once, by the shortest route possible, to Bolton, a point some
                    twenty miles west of Jackson and the nearest place where Johnston and Pemberton could effect a
                    junction. McPherson and the XVII left the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>

                    position to move the next morning on Pemberton's forces a few miles away.</p>
            <p>On May 16 the opposing forces locked in battle at Champion's Hill where about four hours of
                    hard fighting had been preceded by over two hours of skirmishes, "some of which,"
                    says Grant, "rose almost to the dignity of battle." For the Union the encounter
                    was fought by three main divisions-McClernand's 12th commanded by Brigadier General Alvin
                    P. Hovey and McPherson's 3rd under Logan and 7th under Crocker. Grant points out that
                    "every man of Hovey's division and of McPherson's two divisions was
                    engaged during this battle".<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Although Grant's comment is

            <p>Early on the morning of May 22 artillery from the XVII Corps began pounding the area that was to be
                    attacked by the corps's 1st and 3rd brigades. The objective of Stevenson's 3rd
                    Brigade was a reinforced earthworks, called the Great Redoubt, that topped a steep sloping incline
                    near the center of the Vicksburg defenses. Taking advantage of the terrain to make a covered
                    approach, Stevenson assembled his men in a ravine two hundred yards southeast of the redoubt. He
                    organized his troops into assaulting columns with the 8th <placeName>

                    and loaded their weapons with orders not to fire them until reaching the Rebel works. The artillery
                    fire ceased, and at Stevenson's command the assaulting columns rushed forward and began to

                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, was immediately met by volley after volley from the defenders but did not falter. At a
                    ditch fronting the defense works Stevenson called on the left attacking column to form in support of
                    the right, at the same time ordering the 7th <placeName>

                    into their ranks, they carried out the maneuver. The enemy fire became so destructive that Stevenson
                    ordered his troops to take cover behind the ditch. As the infantry hit the ground, the Federal
                    artillery reopened fire, quickly silencing most of the Rebel pieces mounted on Great Redoubt. The
                    barrage lifted, and Stevenson immediately ordered his men forward. With loud cheers the attacking
                    column's two regiments sprang across the ditch only to have their ranks swept by canister
                    from two remaining Confederate guns. With a final desperate lunge the 7th <placeName>

                    works. Their cheers turned to curses as the Irishmen of the 7th discovered that their scaling

            <p>The results of the attacks on May 19 and May 22 convinced Grant to change his tactics from assault to
                    siege. From May 23 on, Union troops constantly fortified and pushed their positions nearer to the
                    enemy, in many cases close enough to talk and to exchange insults; the closest of them all was
                    Logan's 3rd Division. Hall must have had an almost inside view of the activity during the
                    siege; he quite probably had an active role. He may also have had a close view of the surrender on
                    July 4. According to Grant, "At the appointed hour the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of
                    their works and formed line in front, stacked arms and marched back in good order. Our whole army
                    present witnessed this scene without cheering. Logan's division, which had approached
                    nearest the rebel works, was the first to march in …."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> It
                    is possible, however, that Hall was not present at the surrender. July 4, 1863, was a very hot day

            </p>
            <p>On July 7, 1863, Hall was detailed to daily guard duty at McPherson's headquarters; he
                    remained on detached service at corps headquarters until placed on the Detachment Muster-out Roll in
                    March, 1864. Company E's muster roll lists only one sergeant and three privates as assigned
                    to detached service between July, 1863, and March, 1864. In fact, the rest of the 7th <placeName>

                    </placeName>, including Company E, participated in several skirmishes and suffered casualties during
                    this time. Hall, along with the other three-year veterans in the 7th who had not volunteered for
                    another enlistment, was mustered out of service in St. Louis, on June 14, 1864.</p>

            <p>Beanton had little time to get acquainted with his new outfit before Butler's Fort Fisher

                    which delayed any further action for several days and caused widespread seasickness that added to
                    the discomfort of those on the tightly packed troopships.</p>
            <p>On December 24 the navy vessels came into line in a near semicircle about one-half mile offshore from

                    a.m., and at noon about three thousand troops, mostly from the XXIV Corps, went ashore. By 4:00 p.m.
                    Yankee skirmishers had moved up to within about fifty yards of the fort as the fleet's guns

                    1,600 sailors, armed with cutlasses and pistols and supported by 400 marines with muskets, the
                    second on the northeast beach side by the army. With the sounding of the assault signal the sailors
                    rushed forward to be met from front and flank by canister and grape artillery fire. Then, as they
                    reached the slope of the fort, a withering infantry fire greeted them from the ramparts. A surviving
                    naval officer wrote: "The rush of the sailors was over … the enemy were crowding
                    the ramparts not forty yards away, and shooting into them as fast as they could fire. There was
                    nothing to reply with but <hi rend="i">pistols</hi>…. Flesh and blood could not long
                    endure being killed in this slaughter-pen, and the rear of the sailors broke, followed by the whole
                    body, in spite of all efforts to rally them."<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the sailors were being repulsed, the army was fighting its way into the fort. The 2nd
                    Division's 1st Brigade led off, immediately followed by the 2nd and 3rd brigades.
                    Lieutenant William Ketcham, Company I, 13th Indiana, in a letter home a few days after the capture
                    of Fort Fisher, described the 13th Indiana's advance on the fort: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Our brigade formed about a third of a mile from the fort ….</p>
                        <p>When the signal to charge was given we started in good order; but ditches, ponds and bushes
                            soon destroyed every sign of a line, and we rushed on pell mell, a regular mob. Nobody could
                            have kept line. When we got to the fort, I tried to form as many of my company as I could
                            find. I had just got ten files together, when Stepp's "Forward, Company
                            E!" sent them all ahead in a pile. I gave up all hope of keeping a line, and
                            directed my attention to getting the men up to the front.</p>
                        <p>… Toward us there was a palisade about fifteen feet high, made of logs stuck in
                            the ground. There was but one way of getting in, and that was across a bridge which led to
                            the gate. But the planks had been taken up …. The grape more than whistled as we

                    were gaining the upper hand, more Yankee regiments came pouring in as the navy reopened fire,
                    dropping shells into the fort ahead of the advancing Union men. The Confederate troops, outnumbered

                    campaign against the Confederates under Johnston. On April 8 Sherman wrote to Grant, "On

                    then put out surrender feelers. It was at Bennett's Farmhouse, about thirty miles beyond
                    Raleigh, that on April 18 Sherman and Johnston agreed to surrender terms. The 13th Indiana was among
                    the troops present on this occasion. Except for a few scattered actions the war was over.</p>
            <p>What did Beanton do after the fighting ended? According to the muster roll for Company A of the 13th
                    Indiana Infantry Regiment, from May through August, 1865, he was on detached service with the
                    provost guard at the headquarters of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, X Army Corps, serving mostly as

                    widow's pension, I know a great deal more about his war record than when the search began.
                    I know where and when he twice volunteered for army service under names other than his own, the
                    regiments with which he served, his length of service in each, and where and when he was mustered

                    the fall of Fort Fisher, and that he was in several skirmishes and battles but was never wounded or
                    captured. He may well have been present at the surrender of Vicksburg and at Johnston's
                    surrender to Sherman at Bennett's Farmhouse. His detached service records would indicate
                    that his officers considered him a dependable soldier: "goof-offs" do not get the
                    assignments that he had nor do soldiers who disappear when the shooting starts.</p>
            <p>But what of the silhouette cutout of Abraham Lincoln that Mr. Kinley gave his little friend some
                    seventy years ago? Mr. Kinley was never a prisoner at Libby. Approximately fifty years after the
                    Civil War, however, the cutout was one of his keepsakes, and he shared it with a little boy. I
                    prefer to believe the story about how it was used by the prisoners and to assume that the
                    boy's mother misunderstood Mr. Kinley's possession of it. The mystery of the
                    silhouette merely adds to the enigma of a young Hoosier who served almost four years in the Union
                    Army as a volunteer from two different states and under two different names, neither of them his

                    circumstances in which to grow up. Both in their own way can distort one's sense of values
                    and attitudes toward other people. Lilly, one might say, met the challenge brilliantly, making the
                    most of the money and position he inherited to transform Eli Lilly and Company into a major
                    pharmaceutical manufacturer, to turn the Lilly Endowment into an exemplary philanthropic
                    organization, to school himself in middle age in a demanding scholarly discipline, and to take the
                    lead in supporting important community organizations in <placeName>

            <p>The key to understanding Eli Lilly's life is the good fortune he had in warm and supportive
                    family relationships, especially with his father and an aunt, Margaret Ridgely, who lived with the
                    family. He was unusually close to his father, Josiah K. Lilly, Sr., who throughout Eli's
                    life encouraged and supported him. His unmarried aunt showered him with attention and affection.
                    Equally important was Lilly's clear identification with place: <placeName>

            <p>Lilly was also endowed with a keen mind and a great intellectual curiosity, and he
                    developed—at least by young adulthood—a generous spirit. Generosity and
                    intellect, time and again, led this self-described conservative businessman to prove himself an
                    innovator in his company's business and later in his philanthropy.</p>
            <p>Eli Lilly's grandfather—colonel Eli Lilly—had founded the family firm
                    in 1876. By the time Eli was born in 1885, the firm was a solid and respected manufacturer of the
                    raw materials used in pharmaceuticals. Both his grandfather (who died in 1898) and his father
                    assumed that young Eli would some day join the company <list type="footnotes">

            <p>His father assigned him the task of making the company more efficient. Exhibiting a quality that
                    marked many of his later activities, Lilly reached beyond established company practices. He applied
                    the teachings of several proponents of "scientific management" to improve
                    operations. The young Lilly succeeded in improving output, although he apparently took himself too
                    seriously at the time and alienated some employees.</p>
            <p>In the 1920s Lilly again exhibited an innovative spirit. He forged ties with university scientists
                    whose research he thought could be applied to pharmaceutical manufacturing. He cultivated the
                    Canadian scientists who developed insulin, eventually gaining the rights to manufacture the
                    revolutionary product. Profits and prestige followed the successful use of the new drug in treating
                    diabetes. In the early 1930s Lilly expanded the company's own research effort with the
                    opening of perhaps the most advanced industrial <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-087-3-077"/> laboratory for
                    pharmaceutical research in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. The commitment in the 1920s to sustained research was an important departure, which
                    allowed the company to respond well to changing markets and advances in science. In short, Lilly
                    oversaw the transformation of what he called the "pill factory" into a modern
                    pharmaceutical operation.</p>
            <p>Triumphs in business were, alas, not matched by a happy personal life. In 1907 Lilly married Evelyn
                    Fortune, a high school sweetheart. Before 1920 they had buried two infant sons. Such tragedies can
                    either pull a couple closer together or further apart. The latter was the case for the Lillys, and
                    they divorced in 1926. His only surviving child, a daughter Evie, went to live with her mother who
                    had moved to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. While Eli did his best over the years to exert a positive influence on Evie, she
                    became an unhappy adult. Her troubled life proved a source of great sadness for Eli. These
                    disappointments were bearable, however, because of his marriage in 1927 to Ruth Allison. The union
                    proved a long one (she died in 1973), marked by great affection and closeness.</p>
            <p>By 1930 the forty-five-year-old Lilly began a serious reexami-nation of his life. After a period of
                    introspection he determined to enlarge his activities outside the business. In future years he
                    developed a passionate commitment to archaeology, an interest first stimulated by reading about the
                    Indians who had once inhabited the area around Lake Wawasee. His initial curiosity led to a
                    full-scale, serious study of the prehistory of Indiana. He made the acquaintance of professional
                    scholars in the field, helped finance archaeological research, and even published serious papers on
                    the subject.</p>
            <p>Most people in middle age slow down. Lilly became more energetic and active. He continued to
                    discharge his duties at the company, but he also took a lead in organizing the Lilly Endowment in
                    1937. He devoted himself to detailed reviews of potential projects. Similarly, he took an active
                    role in the life of his city and state, in Christ Church, the Indiana Historical Society, Indiana
                    University, <placeName>

            <p>By the 1960s Lilly increasingly worried about the permissive direction of American life, especially
                    the breakdown of community and family. He supported Barry Goldwater in 1964, and by the 1970s Lilly
                    and, especially, his wife came to support causes that were criticized as being extremely right wing.
                    Even so, Lilly never bought into a hard-hearted conservatism that blamed the poor for their plight,
                    thus allowing the well-off to ignore social problems. He continued to encourage the Lilly
                    Endowment's research into education and children's health issues. On balance,
                    Lilly was a progressive, a conservative one to be sure, but a man who believed in <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-087-3-078"/> the importance of family and community and in doing what he could to
                    support both.</p>

            <p>Jones's photography is distinctive in several ways. First, he has a highly individualistic
                    sense of light that takes special advantage of early morning and late evening to create unexpected
                    effects of color, tone, and shadow. Second, he appreciates the particular qualities of the Hoosier
                    climate, making clever, unexpected use of weather and cloud patterns. Third, he obviously enjoys
                    historical photography, from skyline panoramas to sepia tones, and creatively simulates many of
                    their effects. Each of these characteristics is represented, with high production quality, in this
                    book. The sense of light is clearest in sporting scenes and in sunset views of the newly redeveloped <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> skyline. His weather and climate photographs are most effective in presenting familiar
                    suburban locations. And his historical interests are clear in his portrayal of the city's
                    threatened architectural heritage.</p>
            <p>Jones also knows the special interests of Hoosiers, from festivals and games to children's
                    events, and he handles them well. Apart from a lack of portraiture, he captures the places and
                    events that visually document the case for the resurgence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a major city. Not every experiment is a success, witness some of his sepia effects,
                    but the range of experiments is considerable.</p>
            <p>Howard Caldwell, a prominent local media figure, compliments Jones's photographs with an
                    introductory text. Caldwell mixes autobiography, history, architectural reference points, idiom, and
                    contemporary commentary to explore the particular mix of nostalgia, enterprise, and boosterism that
                    Jones illustrates so well.</p>

                    militia, but in only one location did the home guards stand up to the raiders in a head-to-head
                    battle—in Corydon, Indiana, on July 9, 1863. Drawn up in battle line behind a barricade
                    of logs and fence rails and outnumbered more than four to one, the farmers and merchants fought for
                    thirty minutes, killing 8, and wounding 33. They delayed Morgan's advance and contributed

                    the Hoosier state.</p>
            <p>An eyewitness account of one of the home guards at Mauck-port indicates that none of them knew how to
                    aim their six-pound cannon. With an experienced gunner they might have shelled the boilers of the
                    two steamboats Morgan used to ferry his men across the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. Conway
                    declares Morgan's capture of the steamboats and the successful crossing "one of
                    the slickest <hi rend="i">coup de theatres</hi> of the Civil War" (p. 58). The memoir of J.
                    Edward Murr on the Battle of Corydon relates an unconfirmed anecdote of a miller who heard that
                    Morgan would burn his grist mill unless he paid a ransom of $1,000. Rushing to
                    Morgan's headquarters at the Kintner House, he handed the general a roll of greenbacks.
                    According to Murr, Morgan counted the money, and it came to $1,200. Handing back
                    $200, with a twinkle in his eyes, the general said, "Do you think I'd
                    be guilty of cheating a man out of a cent" (p. 80).</p>
            <p>The book has many interesting illustrations, and it is well organized, well written, and concise.
                    There are five valuable Civil War maps but none on the battle itself. Scholars will be frustrated
                    with the lack of documentation; nevertheless, Conway provides a lively, colorful book that
                    contributes to the historiography of the Civil War and will appeal to general readers.</p>

                    considered stating the obvious" (p. xi).</p>
            <p>The book recalls "The Year Without a Summer" (1816, coinci-dentally the year of
                    Indiana statehood) and the "Lake Manitou Monster," which Cavinder pairs with
                    artist George Winter's drawing. Also interesting is the author's statement that a
                    Hoosier from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>—not Horace Greeley—first said, "Go west, young
                    man!" The Civil War and skirmish-filled Hoosier political battlegrounds provide more rich
                    source material; <hi rend="i">i.e.,</hi> Boggstown's secession from the Union. Cavinder
                    also points out that there were five Civil War generals from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and that the state once had four governors in 105 days. Sports enthusiasts, too, will
                    find plenty to cheer, such as the weird tale of a 190-yard touchdown run in a high school football

                    no-smoking law imposed on Hoosiers between 1905 and 1909. Even the familiar Coca-Cola bottle, so

                    popcorn, are habit-forming. The book leaves you wanting more.</p>

            <p>This is a fascinating reference for both the fan of Indiana humor and the comedy scholar in general.
                    So many Hoosier "laugh-makers" are of national significance, from Kin Hubbard
                    (creator of Abe Martin) and Kurt Vonnegut to Red Skelton and David Letterman. The book's
                    subheading bears quoting, moreover, since it suggests the breadth of Banta's
                    work—"The Story of Over 400 Hoosiers: ACTORS, CARTOONISTS, WRITERS and
                    OTHERS." Thus, there are 400-plus capsule biographies of seemingly every Hoosier with a
                    comedy connection, from the circus clown to the university academic. Entries are detailed and boast
                    modest bibliographies, with the accent fittingly on Indiana publication sources. Such references are
                    in line with the ever-increasing push among <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-087-3-082"/>

            <p>Banta's ability to pack a biographical sketch with so much insightful information yet do it
                    entertainingly is most impressive. For instance, one of my favorite humorists is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Auburn</settlement>
                    </placeName>-born Will Cuppy (1884-1949), author of such inspired comedy volumes as <hi rend="i">How
                        to Be a Hermit</hi> (1934), <hi rend="i">How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes</hi> (1931), and
                        <hi rend="i">How to Become Extinct</hi> (1941). A sadly neglected talent, Cuppy has very little
                    biographical material available. Consequently, Banta's citation on the humorist was not
                    only a pleasant surprise but also provided a new slant on Cuppy's demented professorial
                    style (comic footnotes, mock reference subjects, etc.). Banta's brief aside about
                    Cuppy's fascination with university classes reveals volumes about the humorist's
                    best work.</p>
            <p>Although the book focuses on the capsule biographies, the opening thirty pages are devoted to
                    numerous short historical overviews on subjects such as Hoosier cartoonists, Indiana stage and
                    screen successes, and prominent state authors and special features such as "<placeName>

            <p>As indicated on the dust jacket, "<hi rend="i">Indiana Books by Indiana Authors: A Guide to
                        Children's Literature</hi> is a comprehensive an-otated bibliography of writing for
                    children and young adults on Hoosier subjects written by Indiana authors." The book is
                    divided into ten categories: fiction (80), folklore (7), science (22), art (8), music (15), sports
                    (19), literature (15), history (30), American Indians (12), and biography (33). (The figure in
                    parentheses indicates the number of books in each category.) An introductory essay for each section
                    "cites authoritative sources in the field, pinpoints the <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-087-3-084"/> coverage of the chapter, and briefly sets each critical work in context" (p. x). The
                    essays also contain information about other authors and books and limited biographical information
                    about many of the writers. In addition to the usual bibliographical data, there are annotations and
                    suggested reading levels for every entry.</p>
            <p>Although the book covers a wide variety of subjects, there are fields not included, religion for
                    example; and, with the exception of history, there is no section on the social sciences.</p>
            <p>Ruth Jeannette Gillis did not intend to provide an exhaustive list of books in any category:
                    "As for the overall selections, I was guided by the idea of producing a work that would
                    introduce the State of Indiana to someone who had little or no knowledge about the Hoosier
                    state" (p. xii).</p>
            <p>Gillis's guide provides excellent information for teachers, librarians, university
                    professors, students, general readers, indeed anyone interested in books for children and young

            <p>George Jean Nathan, like fellow Hoosier Cole Porter, spent most of his life in Manhattan. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Porter</settlement>
                    </placeName> put together sophisticated song lyrics. Nathan became one of America's most
                    influential and satirically deft drama critics. For over a half century the vanguard press and
                    journals of opinion were pleased to promulgate his views. Brilliant and caustic, Nathan openly
                    confessed "a prejudice against playwrights who seek to palliate their emotional immaturity
                    with anonymous injections of the borrowed mature thoughts of others" (p. 35). This bold
                    critic praised whom he would and deferred not a whit to those literati and progressives who favored
                    others he himself often ridiculed: among them T. S. Eliot, Noel Coward, Maxwell Anderson, and
                    Clifford Odets. Nathan (who won a gold medal in collegiate fencing) developed a rapier wit. And he
                    took risks. As early as 1917 he announced the genius of Eugene O'Neill; in later years,
                    when the Nobel laureate was all but dismissed by such powerful voices as Eric Bentley, Francis
                    Fergusson, and Bernard De Voto, Nathan took a characteristically uncompromising stance: <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-087-3-085"/> "O'Neill is the only dramatist in the history of the
                    American theatre who has achieved real world status" (p. 135). Eager to deflate whatever
                    appeared to him pretentious, he lampooned all Broadway buncombe claiming to serve the cause of
                    "high art."</p>
            <p>Nathan, born into privilege, cultivated a patrician way of life. He was the son of Charles
                    Narét-Nathan, international merchant, and Ella Nördlinger Nathan of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, college classmate of Ella Quinlan, who would later marry the matinée idol
                    James O'Neill and become the mother of Eugene. Given every advantage, Nathan enrolled in
                    the late 1890s as a special student in such universities as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bologna</settlement>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Heidelberg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In 1904 he was graduated from Cornell.</p>
            <p>This history is competently summarized by professor of English emeritus A. L. Lazarus, who has
                    organized a splendid anthology of Nathan's dramatic criticism, his
                    "profiles" of players, playwrights, and "other writers"
                    (Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, W. Somerset Maugham, F. Scott Fitzgerald, <hi rend="i">et
                    al.</hi>). Nathan's ubiquitous sarcasm, no doubt hilarious in once-a-week installments, can
                    become a bit tiresome in this prolonged <hi rend="i">tour de force,</hi> but his columns, showcased
                    for decades, made already good magazines a little racier: <hi rend="i">Harper's Weekly,
                        Smart Set, The American Mercury, Saturday Review,</hi> and <hi rend="i">Scribner's</hi>. Nathan began his famous partnership with H. L. Mencken in 1914, coediting
                        <hi rend="i">Smart Set.</hi> In it he gave first exposure to young O'Neill, to James
                    Joyce (two of the <hi rend="i">Dubliner</hi> stories were printed here for the first time), Maugham,
                    Fitzgerald, and others. Over a long career (and with the help of his friend Alfred A. Knopf) Nathan
                    published over forty books of criticism and reflections. In 1953 Indiana University awarded him an
                    honorary doctorate, an occasion prompting one of his few visits to the native state after his
                    mother's death in 1932.</p>
            <p>Nathan's life was not in every respect a smashing success, of course. He knew the sadness of
                    friendship made even more poignant by unrequited affection. A little like Yeats with Maud Gonne,
                    perhaps, Nathan could not seal in marriage his love for the beautiful Lillian Gish. Later he found a
                    sophisticated partner in the much younger actress, Julie Haydon, whom he married in 1955 (three
                    years before his death). He forged other fascinating associations: best known, no doubt, his
                    celebrated liaison with Mencken. Just as important, it may be, was Nathan's friendship and
                    correspondence with O'Neill (the subject of another Fairleigh Dickinson volume, <hi rend="i">As Ever Gene,</hi> 1987).</p>
            <p>Here then is a book for both theater buff and the student of dramatic history. In addition to the
                    main content, moreover, the author provides a helpful bibliography and index, as well as an
                    interesting "photo gallery." Flawless books defy probability, of course; nor does
                    this volume defeat the odds. What possessed Lazarus to construct a 138-page glossary? He disavows
                    any intention <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-087-3-086"/> to insult the reader's intelligence; he
                    wishes merely to identify persons and events known to the erudite Nathan. But many entries seem
                    condescending, if not wholly unnecessary. Here Lazarus introduces Freud, Marx, Mozart, Shakespeare ("<placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s greatest dramatist"), Woodrow Wilson, and so forth.</p>
            <p>One should not end on a quibble, however. All in all, the <hi rend="i">Nathan Reader</hi> stands as a

            <p>The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, which flourished in states like Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, is commonly regarded as a fanatical movement based largely on religious, racial, and
                    nativist animosities. Historians have been steadily moving away from this generalization,
                    acknowledging the reality of such prejudices yet finding other considerations at least equally
                    important in explaining the organization's success. William D. Jenkins takes this path in
                    his study of Klan activities in northeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s <geogName>Mahoning Valley</geogName>, which includes Youngstown and Niles,
                    the site in 1924 of a violent confrontation between Klan members and incensed opponents.</p>
            <p>Utilizing such sources as local press accounts, personal interviews, and church records, as well as a
                    partial Klan membership list for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Mahoning County</region>
                    </placeName>, Jenkins rejects claims made in Kenneth T. Jackson's <hi rend="i">The Ku Klux
                        Klan in the City</hi> (1967). In particular, Jenkins questions the assertion that Klan members
                    typically were lower-middle-class individuals fearful of immigrant and black threats to their jobs
                    and neighborhoods. He maintains that, at least in the <geogName>Mahoning Valley</geogName>, Klansmen
                    represented a broad spectrum of the general population, and he doubts the significance of economic
                    concerns. Drawing on the scholarship of Richard Jensen and Paul Kleppner, the author sees the Klan
                    as part of a pietist Protestant effort to impose a "conservative moral code on American
                    society" (p. ix). He views the Klan not so much as a peculiar jazz age phenomenon as a
                    long-term "consequence of a cultural conflict that resulted from the overly rapid mixing of
                    divergent cultures within a society already undergoing the wrenching changes of
                    industrialization" (p. ix). The Klan was able, briefly, to gain a political foothold in the
                        <geogName>Mahoning Valley</geogName> because of genuine concerns over political corruption,
                    Sabbath violations, and effective law enforcement, especially in the area of prohibition.
                    Ultimately, <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-087-3-087"/> the organization proved incapable of fulfilling its
                    reform pledges and was discredited by local and national internal corruption. The sensational Niles
                    riot, leading to serious injuries on both sides and a declaration of martial law, reflected
                    determined, effective opposition from the region's sizable immigrant population.</p>
            <p>The book's focus on local issues and its arguments echo other recent studies by Shawn Lay,
                    Robert A. Goldberg, and Larry R. Gerlach. Jenkins is generally convincing, but he candidly
                    acknowledges the difficulty of determining precisely why people joined the Klan. This work should
                    provide meaningful direction for those studying the Klan in neighboring Indiana, which shared a
                    strong pietist influence. Klan scholars might also profit from Jenkins's suggestion that
                    more attention be paid to women's roles in the Klan movement, although his own book sheds
                    little light on this facet of the subject. In his conclusion Jenkins appropriately points out the
                    irony that it was "the moral corruption of its leaders that damaged the Klan the
                    most" (p. 165). Possibly one could go further and add that the organization exhibited a
                    destructive tension between its conservative moral agenda and the "new era"
                    huckstering it employed to advance itself. The Ku Klux Klan, <hi rend="i">in this sense,</hi> was
                    very much a phenomenon of the 1920s.</p>

            <p>This volume is the second in the author's projected five-volume <hi rend="i">Handbook of the
                        American Frontier.</hi> When completed, the series will cover Indian-white relationships in the

                    </placeName> from the time of first contact until the end of the Indian wars four centuries later.
                    The volumes will include "brief articles in dictionary arrangement about American Indian
                    tribes and leaders, explorers, traders, frontier settlers, soldiers, missionaries, mountain men,
                    captives, battles, massacres, forts, treaties, and other topics of importance or interest"
                    (p. vii). Along with the present volume covering the Northeastern Woodlands, the handbook will offer
                    volumes on the Southeastern Woodlands, the Great Plains, and the Southwest and the Pacific Coast.
                    The final volume will include an index, chronology, and bibliography.</p>
            <p>J. Norman Heard's idea for a comprehensive handbook that presents Indian-white relations in
                    an encyclopedic fashion is an excellent one. Unfortunately, his effort—if judged by this
                    volume— <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-087-3-088"/> may fall short of its mark. The author is
                    most successful in identifying the various individuals and topics for inclusion in the work. Most of
                    the major and minor subjects in Indian-white relations of the Northeastern Woodlands are mentioned
                    at least in passing. For example, those interested in Indiana history will find entries on major
                    figures such as William Henry Harrison, Tecumseh, Little Turtle, and Blue Jacket, as well as for
                    lesser-known individuals such as Frances Slocum or Leather Lips. The problem lies not in the
                    selection of material but in the bibliography and sources. Although Heard does cite some recent
                    works, too many of his references are dated. Little effort seems to have been made to use the most
                    recent or best secondary works for the various entries. For example, his entry on the Walking
                    Purchase makes no mention of Francis Jennings's important studies. His entry on Joseph
                    Brant ignores Isabel T. Kelsay's definitive biography published in 1984. The entry on Sir
                    William Johnson ignores the most reliable works by Milton W. Hamilton and James Flexner. Equally
                    troubling is the author's puzzling decision not to include the dates of publication for the
                    various books cited. Readers have no way of knowing whether references were published in the 1930s
                    or 1990s.</p>
            <p>Volume II of the <hi rend="i">Handbook of the American Frontier</hi> is not nearly as useful or as
                    comprehensive as it might have been. What makes it even more disappointing is that this type of
                    encyclopedic volume is greatly needed. It is to be hoped that future volumes will be better.</p>

            <p>This incisive and comprehensive analysis of the settlement and urbanization process that took place
                    in the antebellum Midwest is an important contribution to the historical literature of urbanization.
                    The "Great West" defined by the author was a regional economic and urban system
                    that developed across the <geogName>Mississippi River Valley</geogName> between 1820 and 1860.
                    Settlement patterns and economic advantages early on favored the development of towns on the west
                    bank of the river. Later, as a result of competition between transportation systems, the region
                    divided into the upper valley dominated by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the lower valley dependent on St. Louis. Many towns were founded in this region,
                    but their survival was subject to the vicissitudes of population movements, economics, <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-087-3-089"/> and the strategies used by their leaders to interact with this emerging
                    regional urban system. The economic and cultural interactions among the towns and cities were
                    accompanied by the social interactions of the individuals who populated the region. The migratory
                    experience of these people and their interaction with the urban system as individuals and groups
                    establish the basis for understanding how the urbanization process affected the lives of the people.</p>
            <p>This detailed analysis of the historical development of the Great Valley prior to the Civil War and
                    Timothy R. Mahoney's perceptive and original interpretation of the regional urban system
                    that emerged lays an excellent foundation for future studies of urbanization in this region and
                    elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Mahoney has written a fine study grounded in exhaustive research in primary and secondary sources. He
                    presents substantial material in the form of clear descriptive tables and figures. The topics of the
                    tables range from Edmund Dana's 1819 ranking of the attractiveness of thirty western
                    locations based on soil quality, climate, healthfulness, market access, and other variables to a
                    detailed schedule of farmer Edward Ingraham's twenty-nine trips to market to deliver 641
                    bushels of corn between 1852 and 1853. The maps clearly depict subjects such as the attractiveness
                    of western locations, human settlement patterns, soil quality, urban hinterlands, roads and rates of
                    travel, the hydrology of the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>, and the location of businesses
                    in Galena and Davenport. These figures, tables, and maps provide students of regional history and
                    the urbanization process a rich mine of information that is clearly presented and interpreted.</p>

            <p>In the first volume of his long-awaited study of secession, William W. Freehling offers a complex
                    account of a fragmented social order. After a lesiurely tour of the South's physical and
                    human geography, he quickly focuses on slavery as the centerpiece of southern society. From the
                    eighteenth century onward slaveholders had precariously balanced a preference for Enlightenment
                    deference <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-087-3-090"/> against the demands of romantic democracy. They had
                    to rule their slaves and at least attempt to control their neighborhoods without violating sacred
                    principles of republicanism. Whether in the household, in the field, or on the hustings, masters
                    seldom wielded unlimited power. To Freehling both slaveholders and their slaves participated in an
                    elaborate charade in which paternalistic pretensions clashed with harsh repression and apparent
                    submissiveness masked daily resistance.</p>
            <p>Variations on these theatrics appeared because of important regional differences within the so-called
                    South. The South was in fact several Souths, and especially important were the contrasts between the
                    politics of slavery in the deep South and in the border states. Throughout the volume the author
                    maintains a useful distinction between "diffusionists" who would rid their states
                    of slavery through manumission, colonization, sales, and even territorial expansion and
                    "perpetualists" who tried to fortify their social order against the smallest
                    threats to slavery.</p>
            <p>In detailing the lengthy journey toward secession, Freehling deals with familiar topics ranging from
                    slavery in Jeffersonian <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> to the <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>-<region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
               </placeName> Act, but along the way he offers either new
                    interpretations or a skillful synthesis of a massive secondary literature. Thus the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Compromise becomes another example of the persistence of slavery diffusion proposals in
                    American politics. In dealing with the nullification crisis, Freehling revises his own earlier work
                    by portraying the nullifiers as nervous, cautious, and compromising revolutionaries. Giving more
                    thorough treatment to the ideological and political subtleties of the gag rule debates than any
                    previous scholar, Freehling neatly handles the interplay of state, national, and party politics.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Road to Disunion</hi> offers many revisions—large and small—on
                    seemingly exhausted subjects. In a sophisticated analysis of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> question Freehling reinterprets the motives of southern annexationists and finds
                    considerable evidence of British-abolitionist cooperation to end slavery in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. He is especially good at rediscovering and explaining the actions of often forgotten
                    figures such as Abel Upshur and Stephen Pearl Andrews.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately many readers may not be able to appreciate the substantial contribution made by this
                    book because of some obvious and annoying problems. Once Freehling moves past the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> question, too many of the chapters seem either sketchy or derivative, as if he had
                    already written too much and decided to wrap things up quickly. Freehling's assessments of
                    the secondary literature are often generous and perceptive but are sometimes idiosyncratic and
                    occasionally harsh. Nor does he necessarily practice what he preaches. After deploring the
                    overemphasis on the role of slavery in southern politics, Freehling spends about two-thirds of <pb n="295" id="VAA4025-087-3-091"/> his overlong book dealing almost exclusively with the politics
                    of slavery.</p>
            <p>There are also some maddening style problems. Freehling strains for a smoothly flowing narrative,
                    sometimes achieves this goal, but often ends up with jarring informalities, silly nicknames (Howell
                    Cobb is referred to as "Fatty Cobb" throughout), odd phrases, and frequently
                    anachronistic diction. The book is severely overwritten from beginning to end. Nevertheless, readers
                    should patiently endure the prose because there is much to learn from Freehling's book, and
                    they can only hope that he avoids such excesses in the concluding volume.</p>
            <p>If Freehling essays to analyze the whole sweep of southern sectionalism, Kenneth M. Stampp's
                        <hi rend="i">America in 1857</hi> microscopically examines one year of the sectional conflict.
                    Organized in roughly chronological fashion, the book is effectively held together by steady
                    attention to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> question. As the New Year dawned, many Americans hoped that the newly elected President
                    James Buchanan would discover the formula for dampening the fires of the slavery controversy. If
                    Democrats had reason to be optimistic, Republicans, too, saw a bright future for their young but
                    growing party. Indeed the third American party system was moving out of its infancy into a
                    boisterous childhood.</p>
            <p>In a book that can best be described as good old-fashioned political history, Stampp includes
                    descriptions of the national and regional economies along with some social history. Yet his social
                    history is quaintly anecdotal and oblivious to newer historical topics and methods. Stampp keeps the
                    focus on politics, especially the intricate political maneuvering in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and factionalism in the states. <hi rend="i">America in 1857</hi> dwells lovingly on
                    such staples of political history as the tariff, Cabinet making, and patronage; Stampp masterfully
                    wends his way through the labyrinth of personalities and issues with sure-footed confidence.</p>
            <p>Naturally much of this material will be familiar to students of antebellum American history. The
                    discussion of the Dred Scott case, for instance, while concise and clear, adds little to an already
                    substantial secondary literature. On the other hand, Stampp presents the best available narrative
                    analysis of the Lecompton fiasco and is especially good at describing and assessing decisions made
                    in both <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Some political topics such as the Mormon war and filibustering appear tangential to
                    the main story, but the author nicely weaves the Panic of 1857 into the flow of political events.</p>
            <p>A deft feel for the interactions of personality and politics produces fine assessments of Buchanan,
                    John W. Forney, Robert J. Walker, Stephen A. Douglas, Howell Cobb, and many other figures. Although
                    Stampp gives somewhat superficial attention to southern politics, he is superb on the intricacies of
                    party battles in <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-087-3-092"/>

                    magisterial studies of past politics. Such good history should never go out of style.</p>

            <p>These essays survey various fields of agricultural historiography, discuss contested issues, and
                    identify opportunities for further research. Five of them consider the Northeast and Midwest,
                    another five address southern questions, and two deal with women and immigrants as "Special
                    Topics" that cut across the book's regional division. Because the editor and
                    several contributors hold university appointments in economics, and most of the other contributors
                    are conversant with the methods and theories of social science, the essays' language is
                    sometimes technical and occasionally mathematical. Their use of "in-text
                    citation," a style of documentation characteristic of the social sciences and still
                    (blessedly) rare in history, accentuates their special flavor.</p>
            <p>Particularly rewarding essays include Jeremy Atack and Fred Bateman, "Yeoman Farming:
                    Antebellum America's Other 'Peculiar Institution'" and Kathleen
                    Neils Conzen, "Immigrants in Nineteenth-Century Agricultural History." Both will
                    be especially helpful to students of the Midwest. Atack and Bateman ask whether the North's
                    small, independent farmers were succeeding in 1860, conclude that they were, and then note that the
                    farmers' commercial aspirations portended their eventual loss of independence. In the
                    course of developing that argument, Atack and Bateman lucidly summarize a great deal of information,
                    much of it drawn from their own research, about land distribution, the costs of beginning farms in
                    various parts of the North, and the relatively high degree of economic equality characteristic of
                    northern rural communities. Conzen's essay reports that studies of midwestern Germans and
                    Scandinavians have challenged the once regnant "Turnerian" belief that ethnicity
                    had little importance for American agricultural developments. She adds, however, that
                    "synthesis remains a distant goal" (p. 309). Midwestern historians will also <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-087-3-093"/> find historiographical guidance in the essays by Hal Barron, R.
                    Douglas Hurt, Dorothy Schweider, and Donald L. Winters. The last essay is particularly interesting
                    for its explanation of why historians disagree so strenuously about whether midwestern farmers got a
                    proper share of the country's wealth.</p>
            <p>Readers interested in the burgeoning rural part of women's history will profit from
                    Elizabeth Fox-Genovese's essay and from Hal Barron's consideration of some
                    women's history topics that Fox-Genovese's economic focus excludes. And anyone who
                    wants to study the present state of southern agricultural history, with its distinctively dense
                    thicket of quantitative economic studies, will want to read this book's southern section,
                    perhaps especially the concluding essay by Joseph P. Reidy. The section clarifies some complex and
                    fiercely contested issues about slavery and its aftermath.</p>
            <p>All of these essays have lengthy bibliographies. Taken with the book's statistical appendix,
                    they make the volume a servicable reference tool that should be regularly consulted by everyone who

            <p>In <hi rend="i">The Sanitarians</hi> John Duffy has produced a useful overview of the evolution of
                    public health in America. Written in a straight-forward narrative style, the volume covers the topic
                    from colonial times to the present. Among the book's themes Duffy focuses on "the
                    constant alternation between apathy and sharp reaction to periodic health crises" (p. 2)
                    and "the clash between individual liberty and the public welfare" (p. 3). He gives
                    greater emphasis to the former, building much of the chronology around key epidemics or significant
                    medical breakthroughs.</p>
            <p>Building on his own voluminous body of primary research, a wide range of secondary materials,
                    contemporary periodicals, and some institutional reports, Duffy offers concise descriptions of the
                    rise of important public health agencies, the professionalization of public health officials, and
                    the extent of the problems they faced. Such a broad approach leaves little time for an in-depth
                    analysis of any one topic or theme, but the book is a good first stop on the road to understanding
                    the public health history of the country and a good place to start looking for additional pertinent
                    bibliography.</p>
            <p>Duffy claims that "the history of public health in America has not been one of constant and
                    steady upward progress" (p. 315); <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-087-3-094"/> however, he exhibits
                    a rather strong progressive view throughout the book in highlighting the accomplishments of the last
                    two hundred years. More could have been made of the indecision and uncertainty that inevitably arose
                    in dealing with many confounding medical crises over the years. Mention is made, for example, of the
                    search for pure water supplies, but little discussion is presented about the intense battles to find
                    an effective way to deliver those supplies to the public.</p>
            <p>Duffy also raises some tantalizing issues in the conclusion to <hi rend="i">The
                    Sanitarians</hi>—most notably his reference to medical ethics, "which was
                    largely medical etiquette for much of its history and which accepted medical experimentation on the
                    poor with but few questions until well into the twentieth century" (p. 316). Unfortunately,
                    because the years after World War II are treated so briskly, readers get little benefit from
                    Duffy's experience and perspective on medical ethics, the AIDs epidemic, and the impact of
                    the environmental movement on public health.</p>
            <p>These criticisms aside, <hi rend="i">The Sanitarians</hi> serves as a good introduction to the
                    history of public health through the mid-twentieth century. Duffy highlights many significant themes
                    and events and offers helpful comments on the available literature in the field. This is a good
                    companion volume to his previous study, <hi rend="i">The Healers</hi> (1976).</p>

            <p>This book represents an attempt to develop a stylistic taxonomy of American popular housing in the
                    first four decades of the twentieth century by focusing on mail-order catalogue houses. The book is
                    organized into three sections. In the first, nine short chapters contain overviews of such subjects
                    as styles at the turn of the twentieth century and the history of prefabricated housing. The second
                    section, "The National Period, 1900-1920," outlines ten styles the authors
                    associate with this time period, ranging from "transitional colonial revival" to
                    the "box house or foursquare." The third, "Academic Period,
                    1920-1941," does the same for the pre-World War II era, identifying, for example,
                    "Five Types of <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-087-3-095"/> Modern Tudor," and the
                    "Modern Georgian Revival." For unclear reasons a chapter on "Vernacular
                    Homes" is also included in this section.</p>
            <p>The most useful part of the book is the section on the history of the Aladdin company, based on
                    archival material and local history; here the authors rightfully establish the importance of that
                    firm. As the partial list of the book's contents perhaps suggests, however, the authors
                    otherwise achieve only limited success in accomplishing their goal. The style labels that the
                    authors have chosen will probably not stick, any more than terms for nineteenth-century styles have
                    been standardized. And while style is undeniably important, the primary significance of catalogue
                    homes is in their relevance to social history, which the authors do not explore in any depth. For
                    the subjects they do tackle, they attempt too much and compound the problems by writing for an
                    audience that consists both of professionals and lay people. Thus, in order to put style labels on
                    catalogue homes, they are compelled also to discuss the history and characteristics of architectural
                    styles more generally; the result is sometimes impossibly superficial. The focus continually shifts
                    between catalogue homes and more general topics, for example in the discussion of construction
                    techniques and of precursors to catalogues. Moreover, these discussions are not coherently related.
                    The result is that the book itself all too nearly approaches the catalogue format. The
                    volume's usefulness for its projected audience, then, would seem to be limited.</p>
