            <p>In the closing pages of Plato's <hi rend="i">Republic</hi>, there is found the story of
                    the prophet of Lachaesis, who addressed the souls of men who were coming back from the other world
                    to take up once more human form: "Let him who draws the first lot have the first choice,
                    and the life he chooses shall be his destiny." The life which was chosen on this spot; the
                    life which was chosen in the Legislative Hall one hundred yards from where we sit; the life which
                    was chosen at Fort Sackville, became the destiny of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder if those of us, who are close to this pioneer life in Indiana, realize what a great region
                    we have here. It is not merely that we have preserved these places, it is that the spirit which was
                    born in them has persisted through the years. It is a splendid thing that we have the tangible
                    reminders of the fact that history was made here and that policies were adopted, and faiths
                    announced, which have been kept through the years.</p>
            <p>I have never been able to understand why those who have undertaken the task of writing the history of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have not laid greater stress upon the important events which happened in this
                    community. And while this is speaking a bit out of turn, as a member of the State Board of
                    Education, I think it might be in order for the Board to suggest that those who offer their
                    histories for use in the public schools of Indiana pay some attention to the real history which was
                    made here.</p>

                    the developments in the course of training for citizenship, in the form of this splendid unit from
                    the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at Indiana University.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> You
                    perhaps merely look upon uniformed men. Do you realize that you see in them a symbol of the duty
                    which rests upon every able-bodied man, namely, the defense of the nation in any hour of need? They
                    likewise take you back from the modern exemplification of duty to the earlier exemplification of
                    duty in George Rogers <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName> and his intrepid band. They made history. The attack they carried out here, the capture
                    of Fort Sackville, comes down in the annals of our nation. It was a brilliant campaign under a
                    daring and resourceful leader.</p>
            <p>Many other places in this part of the country laid claim to the national memorial to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName>. But, here he accomplished a most brilliant feat; here he made his most important
                    contributions to the future welfare of the nation. No man knows what the development of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> might have been were it not for the fact that <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark</region>
                    </placeName> and his men brought about the surrender of Fort Sackville. It is appropriate that the
                    nation itself recognize this in placing here at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> this beautiful national memorial.</p>
            <p>May I remind you, that in the building across the street (Legislative Hall),<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                    actions were taken, more far-reaching, more important than have been taken in any building in this
                    whole nation, except in the Capitol Building in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>. More land was controlled through that office, more important policies were adopted by
                    that Legislature of thirteen members, which met in the upper room of that building, than in any
                    other state or territorial capital. The thought came to me this afternoon as I walked through that
                    upper room that it might be well to have a legislature of thirteen once more. It is always easier to
                    settle matters in one room through close personal contact with those who are charged with the
                    responsibilities of government.</p>
            <p>I wish at this time to point out a very important thing, which has to do with this community and to
                    offer a suggestion. The region between the <placeName>

                    for us to center the eyes of the nation upon <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, upon this memorial, upon this Legislative Hall, on the one hundred and fiftieth
                    anniversary of that signing on the third day of September of this year. I shall be more than glad to
                    use the powers of my office to invite the attention of the rest of the nation to the importance and
                    significance of such a celebration and I feel confident that you who are present here will be
                    willing to join me.</p>
            <p>I want to call your attention to the unique significance in the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of the territory ceded to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by Great Britain in 1783, the Old Northwest. Do you realize that this was the first
                    acquisition of territory made by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a nation? That it was more important than the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Purchase, more important than <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>—more important than the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>
                    </placeName> country or the far Southwest. It was the heart of the continent then, it is the heart
                    of the continent now—the center of our population, the place where true Americanism and
                    the pioneer spirit reign supreme. Without this territory, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> might have remained a small seaboard nation.</p>
            <p>The second thing that I wish to call to your attention at this time is this: At that time the
                    territory was claimed by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, by <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>, <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
               </placeName> and other eastern seaboard states.
                    Those states generously surrendered their claims and made this territory a common possession,
                    belonging to all. It was almost the only common possession of the whole people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and it was a bond which held the states together when the very existence of a federal
                    government was seriously threatened.</p>
            <p>There is a third thing to which I wish to invite your attention: It is that the organization by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of these territories was an important step between national domain and statehood. It is
                    not generally understood today how important that step was in the development of the nation, This
                    territory might have been treated as government property to be held as a colony for the benefit of
                    the original states <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-029-2-004"/> of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>. On the other hand, the expansion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> might have taken place through the extension of some or all of the original states. It
                    was through conflict of opinion and of interests, it was through serious thought and gradual
                    development, that the idea of a temporary territory controlled by the federal government was
                    adopted. The American "territory" which thus came into being differed from the
                    British colony chiefly in the fact that it was temporary and not permanent. The way was provided for
                    statehood, for complete equality in due time with the original charter members of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance of 1787 has long been regarded in American history as second in importance only to the
                    Constitution of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Emphasis has long been placed on the general principles of religious freedom, public
                    education and prohibition of slavery incorporated in that document. But in reality, the
                    establishment of these principles and their realization were effected not so much by the Ordinance
                    of 1787 as by the development which took place in the territories themselves. It is not of so much
                    importance that these principles were written into the document; it is of importance that they were
                    carried out by the people who came to the Northwest Territory.</p>
            <p>The provisions for the governmental organization of the territory and the subsequent creation of the
                    resulting states, to be taken into the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on the same basis as the original states, was the most important thing that came out of
                    that entire development. For it was in the Northwest and Indiana Territories that the principles
                    governing the expansion of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> were worked out under Arthur St. Clair and William Henry Harrison, the most important
                    of all our territorial governors. They were more than governors. They were empire builders.</p>
            <p>The laws established for the Northwest Territory, and the laws enacted by the territorial legislature
                    that sat in that building (Legislative Hall) and the procedure our government adopted then, were of
                    prime importance and served as precedents for all subsequent times.</p>
            <p>May I also invite your attention to a fourth thing? That the pioneers of this great <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> valley, that the pioneers of the Northwest and Indiana Territories, really developed
                    American democracy. Conditions were similar throughout the region <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-029-2-005"/> between the Alleghanies and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, and they were different from those prevailing anywhere else. The privations with which
                    our forefathers contended, the ever present malaria, the difficulty of travel by the wilderness
                    trails, the log cabins which spotted this part of the country, the clearing and cultivating of farms
                    by the hardest of toil, all marked the life of our pioneers. In that pioneer life of the Old
                    Northwest they developed social and political equality, pride of citizenship, and the
                    resourcefulness which have made this nation what it is.</p>
            <p>I want to pay tribute to the foresight of those men who made the first Constitution of the State of
                    Indiana—men who had the courage to provide for a system of public education, wherein
                    tuition should be gratis, from the primary school up to and including the university. They planned
                    with a vision of equality of opportunity for all of the children. I add this one thing today, my
                    fellow citizens; despite the crisis which is upon us; despite this great shadow of economic
                    depression under which we have been living, it is still one of the primary duties of an enlightened
                    government to give adequate support to public education. If you expect anything to come from the
                    future years, you must provide education for the children. They grow up in times of depression as
                    well as in times of prosperity. Roads and buildings can wait, but not these
                    children—don't forget that.</p>
            <p>The last thing to which I wish to call your attention is this: It was this region that decided the
                    question of slavery and the outcome of the Civil War. The five states of the Old Northwest threw
                    their great weight into the scale on the side of freedom and national unity, and both were won. From
                    this region came President Lincoln and General Grant, the two greatest figures of the War. These
                    States have led also in the rebuilding of the nation and since the fourth day of March, 1861, this
                    region has given to the nation eight of the fourteen men elected to the presidency of the <placeName>

            <p>"Remember that Bayard Taylor will lecture tomorrow night at the city school house and that
                    Horace Greely will lecture at the same place Saturday night."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In these
                    words, quoted from a Middle Western newspaper of more than seventy years ago, there comes to us
                    faintly an echo of a then vigorous educational vogue, the old lyceum. The story of that enterprise,
                    distant ancestor of our immense university extension activities, has many a thrill for the
                    antiquarian, be his chief interest historical, literary, or educational. It is the purpose of this
                    essay to reopen a few of the more piquant pages in the history of the lyceum, particularly as it
                    touched the early Middle West, and to enliven the story with some hitherto unpublished letters of
                    Emerson, Holmes, Bayard Taylor, J. G. Holland, and other celebrities of their time.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"Remember that Bayard Taylor will lecture." To the tough-sinewed pioneers not many
                    years emerged from the log-cabin era, this announcement must have been more than mildly interesting,
                    at least to the more ambitious among them. Ignorant and gullible though they were as a group, and
                    often immersed in the boiling pot of rabid politics, some longed for refinement and intellectual
                    pursuits and warmly sponsored any movement that appeared to be educational. Their admiration for
                    Taylor and men of his calibre may be judged from this anonymous critical note from the newspaper
                    quoted above: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            finely cut lips covered with brown, silky mustachios; eyes that seem black until they look
                            straight into yours, and then you discover that they are that rich, warm brown of which you
                            never see but two or three pairs in a life-time…. Through the whole course of the

                    among his hearers were similarly affected. To them Taylor was not Socrates, but Adonis. Like the
                    Polchester ladies in Walpole's <hi rend="i">The Cathedral</hi>, who spoke glibly of Greek
                    gods though they had never seen one, the pioneers were pathetically laughable in their attempt to
                    appear sophisticated.</p>
            <p>But this was not their only reaction. Whereas now adult interest in things cultural may sometimes
                    rise, it is to be feared, merely from a desire to escape being stifled by materialism, seventy years
                    ago it frequently arose from a thirst for the good and the beautiful and from a true passion for
                    learning. The ideas of liberty, equality, and free educational opportunities for all had by 1825
                    taken a firm hold upon the imagination of the builders of the empire in the West.</p>

            <p>The lyceum movement was founded in 1826 by Josiah Holbrook, a graduate of Yale. The idea was probably
                    suggested to him by the mechanics' institutes which began in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> late in the eighteenth century. He had a vision of an international system of education
                    for adults as well as for adolescents. His plan was to establish an organization that would extend
                    from a national center to the states, and thence to the counties, and on down to every town,
                    district, and village. Membership was voluntary, though the leaders tried to interest farmers,
                    mechanics, teachers, and even women. The word <hi rend="i">even</hi> is used advisedly, for this was
                    before the day of women's emancipation. Activities were meant to be patriotic,
                    non-partisan, educationally democratic, benevolent, and Christian. The prime object was the
                    "universal diffusion of knowledge." Annual membership fees were two dollars for
                    adults and one dollar for persons under eighteen years of age. One could have "membership
                    forever" by paying twenty dollars. Every local group was supposed to have weekly meetings
                    with alternate lectures <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-029-2-009"/> and debates. Employing agents with
                    managerial powers had charge of activities in given districts.</p>
            <p>The chief matters to be promoted were the study of natural history through a central cabinet and a
                    system of exchanges with local museums, the use of apparatus in lectures, the introduction of vocal
                    music into common school education, the study of history and international law, the preservation of
                    records and materials of local history, the establishment of people's colleges, and the
                    provision of textbooks, possibly free, for the public schools. Other aims were the improvement of
                    conversation, the supervision of amusements, the saving of expense, the founding of libraries and
                    museums, and the establishment of seminaries for teachers. One early account of the system states
                    that sometimes women were allowed to instruct in some of these subjects—an amazing
                    concession in 1826. A constitution was drawn up in 1829 by a committee headed by Henry Ware,
                    president of <placeName>

            <p>The lyceum movement grew rapidly in the West and seemed, at least for a time, to make progress in

            <p>George D. Prentice, the only Middle Westerner represented in the correspondence with the Ulyssean

            <p>Lecturing was "big business" in 1859. Hardly could the supply meet the demand.
                    Whenever headliners were undbtainable, unknown second-raters had to be rushed in, and even they, if
                    sufficiently robustious, usually succeeded. Among those both well known and robustious was B. P.
                    Shillaber, a journalist who used the pseudonym of Mrs. Partington. Here is a specimen from his <hi rend="i">Life and Sayings of Mrs. Partington</hi> (1854): <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I am not so young as I once was, and I don't believe I ever shall be if I live to
                            the age of Samson, which, heaven knows as well as I do, I don't want to, for I
                            wouldn't be a centurion or an octogon and survive my factories and become
                            idiomatic by any means.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>An American Mrs. Malaprop, indeed! Emerson says in his <hi rend="i">Journals</hi> that the Westerners
                    demanded a lecturer who could <pb n="93" id="VAA4025-029-2-013"/> make them laugh or they stalked
                    angrily from the lecture hall. No wonder, then, that Shillaber was a success!</p>

                        <p>Yours of a previous date to 16 Sept. I did not receive. In reply to your note of the
                                    mentioned date, I am compelled to give an unfavorable answer. I have abandoned all

                                    and others to draw me further west. Mr. George Edward Rice and Mr. Jacob Barrow have
                                    both been added to the list of lecturers, with good appeal, as I hear, to the public

            <p>In the bundle of letters to the Ulysseans are others written by Henry W. Bellows, O. M. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, J. H. Wainwright, G. V. Headly, and Carl Schurz. They show the difficulties that arose
                    from poor mail service and slow transportation, and a naive readiness to mix personal affairs with
                    business. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mitchell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, declares that he can not come because of his wife's illness,
                    adding in parenthesis that she "is suffering from paralysis." But, as the letters
                    of these lecturers tell little else, they are not quoted here.</p>
            <p>Looking back now upon that golden age of oratory, we can easily see why lecturing was universally
                    popular. With no radios or airplanes, with no telephones, with only very slow trains—the
                    fastest in 1860 averaged about twenty-five miles an hour—with a deplorable scarcity of
                    newspapers and books, with pitifully few and inefficient schools, the people naturally turned to the
                    spoken word. For a good half-century (1825-1880) the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> valley looked to this source for information and entertainment. But after the Civil War
                    a new era was at hand. Time and opportunity had opened other educational doors. Gradually the
                    chautauqua idea evolved, and then came the university extension courses.</p>
            <p>One commentator, writing in 1869, says that already the lecture system was dying, except "in
                    remoter districts of the valley of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>… where it is possible that not only the political lecturer but the others
                    will exert a sensible intellectual influence." He is skeptical, however, adding that even
                    Emerson, if he should go West again, <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-029-2-014"/> "will be assured
                    of a large attendance only by having a committee that will add a dance and ‘an elegant
                    collation’ to the program under the price of admission."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another cause of the decline of the lyceum was exploitation and commercialism. Lyman Beecher, father
                    of Henry Ward Beecher, foresaw this danger in 1835. "What will become of the
                    West," he cried, "if her prosperity rushes up to such a majesty of power while
                    those great institutions linger which are necessary to form the mind and the conscience and the
                    heart of that vast world?… We must educate! We must educate! Or we must perish by our own
                        prosperity!"<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, in the end, the lecturers—that is, the educators—themselves demanded
                    too much prosperity, a thing unforeseen by the zealous Beecher. Emerson, a mixture of idealistic
                    transcendentalism and shrewd Yankee practicality, gradually advanced from no fee at all for his
                    lectures to the sum of five hundred dollars. "My pulpit," he once said,
                    "is the lyceum platform." For some time his figure stood at five dollars at home,
                    and later, in most of his trips to the West, he received fifty dollars. Henry Ward Beecher, speaking
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1880, climbed to the incredible sum of one thousand dollars. John B. Gough, the
                    famous temperance lecturer, began at eight dollars and ended only a little below
                    Beecher's best. Henry M. Stanley, by virtue of having found Livingstone, made
                    $287,070 from one hundred and ten lectures.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The "star
                    course," as it was called, was indeed bright with the allurement of gold.</p>
            <p>Thus ignobly perished a great educational dream. One of our presidents called the lyceum
                    "the most American thing in America." And it was. Like our nation, it was
                    "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
                    equal." Especially in the West was the lyceum a godsend. It proved to be, at the time and
                    under the circumstances, by far the most efficient means of converting a crude and often
                    anti-cultural people to sound ideals of living and thinking, and it pointed them the way, long and
                    arduous though it is, that leads to sweetness and light. We, their descendants, are still laboring
                    up the ascent. Let us look upon their letters <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The first inhabitants of this country, regardless of where they came from, or when, were food
                    hunters, depending entirely upon the resources of nature for their existence. Such a condition and
                    mode of living necessitated a constant movement and search for food. In seasons of food failure
                    death or a long movement to new localities was inevitable. Sir Arthur Keith has said that
                    "A tribe numbering fifty souls, if they depend for a livelihood on the natural produce of
                    soil or river, needs a fertile territory of 100 square miles for its subsistence." Such a
                    condition would permit only a very low form of culture as no time or energy would be available for
                    the development of the arts.</p>
            <p>There was nothing edible that the aborigine would not eat if conditions required. All animal products
                    of land, sea and lake, all fleshy roots and seeds went into his maw, but the first American was
                    mainly a vegetarian.</p>
            <p>Among such foods wild fruits perhaps came first in point of quantity. America abounded in
                    berries—gooseberries, huckleberries, black raspberries, cranberries, blackberries,
                    strawberries and others. Plums of three varieties white, red and black, wild grapes both white and
                    red, crabapples, haws, persimmons, paw paws, and in some parts of the Americas, the pineapple, all
                    contributed largely to his diet.</p>
            <p>Father Allouez, a Jesuit Missionary toward the end of the seventeenth century, reported the natives
                    of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> country using "from trees and plants 42 different kinds of fruit all of which
                    are excellent." Of course they ate every edible variety of nut and had known how to obtain
                    maple sugar from the maple tree since time immemorial.</p>
            <p>Early European explorers were much impressed by the amount of grain they found growing in America.
                    The white observers were often ignorant of the fact, but much of this grain was wild. Wild rye was
                    common on the Atlantic coast north of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. It was this that the Norse explorers spoke of as growing in the form of "self
                    sown wheat fields." It was also this grain that Captain John Smith found the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Indians using as what he termed a "dainty bread buttered with deer
                    suet." Who can read such phrases as this last, frequent <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-029-2-017"/>
                    in the literature of early exploration in the Americas, and not believe that the early American
                    lived well?</p>
            <p>When the prehistoric Indian developed maize, or corn, from a wild seed bearing grass, believed to
                    have been <hi rend="i">teocintli</hi>, and at the same time invented agriculture, that is, when he
                    began to gather seeds and plant them under conditions favorable to their <hi rend="i">growth</hi>,
                    he took a <hi rend="i">very great</hi> step upward in <hi rend="i">the</hi> cultural scale and
                    towards civilization. We do not know when he took this step, or how, but that it was in the remote
                    past is suggested by the fact that the wild grass, <hi rend="i">teocintli</hi>, is still found in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> but the intermediate steps or missing links between it and maize have never been
                    identified and are probably lost in oblivion. Agriculture and the cultivation of at least a portion
                    of his food permitted the Indian to become sedentary, somewhat independent of nature, and provided
                    that residue of food necessary for leisure. As leisure is necessary for cultural attainments it was
                    only at this time that he was able to make any appreciable progress. It is a fact worthy of note
                    that the highest cultures are found exclusively within the agricultural area and then in a degree of
                    development in direct proportioa to the fertility of the area. Central America, where agriculture
                    probably originated, is the highest culturally of any territory in the Americas with the exception
                    of Peru, where climatic conditions were especially favorable to plant growth.</p>
            <p>Of all agricultural items of the prehistoric American, corn ranks foremost in importance. Cultural
                    development among the Indians was dependent upon it and even the colonization of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by the Whites owes its success largely to the Indian and his corn. It is one of our
                    most important cereals and possibly the oldest. The present market price of corn certainly does not
                    seem to support these statements but they are true nevertheless [December, 1932].</p>
            <p>Few of us realize how completely we have absorbed the corn complex of the American Indian. The Indian
                    method of hand planting in hills is still followed today under modernized methods. Squash or
                    pumpkin, and beans were inseparable from an Indian corn field and are still so planted. The word <hi rend="i">hominy</hi>, with which we are familiar, is strictly American Indian in origin and
                    meaning. It means hulled maize. The method of hulling by the use of wood ashes was Indian in origin
                    and has given rise to our name <hi rend="i">Lye Homing. Succotash</hi> is another word of Indian
                    origin, meaning green corn and beans cooked together. <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-029-2-018"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Squash</hi> is still another Indian word which has been adopted into the American
                    language, and this product is extensively used as an item of our diet. Botanists have agreed that
                    all of the common varieties of squash were generally used by prehistoric Americans. Every edible
                    variety of bean with the exception of the soy-bean and the horse-bean were originated and
                    extensively used by American Indians. The white potato and the sweet potato were the outstanding
                    root crops cultivated by the southern Indians though little is known of their use in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley. The true potato is the sweet potato, which belongs to the morning glory family.
                    The miss-named <hi rend="i">Irish potato</hi> is of the nightshade family to which the tomato
                    belongs. Many plants of this family are poisonous which accounts for the aversion to the
                    "red poison apple," as the tomato was called until the nineteenth century.
                    Nevertheless it was cultivated and eaten in Central America in pre-Columbian times.</p>
            <p>By cultivating at least a part of the food items given above, together with what nature provided,
                    Keith's same tribe of fifty, by cultivating only a hundredth of one square mile, could
                    multiply the number of members by four and still subsist. It can readily be seen what a vital part
                    agriculture played in cultural progress and in populating the prehistoric Americas.</p>
            <p>Of the aboriginal methods of preparing foods the accounts on which we must depend are full but
                    diverse. When we consider that their only way of cooking was at an open fire and their only utensil
                    the earthen vessel, we can understand the surprise exhibited by the old chroniclers at the variety
                    of dishes the prehistoric Americans were able to prepare from wild flesh, corn, beans, pumpkin,
                    squash, dried fruits, roots, nuts and herbs. Of nuts they had a great variety and besides using them
                    as we do, they pounded them in mortars and made them into bread and broth or used them to mix with
                    their hominy.</p>
            <p>Bartram, an early traveler in the south, speaks of hickory milk which he describes as being as sweet
                    and rich as fresh cream. To make it they first pounded the nuts in a mortar or on flat stone and
                    then cast them into boiling water, which, after being passed through fine strainers, preserved the
                    most oily part of the fluid. It was used as an ingredient in most of their cooking especially in
                    hominy and corn cakes, as well <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-029-2-019"/> as furnishing an agreeable drink.
                    Sometimes they skimmed off the oil and left it in gourds or earthen vessels, using it as we do
                    butter on their corn cakes or to give body and flavor to their broth when meat was scarce. Sunflower
                    seeds were treated in a similar manner among the southern Indians.</p>
            <p>Acorns were used extensively in making broth and bread after having first been soaked in lye to
                    remove their bitterness. They were also boiled and the oil skimmed off and preserved in gourds and
                    jars. Bread and gruel were made of the wild cane seed of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> Valley, and another cereal much used was wild rice, the same plant that hunters now
                    disseminate to attract ducks.</p>
            <p>In their constant search for vegetable products from which to make flour, the ancient Americans
                    experimented with a great variety of nuts when making bread. Among these were the chestnut,
                    hazelnut, walnut, pecan, the chinkapin and the acorn. The seed of the sunflower was used, and it
                    also provided an oil much relished as a dressing. The Jerusalem arbichoke, which is neither an
                    artichoke nor from Jerusalem, was employed for the concoction of both bread and broth. This plant
                    and the sunflower both became objects of intensive cultivation, whereas the nuts were everywhere so
                    plentiful that cultivation was not necessary.</p>
            <p>Corn, the foundation of all their cooking, was prepared in a number of ways. Among them there was one
                    dish that was in such demand and favor that it may be said to be typical. To the French it was known
                    as <hi rend="i">sagamite</hi>, while among the English it was variously termed <hi rend="i">sump</hi> and <hi rend="i">hominy.</hi> Both the latter words are Indian in origin as is the dish
                    itself. It was made of ripe corn, either whole or crushed, and boiled with meat or fish, either
                    dried or fresh. Sometimes in the spring or early summer, Indians used green corn and beans boiled
                    together and which under the original Indian name <hi rend="i">succotash</hi> was included in our
                    menu this evening.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Corn bread was made in a variety of ways, from ripe corn. Our term Johnny Cake was derived from an
                    Indian word meaning "journey cake" and so called because of its extensive use

            <p>We do not think of the potato as a cereal, but the ancient Americans treated it as such. Perhaps no
                    vegetable is more widely used in the civilized world than this tuber, yet no plant has been so much
                    misrepresented, not even the tomato. This common white root is usually referred to as the
                    "Irish Potato" but, as the late W. E. Safford of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of Agriculture has pointed out, "It is only a potato by analogy and
                    Irish by extraction."</p>
            <p>The peanut, sometimes referred to as the ground-nut, was developed by the natives of South America.
                    Soon after the discovery of America by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Spaniards took the peanut to Africa and slave ships bringing negroes to North
                    America at a later period brought the peanut with them. Thus the peanut, like the potato, had to
                    cross the Atlantic from South America in order to get into North America. The potato was first
                    introduced into the English Colonies of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1719, several hundred years after its aboriginal inception in the South Americas.</p>
            <p>Tapioca pudding is still a fairly common dessert in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and has been included in our dinner tonight. But to few who are not specialists in
                    botany do the words <hi rend="i">yuca, mndepore, maihot, cassaba, cassava, manyoc</hi> and <hi rend="i">manioc</hi> mean anything. Yet these are all native names for the plant which yields
                    tapioca.</p>
            <p>Manioc had a wide distribution in early America. Where the climate was too hot for maize, manioc was
                    often the staple food. It is a root plant and the most interesting thing about it is that the juice
                    is poisonous. Throughout the region where it was eaten the root was everywhere treated in an
                    identical manner for the removal of this poisonous juice containing prussic acid. The root was
                    grated and the pulp squeezed in basketry presses. When the juice had been pressed out of the pulp
                    the residue was made into cakes and heated until the volatile poisoning remaining had been removed.
                    The result was "cassava bread." Here we have an analogy in the process of poison
                    removal from a root in South America with the process applied to the acorn in North America to
                    remove its bitterness.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the information we have regarding Indian foods and the methods of preparing them has been
                    left us through the historical accounts of early explorers, missionaries, Jesuit Priests, travelers
                    and traders. We are therefore <pb n="101" id="VAA4025-029-2-021"/> largely dependent upon the
                    written word for our information. In Indiana we can also rely somewhat upon archeological methods
                    and research for our data. Archeology has been termed "frozen history" and when we
                    consider just what archeology really is the truth of the term becomes apparent. The archeologist
                    reads the words contained in the earth making up the habitation sites and burial places of
                    prehistoric peoples. The area under investigation is his volume and the articles left by the
                    aboriginal inhabitants are the words contained therein. This type of word is just as legible as that
                    of the printed record, if you know the language, provided of course, that the objects have not been
                    removed from their proper setting. It is merely a matter of interpretation and the transformation of
                    the earth-words to the printed form to make the story readable to all.</p>
            <p>It is the village sites with their ever present refuse deposits, either in heap or pit form, that we
                    must turn to obtain a record of the every day life of really prehistoric peoples in Indiana. From
                    excavations in prehistoric sites in Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> we have material evidence that corroborates in every way the printed accounts left us
                    from the early historic period.</p>
            <p>In practically every pit, bones of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> deer are found and figures show that this animal formed the major portion of the meat
                    diet of the Indians formerly inhabiting this area. Bones of the elk, squirrel, muskrat, woodchuck,
                    bear, panther and wildcat are found but in numbers far under those of the deer. It may be that the
                    smaller animals were more difficult to capture with primitive weapons than was the deer. The bones
                    of animals are almost always cracked open and crushed showing that the Indian did not overlook one
                    of the most wholesome portions of the animal, the marrow of the bones. The buffalo, always
                    associated with the Indian in mind at least, is rarely found in habitation sites east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. We know that the buffalo was present in this area in large numbers well back into the
                    proto-historic period and the absence of its bones from refuse deposits is somewhat of a puzzle. It
                    may be accounted for by a consideration of the size of the animal and by the difficulty that would
                    be entailed in bringing the body entire into the village. It may be that such meat as was desired
                    was stripped from the carcass at the point of capture and the residue left to be consumed by
                    carnivorous <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-029-2-022"/> animals and the elements. This is merely an
                    assumption however.</p>
            <p>The wild <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tu">turkey</region>
                    </placeName>, ducks of several varieties, the trumpeter swan, quails, partridges, pigeons and the
                    larger shore birds are represented in numbers in the pits. The bones of birds were largely used for
                    the manufacture of beads, bone awls and needles which may account for their comparative rarity to
                    those of animals, or again it may be due to difficulty of capture.</p>
            <p>Terrapin shells are found in numbers showing that these animals provided food. The shells also served
                    admirably as cups and small containers formed by cutting the marginal scutes and cleaning the
                    interior of the shell. Shells of the fresh water mussel are found on all sites in every locality
                    where that animal was obtainable. Judging from the amount of shells found the mussel was comparable
                    to the oyster of the east coast in point of popularity as a food. Huge heaps, composed almost
                    entirely of shells, isolated from village sites would indicate that the mussels were obtained and
                    dried at points were they were numerous and carried back to the habitation sites.</p>
            <p>Seeds of the paw paw, wild plum, wild grape and wild cherry have been found cached away under
                    circumstances that would indicate that the seeds had been preserved after the fruit had been
                    consumed. Hickory nuts, walnuts, butternuts and acorns are found in numbers. Corn and beans have
                    been found stored together in grass lined cache pits. Sunflower seeds, shells of gourds and squash
                    together with corn, corn cobs and nuts have been found in dry caves and rock shelters where
                    atmospheric conditions were conducive to their preservation.</p>
            <p>In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> County, just surveyed for the Indiana Historical Society, hickory nuts were found in
                    numbers in the pits of two village sites excavated. Corn was not found but shreds of pottery bearing
                    a form of decoration on the exterior surface that had been made while the clay was still plastic by
                    impressing a corn cob into the surface. This fact, together with the finding of many mortars and
                    pestles such as were used to grind corn, provides good presumptive evidence that corn was known and
                    used in the county during prehistoric times. It is also possible that wild rice abounded in the once
                    extensive <pb n="103" id="VAA4025-029-2-023"/> marshes in the county which fact, if true, would
                    account for the extreme density of aboriginal population as was revealed by the survey.</p>
            <p>A list of the agricultural items and their by-products, which were grown and formed a part of the
                    prehistoric American diet and in turn have become major items in our own diet, includes: maize or
                    corn of several varieties, white potato, meet potato, tomato, pumpkin, squash, lima bean, kidney
                    bean, Jerusalem artichoke, peppers, cassava (from which tapioca is made), cocoa, yam, yam-bean,
                    pineapple, strawberry, guava, the peanut and the avacado or alligator pear. Domestic animals and

            <p>Every item on our menu this evening with the exception of coffee and butter is typically American

                    indulge, chewing gum. The justification for including the last item is the chicle chewing habits of
                    the Indians of Central America.</p>

                    made on the east bank of Big Blue river about five miles north of the present city of Shelbyville.
                    The fame of this river was in time spread far and wide by the beautiful story, <hi rend="i">The

            <p>A few historical moorings will be helpful in taking us back to the time when Kingdom Church was

                    were later replaced with more "modern pews" made of wide boards. In the earliest

                    occasion when the members of the church were holding Quarterly Conference meeting at the church,
                    their proceedings were interrupted by the commotion made by hogs which had crowded together
                    underneath the building. Some members were delegated to drive the hogs from under the church after
                    which the meeting continued. This story is evidence that the structure rested on blocks or boulders
                    with an open space under the floor.</p>
            <p>The records which have been quoted show that the original name of the church group was "<placeName>

                    </placeName> Class" but that the name "Kingdom Class" soon became more
                    common. This latter name is not often heard among the younger members of the church today but is
                    familiar to the older residents of the community. The name Kingdom Class had a very interesting
                    origin. According to a common version of an oft repeated story John Carmony, Sr., was one of the
                    more prominent members of the early church and community. He was tall, husky, and strong. In fact he
                    is said to have had some resemblance to a giant. He had long arms, could lift more than any of the
                    other men, and could chop a log in two with an axe quicker than any competitor in the neighborhood.
                    At wood choppings, log rollings, and other pioneer doings he excelled. His fellow pioneers noticed
                    this superiority and decided to crown him king. Therefore a wreath of leaves was prepared and placed
                    upon his head as a crown. From this time on he came to be known as the "King," the
                    community as the "Kingdom" neighborhood, the church as the "Kingdom
                    Church," and the cemetery as the "Kingdom Burial Ground."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Though this particular family has not become famous for producing additional giants,
                    the story, with the embellishments added by time, is good evidence that these pioneer fathers could
                    enjoy themselves abundantly.</p>

                        <p>I can remember that when possibly four or five years old I begged to go with father to a
                            prayer meeting at the old Kingdom Church, Father led me by one hand and carried an old tin
                            lantern with a tallow candle in it in the other, and walked through timber a direct route. A
                            part of the time the door of the lantern was left open to get more light. We were the first
                            to arrive at the church and father took his tallow candle out of the lantern, turned the
                            lighted end down and let the melted tallow fall on a little board projecting from the wall a
                            few feet above the floor and then, he turned the lighted end up and placed the other in the
                            melted tallow and then the candle sat upright, Others coming soon did the same thing. There
                            was a wonderfully good prayer meeting that night.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

            <p>There is much evidence to indicate that enthusiasm played a very important part in the services of
                    the old church. Meetings were very informal. Those in the "Amen Corner" felt free
                    to express themselves and the success or failure of the sermon upon the congregation was generally
                    considered to be determined to a great extent by the amount of enthusiasm displayed. Testimony
                    meetings which still form a part of the prayer meeting service and occasionally of other services,
                    were times especially dear to many members. During revivals or protracted meetings testimonies were
                    encouraged. A revival which could not stimulate such enthusiasm was generally conceded to be a
                    failure.</p>
            <p>It seems that a member named Nathan Young was well known in the community for his long prayers. A
                    common version of an oft repeated story tells how some of the members having arrived late for a
                    service were obliged to wait at the church door for Nathan to cease praying. One member becoming
                    impatient asked: "How long will it be before Nathan stops praying?" A friend
                    replied, "I don't know. I wasn't here when he started but I know that
                    he usually prays about forty-five minutes." With a liberal deduction for exaggeration, it
                    would seems that Nathan's prayers must have been long enough! There were in early
                    churches seldom enough song books to go around and Old Kingdom Church was no exception. It was
                    customary for the minister or song leader to read two lines <list type="footnotes">

                    lines. Then the leader would read again and the congregation follow in song, and so on to the end.
                    This process of lining a hymn did not need to be repeated very many times until the song would be
                    "learned by heart." And on many occasions song services became so informal that
                    some one would lead out spontaneously in singing a song knowing that the others would join in
                    unison. When the pastor was not present it was not at all uncommon for some member of the
                    congregation, or some visiting brothers to take charge of the services. There were likely to be
                    several "exhorters" in any community. Sermons were preached from the heart as
                    directed by the will of God. To depend upon human strength, and especially to resort to the use of
                    notes, for a sermon was considered a sign of weakness.</p>
            <p>In doctrine and dogma, any local Church of the United Brethren sect has always been governed by the
                    discipline of its denomination. The dogmas and doctrines of this sect have been very conservative
                    but strongly humanitarian. As early as 1821, the general conference of the denomination passed a
                    resolution severely condemning slavery. The resolution which was adopted barred slaveholders from
                    membership in the church and required that those who already owned slaves either manumit them or
                    lose their membership. The same general conference wrote in the minutes "that neither

                    which had become the successor of the old Kingdom Church in 1854. This session took a very strong
                    stand against the use of liquor, called for a more strict observance of the Sabbath, and adopted a

                    Prior to the Civil War, there was opposition to Free Masonry but it was many years before it became
                    a disruptive force in the church.</p>
            <p>Early in its history, the Church of the Brethren had developed two major factions relative to the
                    attitude that should be taken by the denomination toward membership of Christians in secret
                    societies. One faction opposed secret orders as being unchristian and hence not to be tolerated in
                    either the laity or clergy of the church. Another group, which constantly grew in numbers, believed
                    that secret orders were not inconsistent with Christian ideals. The former group became known as
                    "radicals"; the latter as "liberals". For many years annual
                    conferences were moved by the mighty undertow of this factional struggle. Not long before 1890, the
                    "liberals" won control of the general conference and made membership in secret
                    orders permissable according to the discipline of the church.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Immediately
                    court trials were instituted in various churches of several Conferences. Almost all of these trials
                    resulted in victory for the "liberal" element.</p>
            <p>It is not surprising that this struggle had its repercussion at <geogName>Blue River</geogName>
                    Chapel. In 1887, two years before the "liberals" had won formal control of the

                    membership in the old church. They organized a separate congregation and built a church at Mt.
                    Carmel, about three miles northwest of <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Chapel. This church was in
                    use for about two decades. For many years the feeling between the two churches was very unfriendly.
                    However this feeling disappeared in time and gradually most of the radicals returned to the old
                    church, though a few refused. Some even declared that the "liberals" were using
                    stolen property. Today one could belong to the church and never hear anything of this struggle which
                    occurred less than a half century ago.</p>

               <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Chapel was erected two years later. It is located almost exactly one
                    mile south and one mile east of the place where the old log building of Kingdom Church stood. Eli
                    Myer and his wife gave the land upon which the church was built, The new church, a large frame
                    structure, was erected at a cost of about $1,700. It is probable that some services were
                    held in the log church (Old Kingdom Church) after 1854. During the later fifties, a Mr. Walker and
                    family lived in the old church, These people raised geese which were often kept in one corner of the
                    building. This old log church house probably stood for many years after 1854.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Thomas Evans was pastor when <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Chapel was built. The Rev. John
                    Smith dedicated the church. Mrs. Angeline Copple Phares, who died a few years ago, attended the
                    dedicatory service. She told the writer of this article that she recalled the text used by the Rev.
                    Smith, which was Ephesians 2:19-22. Three annual sessions of the <placeName>

            <p>At some date between 1880 and 1890, the Chapel was remodeled. At that time a belfry was added and a
                    bell placed on the church. One of the members protested against this departure and in his stuttering
                    and stammering manner suggested "that one might travel from A to Isarel and never see a
                    thing like that on a church." Near the close of the first decade of the present century,
                    the church was again remodeled. The first piano used in the church was given by Levi Myer in 1920.
                    Be fore that time an organ had been used for many years. In 1929 the church received
                    $1000 dollars from the will of Alfred Dyer. This money was used to make needed repairs
                    and improvements in the Chapel building.</p>

            <p>Today <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Chapel is a typical rural church located in what is normally a

                    services. The church stands today as a symbol of the idealism and religious zeal of the community.
                    Like all other rural churches, it does not possess the influence over the community which it
                    exercised in pioneer days. It has been compelled to divide its influence with the school, the press,
                    and other agencies. However, there is no doubt but what Kingdom Church has served as a leaven for
                    good. Hundreds of lives have been touched and made better through its influence. <geogName>Blue

                    thousand acres could be sold for immediate use. These were sold for less than enough to pay for the
                    erection of the building,<hi rend="sup">42</hi> while lands leased were let on, terms that brought
                    in almost no returns to the University.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> A petition to Congress in 1817,

            <p>Old houses in various stages of decay or decrepitude have a pathetically human appeal. Windowless
                    casements are suggestive of empty eye-sockets in a human skull—an eloquent epitome of all
                    the significance of the phrase, "has been."</p>
            <p>On the river front of the "upper grade" at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, is an old two-story brick home where I used to play with a childhood friend.
                    Then houses were simply houses to me. For some time past, however, thoughts of that old building
                    have haunted me. I have tried to recall and knit together the things that I know about
                    it—memories more or less tennous, floating about in my subconscious mind.</p>
            <p>From an old friend, Mrs. Nora Lewis Duprez, who is a sort of repository of much of the romance of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history, I have obtained bits of information which I have pieced together
                    to supplement my own knowledge. This old house was built about ten years before the Civil War by a
                    rich Englishman by the name of Joshua Smithson. Through all the changing years and various
                    occupancies, the old home has always been known as the "Joshua Smithson Place."
                    Smithson started the first coal business in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a Universalist and, with two-thirds of his estate, endowed a college where
                    students of his denomination might obtain an education. To the endowment, Mrs. Smithson, after the
                    death of her husband added the whole of her inheritance, which was valued at several thousands of
                    dollars. The institution was located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName> on a high bluff overlooking the common valley of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its tributary, the <geogName>Eel River</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This worthy

                        <hi rend="sup">1</hi> An early catalogue of Smithson College states: "Although
                                not the largest contributors Mr. and Mrs. Smithson were the first and hence became
                                entitled to have their names permanently attached to the institution." This
                                catalogue (1872-3) was probably the first one issued for in it I find that "the
                                building is not quite finished." It describes at some length how complete the
                                structure was to be in every detail "when the designs are rounded out"
                                and "that every care has been taken to produce the most perfect college edifice
                                in the west." Hopeful, old builders, proud and happy in your self-sacrifice 1
                                No doubt YOU thought YOU were building forever and who knows but what you did in the
                                life purposes of at least some of the students even if the school, itself, did not see
                                the stars out, as no doubt you fondly hoed?</p>
                            <p>The catalogue adds that the building is "arranged to board two hundred pupils of
                                both sexes." "A Lady Principal" who will have especial care
                                of the young ladies, is naively mentioned. Board and light, fuel and laundry were all to
                                be had for the modest sum of five dollars a week and tuition for all regular courses was
                                ten dollars per term. Carpets seem to have come extra. Stress is somewhat severely
                                placed on this and also on the fact that each student must be altogether responsible for
                                his own soap.</p>
                            <p>It is interesting to note that a commercial course was included at that early date rind
                                that the range of studies was broad, embracing mathematics, science, ancient and modern
                                languages, music. art, some history and English, all of which was to be administered by
                                a staunch little band of seven as a faculty.</p>

                    </placeName>, his home, but left a sum of money to be used in the construction of a church for the
                    Universalists of the community. The congregation which worshipped in the edifice so generously
                    provided "waxed fine in degrees and visibly less," a thing which the donor of the
                    church fund may have feared since his bequest carried a special proviso. This was to the effect that
                    should it turn out that the building could not be kept for the designated purpose, it was to be sold
                    and the proceeds turned over to the College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Though the church had to be sold, it was impossible to carry out the above mentioned
                    stipulation for the reason that the college faded out before the sale of the church.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As my mind runs over the life of Mr. Smithson, I feel like exclaiming: "Bravo, old Joshua!
                    You kept the home fires burning for the good people of <placeName>

                    learning and religion in the adopted state of your foster country. Nor should I forget to express
                    gratitude to you, Mrs. Joshua, who so loyally followed your husband in the support of his high
                    purpose."</p>
            <p>On a July evening of last summer, I wandered down to that once picturesque "upper
                    grade," now utilized for corn fields, accompanied by a friend, Mrs. Kathryn Leitch, who,
                    although she did not share my memories, was a keenly sympathetic companion. Walking slowly over a
                    winding dirt road, I made my way after a lapse of many years to the Smithson home to revive happy
                    childhood memories. The house, alas, <list type="footnotes">

                            different from what it means now, 88 it was provided for the Freshman Class. <p>[The
                                statements in the catalogue relative to the building were correct. It was a large
                                structure of four stories, equipped with offices, recitation rooms. an assembly hall,
                                large dining hall and kitchen, and many rooms of reasonable size for the use of
                                students. Everything was under one roof. Students were obliged: to carry all the water
                                used in their rooms from a well or cistern in the college yard. Those who were domiciled
                                on the third or fourth floor were at considerable inconvenience. The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> spent about a week in a room on the third floor of this building shortly
                                after being graduated from the Delphi High School. The institution was then known 88 the
                                American Normal College, this being a short-lived school that made use of the building
                                following the period of the Smithson College. The building was destroyed by fire in the
                                nineties].</p>

                    grandame "sans teeth," etc., it still preserves a bit of the grand air.</p>
            <p>Those who dwell in the old home today are humble folk from somewhere across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. The front door can no longer be entered as the high stone steps have disappeared. At
                    our approach a dog barked, children's faces appeared at the door and we half feared that
                    the dog might be allowed to drive us away. Instead we were asked to "come around the
                    house" where by fragile, temporary, wooden steps we reached the latticed back porch. Here
                    we were welcomed by a woman, two boys of ten and twelve, and a demure little maiden of three. There
                    was an aged grandmother, too, who kept her seat, but was cordial, nevertheless, as Kentuckians of
                    whatever age or condition so well know how to be.</p>
            <p>We were allowed to make a tour of the rooms of the lower floor, but it gave me a queer catch in the
                    throat to contrast the <hi rend="i">now</hi> with the <hi rend="i">then.</hi> Still the old hall,
                    that runs straight through the middle of the building which is two-rooms deep, seemed almost human
                    in its determination to keep up a bold front in spite of adversity. The front parlor on the right,
                    long bereft of its former state, aristocratic horse-hair furniture and all, had sunk to the level of
                    a mere bedroom thus becoming no better than the room just behind it. On the left of the hall, the
                    large cheerful living room yet retained, though its past glory had departed, its wonderful view of
                    the hills and more distant lands beyond. The old room reminded me somehow of persons whose optimism
                    is so fine that nothing can destroy it. Just behind the living room was the room now used
                    continuously as the kitchen, the old days of the lean-to summer kitchen having passed with the
                    coming of oil and gas stoves.</p>
            <p>Stepping back into the hall again, it was almost more than I could do to resist the invitation of the
                    beckoning stairway to go up to the four large, airy rooms, where we used to play when the weather
                    did not charm us out to make mud-pies and bake them in the furnaces that we were able to contrive. I
                    almost heard, or seemed to hear, the voice of the little girl, Abby, calling to
                    me—"Come on up. We are waiting for you." The years between held me back
                    and the sacks and junk piled <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-029-2-045"/> on the steps stayed me, but I
                    thought wistfully of the soul of Abby who has been waiting <hi rend="i">up yonder</hi> these many
                    years.</p>
            <p>Somewhat overcome with memories of the past my mind returned to the present and I went out in the
                    yard. Uncared for or converted into vast bunch-bean gardens at front and side, the beauty of other
                    days was gone, but as our hostess proudly pointed out there was "nary a weed" in
                    the garden plots. When in childhood I played about this old place with little Abby, I never heard of
                    Joshua Smithson or what he did for the uplift of Universalist youths (Little children, absorbed in
                    the demands of dolls and toys, take no heed of such things), so my pilgrimage to the house-he-built
                    must make amends and express my gratitude to him and his relict, as well as furnish me a glance
                    backward towards my lost early girlhood.</p>
            <p>Joshua Smithson and another Englishman, a Mr. Cookson, married sisters by the name of Goddard,
                    cousins of Mrs. Sarah Northcott Patton, who in turn was an aunt of Mrs. Nora Duprez. Cookson was a
                    younger son of a noble family with no hope of the title, who came to America to make his fortune.
                    Instead he lost what he had in unprofitable business ventures. He and Smithson first started woolen
                    mills above the town of Ghent in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but lost heavily. In later years Cookson was found serving in a more or less menial
                    position in the woolen mills owned and operated by the Schofields of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Cookson ancestral home in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake</region>
                    </placeName> District and the younger son who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> had known personally the poets of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Lake</region>
                    </placeName> School and other famous people. Mrs. Patton was shown letters and pictures of the
                    Cookson estate which proved the truth of these claims, but it was the fate of the young man who came
                    to America full of hope to end his career on a minor note. His misfortune inspires a feeling of
                    sympathy and pity, not only for him, but for all who fail because of unpreparedness or from a too
                    generous trust imposed in others.</p>
            <p>Not far from the Smithson house was another old mansion of the long ago. It was always called the
                    McMakin Home though it was built by Vincent &amp; four. This young man was the only child of
                    John James Dufour, eldest of the Dufour family who came to. America from <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. He founded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> in Switzerlard County in 1799 naming the place from a city in his native country. Young
                    Vincent, who was <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-029-2-046"/> trained in a military school in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, was at twenty-eight a captain in the army. He knew nothing of money making, but as his
                    father did and he was the only heir, he got on very well. He was captain of the company of Swiss
                    Artillery of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> that went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to welcome Marquis de <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> on his visit to this country in 1824. Captain Dufour was introduced to the famous
                    general by his father who had known <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and the Marquis did him the honor to say that his company was the most active in
                    artillery tactics of any company he had met on that trip to America.</p>
            <p>When the Captain built his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> there was a Dufour in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> who was a famous designer of wall paper and so Vincent and his good wife, Annie, sent
                    there for the paper for their hall. It depicted a series of hunting scenes and was a great marvel to
                    the good citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It lasted, strange to say, almost as long as the house. The writer remembers to have
                    been taken there as a child to see that wonderful paper which at that time, swayed from the walls,
                    in places like tapestry in a breeze. The place was then deserted and the rooms seemed sad and
                    haunted by the life of the past. Later when I read DeQuincy's description of the
                    abandoned old house in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he took refuge in the time of his run-away, vagrant boyhood, thoughts of this old
                    place near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> came to mind.</p>
            <p>The shadow of misfortune brooded over that roof-tree in the more or less tragically ended lives of
                    the family of McMakins but, as great writers sometimes say in books—"all that is
                    another story." A daughter of the house, the last to live there, was at one time in her
                    young womanhood said to be the village belle; the prettiest girl in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> who spent money like "a house afire." The oldest inhabitants still
                    tell about her attending an Inaugural Ball in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>, and her white satin gown worn on that occasion was the talk of the town for years. In
                    some unexplainable way the threads of her life became inextricably entangled and she finally sank to
                    a marriage much beneath her social level, as a consequence of which she became lost to her former
                    friends. I still retain a faint memory of her pathetic, violet-purple eyes and the tremulous lips of
                    her ill-fated old age which inspired an incredulous wonder at the reputed triumphs of her youth.</p>
            <p>These two stately old houses faced the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-029-2-047"/> along their front ran the "upper grade," a dignified
                    stretch of beach, lined with beech trees, that as children, innocent of the mysterious intricacies
                    of the black art of spelling, we used to think achieved their name from the fact that they grew on
                    the beach. Along this path, those citizens who loved "Old Man Ribber" and his
                    moods used to stroll, in family groups on Sunday afternoons. The "Old Man" in his
                    spring freshet showed no respect for these houses but rose in his might against them, flooding them
                    to the upper story and yet they calmly and patiently kept their poise, emerging from these
                    onslaughts, apparently not much the worse for their contact with the raging floods, so well had the
                    pioneers builded.</p>
            <p>Gone is the beach, either washed away by the waters or hidden by the cornfields and underbrush. Gone
                    is the old Mc-Makin House and the famous wall paper, the pride of fair Annie Dufour's
                    heart and the wonder of the town. Long dismantled and deserted, haunted by derelicts, the midnight
                    scene of suspected orgies, a disgrace to the pioneer citizens who built it, it was swept away in a
                    purifying blaze, kindled no doubt, by the carelessness of some vagrant's hand. It
                    resisted for years the violence of water only to meet its destined end as the victim of fire. And so
                    its tale is told. The old Joshua Smithson House deprived of its companions still courageously faces
                    sturdy old age with what seems almost human fortitude.</p>

            <p>The annual pilgrimage of the Indiana Historical Society, to which members of the Society of Indiana

                    </placeName> the party stayed at the Hotel Del Prado, Hyde Park Boulevard Chicagoand Fifty-third
                    St., where it was joined by a number who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> by automobile. Altogether there were seventy-five or more persons who participated.

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to spend more time in the new building of the <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Benton</region>
                    </placeName> depicting the development of the state, was as an interesting meeting place for the
                    party which otherwise separated, interesting each going his own way through the Century of Progress.
                    The Society was favored by a cool spell of weather which made conditions ideal during the whole of
                    the trip. It was generally voted one of the most pleasant, interesting; and successful of all the
                    pilgrimages of the Society.</p>
            <p>The office of the Indiana Historical Society on June 20 was moved, with the Historical Bureau, into
                    the new State Library and Historical Building, Senate Avenue and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Historical Bureau will have the northeast corner of the top floor. The building is
                    not yet completed but the former office at 334 State House had to be given up as part of the change
                    incident to the creation of the Gross Income and Sales Tax Bureau.</p>
            <p>The William Henry Smith Memorial Library of the Indiana Historical Society has asquired from the
                    Borden Collection, <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-029-2-049"/> a copy of the first English edition of
                    Audubon's <hi rend="i">Birds of America.</hi> This is a rarity among collectors and is
                    believed to be the only set in the state.</p>

                    </placeName>, is conducting field work this summer for the Archaeological Section of the Society. He
                    is making a survey of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dearborn</region>
                    </placeName> County and part of the surrounding area. The southeastern part of Indiana is tied very
                    closely in its prehistory with southwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> lying across the river from these two sections. It is not unlikely that Mr. Black will
                    discover interesting cultural connections between the prehistory of the inhabitants of this section
                    of the state and tribes whose remains have been studied more intensively and are better known.</p>

                    century and therefore considerably older than himself, they seem to have felt an unusual interest in
                    the younger man from the Hoosier state who was the sole representative from his state of the growing
                    Free Soil movement that was destined to play havoc with both the Whig and Democratic parties within
                    the ensuing decade. Julian always looked back upon this association with grateful appreciation. With
                    Giddings the tie was destined to be a close one. Of Charles <placeName>

            <p>Congress had convened more than two weeks earlier, Mr. Julian's presence having been
                    delayed by a serious illness caused from over-work in the campaign. He had suffered several

                    fifty-seven places" and applied croton oil copiously. In spite of this heroic treatment and
                    the exhausting journey he was able to take his seat in the House on the very day of his arrival. He
                    was then thirty-two years of age, while Mrs. Julian was twenty-two. They had left a three-years-old

                    famous Compromise measures. Those which were concessions to slaveholders were opposed by the few
                    Free Soil members with as much force as they could muster, but of course vainly. It was in this

                                    day or so longer. I spent that evening at Daniel Neel's delightfully and
                                    know you would have enjoyed it much. Dr. Elder, a glorious fellow whom I wish you
                                    might have met, and Charles Wright, (formerly of Indiana and a son of Peter Wright)
                                    and his wife took tea with us, Mrs. Neel and I leading the way to the dining-room.
                                    The Neel home is adorned with rare paintings and statuary, and they are great lovers
                                    of music. I learned from them and others that it is very common among the Hicksite
                                    Quakers to have a piano and also regular dancing parties among the young and newly
                                    married. How different is such Quakerism from that to which we have been accustomed!</p>

                                            suffrage for women. Keenly interested in the antislavery movement, she
                                            identified herself with the little Free Soil coterie that met at Dr.
                                            Bailey's home about which she wrote interesting reminiscences
                                            many years later. She died in 1904, her later years having been spent
                                            chiefly in <placeName>

                                            kept up an occasional correspondence with her until his death in 1899. The
                                            Mrs. Bailey was the wife of Dr. Gamaliel Bailey, editor of the <hi rend="i">National Era.</hi>

                        <p>Yours of the 16th came last night, greatly relieving my mind, for I expected to hear
                                    sooner. I shall take much pleasure in reading your "magnificent

                        <p>I was <hi rend="i">afraid</hi> Centreville would seem dull to you. You know I have
                                    always had a fear that we should never again be satisfied with the former monotony
                                    of our village life. It may however turn out otherwise. After you have again become
                                    accustomed to the old ways YOU may feel differently, but the symptoms are
                                    unfavorable at present.</p>
                        <p>The weather here is oppressively hot and the other day I went down on the Avenue and
                                    ordered a summer sack-coat and pantaloons. My new shoes are made, and with the new

                                    and I should of course prefer to stay all summer rather than adjourn on such terms.
                                    Many members seem to think we shall not get away before October. What a gloomy

                        <p>Both Houses adjourned today about half past one o'clock in consequence of
                                    a report that the President is dying.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> I have just heard that
                                    he is a little better, but it is not at all probable that, he will survive the
                                    night. His disease in the beginning was something very much like cholera, which has
                                    been followed by fever and a sudden prostration of all his faculties. But you will
                                    have heard of his death and attendant circumstances long before this will reach you.
                                    It will produce a great sensation in the present state of affairs. The balance of
                                    this week will be pretty much occupied with the funeral services, the ceremonies of
                                    inducting the new President, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>It is not quite so hot for the past two or three days. As yesterday was resolution
                                    day I hoped something would be done on the subject of adjourning, but nobody seems
                                    to think about it any more. So I must give it up. And I suppose I must give you up
                                    too since there seems to be no way of your getting here without too great peril to
                                    yourself. I am too lonely here at Mrs. Spriggs and have a notion to follow Giddings
                                    and <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                                    </placeName> to Lamb's, as they urge me to do. I know I should feel more
                                    at home there, but should be sorry to leave Mrs. Spriggs. What do you think about
                                    it?</p>
                        <p>I walked down on the Avenue [<placeName>

                                    </placeName>] last evening after dark and was considerably startled as I passed
                                    along the south side about opposite Gadsby's by the sight of a lot of
                                    coffins leaning up against a building,—those hideous looking metallic
                                    ones; but glancing above the door I saw the sign "Undertakers"
                                    which explained the matter. These coffins have been placed here since the sickly
                                    season set in. What an exhibition of hardware!</p>

                        <p>In consequence of the excessive dust and a slight indisposition I did not join in the
                                    procession today nor attend the funeral at the Presidential mansion. I was really
                                    not able. I took my position at my window here at Mrs. Spriggs' and had a
                                    good view of the immense throng that formed the procession and filled the streets
                                    and sidewalks on either side. The military under command of General <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                                    </placeName> made a fine appearance, and as the train moved slowly along the bells
                                    of the city tolled and minute-guns were fired, adding to the impressiveness of the
                                    occasion. The coffin was not one of the new-fashioned metallic ones, or if it was
                                    there was an outer one of the ordinary shape enclosing it. It appeared to be covered
                                    with black crape or muslin and was placed on the top of a peculiarly constructed
                                    chariot, high up from the ground and drawn by eight white horses, each horse being
                                    held at the mouth by a darkie. Old Whitey followed next, as fine-looking a horse as
                                    I ever saw.—But I need not tell you anything further about the
                                    ceremonies, as the papers will give all details in due season.</p>
                        <p>As to the Old General, I have a good deal of respect for him. He did not hesitate to
                                    antagonize the South by his action on <placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                                    </placeName>. Considering his southern position he did well, and the Free Soilers
                                    have given him due credit. In fancy I see his iron-grey hair and smiling benevolent
                                    face as he appeared the night you and I attended our first levee, and
                                    notwithstanding the harsh things I have said about him I believe he meant to do his
                                    duty as he said.</p>
                        <p>Your Fourth of July was about as I anticipated. Your reply to the Colonization folks
                                    was exactly right. The idea of collecting money on such a day for such a scheme is
                                    abominable, and I am astonished that the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> people would encourage such a piece of business. They ought to have
                                    remembered the declaration of John Quincy <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Adams</region>
                                    </placeName> that the Colonization scheme is a project of the slaveholders to
                                    strengthen and perpetuate American slavery.</p>
                        <p>I shall seek an opportunity, since you wish it, to become acquainted with Miss Bremer
                                    and will also try to follow your advice to mingle more in society. It would probably
                                    be good for me, but I have spent too much of my life, my "glorious youthful
                                    prime", in the solitude to which I was driven by my timid nature, my
                                    cowardly fear of man and women. <pb n="141" id="VAA4025-029-2-061"/> I have done
                                    much to conquer nature and to neutralize the effects of an education which made no
                                    effort to save me from my besetting sin; but I can never hope to be the man I might
                                    have been with proper early education. Let us remember these things in
                                    "training up in the way he should go" <hi rend="i">our</hi> little
                                    scion, whom we may thus save from a world of suffering and self-conflict and at the
                                    same time help to give him the full stature of manhood for which he may be fitted by
                                    natural endowments.</p>

                                    Allen is going home soon for a visit, and urges me to accompany him.</p>
                        <p>Congress is wagging along as usual, with no sign of an adjournment. I was again at
                                    Dr. Bailey's last evening, with <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                                    </placeName> and Giddings. We found Chase, Hale,<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
                                    "Grace Greenwood" and a number of others there and had a spirited
                                    talk, I have not yet been introduced to Miss Bremer and probably shall not be, as I
                                    am informed she leaves tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>The weather here has turned cooler since the late remarkable storm which lasted more
                                    than twenty-four hours, and I learn from all quarters that the cholera is abating. I
                                    no longer fear its coming here and probably our worst trouble will be the dreadful
                                    billions diseases which set in about the first of August.</p>
                        <p>But I must conclude…. There seems nothing interesting to write about. We
                                        <hi rend="i">have</hi> nothing but politics, politics, politics. You wished me

                                    </placeName>, and having left me when I most wanted you it seems to me you ought to
                                    give me something better than "scraps" to live on. Think of this,
                                    and of how I must feel to be so far and so long away from you and our boy. Give me
                                    good long letters and I will <hi rend="i">try</hi> to reciprocate.</p>

                        <p>Hon. Daniel P. King, a Whig member of Congress from Massachuetts fifty years of age,
                                    died recently at his home as I have just learned. He was sick when he left here, of
                                    the prevailing diarrhea, but reached home, when he became worse. Several other
                                    members are sick. Mr. Hackett<hi rend="sup">34</hi> has the consumption and it is

                        <p>When this letter reaches you it will be two months since we separated, and it seems
                                    to me sometimes as if we are becoming strangers. "When shall <hi rend="i">we thee</hi> meet again?" When shall I return to that dull old town
                                    that I was so eager to get away from and that now seems to me so precious? The

                                    at the beginning of the session. Nothing yet done and unless we should break up in a

                                    Channing's illness, but glad you are about again. I shall feel uneasy
                                    till I hear again, for I have no doubt you are in more danger of cholera there than

                        <p>You speak of your dread of letter writing. You should shake it off at once, for the
                                    more you yield to it the more you will dislike to write. You have now got your hand
                                    in and the only way to succeed is to persevere. Habit will make it all easy. Am
                                    sorry you feel so lonely and as if you had few friends. We <hi rend="i">want</hi>
                                    but few intimates, and besides, Centre-ville is not the whole county or district, in
                                    which we have any quantity of the right sort. Moreover, we shall always have as many
                                    as we want <hi rend="i">they-e.</hi> For my part I am attached to the soil on which
                                    I was torn and at present have no desire to leave it. I would rather remain there
                                    than go anywhere else. I know of no better country than the West, and that
                                    particular part of it where our lot has been cast.</p>
                        <p>You make out a pretty plausible case in favor of my being reconciled to remain here a
                                    while longer. I am willing provided I can have health. I feel sad to hear that
                                    Channing is so unmanageable and doesn't seem to care a snap for me: this
                                    makes me long more than ever to go home and help mould his developing character.
                                    Watch over him, keep him child-like and innocent, and don't allow him to
                                    be influenced by bad associations.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

                                    else does so and in the course of about a week, if 1 should feel pretty well and the

                                    squally. Everything may come right by another year, but I have not much hope of it,
                                    and the more I look forward to the uncertain future the more thankful I am for the
                                    past, which has gone to record and cannot be recalled. I am truly sorry for Vaile

                                    the small vote he received, he <hi rend="i">needs</hi> the office for which he was
                                    defeated, and is fitted for it.</p>
                        <p>I am much pleased with what you say about our Channing. His question, "Is he
                                    like he been?" has edified me greatly and has given me a better idea of him

                                    when we are so hurried to get through. You will see it in the Globe and probably in

                    friends. Nearly all of his callers wished to hear further about his experiences of the past ten

                        <p>I arrived here last night at 8 o'clock, bruised and fatigued beyond an
                                    former experience. I passed over the mountains in the night, and such jolting you
                                    can hardly imagine. I can scarcely get up or down and shall probably be a pretty
                                    respectable cripple for a week or more, but am thankful to be safely at the end of
                                    my trip. I am at Mr. Colbert's boarding house quite near the Capitol,

                                        <region type="county">Allen</region>
                                    </placeName> until we engage permanent quarters. The Public Grounds look most
                                    delightful and so does the whole city. I am captivated with its appearance from the
                                    Capitol, —its fine public buildings, broad streets and
                                    "magnificent distances." Centreville seems to me more
                                    insignificant than ever and you don't know how I shall pity you if you
                                    should have to remain there all winter.</p>

                        <p>Politically, I know of nothing new except a speech today in Committee of the Whole by
                                    Mr. Giddings, called forth by the final portion of the President's
                                    Message commending the late Compromise. Mr. Giddings again called attention to the
                                    fact that the Free Soilers have no slightest disposition to interfere with Slavery
                                    in the States where it exists: they would leave it where the Constitution leaves it,
                                    but they do not propose to turn out and help Southern slaveholders capture their
                                    runaways. The speech was not treated with the respect it deserved and I believe
                                    there is a more proscriptive and intolerant feeling towards the Free Soilers than
                                    ever before. They are determined to keep down "agitation," but
                                    they will fail in their purpose.</p>

                                            hopeful that Democrats would again fuse with Free Soilers in the district.
                                            He saw the possibility that the Democrats might run a candidate of their

                        <p>For several days I have heard nothing but talk about the "divine
                                    Jenny" who is to leave this morning, I hear. She was in our gallery
                                    yesterday and such a hubbub in the Hall I have never seen. No mortal is so idolized.
                                    Giddings and Durkee went to hear her last night and were of course enchanted, as I
                                    was [when] in <placeName>

                                    album to Willard's [Hotel] and obtained her autograph as follows:
                                    "In kind remembrance of Jenny Lind. <placeName>

                        <p>Yesterday soon after the House met I was called to the door by Will Woods<hi rend="sup">64</hi>. I was surprised of course to see him. He heard
                                    "Jenny" last night and agrees with others as to her singing, but
                                    declares she is homely. I believe he is here on some patent business.</p>
                        <p>I forgot to tell you that when I last called on the Underwoods I met Tom's
                                    wife who is very pleasant and who spoke of seeing you in <placeName>

                        <p>Your long wished-for letter dated Dec. 19 came last evening. I am pleased with what
                                    you say about politics and "the quiet joys of home." It will be
                                    fortunate if our political experience shall have the effect of making us more
                                    contented with private life than we might otherwise have been. The tone of your
                                    letter, your disposition to jest with untoward circumstances, pleases me. You have
                                    more philosophy under trials generally than I have. So Channing talks about me! I
                                    wish I had him here to <hi rend="i">tousle</hi> with! It is strange that you have
                                    not received any papers yet, for I have sent a number, some of real interest. I have
                                    not seen Stitt's puff of Ob.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> and wish you would
                                    send me the paper.</p>
                        <p>The weather is cold here, but my health is excellent. I walk with the Judge about
                                    four miles every day, and eat <hi rend="i">some.</hi>

                                    lemonade &amp;c. The doctor has moved on to E St. and purchased one of the
                                    finest houses there. He is evidently getting to be one of the city's
                                    aristocracy. A beautiful life-size portrait of "Grace Greenwood"
                                    hangs in a gilt frame above his mantel. We next called to see Senator <placeName>

                                    We then went to the President's where we found a much greater jam than a
                                    year ago. With difficulty we passed through the different rooms, shaking hands with
                                    the President, Henry Clay and others. General Scott was there in full military dress
                                    and made a fine appearance, attracting more attention than any one else except Clay.
                                    I returned home tired enough. But when Mrs. Underwood called and invited Will Woods
                                    and me to take tea with them I sallied forth again. We were feasted to all sorts of
                                    music, the whole family joining either with instruments or voices, and the exercises
                                    were concluded by the appearance of Harriet and Jack<hi rend="sup">69</hi> disguised
                                    in the most hideous false faces, who sang and danced. It was a lively evening and I
                                    returned home at nine o'clock. Mrs. Underwood informed me that Mary

                        <p>….. Last evening I called at Mr. Cushman's to see Miss Loring
                                    of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but she had gone to church. She has just come to town bringing a
                                    letter of introduction to me from Dr. Stone, one of my special friends there. I
                                    called again today and accompanied her and Miss Cushman to the Capitol, showing them
                                    sundry little attentions. I am to conduct them this evening to the Institute to hear
                                    the lectures. I <hi rend="i">fear</hi> I shall be under the necessity of taking them
                                    to the Levee next Friday (of course at some expense), but as Dr. Stone was
                                    exceedingly kind to me when I was in <placeName>

                                    </placeName> I must do what I can to show my appreciation.</p>
                        <p>I raised quite an excitement in the House today by presenting a petition from the
                                    Yearly Meeting of Antislavery Friends in Indiana praying the repeal of the Fugitive
                                    Slave law. I succeeded in having it read and in getting the yeas and nays on
                                    receiving it. Of course there was a hubbub and I was denounced for stirring up
                                    "agitation." Our own delegation is down on me….. I will

                                    the old parties to put me down. I see you expect to drive around with me in
                                    canvassing the district next summer, but I think the prospect much better for
                                    quitting politics entirely. I mean to take the straightforward course without regard
                                    to consequences.</p>
                        <p>I have twice accompanied Miss Loring and Miss Cushman to the Institute lectures and
                                    am to go with them to the Levee tomorrow evening. I received two cards today from

                                    accompanying regulations of the Dancing Academy which you may like to look over.</p>

                        <p>I have nothing to write today but some account of my feats in gallantry and wonderful
                                    adventures last evening. I am taking your advice about going into company and
                                    avoiding the "mopes," and if you will hold your breath now and
                                    promise not to be jealous I will proceed.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock Mr. Durkee and myself by previous arrangement got into the
                                    hack of Senator Foote's brother and drove to Mr. Cushman's,
                                    Mr. Durkee taking charge of Miss Cushman and I of Miss Loring. We had a pleasant
                                    chat on the way to the Presidential mansion and when we reached there we took the
                                    number of Master Foote's hack and went in. After our ladies had arranged
                                    their toilets we marched into the reception room, the way being led by a Mr. Thayer
                                    and Miss Brown who also went from Mr. Cushman's. The President saluted us
                                    very cordially. He knew me and after I had introduced Miss Loring he observed that
                                    he was "glad to see the East and West united." We then passed on
                                    to where Miss Fillmore [the President's daughter] was standing and I
                                    bowed to her and introduced Miss Loring. She appears very affable and graceful. We
                                    next went into the East Room where we saw the most brilliant gathering I have ever
                                    seen at a levee. The evening was mild and beautiful and everybody seemed to be there
                                    and very happy. We soon met General <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Houston</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and had considerable chat with the old fellow who is very bland and
                                        polite.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Passing round on the promenade (promenad they call
                                    it here) we presently saw General <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Scott</region>
                                    </placeName> talking with Mr. McLanahan who introduced us to the old General who
                                    chatted with us a short time. He is two or three inches taller than I am, and has a
                                    very stern look but with an expression of benevolence mingled with it. <list type="footnotes">

                                    met and conversed with divers others of less note in the East room which after
                                    awhile became too warm, and we took up our march in the large hall where it was
                                    cooler. "Grace Greenwood" was just leaving the hall in company
                                    with Dr. Bailey, but bowed gracefully, and a half hour later left the promenade to
                                    cross the room to where we were standing. She then had the arm of William D.

                                    </placeName> by illness. There is always an expression of sadness in her countenance
                                    even when engaged in sprightly conversation. There is a lurking sarcasm too in the
                                    curl of her lip. I wish you could see her. Well, we enjoyed the evening as everybody
                                    seemed to till after ten and after bowing to the President and his daughter we left
                                    for our hack. The darkeys rushed round us crying "Hack, sir!"
                                    "Hack, gentlemen" &amp;c, but our man Foote did not appear.
                                    Durkee told one of them we wanted Foote. He raised the cry
                                    "Foote!" "Foote!" and just then the Senator
                                    [Foote] came along, creating a roar of laughter. <hi rend="i">Our</hi> Foote at
                                    length drove up and we reached home in safety; and so ends my long yarn.</p>
                        <p>Later. At the close of the above Dr. Bailey sent up his card and on going to the
                                    parlor I found his errand was to invite all of us Free Soilers to his home Saturday
                                    night for talk and a cup of coffee. The invitation is for <hi rend="i">every</hi>
                                    Saturday night of the session.</p>
                        <p>Tom Thumb is in town creating some excitement. I saw his little ponies today, about
                                    as large as large dogs, hitched to his little hack which is about the size of the
                                    little wagons children are hauled in. He has an out-rider about his size and he sits
                                    inside. This may interest Channing.</p>

                        <p>I did not enjoy the party at Dr. Bailey's: it was too formal, and I do not
                                    like so much standing around and eating. Durkee and I called earlier in the evening
                                    to see our friends at Mr. Cushman's and were there introduced to a number
                                    of pleasant folks. Mr. Cushman teaches a school of young ladies in an apartment of
                                    his own house and they were all in the parlor in the most frolicsome mood. Some of
                                    them are handsome, and all seem intelligent. I bade Miss Loring good-bye, as she
                                    leaves tomorrow for her home, but it would not do for me to report what she told me
                                    some of the ladies at the levee said about me. So I will keep that: it might make
                                    you vain, or peradventure it would make you think <hi rend="i">me</hi> so! I expect
                                    to call on Mrs. Woolley some day this week; but perhaps you will think it about time
                                    to slacken my social pace a little. Giddings and Allen are both scolding and
                                    threatening to write you on the subject. They make much sport of the gallantry of

                                    The first exercise was fortune telling, which I shall not attempt to describe but
                                    will tell you all about it when I come home. Then commenced blind-folding one

                                    that "Grace Greenwood" considers Wendell Phillips far superior to
                                    Sumner. I was pleased when she told me that Mr. Phillips is warmly my friend.</p>

                        <p>A letter from Uncle Henry Hoover gives a gloomy picture of our Free Soil prospects.
                                    Things look unpromising, but I do not rely implicitly upon his judgment. If I can
                                    succeed at all next summer it will be by firmness, unanimity and <hi rend="i">faith</hi> on the part of the Free Soilers. Some of them are discouraged by the
                                    backward tendency of things, and this is likely to be the trouble. If they give up
                                    in despair of course they can't influence the action of the old parties.
                                    I am sorry they have not a little more pluck. Free Soil friends here are decidedly
                                    in favor of my going into the fight at all hazards, and they think that whether
                                    successful or not I will in the long run be the gainer.</p>
                        <p>On last Thursday evening Mr. Durkee and I accompanied Miss Susan Underwood, Mrs. Torn
                                    Underwood, and her sister Miss Wilson to the levee. They were the best-looking
                                    ladies there. Mrs. Underwood is creating quite a sensation at the levees and in the
                                    galleries of the house by her beauty. She is intelligent and agreeable too. There
                                    was a great crowd at the levee, but I saw nothing of special interest. They were
                                    nearly all strangers. Will Woods was there in company with his friend John Williams
                                    who is about exhibiting his Bible Panorama. He is a portrait painter and used to

                                    </placeName> County. His panorama is said to be the finest in the world and he has
                                    sent me a ticket.</p>
                        <p>We had a pleasant time at Dr. Bailey's last evening. Among other notable
                                    personages present there was a Polish lady, Madame Iazello, who came over to this
                                    country with Gen. Ughizey, and her conversation was interesting.</p>
                        <p>I am again becoming sick of Congress and begin to feel as I did during the long
                                    dreary months of last summer. I am tired of this way of living, having a wife, a
                                    child and a home, and yet separated from them.</p>

                                    I have seen in a private collection. One painting in particular, a beautiful woman

                                    especially as to eyes, forehead and hair. I have observed that paintings of female

                                    letter, which I presume you have received by this time. We Free Soilers did not like
                                    her at first: she is a "doughface." But our dislike has passed
                                    away on better asquaintance. I have sent you The <placeName>

                                    rather flattering terms of us "fanatics." Have confidence in
                                    yourself and you can write her a first rate letter.</p>

                                    comes I will send it to you. I am glad I made that speech and wish I had the means
                                    of circulating it more widely. By the way, some of my recent letters speak more
                                    hopefully of prospects at home. I don't see how I can avoid another
                                    contest, whether there is any prospect of success or not. Either Parker or Newman
                                    will be the Whig candidate [for Congress], and if I don't run there will
                                    be an end of our organization and a voluntary and cowardly surrender to the Whig
                                    hunkers. They would like that a little too well. I guess you must study politics
                                    again and be my oracle as to what is best to be done when I return.<hi rend="sup">81</hi>

                                            Burnt District in 1851. Julian was once more the candidate of Democrats and

                                    already been sufficiently tortured I consented to inhale ether so as to avoid the
                                    pain. The drowsiness which came on however was not deep enough, and the operation
                                    was horrible. So you see I have had rough handling, but am glad it is over and have

                                    will pass it on to you on my return. A friend of hers brought it to me and tells me

                        <p>Yesterday morning Mrs. Southworth was in the Library and sent for me to come in. She
                                    handed me your album with a beautiful sentiment of hers written in it on
                                    "Prayer." She is in poor health, and is naturally homely, yet when
                                    her face is lighted up in conversation she becomes quite handsome. She is a noble
                                    woman. She almost worships Dr. Channing, and says she was a hopeless skeptic till
                                    she read his works. All that she is she says she owes to his immortal lecture on
                                    "Self Culture." One of the pages now has your album and is
                                    carrying it around among the members and others. It will be quite a treasure if he

                                    "a bundle" for him, and being a servant of the people of course I
                                    must do it. I am indeed glad to hear of Dr. Pritchett's safe return. Some

                                    all night and probably part of tomorrow to finish the appropriation bills. I never
                                    saw such crowded galleries. AS the time approaches I feel very sorry to part with my

            <head>Comment</head>
            <p>For many years, Dr. Amos Shartle Hershey, who died on June 12, 1933, was a member of the faculty of
                    Indiana University. For several years he was a teacher of European history, but his chief interest
                    was in international relations and international law. In 1905 he was made professor of political
                    science and international law. Dr. Hershey traveled extensively viewing conditions at close range in
                    Europe, in the Near East, in the Far East, and in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>. He read widely, and wrote several modest volumes as well as many short articles. His
                    knowledge of and views on international problems were much sought after. He accompanied President
                    Wilson and the other American Peace Commissioners to Versailles where he acted as one of the
                    advisers during the Peace Conference.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career as a teacher and student, Dr. Hershey was an open-minded liberal. His mental
                    processes were so natural, his thinking was so free from bias, he was so ready to learn something
                    from anyone, anywhere, at any time, that his friends never ceased to marvel at his modesty and
                    simplicity, and strangers felt at home with him at once. He knew men, he was shrewd and he possessed
                    a fine sense of humor, but to do or say anything merely for effect or to gain any advantage for
                    himself was completely foreign to his nature. He was an unspoiled, honest man with a fresh, vigorius
                    mind and a rare, genial spirit. Fortunate were those who were privileged to know him. What was said
                    of Nathaniel by the Man of Gallilee could have been said of Amos S. Hershey: "Behold a man
                    in whom is no guile."</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Amam That Was and Amana That Is</hi>, by Bertha M. H. (Mrs. Benjamin F.) Shambaugh was
                    brought out by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> State Historical Society near the end of last year. The volume is divided into two
                    parts as the title indicates, the first part, <hi rend="i">Amana That Was</hi>, being largely a
                    reproduction of an earlier volume by the author, <hi rend="i">Amana, the Community of True
                        Inspiration</hi>, which the Society published in 1913. The second part of the present book deals
                    with the Amana community as it is since the reorganization of the society which has taken place
                    since 1930. The story of Amana, a religious society, its successful <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-029-2-085"/> experiment in communism and its attempt to solve the problems presented
                    in a new age is well told. The volume is a splendid specimen of the book-maker's art, and
                    many readers will find its contents equally attractive.</p>
            <p>Number 5 of Volume X, Indiana Historical Society <hi rend="i">Publications</hi>, which appeared
                    recently is a study by Cecelia Bain Buechner of the Northern Indiana Historical Society, the title
                    of which is <hi rend="i">The Pokagons.</hi> This monograph forms a pamphlet of fifty-six pages. It
                    is documented, accompanied by a short bibliography, and carries several illustrations including a
                    picture of Simon Pokagon when an old man. "The Red Man's Greeting"
                    which first appeared as the "Red Man's Rebuke", is presented in an
                    appendix. This brief recital of the wrongs suffered by American Indians at the hands of Europeans
                    will interest many. The author's careful work deserves high commendation.</p>
            <p>The commodius and well-appointed new building which will house the Indiana State Library and also the
                    Indiana Historical Society and Historical Bureau is nearing completion. It is conveniently located
                    near the State House, and it is a structure of which the citizens of Indiana may well feel proud. In
                    the <hi rend="i">Library Occurent</hi> for January-March, 1931, there was published an article by
                    Miss Esther U. McNitt, "A Short History of the Indiana State Library". At this
                    time, when the Library is nearing the end of an era and will soon be released from its painfully
                    inadequate quarters in the State House, patrons and all other friends of the institution will find
                    it well worth while to read the historical sketch by Miss McNitt.</p>

                    information included in the following paragraphs relating to Territorial Papers, we are glad to

                            supervised the collection and the copying of many of these documents. In 1931 Professor

                            first three volumes. The Department of State, which is in charge of the project, planned to
                            issue these first three volumes in the early Autumn but the cutting down of the
