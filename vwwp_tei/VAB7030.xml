                    </p>
                    <p>1st. Divorce à mensâ et thoro, being only a separation from bed and
                        board.</p>
                    <p>2nd. Divorce à vinculo matrimonii, being an entire dissolution of the bonds
                        of matrimony.</p>
                    <p>The grounds for the first kind of divorce are, 1st. Adultery, 2nd.
                        Intolerable Cruelty, and 3rd. Unnatural Practices. The Ecclesiastical Courts
                        can do no more than pronounce for this first kind of divorce, or rather
                        separation, as the matrimonial tie is not severed, and there is always a
                        possibility of reconciliation.</p>
                    <p>The law cannot dissolve a lawful marriage; it is only in the Legislature that
                        this power is vested. It requires an act of Parliament to constitute a
                        divorce à vinculo matrimonii, but the investigation rests by usage with the
                        Lords alone, the House of Commons acting upon the faith that the House of
                        Lords came to a just conclusion.</p>
                    <p>This divorce is pronounced on account of adultery in the wife, and in some
                        cases of aggravated adultery on the part of the husband.</p>
                    <p>The expenses of only a common divorce bill are between six hundred and seven
                        hundred pounds, which makes<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7030-008"></pb> the possibility
                        of release from the matrimonial bond a privilege of the rich.</p>

                <head>REMARKS.</head>
                <p><hi>THESE</hi> are the principal laws concerning women.</p>
                <p>It is not now as it once was, when all existing institutions were considered
                    sacred and unalterable; and the spirit which made Blackstone an admirer of,
                    rather than a critic on, every law because it was <emph>law</emph>, is exchanged
                    for a bolder and more discriminating spirit, which seeks to judge calmly what is
                    good and to amend what is bad.</p>
                <p>Philosophical thinkers have generally come to the conclusion that the tendency of
                    progress is gradually to dispense with law,—that is to say, as each individual
                    man becomes unto himself a law, less external restraint is necessary. And
                    certainly the most urgently needed reforms are simple erasures from the statute
                    book. Women, more than any other members of the community, suffer from
                    over‐legislation.</p>
                <p>A woman of twenty‐one becomes an independent human creature,<ref target="#bodichon-note50">*</ref> capable of holding and administering
                    property to any amount; or, if she can earn money, she may appropriate her
                    earnings freely to any purpose she thinks good. Her father has no power over her
                    or her property. But if she unites herself to a man, the law immediately steps
                    in, and she finds herself legislated for, and her condition of life suddenly and
                    entirely changed. Whatever age she may be of, she is again considered as an
                    infant,—she is again under “<term>reasonable restraint</term>,”—she loses her
                    separate existence, and is merged in that of her husband.</p>
                <p>“In short,” says Judge Hurlbut, “a woman is courted and wedded as an angel, and
                    yet denied the dignity of a rational and moral being ever after.”</p>

                            representation, for they pay taxes without having the liberty of voting
                            for representatives, and indeed there seems at present no reason why
                            single women should be denied this privilege.</q>

                <p>“The next thing that I will show you is this particularitie of law; in this
                    consolidation which we call wedlock is a locking together; it is true that man
                    and wife are one person, but understand in what manner. When a small brooke or
                    little river incorporateth with Rhodanus, Humber, or the Thames, the poore
                    rivulet loseth her name, it is carried and recarried with the new associate, it
                    beareth no sway, it possesseth nothing during coverture. A woman as soone as she
                    is married is called covert, in Latine nupta, that is vailed, as it were clouded
                    and overshadowed she hath lost her streame. * * I may more truly farre away say
                    to a married woman, her new selfe is her superior, her companion, her master.
                    The mastership shee is fallen into may be called in a terme which civilians
                    borrow from Esop’s Fables, Leonina societate.”<ref target="#bodichon-note51">*</ref></p>
                <p>Truly “she hath lost her streame,” she is absorbed, and can hold nothing of
                    herself, she has no legal right to any property; not even her clothes, books,
                    and household goods are her own, and any money which she earns can be robbed
                    from her legally by her husband, nay, even after the commencement of a treaty of
                    marriage she cannot dispose of her own property without the knowledge of her
                    betrothed. If she should do so, it is deemed a fraud in law and can be set aside
                    after marriage as an injury to her husband.</p>
                <p>It is always said, even by those who support the existing law, that it is in fact
                    never acted upon by men of good feeling. That is true; but the very admission
                    condemns the law, and it is not right that the good feeling of men should be all
                    that a woman can look to for simple justice.</p>
                <p>There is now a large and increasing class of women who gain their own livelihood,
                    and the abolition of the laws which give husbands this unjust power is most
                    urgently needed.</p>
                <p>Rich men and fathers might still make what settlements they pleased, and appoint
                    trustees for the protection of minors and such women as needed protection; but
                    we imagine it well proved that the principle of protection is <note anchored="true" place="foot" xml:id="bodichon-note51">* The Lawe’s

                    education of freedom and responsibility will enable women to take better care of
                    themselves and others too than can be insured to them by any legal
                    precautions.</p>
                <p>Upon women of the labouring classes the difficulty of keeping and using their own
                    earnings presses most hardly. In that rank of life where the support of the
                    family depends often on the joint earnings of husband and wife, it is indeed
                    cruel that the earnings of both should be in the hands of one, and not even in
                    the hands of that one who has naturally the strongest desire to promote the
                    welfare of the children.</p>
                <p>All who are familiar with the working classes know how much suffering and
                    privation is caused by the exercise of this <emph>right</emph> by drunken and
                    bad men. It is true that men are legally bound to support their wives and
                    children, but this does not compensate women for the loss of their moral right
                    to their own property and earnings, nor for the loss of the mental development
                    and independence of character gained by the possession and thoughtful
                    appropriation of money; nor, it must be remembered, can the claim to support be
                    enforced on the part of the wife unless she appeals to a court of law. Alas, how
                    much will not a woman endure before she will publicly plead for a
                    maintenance!</p>
                <p>Why, we ask, should there be this difference between the married and unmarried
                    condition of women? And why does marriage make so little legal difference to
                    men, and such a mighty legal difference to women? In France it is somewhat more
                    equal; married women have a right, if they marry without a marriage contract, to
                    claim at the death of a husband half of whatever he possessed at the time of
                    marriage, or may have gained afterwards. If a woman have property of her own,
                    she may if she please marry under the “régime de séparation de corps et de
                    biens,” in which case she has the entire control of her own fortune, and has no
                    need of trustees. But usually marriages in France are of another description, or
                    under the “régime dotal,” in which case a portion of the property of the wife is
                    left at the disposal of the husband, and the rest placed in the hands of
                    trustees, much as it is with us<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7030-014"></pb> in England. The
                    choice which the French law allows is however a great improvement on our
                    law.</p>
                <p>In Turkey, daughters succeed equally with sons in houses and landed property, and
                    always take one‐third of the personal property. A widow receives one‐eighth of
                    the personal property, and must be provided for during her life by the heirs.
                    Women control their own inheritance when married; the husband has no power over
                    the inherited portion of his wife or wives.</p>
                <p>In Hungary, the common law, before 1849 (the German law is now introduced), made
                    a broad distinction between <term>inherited</term> and <term>acquired</term>
                    property, whether landed or personal. Whatever was inherited went to the heirs;
                    it could not be subject to a will.</p>
                <p>As to <term>acquired</term> property, the law only interfered to give half to the
                    wife; it was her absolute property, of which she might dispose in any way during
                    life or by will. Among the nobility this law did not obtain. In cases where
                    inherited property had been so left by the will of the first
                        <term>acquisitor</term> as to exclude the female sex, the brothers were
                    oblige to give a handsome sum if they married to their sisters, and provide for
                    them in a becoming way if they remained single.</p>
                <p>The rights of a widow were great; she was guardian of children, administrator of
                    property, and, as long as she bore the name of her husband, she could exercise
                    all the political rights of a man; she could vote in elections of county
                    officers, and in those of the Deputies to the Diet.</p>
                <p>Single females, according to the Hungarian law, were considered as minors, who
                    became of age upon marriage, and by marriage came into full control of all their
                    estates. They were not liable for the debts of their husbands; they were not
                    even bound to provide for the domestic expenses, the care of providing for the
                    house and the education of the children being incumbent on the husband. Wives
                    could make wills and sign deeds without the consent of the husbands. If a wife
                    died intestate, her property went to her children or collaterals.</p>
                <p>In fact a wife was not regarded in Hungary as a minor, her husband was not her
                    guardian, nor were there trustees<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7030-015"></pb> appointed for
                    her property. “None of my countrywomen would ever have submitted to such a
                    marriage settlement as is usual in England,” said a Hungarian lady, well known
                    for her genius and reputation. With the one exception of considering all
                    unmarried women as minors, the Hungarian law is very much in advance of
                    ours.</p>
                <p>The laws in the United States are generally much the same as ours. As a general
                    rule married women cannot make a devise of real estate. In some of the States
                    there are more reasonable laws, and a married woman may make a will and devise
                    lands in the same manner as men. These States are Ohio, Illinois, Connecticut,
                    Mississippi, and Louisiana. In Ohio the laws are remarkably liberal to women.
                    The first section of the statute of wills in Ohio declares that any person of
                    full age and sound mind and memory may make a will. By the statute of Ohio it is
                    expressly provided that the will of an unmarried woman shall <emph>not</emph> be
                    revoked by her subsequent marriage.</p>
                <p>What changes we find in the American laws are improvements upon ours. Is there
                    not evidence in our English laws of old opinions related to women which are
                    passing away with the old state of things which engendered them? In the early
                    times, when women were obliged by the violent state of society to be always
                    under the guardianship of father, brother, or husband, these laws might be
                    necessary; but in our peaceful times, such guardianship is proved to be
                    superfluous by the fact of the secure, honourable, and independent position of
                    single women who are sufficiently protected by the sanctuary of
                    civilisation.</p>
                <p>Since all the unmarried women in England are supported either by their own
                    exertions or by the exertions or bequests of their fathers and relations, there
                    is no reason why upon marriage they should be thrown upon the pecuniary
                    resources of their husbands, except in so far as the claims of a third
                    party—children—may lessen the wife’s power of earning money, at the same time
                    that it increases her expenses. Of course a woman may, and often does, by acting
                    as housekeeper and manager of her husband’s concerns, earn a maintenance and a
                    right to share in his pro‐<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7030-016"></pb> perty, independent
                    of any children which may come of the marriage. But it is evident that daughters
                    ought to have some sure provision—either a means of gaining their own bread, or
                    property—as it is most undesirable that they should look upon marriage as a
                    means of livelihood.</p>
                <p>Fathers seldom feel inclined to trust their daughters’ fortunes in the power of a
                    husband, and, in the appointment of trustees, partially elude the law by a legal
                    device. Also, the much abused Court of Chancery tried to palliate the Common
                    Law, and recognizes a separate interest between husband and wife, and allows the
                    wife alone to file a bill to recover and protect her property, and trustees are
                    not necessary if there has been an agreement.</p>
                <p>Why should not these legal devices be done away with, by the simple abolition of
                    a law which we have outgrown?</p>
                <p>We do not say that these laws of property are the only unjust laws concerning
                    women to be found in the short summary which we have given, but they form a
                    simple, tangible, and not offensive point of attack.</p>
