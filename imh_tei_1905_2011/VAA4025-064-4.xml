            <p>The demand, for a national referendum prior to a declaration of war was a twentieth century American
                    phenomenon which reached its apex in the years immediately prior to World War II. The wide advocacy
                    of such a plan at that time, both by a large segment of the American public and a substantial number
                    of congressmen, has usually been interpreted by historians as a manifestation of the resurgence of
                    isolationism and as an indication of the weakening of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
                    control of Congress. Although these explanations are valid in part, both tend to ignore the fact
                    that the war referendum movement attained national prominence primarily because of the personal and
                    persistent efforts of one United States congressman, Democratic Representative Louis Ludlow of
                    Indiana. Historians have examined neither Ludlow's background, philosophy, and motives, nor
                    his tactics when he sponsored a constitutional amendment providing for the war referendum. The
                    purpose of this study is not to criticize or support the war referendum idea; rather, it is to
                    investigate closely Ludlow's efforts to gain popular and congressional approval for his
                    measure during the years from 1935 to 1941.</p>

            <p>Throughout his twenty years of congressional service, Louis Ludlow's political philosophy
                    remained a unique blend of Christianity, Jeffersonian, and isolationism. He firmly believed that
                    "when everything else has failed it will be found that a sincere application of the
                    principles of Christianity is the best solvent of the world's troubles."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In the midst of the depression of the 1930's, Ludlow suggested:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It would be well for America if each of us would create in his own being a spiritual
                            department—a department of good works, if you please—to be devoted not

                            believe that the low estate into which we as a nation have fallen, with suffering and misery
                            unprecedented and unspeakable, is largely due to a growing indifference to the things of the
                            spirit. We have wandered far from God, and it is high time we should retrace our footsteps
                            to the throne of grace.</p>
                        <p>America's greatest need today is the strengthening of its moral reserves. If
                            everyone of us would shape his course of action by the precepts of Christianity, how simple
                            government would become! No longer would it be necessary to enforce justice between man and
                            man by the strong arm of government, and we could do away with most of our boards and
                            bureaus. The decrees of justice would be en graven on men's hearts, and no
                            enforcement officer would be needed save the silent monitor called conscience.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    </placeName>. The Indiana congressman insisted that "what America needs most of all in this

                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName>, Ludlow was a firm believer in the equality of all men and in the ability of the people
                    to make the ultimate decisions, a staunch opponent of strong executive power, and a consistent
                    advocate of reduction in governmental expenditures. In foreign affairs, Ludlow was an isolationist,
                    believing that the United States should maintain friendly relations with all nations, but should not
                    become involved with overseas problems which were not its concern, particularly those which might
                    lead the nation into war. In a speech of March 2, 1939, he concisely expressed his isolationism:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>We have declared in the <placeName>

                            </placeName> Doctrine that foreign nations must keep off of the Americas, but some of our
                            Cabinet leaders and senatorial statesmen seem to forget that the doctrine should work both
                            ways; that is to say, if it is logical and proper to say to foreign nations that they shall
                            not interfere in the Americas it is logical and proper for foreign nations to say that we
                            shall not interfere in their affairs. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the

            <p>The first six years of Ludlow's congressional career, from 1929 to 1935, yielded little of
                    permanent significance. He did eventually receive a seat on the powerful House appropriations
                    committee and became very popular among his fellow representatives, but otherwise he did little
                    which distinguished him from most other congressmen. His greatest concern during this period seemed
                    to be the increasing growth of federal power and administrative agencies, a tendency which he
                    deplored and condemned on numerous occasions.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Four of the remaining measures in
                    which Ludlow expressed interest prior to 1935 were of limited importance: a proposed constitutional

            <p>The concept of a war referendum did not originate with Ludlow. During the period of neutrality prior

                    prevalent belief of the Progressive Era that the public should have a greater voice in the
                    determination of important issues and fearing that the United States might be drawn into the
                    European war, introduced in Congress several proposed constitutional amendments providing for a war

                    supported the war referendum proposal. In 1917, five days prior to President Woodrow
                    Wilson's request for a declaration of war against Germany, Bryan sent the following plea to
                    each member of Congress: "If you reach the conclusion that nothing but war will satisfy the
                    Nation's honor, is it too much to ask that, by a referendum, you consult the wishes of
                    those who must, in case of war, defend the Nation's honor with their lives?"<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In February of the same year, Bryan observed: "If we could get the
                    vote of the American people nine-tenths of them would say that we should defend ourselves, but that
                    not a boy should be sent to Europe to fight under the banner of a European monarch or die under a
                    European banner."<hi rend="sup">12</hi> During the Senate debate over the declaration of
                    war on April 4, 1917, LaFollette questioned, "Who has registered the knowledge or approval
                    of the American people of the course this Congress is called upon to take in declaring war upon
                    Germany? Submit the question to the people, you who support it. You who support it dare not do it,
                    for you know that by a vote of more than ten to one the American people as a body would register
                    their declaration against it."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Although the United States'
                    intervention in the European conflict caused interest in the war referendum proposal to subside
                    temporarily, the disillusionment of the post-World War I years and the disintegration of
                    international peace machinery combined to attract new converts to the plan. In 1924, both the
                    Democratic and the Progressive national conventions included planks in their platforms advocating a
                    war referendum. The Democratic platform committee asserted: "Those who must furnish the
                    blood and bear the burdens imposed by war should, whenever possible, be consulted before this
                    supreme sacrifice is required of them."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Both these parties, however,
                    were unsuccessful in the presidential election, and after that year a war referendum plank did not
                    appear in the national platform of a major political party. During the 1920's, several
                    resolutions advocating adoption of a war referendum were introduced in Congress, but there was
                    little public support or enthusiasm for such a measure, and, like their predecessors of the World
                    War I period, all of these proposals died in committee.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>The strong resurgence of isolationism during the 1930's, especially following the
                    congressional investigation headed by North Dakota Senator Gerald Nye into the cause of American
                    entry into World War I, created new interest in a war referendum. Many Americans were determined not
                    to repeat the experience of World War I—an involvement which, according to the results of
                    the Nye Committee investigation, had supposedly been caused by the influence of powerful munitions
                    and banking interests and vicious foreign propaganda. These convictions found their most dominant
                    expression in the mandatory neutrality legislation of the middle and late 1930's<hi rend="sup">16</hi> and in the war referendum crusade during the years from 1935 until 1941.
                    Ludlow was very much influenced by the results of the Nye Committee hearings. Early in 1935 he wrote
                    to Senator Nye: "I have followed with approval and admiration your masterful expose of the
                    machinations of munitions manufacturers who have not hesitated to foment strife and even to
                    precipitate wars in order to satisfy their greed for gain. I am sure the entire nation applauds the
                    major service you are rendering to humanity."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Ludlow publicly
                    expressed his sentiments even more forcefully in an article published in <hi rend="i">World
                    Affairs</hi>: "On reading these hearings one has a sense of utter shame that there are
                    creatures who call themselves business men who are such strangers to the common impulses of humanity
                    that they eagerly, by bribery and chicanery whenever necessary, promote wars to slaughter their
                    fellow beings for the sake of filthy dollars."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As early as 1924, Ludlow had expressed his dissatisfaction with the constitutional procedure for
                    declaring war. In his autobiography he asserted that "the most monumental fiction in the
                    American governmental system today is the provision in the Constitution which gives to Congress
                    alone the power f declaring war." He then suggested that "the Constitution of the
                    United States should be amended so as to provide for a referendum on war."<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Yet during his first six years of congressional service he failed to take an active part in
                    the war referendum movement. During the years from 1929 to 1935 the leading supporters of the war
                    referendum in Congress were Representatives <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">16</hi> Ludlow was also a strong advocate of mandatory neutrality
                            legislation. In a House speech of January 8, 1936, he declared: "I plead for a
                            neutrality policy based on law and against a neutrality policy based on the opinions or the
                            whim of the President who may be occupying the White House when trouble arises."
                                <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 74 Cong., 2 Sess., 162. During that year he introduced a bill
                            which called for a presidential proclamation, to be issued upon the outbreak of hostilities,
                            forbidding exports of all kinds to belligerents and prohibiting loans and credits to
                            belligerents or to nationals of the countries involved. The penalty for violation of the
                            proclamation was to be a $10,000 fine or imprisonment up to five years, or both.
                            Ludlow's proposal also provided that the presidential proclamation inform American
                            citizens that they must travel on belligerent vessels at their own risk. Aliens seeking to
                            interfere with neutrality were to be arrested and deported, and recruiting in the United
                            States for belligerents was to be forbidden. Violators of the recruiting prohibition would
                            incur the same penalties as those exporting goods or credit. Ludlow's bill died in
                            the Committee on Foreign Affairs. <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 163–64.</item>

            <p>On January 14, 1935, Ludlow introduced his war referendum in the House of Representatives for the

                        <p>Sec. 2. Whenever war is declared the President shall immediately conscript and take over for

                            supplies, together with employees necessary for their operation, fixing the compensation for
                            private properties temporarily employed for the war period at a rate not in excess of 4

                    </quote> In a speech before the House, Ludlow explained the dual purpose of his measure:
                    "First, it gives to the rank and file of our citizenship who have to suffer and die and pay
                    the awful costs of war the right to decide whether there shall be a war. Secondly, it takes the
                    profits out of war, and by removing the incentive of those whose hellish business it is to foment
                    wars minimizes the probability of wars in the future."<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Ludlow soon
                    decided to eliminate the portion of his resolution which had called for the conscription of
                    personnel to operate the war properties. As he explained in a letter to Senator Nye, "I
                    felt that provision might create some antagonism and that it was unnecessary."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> In March, Congressman Ludlow's office issued his first public letter
                    urging support for the referendum. The letter encouraged individuals to pressure their congressmen,
                    to obtain resolutions from groups, and to seek support from the press and radio. Denying that his
                    resolution was a pacifist measure, the Indiana representative explained: "I am willing to
                    die for my beloved country but I am not willing to die for greedy selfish interests that want to use
                    me as their pawn."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                    resolution was received from representatives of Congress, peace societies, colleges, labor,

                        war."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The proceedings of the subcommittee were completed in one
                    day, but no action was taken by the Committee on the Judiciary, with the result that the Ludlow
                    Resolution had not been brought to the House floor for consideration when the first session of the
                    Seventy-fourth Congress adjourned in August, 1935.</p>
            <p>When Congress reconvened early in 1936, Ludlow was still unable to persuade the judiciary committee
                    to report his resolution to the House. In February, he decided to file a discharge petition in order
                    to force the committee to release the war referendum measure. His loss of hope for a report from the
                    committee was evident in a letter to Edward Keating, editor of <hi rend="i">Labor</hi> magazine:
                    "It was apparent that the Judiciary Committee would do nothing with it, and the only way to
                    make progress now is through a discharge petition."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Under House
                    rules, the resolution would be discharged only if a majority (218) of the members affixed their
                    signatures to the petition. By the conclusion of the second session of the Seventy-fourth Congress,
                    in June, 1936, only seventy-two congressmen had signed Ludlow's petition. The Indiana
                    Democrat, however, had no intention of abandoning his crusade. In <list type="footnotes">

                            maneuver the country into war would override or repeal all statutes that stood in their way.
                            Only a constitutional amendment would have permanency and stability enough to accomplish the

            <p>Ludlow's attempts during 1935 and 1936 to gain consideration of his resolution were
                    unsuccessful primarily because the nation was still preoccupied with domestic issues, such as Social
                    Security, the National Labor Relations (Wagner) Act, and the Works Progress Administration. The
                    Indiana congressman had attempted to organize support, but he lacked the backing of a strong
                    national group which would be able to supply abundant funds and publicity. Few people took
                    Ludlow's proposal seriously at this time, as evidenced by the lack of any significant
                    opposition. Peace societies, in response to the Nye Committee revelations, were more concerned with
                    securing mandatory neutrality legislation for the United States than with promoting the war
                    referendum. Isolationism was a powerful force in America during these years, but its supporters, for
                    the most part, had not yet adopted Ludlow's plan for keeping the nation out of war.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the beginning of 1937, it seemed that the Ludlow Resolution would never be discharged from the
                    judiciary committee. Ludlow, however, persisted and introduced his proposal again during February.
                    Following the advice of one of his principal supporters, William F. Bigelow, editor of <hi rend="i">Good Housekeeping</hi> magazine, he further altered the resolution.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> This
                    time he separated the war referendum section from the property conscription portion and introduced
                    them as separate resolutions on February 5.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The Committee on the Judiciary,
                    however, still refused to report any war referendum proposal to the House for consideration, and
                    Ludlow once more resorted to circulating a discharge petition. A combination of circumstances during
                    1937 helped to create a more favorable attitude in Congress toward the war referendum measure. The
                    worsening global situation (for example, the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War) and an intensive
                    propaganda campaign begun under the auspices of the National Council for Prevention of War spurred
                    an ever increasing number of congressmen to sign Ludlow's petition. At the beginning of
                    June, the petition contained 120 names; by the middle of July, 155 had signed. When Congress
                    adjourned in August, 185 members were in the fold; but the Ludlow Resolution still remained in the
                    judiciary committee.</p>

            <p>In late 1937, Ludlow and the war referendum advocates received ar. unexpected opportunity to secure
                    the additional thirty-three necessary signatures, an opportunity of which they were able to take
                    successful advantage, President Franklin Roosevelt had been largely unsuccessful in obtaining
                    legislative approval of his program during 1937 and faced increased opposition in Congress,
                    especially after his efforts to enlarge the Supreme Court in an attempt to secure judicial decisions
                    favorable to New Deal measures. The President, therefore, convened Congress in a special session
                    beginning November 15, 1937,<hi rend="sup">34</hi> and Representative Ludlow resumed his quest for
                    signatures. By December 12, the date of the Japanese attack on the American gunboat <hi rend="i">Panay</hi> in China, 205 congressmen had signed the discharge petition, and within the next two
                    days the final thirteen names were affixed.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> Shortly after the completion of
                    the discharge petition, Congress adjourned for the Christmas holidays, and further action was
                    deferred until January 10, 1938.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Support for the war referendum was not strictly in accordance with political or geographical
                    boundaries. Signers of Ludlow's petition included 151 of the 329 Democrats, 55 of the 90
                    Republicans, 4 of the 5 Farmer-Laborites, and all 8 Progressives. Sentiment for the proposal was
                    strongest in the traditionally isolationist Midwest and weakest in the South, although significant
                    numbers of supporters were to be found in all sections of the nation.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
                    Generally, the war referendum was favored by advocates of mandatory neutrality legislation and an
                    isolationist foreign policy and was opposed by the supporters of discretionary neutrality and an
                    internationalist foreign policy. Many prominent individuals and organizations were involved in the
                    debate over the resolution's feasibility and did not hesitate to use their positions and
                    influence in an attempt to sway American public opinion. Organizational support for the Ludlow
                    Resolution was strongest among church, pacifist, and educational groups such as the National Council
                    for Prevention of War, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, World Peace
                    ways, the Keep America Out of War Congress, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the American

            <p>Of all those favoring adoption of the war referendum, the most zealous and persistent advocate
                    undoubtedly was Ludlow himself. He took full advantage of his position in the House to present his
                    ideas regarding the proposal, and to announce periodically the exact number of signatures on the
                    discharge petition, and the names of new groups and individuals which supported his cause.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> One of the most serious obstacles which he faced was the lack of necessary
                    financial support which would allow him to give greater publicity to his resolution. His awareness
                    of this problem was evident in a speech calling for assistance just prior to the adjournment of the
                    House in 1935.</p>

                    <p>My own means are so limited that I cannot give the proposal the publicity which its merit

            <p>As early as April, 1936, Ludlow had written to William Bigelow that his life was devoted to the
                    referendum, and one year later he confided to the same correspondent: "My services are
                    dedicated to the advancement of this peace legislation above all things else. There is nothing I can
                    honorably do to promote it that will be left undone."<hi rend="sup">43</hi> Between 1935
                    and 1938, Ludlow presented his arguments to the people of the United States by practically every
                    available means. He devoted many hours to the preparation of radio addresses and newspaper and
                    magazine articles which appeared in many diverse publications.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> During the
                    interim between the Seventy-fourth and Seventy-fifth congresses he wrote a volume entitled <hi rend="i">Hell or Heaven</hi>, the title suggesting that America's fate depended on the
                    failure or passage of his resolution.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> In addition, the Hoosier Democrat
                    attempted by personal correspondence to increase the list of notable figures who had joined the

            </p>
            <p>Ludlow was thoroughly familiar with the logical and historical arguments in favor of his proposal.
                    Not opposed to all conflict, he distinguished between just and unjust wars. In a speech on February
                    19, 1935, he observed: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There are some wars which as far as finite vision can discern are God-ordained and
                            inescapable, such as the War of the American Revolution which was to enthrone in our social
                            order great principles of human rights, and the War between the States, which was to write
                            in blood and tears the fate of the institution of slavery, but history points out that a
                            large majority of wars that have cursed the human race have been due to machinations and
                            greed. It is to protect our children and our children's children and the remote
                            generations of posterity for all time to come against a recurrence of these unholy wars that

                    </quote> Arguing for his war referendum proposal he stressed the singular importance of the war
                    decision, the excessive influence of the President upon American diplomacy, and the absence of any
                    effective means of recording popular sentiment on questions of war or peace. Congress, he
                    maintained, was extremely susceptible to diverse pressures, particularly from the Executive, when a
                    declaration of war was being debated—much more susceptible, supposedly, than the public
                    at large. <quote rend="blockquote">

                            unfair to expect the Members of Congress, after all of the atmosphere of war has been
                            created, to resist the terrific pressure and propaganda for war, thus subjecting themselves
                            to the taunts and charges of treason that are always hurled at those who do not go along

                    founding fathers would have included such a provision in the Constitution of 1787, Ludlow countered:
                    "I think the reason they did not is very simple and very apparent. At that time the means
                    of communication were very limited…. The framers of the Constitution knew that under such
                    circumstances a referendum on war was impracticable, if not impossible, so they placed the power to
                    declare war as near to the people as they could under the circumstances then existing and lodged it
                    in the Congress." Pointing out that that objection was no longer applicable, Ludlow
                    concluded: "The true objection to a war referendum has been eliminated by fast trains, by
                    air mail, and radio."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> To impress upon his audience the urgent

                    <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-064-4-014"/> Ludlow optimistically predicted that success of his plan would
                    insure a peaceful future for the United States: "I believe that if this amendment is
                    adopted America will never enter another foreign war in the settlement of other people's
                    quarrels, and perhaps will never enter another war of any kind, unless the need should come to wage
                    a righteous war of self-defense."<hi rend="sup">53</hi>

            <p>Ludlow was influential in the formation of the National Committee for the War Referendum, a new
                    coordinating organization formed during the final months of 1937. Its purpose was to inform the
                    public about the proposed amendment and to bring pressure on congressmen to pass the Ludlow
                    Resolution. The committee's chairman was retired Major General Rivers, and the board of
                    directors included Ludlow; Bigelow; William Allen White, editor of the Emporia (<placeName>

                    Council. Also among the leaders of the group was Stephen Raushenbush, formerly chief investigator
                    for the Nye Committee.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The crusade of the Indiana congressman continued to be
                    strongly supported by the National Council for Prevention of War. This organization included over
                    twenty affiliated pacifist groups, and used its abundant funds and influence to urge passage of the
                    war referendum. Members of the council delivered speeches, wrote magazine articles, issued petitions
                    and press releases, published pamphlets, and lobbied in Congress.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The effect
                    of the crusade on the average citizen can only be estimated. The American Institute of Public
                    Opinion asked a representative cross section of the American public: "In order to declare
                    war should Congress be required to obtain the approval of the people by means of a national
                    vote?" The percentage responding affirmatively during the period from 1935 to 1938 varied
                    as follows: November, 1935, 75 per cent; September, 1936, 71 per cent; October, 1937, 73 per cent;
                    and October, 1938, 68 per cent.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> Despite this seemingly overwhelming popular
                    support for the Ludlow Resolution, the vast majority of American newspapers were staunchly opposed
                    to it and harshly criticized the measure, particularly after it became certain that the House of
                    Representatives would vote on its consideration.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

                    outspoken critics of the war referendum resolution had not been numerous. On November 22, 1937,
                    Ludlow remarked: "I have heard of almost no opposition coming from any quarter. I have been

                    Their opposition doubtlessly caused some of Ludlow's Republican adherents to reconsider

                    "shorn of its influence," the Navy to be "scuttled," and the

                    war. Our property would become booty for the international buccaneers and our shores an invitation
                    to ruthless invaders." Labeling Ludlow's plan an "untried innovation in
                    the orderly governmental processes of our country," the assistant secretary of war
                    condemned the war referendum as the "very antithesis of representative

                    time to conduct when time was "the one essence of battle we can least afford to
                    waste." A final criticism was that the holding of a referendum would lead to a divided

                            often expressed his admiration for the New Deal leader. As early as May 26, 1933, Ludlow
                            said of Roosevelt: "I echo a thought that is <hi rend="i">widely</hi> prevalent

                    to maneuver the country into war against the wishes of the majority of citizens. According to
                    Ludlow, "No stauncher friend of peace ever occupied the executive office than President
                    Roosevelt, but after all, the period of one President's service is but a second in the life
                    of a nation, and I shudder to think what might happen to our beloved country sometime in the future
                    if a tyrant of Napoleonic stripe should appear in the White House, grab the war power, and run
                        amuck."<hi rend="sup">65</hi> The President did not expound on the subject of the
                    Ludlow Resolution—perhaps to avoid giving added publicity to a measure which would
                    greatly weaken the Chief Executive's discretion in the conduct of foreign relations.
                    Shortly after Ludlow introduced the measure for the first time in January, 1935, he wrote to the
                    President, explaining the proposal and asking for support: "I do not know of any more
                    fitting cap-sheaf to your great program of social benefits than this proposed constitutional
                    amendment would be, and I hope and pray that you may see your way clear to give your powerful
                    support to it, or to some similar amendment."<hi rend="sup">66</hi> In reply Ludlow
                    received a note from Louis M. Howe, Roosevelt's secretary, merely acknowledging receipt of
                    the letter.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> As early as January, 1936, Ludlow sensed Roosevelt's
                    dissatisfaction. Writing to Bigelow, the Indiana congressman said: "I am of the opinion
                    that the President does not favor the proposal, though I have not received any rejection from
                        him."<hi rend="sup">68</hi> In December, Ludlow again wrote to the President asking for
                    his endorsement: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I submit that this proposed war referendum would complete the democratic processes in the

                            communication were so poor that a war referendum was obviously impractical. We are now
                            living in a different age when communication is marvelously rapid and when the President,
                            sitting before the microphone in the White House, talks simultaneously to all America. We
                            are now ready for the war referendum. As a crowning achievement of an administration so
                            signally dedicated to the service of humanity, I would rejoice if you would use your great
                            name and influence to complete the democratic processes by democratizing the war power.<hi rend="sup">69</hi>

                    intimated that strong alien influences supported Ludlow. Celler maintained that the Nazi Germans
                    favored the resolution because it would "destroy all of our effectiveness, moral and
                    otherwise, in any foreign difficulty." Both congressmen agreed that Ludlow and his
                    followers were not parties to any such plot, but only "enthusiastically
                        misguided."<hi rend="sup">72</hi> The idea that Ludlow's motives were sound

                    because of their friendship with Ludlow, and not because of any sincere desire to see his proposal

            <p>As January 10, 1938, the date set for the vote on the Ludlow Resolution,<hi rend="sup">75</hi>
                    approached, both sides planned their final strategies. Ludlow suffered a setback on January 7, when
                    60 of the 218 signers of his discharge petition met and decided to try for the necessary votes three
                    days later as scheduled. They believed that the chance of victory was good and that, even if the
                    proposal was defeated, publicity for their cause was assured, the crusade could be continued, and
                    victory perhaps could be secured at a later date. Ludlow, on the other hand, favored a postponement
                    of the vote, hoping that increased popular support would accrue to the resolution during the longer
                    interval. He was also uncertain whether all of the 218 signers of his petition would back the
                    measure on January 10, and wanted additional time in which to persuade and pressure possible
                    recalcitrant colleagues. A further consideration was that a delay would disassociate the war
                    referendum issue from events abroad (such as the <hi rend="i">Panay</hi> incident) and possibly

                    House rules limited total debate time to twenty minutes on this type of question. Prior to the

                    brief debate a voice vote was taken. Bankhead ruled that those opposed to consideration of the
                    resolution were in a majority. Ludlow wisely demanded a roll-call tally, but the final tabulation
                    showed 188 favoring consideration and 209 opposed to it. Republicans voted for consideration
                    64–21, but Democrats opposed it, 188–111. The 8 Progressives and 5
                    Farmer-Laborites all favored consideration. Of the 218 congressmen who signed Ludlow's
                    discharge petition less than one month earlier, 154 voted for consideration, 54 opposed
                    consideration, 7 abstained, 2 had resigned from Congress, and 1 member had died.<hi rend="sup">83</hi> Consequently, the Ludlow Resolution remained with the judiciary committee, from which it
                    never emerged. The Roosevelt administration had won its battle, but the shift of a mere eleven votes
                    would have turned defeat into at least a temporary victory for Ludlow and the war referendum
                    advocates. In the closeness of the vote, New Deal historian William E. Leuchtenburg has observed a
                    measure "both of the President's tenuous control of foreign policy and, as late as
                    1938, of the hardrock strength of isolationist sentiment in America."<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the defeat only a temporary setback, Ludlow continued to press for enactment of the war
                    referendum resolution. Bitterly he described the proceedings of January 10: "The scene in
                    the American Congress on that day paralleled the scene in the Roman Senate when Brutus'
                    dagger struck down Caesar, except that the dagger of Brutus went to the heart of a tyrant while the
                    dagger thrust of intolerance in the American Congress went to the very heart of
                        democracy."<hi rend="sup">85</hi> Later, he still maintained his belief that the value
                    of his proposal would eventually be recognized by the nation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Great reforms move slowly, but we believe we have made a valuable contribution to peace and

                            that in the long sweep of years this proposal will be vindicated; that although years and
                            even decades may intervene before those who have to fight and die may be allowed to render
                            their verdict on participation in foreign wars, they will ultimately attain that goal.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>

                    the special interests … which frequently resorted to mean and untruthful attacks
                    …" and the opposition of Hull and Roosevelt, which he respected because they

                    addition to reintroducing his resolution in the House during each Congress until 1941,<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Ludlow worked with a group of senators who had introduced similar war referendum
                    proposals in the upper chamber.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> He had hopes of seeing a war referendum plank
                    in the 1940 national party platforms, and was enthusiastic when the America First organization
                    backed his plan and continued to offer its support as late as 1941.<hi rend="sup">91</hi> Less than
                    four months prior to the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7, 1941, Ludlow complained that the House
                    judiciary committee was "smothering my resolution, just as it has been doing since
                        1935."<hi rend="sup">92</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite the introduction of similar measures in the Senate, interest in the war referendum proposal
                    waned in the late 1930's as the situation in Europe became more critical. In a letter to
                    Major General Rivers, Ludlow's aide, Raushenbush, described the situation less than five
                    months after the near victory in the House: "We got out some letters to a few people on our
                    lists to see whether there was still any interest in the referendum … but there is almost
                    none … a few dollar bills trickle in."<hi rend="sup">93</hi> The entry of the
                    United States into World War II sounded the death knell for the war referendum movement, and such a
                    measure was never seriously considered after 1941.</p>
            <p>Although he did not abandon his war referendum plan, Ludlow tried in other ways to keep the United
                    States free from involvement in World War II. On January 3, 1939, he proposed a resolution providing
                    that the United States should take the lead in suspending naval construction and should call an
                    international conference to discuss limitation of armaments. On March <list type="footnotes">

            <p>As World War II drew to a close, Ludlow resumed his efforts to assure permanent peace. On July 20,
                    1945, he introduced a resolution urging an immediate international agreement to eliminate compulsory
                    military service and proposing that the President, secretary of state, and United States
                    representative to the United Nations should work for an international agreement whereby all nations
                    would adopt a war referendum. On September 5, 1945, he proposed a resolution urging action by the
                    United Nations to ban the atomic bomb as an instrument of war. Finally, on November 12, 1945, he
                    offered a bill providing for the creation of a cabinet level Department of Peace and Good Will.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> These proposals, like his aforementioned prewar measures, all died in
                    committee. Yet, it was still a war referendum for the United States which captivated
                    Ludlow's imagination until the end of his life. In July, 1945, he again suggested adoption
                    of such a measure: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            when we are again at peace with the world, I shall press it with every ounce of my energy

                    reverently and fondly of it until the very end of his long congressional service in 1949. On August
                    4, 1948, he reminisced: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Looking backward, I cannot escape the belief that the defeat of the resolution was one of the

            <p>Although the war referendum crusade ended in failure, it is nevertheless important to recognize the
                    campaign as a measure which Ludlow and others believed would assure world peace. Ludlow's
                    otherwise undistinguished career would have marked him for historical anonymity, but he gained
                    limited recognition because of his dedicated work for the war referendum, not only as a United
                    States congressman, but also as an author and publicist who appealed directly to and won the support
                    of a large segment of the American public. A <hi rend="i">Newsweek</hi> magazine staff writer
                    offered perhaps the best summary of Ludlow's brief moment of glory: "For eight

            <p>The four letters which follow<hi rend="sup">1</hi> are personal and family letters from the pen of
                    Andrew Wylie, the first president of Indiana University, 1829-1851. Wylie's letter to his
                    wife, Margaret, was written in 1835, while she was visiting in Cannonsburg, western Pennsylvania,
                    where they had lived before he became president of Indiana University or Indiana College as it was
                    known from 1828 to 1838. It alludes to difficulties in the construction of "the
                    building"—presumably the residence now known as Wylie House which was erected
                    during the 1830's. In a very human way it evidences Andrew Wylie's concern for his
                    wife, how much she was missed, and the problem of managing household and family affairs in her long
                    absence. It also pictures some of the common perils and hardships of travel in pioneer days.
                    Moreover, the letter to Mrs. Wylie, like those to sons Craig and Sam, reveals the considerable hold
                    which religious faith and views had on Dr. Wylie.</p>
            <p>The three remaining letters from President Wylie to his sons Craig and Sam suggest much regarding the
                    mingled hopes and doubts, aspirations and frustrations, and promises and setbacks which he faced as
                    president of Indiana University. President Wylie not only administered the internal affairs of the
                    infant university, but he also did some of the teaching and spent much time ironing out thorny
                    problems with trustees, placating legislators, and giving addresses at meetings of importance.
                    Within the institution there was frequent turmoil among faculty members, between the professors and
                    students, and in relations between town and gown. Faced with a multiplicity of duties, Wylie, as the
                    letters amply illustrate, was vulnerable to attack on several fronts.</p>

            <p>These three letters also indicate an abiding paternal interest in what his sons were doing and in the
                    kind of men he hoped they would become. His comments to Sam about health and exercise now seem a bit
                    amusing; but they, and his emphasis on the even greater importance of the "health of the
                    soul," indicate a father's deep concern for his children.</p>
            <p>Andrew Wylie, born on April 12, 1789, grew up on a farm in western Pennsylvania and performed the
                    usual hard work typical of rural life of that day. Of Scotch-Irish extraction, the family was
                    Presbyterian. Wylie himself was licensed as a Presbyterian minister in 1812 and was ordained an
                    Episcopal minister in 1841. In 1810 Wylie graduated from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> College, in western Pennsylvania; two years later, when only about twenty-three years
                    old, he was elected president of the college. In 1817 Wylie became president of nearby Washington
                    College and in 1829 he moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to assume the presidency of Indiana College.</p>
            <p>As a farm boy Wylie had learned how to swing the ax in chopping and felling trees. While president of
                    Indiana University, he at times performed such labor for exercise. In 1851 while so doing, he cut
                    his foot; the resulting complications led to his early death from pneumonia.</p>

                        <p>Through the great goodness of God our lives &amp; health are still preserved.
                                    Last week we received your letter by Eliza which gave us the very welcome account of
                                    your safe arrival at Wheeling &amp; of the welfare of our friends generally. It
                                    is here, as yet, a time of general health: though we have had almost incessant rains
                                    &amp; tremendous floods since within a few days after you left us till this week
                                    which has been fair. But now it thunders, the sky is overcast &amp; we expect
                                    rain again. Mrs Nichols departed this life last monday week. This was, you know, not
                                    an unexpected event. You would, doubtless, like to know how we make out to get along
                                    without you. And I am afraid &amp; almost ashamed to tell. The amount of it is,
                                    we do the best we can, &amp; that is bad enough. We have Nancy Swift, without
                                    whose assistance we could not get along at all. In the house things are broken
                                    &amp; lost at a sad rate. The <list type="footnotes">

                                 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the preparation of these letters for publication,
                                            every attempt has been made to transcribe President Wylie's
                                            handwriting accurately. However, both his writing and the condition of some
                                            of the letters have forced the editor to use some discretion in interpreting
                                            certain words or phrases. In those instances where a word or part of a word
                                            was unclear, the most likely correct choice has been inserted in brackets.
                                            In a few cases, a blank indicates complete illegibility of the word omitted.
                                            As was common in his day, Wylie did not always use standard capitalization
                                            or punctuation; his style has not been corrected. Likewise, abbreviations
                                            and obvious misspelling remain untouched. Raised letters and numerals have
                                            been brought down to the line.</item>

                                    &amp; ready to sink under the burden of so many cares. I wish a thousand times
                                    every hour that you were safe at home with us. I feel lost &amp; miserable
                                    without you &amp; am so much reduced in flesh &amp; spirits that you would
                                    hardly know me. I count the hours as months till you return. I say not this to urge
                                    your return. For I tremble to think of the danger by the way. The cholera, as you
                                    have, no doubt, heard, has lately broken out with fatal violence at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, where as many as from 12 to 20 have been buried in a day. And rumor
                                    says it is also at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; other places along the river. I have sometimes the most
                                    melancholy foreboding.—this, you know is my besetting sin, &amp; I
                                    strive against it as well as I can. The death of our lamented William, presses
                                    harder on me also since you left us, so that my spirits are sometimes quite sunk.
                                    Then "I chide my heart that sinks so low" &amp; look around to
                                    count the many &amp; unmerited blessings which Our Heavenly
                                    Father—blessed be his Holy Name!— still allows us to
                                    enjoy—&amp; then again I reproach myself with ingratitude &amp;
                                    unprofitableness. Thus wretchedly do I waste my life &amp; strength. Most
                                    fervently to I pray, &amp; try to hope, that your life may be preserved,
                                    &amp; that you may be kept in health &amp; peace &amp; restored to us
                                    once more. But I know &amp; <hi rend="i">feel</hi> that the time will be long.
                                    For I cannot think of advising you to come so long as the cholera continues on the
                                    river: &amp; to come through in the stage as I did last year would be, <hi rend="i">for you</hi>, out of the question, unless you had some kind &amp;
                                    intimate friend for a protector. Even then, I should hardly advise it, for the road,
                                    unless greatly improved since last year, is, towards this end of it, scarcely
                                    passible. So that, on the whole, I must try &amp; content myself the best way I
                                    can, till frost comes in the fall, when, if you live, you can descend the river
                                    without danger from cholera. But what shall take place, or what shall become of us
                                    before that time, God only knows. Our duty, in the mean time, is meekly to resign
                                    ourselves to his most holy will, making it our great &amp; main concern to
                                    commit the keeping of <hi rend="i">our souls</hi> to Him, in welldoing as to a
                                    merciful Creator, seeking his face &amp; favor with our whole hearts, &amp;
                                    encouraging ourselves in the cheerful hope, that <hi rend="i">whenever</hi>
                                    &amp; <hi rend="i">wherever</hi> &amp; by <hi rend="i">whatever</hi> means
                                    "our earthly house of this tabernacle may be dissolved we may have a
                                    building of God an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens."
                                    There, my dear Margaret, might it please our gracious God, that <hi rend="i">you</hi> &amp; <hi rend="i">I</hi> &amp; <hi rend="i">all our dear
                                    children</hi> should meet at last—after all our crosses, trials &amp;
                                    sorrows in this short life— O the transporting thought! it is too
                                    much—my unbelieving heart will not let me entertain it. This—
                                    alas! alas! is my infirmity. God strengthen my faith &amp; hope! God, of his
                                    boundless mercy &amp; grace grant us this great &amp; amazing blessing for
                                    Christ's sake! Amen! Amen! Amen! O were <hi rend="i">his</hi> Amen to it,
                                    how would my burdened soul bound, exult &amp; triumph. Well, let me say,
                                    "Thy will be done"! But <hi rend="i">I</hi> have something to do
                                    for the attainment of this end! O what responsibility!— <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-064-4-028"/> I never yet in all my life engaged in any thing with so
                                    little spirit as this <hi rend="i">building</hi>; &amp; nothing to which I ever
                                    put my [hands?] dragged so heavily. But yet it seems to have been forced upon me by
                                    necessity.—Things, too, seem to go against in the undertaking. At this
                                    moment the rain descends in torrents. Craig, poor fellow, is, likely, out in it; for
                                    he went with the waggon, this morning to the mill, for boards to cover a lime kiln
                                    which the rains have nearly spoiled. Three days ago, John went a black
                                    berrygathering on the old mare without my knowledge. The mare threw him &amp;
                                    only came home this morning. Yesterday the luckless fellow (John) fell off the
                                    sawpit &amp; hurt his head against a log. He is well enough now; but I was sadly
                                    frightened for a while lest he had sustained some serious or perhaps fatal injury. I
                                    see, from these escapes, how easy it would be, did a guardian <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                                    </placeName> intermit his care, for us to have sorrow upon sorrow. How thankful
                                    should we be for safety, health, <hi rend="i">reason</hi> &amp; all Gods other

                                    go—for it is yet doubtful—Elizth will probably go with them.</p>
                        <p>As to the University I cannot say very confidently. Ammen proves to be a most
                                    efficient teacher.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> If Morrison who will be here in the fall
                                    should do his part as well the Faculty will be second to none this side Yale<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Foster seems to be sunk—though still not so low as

                                    feelings—He introduced among his charges <hi rend="i">one</hi> too
                                    atrocious to mention: it related to William &amp; aimed at fixing a black stain

                                    patience has been severely tryed &amp; I have need to pray "lead me not
                                    into temptation"—that of doing to Foster what, for my own sake I
                                    ought not.</p>

                                    established there. But I do not much fancy the idea of another
                                    removal—especially westward.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> There are many signs of
                                    the tide turning in my favor in this state. But there is no dependence to be put in
                                    what we call tides of popular favor—nor indeed in man in any shape.</p>
                        <p>I find it difficult to get money—So, if my pamphlets are sold, I wish you
                                    to take the money &amp; with it pay Fetter. I hope to be able shortly to pay him
                                    off intirely. Mary's journey will cost me something, &amp; there are
                                    many ways to take away, &amp; but one to bring in money. <hi rend="i">You</hi>

                                    writing home without having been particularly charged to do so;—&amp;
                                    that you seem to have managed other little affairs with a "quantum
                                    suff." of discretion.</p>
                        <p>I shall have your books and things sent by Woodwards waggon to care of B. O. Davis.
                                    It starts on monday next.</p>
                        <p>I am in a hurry preparing to go to convention<hi rend="sup">6</hi> John goes with me
                                    to <placeName>

                                    a severe shock and it will be long yet before he recovers—if ever.</p>
                        <p>You will be in danger of a thousand things from which no care of mine—nor
                                    your own, nor any other mortal can preserve you. Think of this.</p>
                        <p>As to health: you must take exercise every day &amp; keep the pores clean by <hi rend="i">seeeating</hi> washing is good; but it acts on the end of the tube:
                                    whereas the <hi rend="i">sweat</hi> goes through and cleanses out the whole channel</p>
                        <p>But health is not the chief thing, important as it is. You may rise early—
                                    take the morning air, avoid late hours &amp; hard eating &amp; drinking and
                                    all other things which tend to disease &amp; yet you may get into ways which are
                                    not good, as to the health of the Soul. Put it down in your inmost thoughts that all
                                    those things are evil and will prove so in the end which tend to make one forget
                                    God.</p>
                        <p>You will do well to remember that you are poor; have no fortune in prospect and that
                                    the people among [whom] you live being wealthy you may not safely imitate their
                                    expensive habits. Be plain &amp; decent in your dress: this is enough to please
                                    sensible people, and the less you follow such as are not so the better.</p>

                                    Dodds's house, in short the Faculty, finding Williams &amp; Trimble to
                                    have been in the affair called them to account.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> They brought
                                    the rest—Some twenty—to share their fate. The Faculty demanded
                                    an apology. It was given such as it was. That of Williams &amp; Trimble was <hi rend="i">hardly</hi> an apology. But the Faculty agreed to accept it with the
                                    rest &amp; ordered me to dispose of the case with remarks on the impropriety of
                                    such conduct. I did so. Williams &amp; Trimble, offended because the remarks
                                    were not postponed till some distant period when they might not be thought of in
                                    connexion with said remarks, demanded an honorable dismission. It was not granted.
                                    They, aided by Millan &amp; some others of the Law Department, threw the
                                    Philomaths into a phrenzy. They passed certain resolutions censuring the Faculty
                                    &amp; giving Diplomas to Williams &amp; Trimble who went out of town with
                                    the mob shouting for <placeName>

                                    of it and at the next meeting of the Legislature I expect a scheme for some time in

               </placeName>, Indiana, in 1819. The minutes published here record its history from
                    the active and hopeful beginning until the summer of 1826 when these minutes terminate.</p>
            <p>The first entry reports a preliminary meeting, late in 1818, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where they laid the groundwork for the society. The next meeting on January 9, 1819,
                    was a general meeting to which the public— "all those who are friendly to the
                    above institution"—was invited. At this time, the constitution for the society
                    was read and subscribed to by forty-nine men, and officers were appointed. Less than two weeks later
                    the officers met and began efforts to communicate with other societies and to procure more copies of
                    the <hi rend="i">Friend</hi> of Peace<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and other relevant literature. At
                    succeeding meetings bylaws were adopted, a formal explication of motives and goals was formulated,
                    circulation of peace materials was promoted, and annual reports<hi rend="sup">3</hi> of activities
                    were duly produced by the trustees and ordered printed for distribution. Until May, 1821, the
                    society met quarterly according to its constitution; thereafter meetings were held annually in May.
                    The later minutes—usually brief and perfunctory—reflect an apparent dwindling
                    of interest of the majority of the members and a great difficulty in obtaining funds.<hi rend="sup">∗</hi> It is impossible to say <list type="footnotes">

                            $4 tax levied by county commissioners in 1822 on men who, for reasons of
                            conscience, "refused to muster with the militia, or take part in any warlike
                            matters." Many of the men who originally subscribed to the society constitution
                            paid the assessment. Stevens, <hi rend="i">Centennial History of <placeName>

                    but the available minutes provide an interesting example of the general trend of peace societies
                    during the early nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The rise of these societies<hi rend="sup">5</hi> is attributed to the disillusionment and horror
                    which became prevalent with the destructive and costly warfare of the French Revolution, the
                    Napoleonic Wars, and the War of 1812. Various publications against war appeared in the United States
                    and Great Britain during these years, but the most influential was the <hi rend="i">Solemn Review of
                        the Custom of War</hi>

                    </placeName>. This work was translated often and circulated widely in Europe as well as in Great
                    Britain and the United States. It is a masterfully written condemnation of war and the men who make
                    war possible or even necessary to the He of a nation; much of its reasoning is encompassed by the
                    preamble to the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Peace Society constitution and by the statement of motives read in December, 1818. This
                    pamphlet and similar writings apparently helped to stimulate widespread peace activity when world
                    events began to give men hope that peace was actually possible.</p>
            <p>Around 1815 men envisioned a peaceful world with some hope of eventual success. The Napoleonic Wars
                    had ended; the Holy <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Alliance</settlement>
                    </placeName>— presumably that "solemn league" of European
                    powers—gave great encouragement to many men who sought peace; and the United States and
                    Great Britain ratified the Treaty of Ghent which emphasized the necessity for arbitration in
                    conflicts between nations and which provided "an admirable lesson on the subject."
                    And thus "the present time of favor" brought about the formation of peace
                    societies both in the United States and abroad.</p>

                    American peace sentiment was marked by its local character, since the peace societies, spontaneously

                    exchange letters with one another, and gradually something like a unified action in the interest of
                    peace developed. Until the formation of the American Peace Society in 1828, however, the story is
                    largely the story of local, independent organizations."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The fourth

            <p>Most of the peace societies had religious connections, and the purposes and rationale of the movement
                    were thoroughly seated in the doctrines of Christianity. Curtis states that Quakers were not
                    generally as active in the movement in the United States as in Great Britain—perhaps
                    because of geographical diversity and other problems of organization.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The <placeName>

                    relationship in the terminology and explicit biblical allusions that are used throughout. Generally
                    the men who were active in the movement, however, were not only religious leaders but also
                    merchants, educators, and businessmen. Salem was apparently typical in that the prominent and
                    established men of the community provided the impetus for the movement. William Lindley had been
                    largely responsible for the founding of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Peace Society minutes document what is probably a representative experience for local
                    peace societies of the period. The frequent pleas for funds and members in the <hi rend="i">Friend
                        of Peace</hi> indicate that this was a general problem after the early heights of peace
                    activity. Curtis mentions that the <hi rend="i">Friend of Peace</hi> in 1825 "tried to
                    explain the decline in interest" as a result of distance from "the evils of the
                    struggle" of the War of 1812.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The reasons for the decline are no
                    doubt many and varied, but the movement was sustained in the national organization, the American
                    Peace Society. Although the impact of such local peace society efforts is almost impossible to
                    determine, they at least "created an opinion favorable to peace and opposed to

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> In editing these minutes every effort has been made to represent as
                            closely as possible the actual handwritten document, but printing has necessitated certain
                            changes. Liberties in spacing have been taken with such items as the centering of headings,
                            the use of double spacing to mark a new entry, paragraphing, and—with one
                            exception—the setting of lists in series rather than in column. Elevated letters
                            have been brought down to the line; obvious repetitions and flourishes have been omitted.
                            Periods have been substituted for flourishes and other marks and added where necessary.
                            Commas and semi-colons in series of arabic numbers and proper names have been standardized
                            throughout. With regard to spelling, [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] has been used only when
                            spelling is inconsistent within the document or when there might be a question of an error
                            in transcription or printing. Proper names have been allowed to stand even though spelling
                            is inconsistent; correct spelling of names has not been given because reliable sources are
                            lacking. The plural of words ending in "y" varies between
                            "-ys" and "-ies;" the vowel sequence after
                            "c" is consistently "-ie" (for example,
                            "recieve"); and there are other non-standard spellings. Capitalization has
                            presented many problems. Obvious capitals or lower case letters have been retained although
                            they may be inconsistent with modern usage; but several letters are not distinguishable as
                            capital or lower case: "c," "w," and
                            "a" have definite capital forms, but the lower case form is used obviously
                            as both capital and lower case; the same "s" and "y" are
                            used for both capital and lower case in initial position. When there was a question of the
                            writer's apparent intention because of inconsistencies within the document, modern
                            usage was the final critérium for a decision. There has been no real attempt to

            <p>We the subscribers in forming this Society, think proper to make the following concise declaration of
                    our motives &amp; objects.</p>
            <p>Having been impressed by considering the manifold evils &amp; tremendeous [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                    calamities of Public War; we earnestly wish that men may be brought to view it in a just light,
                    clearly to see its sad influence, on the Political moral &amp; religious of communities, and its
                    opposition to the design &amp; spirit of the Gospel; and that the true dignity and Happiness of
                    a People result from Impartial Justice towards all Nations, and the Spirit &amp; Virtues of
                    Peace.</p>
            <p>Various facts and considerations have conspired in exciting a hope, that a change may be effected in
                    public sentiment, and a more happy state of society introduced.</p>
            <p>We believe that a majority of the People in civilized countries, when free from party passions
                    &amp; prejudices, have such an aversion to public Hostilities, that they would rejoice if any
                    plan could be devised which would both secure their rights and absolve them from the burthens
                    &amp; sufferings of war.</p>
            <p>The late Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and the United States, has suggested the
                    Practicability of such a plan, and given us an admirable lesson on the subject.</p>
            <p>For this ray of Pacific light we are gratefull and hope it will be like "the shining light
                    which shineth more &amp; more unto the perfect day."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> It is clear

                    <pb n="305" id="VAA4025-064-4-039"/> appears from History that many customs, which were formerly
                    considered as honorable, usefull &amp; even necessary, have since been abolished, as inhuman
                    &amp; Barbarous, and are now regarded with detestation &amp; Horror.</p>
            <p>The attention of the European [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] Nations lately appears to be unusually excited
                    to the guilt and miseries of war; and with Joy we learn that Peace Societies are Established on the
                    other side of the atlantic, as well as in the United States,—a cooperation in different
                    countries is joyfully anticipated in this great work of promoting peace on earth, and good will
                    among men.</p>
            <p>We Intend that this Society shall be established on such principles as to embrace the friends of
                    Peace tho, they may differ in sentiment on the question, whether war be not in all cases Prohibited
                    by the Gospel, and may also differ in opinion on other subjects.</p>
            <p>We wish to promote the cause of peace by methods which all Christians must approve;—by
                    exhibiting with clearness the pacific nature of the Gospel, and by turning the attention of the
                    community to the nature, spirit, causes &amp; effects of war,—we hope that by the
                    concurrence of the friends of Peace in all Nations, and by the gradual Illumination of the Christian
                    world, a Pacific spirit may be communicated to Governments;—And that in this way under
                    the divine Blessing, the occasions of war, and the belief of its necessity will be constantly
                    diminishing till it shall be regarded by all Christians with the same horror, with which we now look
                    back, on the exploded &amp; barbarous customs of former ages.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Indiana) Peace Society, containing an explication of their motives &amp; objects
                    in forming this association.</p>
            <p>The Institution of Peace Societies being of recent date, we are apprehensive, that some of our fellow
                    Citizens, for want of more explicit information; may, from a cursory view of such an association
                    concieve it to be a Phenomenon; and being moved with fear (that intellectual tyrant, to which
                    mankind are too apt to be subservient) have brought this unpopular [topic?] before their own mental
                    tribunal, and precipitately given Judgment against it, without hearing the evidence; however we hope
                    they have the discretion not to adopt any measures discordant with the counsel of the wise doctor
                    Gamaliel to the Jewish Sanhedrim [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], the purport of which was,— If
                    that counsel or work were of men it would come to nought (as had been the case in divers instances)
                    but if its origin was of the divine power, the might of man could not overthrow it; therefore he
                    advised, to let those men alone, lest perhaps they (that is the persecutors) should be found even
                    opposing omnipotence.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We deem it expedient to announce to the public, a succinct but un-equivical delineation of the
                    motives of our Institution; also the object we have in view, and the means we are engaged to use.</p>
            <p>We solemly [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] declare, that in this case we are free from any private sinister
                    or selfish view; but being impressed with a deep conviction that there is a great deviation from the
                    spirit of Christianity, which is a spirit of mercy, peace and kind affection; and being sorrowfully
                    affected by the accumulated miseries &amp; great desolations which war has spread over the
                    fairest, most fruitfull and enlightened regions of the earth; and at the same time encouraged by
                    many decisive proofs of the revival of Purer &amp; more benevolent principles among Christian
                    nations, we have formed this association, with the solemn &amp; deliberate purpose of
                    cooperating with the Philanthropists, of this and other Countries, in endeavoring to promote the
                    cause of peace &amp; Charity; that war may be stripped of its false glory, and different
                    communities may be united in the bonds of amity &amp; mutual good will. We are sensible that
                    this object is chiefly to be accomplished by a silent and gradual influence on the minds of men;
                    accordingly we intend to limit our operations to the circulation of usefull Treatises in which the
                    Pacific spirit of religion <list type="footnotes">

                    success.—In using these means it becomes necessary for the Society to have some funds,
                    which are to be employed for the diffusion of light on the subject of war, and in the cultivating
                    the principles and spirit of peace, agreeably to the Constitution we have adopted.—On
                    this subject we belong to no sect, no party. As lovers of our Country, as friends of mankind with
                    the spirit of peace in our breasts and with a deep impression of the miseries of war, we are
                    solicitous that the Effusion of human blood by human hands may be prevented, and that men may be
                    recalled to the conviction that they are brethren.—On the same principles &amp; for
                    the same benevolent purposes peace societies are established in several of the United States; also
                    several are formed in great Britain.— These societies with the many others<hi rend="sup">9</hi> which are in existence for pious &amp; humane purposes, it is believed may be
                    auxiliary to each other, in promoting the cause of humanity, and in diffusing the principles of
                    love, peace and amity, so essential to the true happiness of mankind.—Among the members

            <p>It being expected of us to render some account at this time, of our proceedings since our
                    appointment, in respect to our exertions in the aplication of the means proposed by the Society, for
                    the advancing of the good cause for which we are associated and also some information of our
                    prospects; this duty we freely perform as far as is within the sphere of our capacity.—We
                    have attended to the important part of the service we have been entrusted with; but the funds of the
                    Society being small when compared with their object, much more cannot reasonably be expected than
                    evidence of fidelity in the use of such means as have been at our disposal, and to exhibit such
                    facts as may be adapted to excite more liberal Patronage &amp; more powerfull
                    exertions.—We have purchased 50 copies of the 2nd 4 Numbers of the friend of Peace, which
                    have been distributed amongst the members of the Society, and the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and
                    the Supreme Judges of this State,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> to each a copy, and some have been sent into <placeName>

                    recieved by our Corresponding Secretary in behalf of the Society have taken considerable of the
                    money which was in fund, yet a small ballance [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] remains in the hands of the
                    Treasurer.— Although we consider all that we have yet been able to effect, but a little
                    compared with what our brethren, the friends of peace have done in several others of the United
                    States, and also in Great Britain, yet we hope that none who devote their service to this precious
                    cause will lose their reward of inward peace.</p>
            <p>By accounts recieved from other peace societies, the prospect is very encouraging; those which have
                    been associated a considerable time, are still increasing, and new peace societies forming, one of
                    which has lately been formed in Raliegh [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>, divers of the members whereof are said to be very respectable characters, also one
                    lately formed at Honey Creek [ ]<hi rend="sup">16</hi> County in this State.—Numerous
                    publications have been exhibited on both sides of the atlantic, adopted to the disseminating of the
                    principles of peace on Earth and good will to men; which there is reason to believe have much
                    attracted public attention.—In an extract from a letter of an Intelligent Writer<hi rend="sup">17</hi> appears the following remark— "The unreasonable and
                    unchristian custom of war, was perhaps never so generally a subject of consideration as at the
                    present time, and it should seem that Intelligent &amp; accountable beings, have only to examine
                    the question fairly, to become the friends of peace.—["] In this view we may be
                    encouraged to hope that from the standard of strife &amp; misery, not only Individuals but
                    Nations will flee, to rally under the Banner of good will and love.</p>
            <p>We believe there are many respectable citizens who have not yet taken an active part in this work
                    that are well wishers to the cause; and we trust, as the Illuminating influence of the Gospel of
                    Peace shall more generally spread and prevail amongst mankind, that the doubts which many have
                    entertained of success, will vanish in the bosom of evidence, and that they will see it in a clear
                    point of view, to be their duty to lend their aid toward the advancement of so good a
                    cause.—One Publication<hi rend="sup">18</hi> in opposition to the object of peace
                    societies has appeared; but the author had not the confidence to expose his proper name, and his
                    assertions were so erronius [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] &amp; false, and so evidently exhibited his
                    confusion, that we did not deem it worthy of a particular answer.— From accounts well
                    authenticated, it appears, that notwithstanding the opposition arising from the prejudices of
                    education &amp; <list type="footnotes">

                    hope &amp; believe that by the circulation of the numbers of the friend of peace &amp; some
                    other tracts in our Possession as also by the examplary conduct &amp; conversation of some of
                    the members of this Society, that the prejudice formerly existing in the minds of the opponents to
                    this Society have been removed or very much diminished, which evinces a growth in the good cause of
                    peace</p>
            <p>Therefore for the farther information &amp; encouragement to the members of this Society we
                    Recommend them to the Seventh annual report of the M.P.S.</p>
            <p>We would also recommend to this meeting to consider the propriety of laying a small Tax on the
                    members in order to enable the officers the ensuing year to publish some valuable tracts now in
                    their Possession to distribute amongst the members circulation</p>
            <p>Which we submit to the meeting.</p>

            <p>Agreeable to the Constitution of this Society the present annual Meeting will consequently expect
                    some report from the Trustees.</p>
            <p>We regret that but little have been done the past year by this Society, owing in part to a deficiency
                    of funds in this time of pressure yet we have a lively hope, grounded on information from annual
                    reports recieved from Peace Societies in other states that the cause is gaining ground &amp;
                    that several new Peace institutions have recently been formed, also that Pacific principles gain
                    ground in some parts of Europe, and since the formation of this Society we have cause to believe the
                    minds of many (in the vicinity of this place) have been wholly changed in favor of Pacific
                    principles.</p>

                    any professing Christianity be under the influence of the Spirrit of war. Seeing it is entirely
                    opposed to the Spirrit of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but the influence of Education and popular
                    oppinion has a powerfull tendency to blind the eyes of men to their own interest, thus we see men
                    pleading that the only way to preserve peace is to prepare for war and attaching the most honor to
                    him who performs the greatest exploits in sheding his brothers blood.</p>
            <p>And in order to correct Publick oppinion on this Subject by the defusing of Christian Sentiments and
                    inviting all to come under the Influence of the Gospel of peace was the object of the first
                    formation of Peace Societyes &amp; altho the means which has been in our possession ever since
                    our formation as a Society has been so limited that we have done but little for the advancment of
                    the great cause in which we are engaged.</p>
            <p>We have the present year purchased one hundred coppys of the numbers of the friend of peace for
                    distribution. This may seem but little tho we believe it will not be without its use</p>
            <p>We are informed by the last anuel report of the Masachusetts peace Society that they had destributed
                    dureing the last year ten Thousand three hundred and twenty Seven tracts. And by the Same report it

                    Society in Ireland called the Hibernion peace Society Several have also been formed in Noviscotia
                    &amp; in Canaday there is also a society in France called the Society of Christian Morals
                    enbracing several objects one of which is the abolition of war.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that with in twelve years more than one hundred peace Societyes have been formed in Urope
                    &amp; America which are doing much in almost every country where the Christian Religion has been
                    embraced. &amp; there can be no doubt but as the dictates of Christianity is attended too it
                    will intirely erradicate the Spirrit of war.</p>
            <p>We may also observe with Satisfaction the Manumition Society of N Carolina is spreading fast, at
                    their General association in March last there appeared representatives from more than forty branches
                    making in all more than two thousand members some of which are of the first order of tallants in the
                    state. If the influence of the Gospel when given way too does open the eyes of men who have been
                    blinded by education &amp; Interest to see the unjustness of holding their fellow beings in
                    Slavary why not believe that peace Societies may also by divine aid be mad useful in opening the
                    eyes of mankind to see the inconsistency of Christians encouriaging the Spirrit of war which is so
                    disolating not only to the morrals but the lives and hapiness of each other.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1925, he was appointed instructor of history at Indiana University. He became
                    professor in 1945 and since 1964 had been professor emeritus. His death on April 25, 1968, ended a
                    connection with and deep devotion to his alma mater that extended over more than a half century.</p>
            <p>Professor Buley's commitment to the history and heritage of Indiana, the Midwest, and the
                    United States was intense, abiding, and well revealed in his research and writing, his teaching, and
                    the countless hours he devoted to his students. From eight to five (except for the brief period when
                    he ate lunch in his office) his door was literally open to any student or other person who wished to
                    talk seriously, chit-chat, or swap yarns and stories. He was never too busy with his own work to
                    confer with, advise, and instruct others. This spirit of helpfulness and his effectiveness in the
                    classroom were partially recognized by his being awarded the <placeName>

                    former students prior to his retirement.</p>
            <p>Though primarily a teacher of survey and post-Civil War United States history, Professor
                    Buley's chief research and writing interests were the pre- 1840 Old Northwest and business
                    history… …. Professor Buley was not content just to do the research and
                    writing; he played a large part in designing many of his books. The end products attest not only his
                    knowledge of this art but also his love of the aesthetic…. his contributions to
                    scholarship were recognized by Alfred A. Knopf and Newberry Library fellowships and by an honorary
                    Doctor of Literature from Coe College.</p>
            <p>Through numerous articles and book reviews in the major historical and other journals as well as by
                    talks and speeches to assemblages of lawyers, doctors, insurance executives, historians, high school
                    and college students, and politically oriented groups, Professor Buley brought to his listeners a
                    keen enjoyment in and understanding of the past. And while writing and talking history he did not
                    neglect the materials of history. His <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Professor Buley took as great pride in his home and grounds as he did in winnowing historical facts
                    from the mass of evidence. There he and his wife, Evelyn Barnett Buley, served as gracious hosts,
                    and there the azaleas, rhododendrons, stray or wounded animals and birds, or individuals
                    "down on their luck" received expert attention and a helping hand. A man of strong
                    convictions and deep compassion, Professor Buley was Hoosier and American to the core. He wanted
                    others to be the same but recognized their right and privilege to conform to their own versions of

                    D. Eisenhower. Introduction by Everett McKinley Dirksen. (<placeName>

            <p>The author conducts the reader through the political career of Charlie Halleck in a manner that is
                    satisfying in some respects, but less so in others. He is a lively and enlightening guide when
                    narrating the personal fortunes of his subject. Halleck's rapid rise to his
                    party's second highest office in the House as majority leader in 1947, his nomination of
                    Eisenhower in 1956, and his attainment of the top Republican post in the House of Representatives in
                    1959 by replacing Minority Leader Joe <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Martin</region>
                    </placeName> are well related. So also is the account of the reversal of his fortunes in 1965 when
                    defeated by Gerald Ford of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in a vigorous bid to continue as Republican House leader. Thus the reader shares in the
                    triumphs of the Indiana congressman and in his disappointment at not reaching either of his most
                    coveted goals of speaker of the House and vice president.</p>
            <p>The author is less successful when he leaves personal, narrative history. The domestic social and
                    economic environment and the foreign relations within which Halleck's career operated are
                    inadequately outlined, even for a "political biography." Emphasis is sometimes too
                    narrow; for example, President Eisenhower's campaign in 1956 is covered, but his
                    party's failure to capture Congress (so vital to one in Halleck's position) is
                    scarcely mentioned. The most serious professional fault, however, is apparent from an examination of
                    the sources used. Lapses include ignoring the public and private papers of leaders of the period and
                    making scant use of congressional and other governmental records. The results are some unusual
                    footnotes (<hi rend="i">e.g.</hi> the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Valparaiso</settlement>

                    popular college textbook for the complex Greek situation in 1947 on page 116.)</p>
            <p>But what of the Charlie Halleck which emerges from this study? Achievements on the negative side
                    included revitalizing the Republican-Southern Democratic coalition to an efficiency of 91 per cent,
                    receiving a career rating of 86 per cent from the very conservative Americans for Constitutional
                    Action, displaying his legislative expertness by such maneuvers as killing the 1956 aid-to-education
                    bill by promoting the Powell Amendment that would make it unacceptable to the southern states, and
                    successfully serving the opposition an "assortment of fast curves and sharp-breaking
                    sliders" (p. 195). These probably accounted for much of his contemporary popularity in the
                    Indiana Second Congressional District and in conservative circles throughout the country.</p>
            <p>However, the record included more of the positive than Halleck's many critics have usually
                    noted. He supported the civil rights acts. With a fellow <pb n="328" id="VAA4025-064-4-062"/>
                    Republican as President from 1953-1961, he labored for extension of reciprocal trade agreements, the

                        <region type="county">Lawrence</region>
                    </placeName> Seaway project, public housing, and foreign aid. Most of these measures he had
                    previously opposed, as the right wing of the Indiana party hotly reminded him.</p>
            <p>It is not intended to suggest that Representative Halleck has been a hidden liberal. It is probably
                    nearer the truth to say that his role has been more that of a professional politician than of a
                    conservative ideologue. Judging from his defense of the profession of politics, he might not regard
                    that judgment as a harsh one.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Goodly Heritage</hi> offers an informative, interesting, and significant history of
                    Masonry in Indiana. It is a worthy and permanent contribution to the sesquicentennial of the
                    founding of the Grand Lodge of Indiana at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> early in 1818, the observance of which has continued during 1968. Although the major
                    attention is devoted to the beginning or lower orders of Masonry for men—commonly called
                    Craft Masonry, consideration is also given to other orders for men as well as special orders for
                    women and youth. Comprehensive in scope, the book includes information concerning early local
                    lodges, establishment of the Grand Lodge, ups and downs of membership, and the anti-Masonic movement
                    as well as such topics as Masonic charity, ethics, ritual, philosophy, and membership requirements.
                    So far as chronology is concerned, the main focus is on the beginnings and then the development of
                    Masonry during the initial half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>This volume contributes useful information and interesting perspectives about the anti-Masonic
                    crusade which reached its peak during the late 1820's and the 1830's. It
                    definitely supports a commonly held view that the political impact of anti-Masonry was modest among
                    Hoosiers, but it plows some new ground in its vivid account of the near demise of the Grand Lodge of
                    Indiana during the early 1830's. Dr. David G. Mitchell, of Corydon, apparently the major
                    anti-Masonic leader in the state, is frankly described as an ex-Mason who had been expelled for
                    drunkenness and other causes. Despite the anti-Masonic crusade, five of Indiana's first
                    eight governors were Masons: Jonathan <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings</region>
                    </placeName>, James B. Ray, Noah <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Noble</region>
                    </placeName>, David Wallace, and James Whitcomb. Moreover, these executives served for approximately
                    twenty-seven of the thirty-two years from 1816 to 1848.</p>
            <p>Smith is to be commended for his substantial research and thoughtful evaluations. He has made much
                    use of Indiana Masonic records, especially those of the Grand Lodge and local lodges. But Smith has
                    also used an <pb n="329" id="VAA4025-064-4-063"/> impressive array of books, articles, and
                    miscellaneous sources concerning Indiana history at large. Confidence in the general reliability of
                    this volume is augmented by the author's obvious effort to "tell it as it
                    was"—even when the truth leaves blots or blemishes on Masons or Masonry. Thus,
                    no sanctimonious quibbling is made about the fact that the very first Grand Master of the Grand
                    Lodge of Indiana crossed over into <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and engaged in a duel while serving as Grand Master; that official investigations by
                    the Grand Lodge resulted in charges of irregularities in the accounts of two Grand Treasurers; and
                    the significant, and most embarrassing, involvement of Masonry in the Ku Klux Klan of the
                    1920's. On the other hand, the role played by Masons in the development of state government
                    in pioneer days and their substantial contributions to the defense of the United States are
                    convincingly demonstrated. In addition, Smith conveys the inner spirit of Masonry in a thoughtful
                    and persuasive manner. Although presumably written principally for the edification of Masonic
                    brethren, <hi rend="i">Goodly Heritage</hi> is an extremely informative volume for non-Masons as
                    well. At least, this reviewer, himself not a Mason, found it so.</p>

            <p>Here is an excellent addition to the still regrettably small amount of literature on the progressive
                    movement at the state level. It takes its place with George Mowry's <hi rend="i">The <placeName>

                        </placeName>
               </hi> as model studies. Margulies has been thorough in his research and succinct in
                    describing the results, never content to take what the reformers had to say about themselves at face
                    value. The book is consequently more authoritative than the previous study with which it invites
                    comparison, Robert S. Maxwell's <hi rend="i">LaFollette and the Rise of the Progressives in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

            <p>Margulies' theme is decline, with particular emphasis upon the reasons for it. This erosion
                    in progressive fortunes he dates from the 1906 primaries. Three new ideas emerge in his exposition.
                    First is the debilitating effect on the reformers of constant conflict and political fragmentation
                    within the <placeName>

                    his followers, who preached principle above personality, but who did not hesitate to attack their
                    opponents personally, made the progressive movement one of turmoil. Programs closest to their
                    philosophy only helped. The direct primary, for example, although it democratized the nomination
                    process, became the means by which their "stalwart" opponents could disunite the
                    progressive forces. This internal rivalry encouraged divided loyalty in the leaders. Men like John
                    O. Davidson and Francis E. McGovem <pb n="330" id="VAA4025-064-4-064"/> looked to their own personal
                    opportunity and cultivated bases of support independent of LaFollette when they might have
                    campaigned unilaterally.</p>
            <p>Second, the author insists that the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> progressive movement effectively ran its course before America's entrance into
                    World War I. The stalwarts managed to elect their resourceful leader Emanuel L. Philipp as governor
                    in 1914, introducing a period of consolidation. This change suggests to Margulies that the character
                    of a resurgent reform movement after the war could have been different.</p>
            <p>Indeed, he concludes that the "new progressivism" beginning in 1919-1920, commonly
                    assumed to be a continuation of the old style activity, was in fact distinctly different. The war
                    had shattered the reform movement. Zealous patriots concerned with national honor attacked opponents
                    of war like <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> German-Americans, the Social Democratic party, and, of course, Senator LaFollette
                    himself. Sensitivity over patriotism encouraged a different alignment, to which new elements like
                    the Nonpartisan League, the State Federation of Labor, and the railroad brotherhoods, disenchanted
                    with economic conditions created by the war, were attracted. LaFollette could easily assume
                    leadership of this new coalition, campaigning on issues which, like the high cost of living, civil
                    liberties, and isolationism, were all born of the war and bore only an insignificant relationship to
                    those of the prewar progressive era.</p>
            <p>At the outset, Margulies modestly, but forcefully, stresses that he cannot, and will not, make
                    national generalizations about progressivism based on the experience of just one state. Whether
                    later synthesizers rate <placeName>

                    beyond such broad concepts as "decisions which produce 'proper' levels of
                    service and reasonable distribution of cost" (p. 197) apparently became increasingly
                    difficult. For somewhat the same reasons, the authors apparently found it difficult to associate
                    "good" or "poor" municipal finance with "good"
                    or "poor" municipality services and environments. This indecisive treatment of

            <p>Conscientiously, in his wish to make this a complete album of the farming area around the

                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="county">Howard</region>
               </placeName> Good starts back in the
                    geologic longago, the ice age, the glaciers, the forming of a soil that was no longer a swamp when
                    he lived there as a farm boy. This makes for a slow start, and Good's style is not
                    essentially fast moving anyway; but once this is accomplished (end of Chapter 1) he is ready to take
                    on the pioneer settlers and their forest-clearing and dangers.</p>
            <p>From then on the Black Swamp area becomes a distinct and engaging personality in this readable
                    genealogy. Good's talent lies less in sparkling humor and story telling than in minute,
                    almost loving observation and honest reporting. The reader with a farm background or one who
                    cherishes the land will find many occasions when he would like to lean forward and clap an
                    appreciative hand on Good's shoulder, as a farmer would do in face-to-face conversation. To
                    mention a few: the boots that irritatingly pulled the socks down into themselves; the scratchy new
                    unbleached towels; filling the straw- tick; trading a fodder chopper for a parlor organ; heavy farm
                    menus that produced no fat farmers; games the school boys played; old-fashioned names for parents;
                    superstitions farmers believed in; colloquialisms they spoke in; <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-064-4-066"/> how the land restores itself when left alone to do so. Also one appreciates the mention of early
                    farm practices: adding crushed limestone to the gummy soil; feeding skimmed milk to pigs and calves;
                    warming the bits before bridling the horses.</p>
            <p>Events in which the Good boy participated most are fully told: wheat threshing, the county fair,
                    spring housecleaning, butchering. The Chautauqua is skimped. There are delightful glimpses into farm
                    living: the cooking, the bread baking, quilting, a description of the family parlor. Good knew the
                    bleak nesses of farming—such as planting corn by hand—and wisely does not omit
                    nor gloss them over; but he states a viable philosophy: "Being kept busy and having a
                    limited amount of money was a good thing. One learns to make good use of time; tends to become
                    resourceful, improvises to provide diversions" (p. 154). He goes on to a fine description
                    of modern fanning in the area, giving both advantages and disadvantages. In the end he is optimistic
                    as fanners have always had to be to remain farmers. "The Valley remains unchanged, its
                    immense drift sheet … characteristic topographic features and inherent qualities
                    essentially the same as they have been for thousands of years" (p. 304).</p>

               <hi rend="i">Black Swamp Farm</hi> is a worthy contribution to a literature concerned with the land,

            <p>This short study of American Indian policy for the years between the Revolutionary War and the War of
                    1812 has as its theme the dilemma facing United States officials of reconciling national interest
                    with national honor. Accepting expansion as inevitable and desirable, the policy makers sought means
                    by which it would also be peaceful and culturally beneficial to the Indian. Such a policy proved
                    impossible to achieve. By 1811 the Indians had rejected the governmental efforts, white settlers had
                    ignored them, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> acquiesced by abandoning them.</p>
            <p>At first, from 1783 to 1786, the United States temporarily scrapped the previous British policy of
                    recognizing Indian claims to land ownership and pursued a policy based on physical occupation which
                    ignored the Indian title to territory east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Too weak militarily and economically to evict the tribes at will and troubled by the
                    moral inconsistencies which naked aggrandizement posed for a nation which had ascribed to the
                    principles set down in the Declaration of Independence, the United States soon returned to the old
                    British policy, with modification.</p>
            <pb n="333" id="VAA4025-064-4-067"/>
            <p>The British policy had called for acquisition of Indian lands through formal treaty negotiations.
                    Adopting this approach, Congress further hoped to improve Indian relations by passing various
                    regulatory Indian trade and intercourse acts. During the 1790's, the United States expanded
                    its appeal by calling for acculturation. This latter objective eased the consciences of officials
                    who readily assumed as did other western statesmen during the nineteenth century that non-whites
                    would eagerly accept and profit from exposure to the white man's ways.</p>
            <p>Federal policy failed for several reasons. The Indian did not wish to give up his lands nor his
                    culture; the white settler only accepted the expansionist phase of the program; and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> showed that it too was, first of all, expansionistic. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson</region>
                    </placeName> preached most vigorously the virtues of acculturation to those tribes east of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> whose lands he immediately desired. To those west of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> he softpeddled the advantages of becoming white men. The end result was that the
                    Indians, threatened by American encroachment, sided with the British in 1812.</p>
            <p>Horsman believes that the United States could have saved itself considerable tribulation had it never
                    enunciated a policy of acculturation. Westward expansion could never have been peacefully achieved
                    for the only policy acceptable to the Indians was for the United States to remain where it was.
                    Since this was historically impossible, Horsman argues that the United States should have adopted a
                    more realistic program, one which would have taken conflict for granted.</p>
            <p>The organizational framework of this study is twofold. Descriptive chapters on the policy itself
                    precede those illustrating the policy in action. Horsman could have written a tighter narrative; for
                    example, the reader is told three times in the space of fifteen pages why certain Indians joined the
                    British in 1812 (pp. 154, 167, 169). The book is adequately researched, and the bibliography
                    includes Horsman's four published articles which formed the basis of this book.</p>

            <p>Nineteenth century rural America, writes Hayter, was profoundly affected by forces attendant to the
                    Industrial Revolution. Especially after 1850 as farmers were challenged by urbanism, mobility,
                    science, and technology, they were faced with a "conflict between their traditional values
                    and those of the strange new world in which they found themselves" resulting in a
                    "disquieting uncertainty" (pp. 9-10). The "troubled farmer,"
                    notes Hayter, was ill equipped to handle the numerous problems resulting from the ever increasing
                    complexity of commercialized agriculture.</p>
            <pb n="334" id="VAA4025-064-4-068"/>
            <p>The author's purpose is to relate how the Industrial Revolution affected the
                    farmers' daily lives and particularly to describe farm opposition to and support of
                    innovations. This, then, is intended to be a social history; consequently, such topics as currency
                    agitation and tariff reform are not within its scope. Hayter covers a number of diverse farm
                    problems including the oleomargarine controversy, the introduction of barbed wire, the advent of
                    scientific veterinarian practices, and the complex battles over patent rights to farm devices.</p>
            <p>There is much of value and interest in the book, but it is essentially a series of somewhat
                    disjointed essays. Most of the essays are rather clearly related to the central thought of the
                    farmers' difficult adjustment to industrialism, but several are somewhat afield. For
                    example, there is much more attention given to the types of fencing that preceded barbed wire than
                    to the impact of barbed wire itself. Likewise, the chapter "Sheep versus Dogs" is
                    related to the Industrial Revolution on the premise that mechanical gadgetry had transformed the dog
                    from a serviceable animal to a useless creature. These topics could well have been sacrificed in
                    favor of some key neglected areas such as farm machinery, railroads, and farm organizations.</p>
            <p>The essays are the result of extensive research, primarily in farm journals and government reports.
                    They are well organized, evidence much thoughtful preparation, and are copiously documented. The
                    writing is generally clear and concise, but it is marred by frequent rough transitions and use of
                    the first person.</p>
            <p>Despite obvious limitations, the book will be useful for students of nineteenth century agriculture
                    because Hayter provides information on a wide range of miscellaneous, yet important, problems and
                    issues which confronted American farmers.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Conservative Reformers: German-American Catholics and the Social Order</hi>. By
                    Philip Gleason. (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1968. Pp. x, 272. Notes,
                    bibliographical note, index. $8.95.)</head>
            <p>About six million Germans emigrated to the United States between 1820 and 1920. Among them were many
                    Catholics from Bavaria, Westphalia, and other parts of Germany. Within a single decade (1881-1890)
                    the high tide of an estimated 400,000 German Catholics came to America where they formed a
                    self-conscious, distinctive group aware of its German origin and culture and also of its Catholic
                    faith. Eventually the German-American Catholics had their own mutual aid societies, publications,
                    and spokesmen.</p>
            <p>Philip Gleason has studied carefully the evolution of one German- American Catholic organization with
                    a history reaching back to its founding in 1855 in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName>. This was
                    Der Deutsche Römische-Katholische Central-Verein von Nord Amerika, more commonly called
                    the Central-Verein, <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-064-4-069"/> a national federation of parish mutual aid
                    societies. The gradual Americanization of the membership, the dropping of German for English, the
                    strains of World War I on people of multiple loyalties, and the changes in society produced by
                    steady industrialization and growth of city life, all seriously affected the character of the
                    Central-Verein as can be seen in its publication, the <hi rend="i">Central-Blatt</hi>. Membership
                    figures—125,000 in 1916 to some 86,000 in 1930 and then to 311 men in
                    1966—indicate the decline of the Central-Verein and the weakening of German-American
                    Catholic ethnic consciousness, evident by the mid-1920's. An account of the leaders of the
                    organization, their programs and social ideas are essential elements in Gleason's account.</p>
            <p>The author explicitly states that he has undertaken "an organizational and ideological
                    analysis of the evolution of the German-American Catholic group" (p. 258). He has done a
                    good job. The writing is clear, forceful, and always to the point. Gleason has supplied a valuable
                    annotated bibliography which contains some references, incidentally, to materials on Polish,
                    Lithuanian, French-Canadian, and Slovak immigrants in America who all have had strong Catholic
                    loyalties. There is a good index.</p>
            <p>The author did not aim at an explanation of the roots of German- American Catholic self-awareness,
                    the sense of "peoplehood." But, for the reader who does not belong to this group,
                    a short digression might have been a welcome introduction to the distinctive dialects, cooking,
                    music, family celebrations of Christmas, wedding customs, picnics, parades, and festivals which,
                    along with religious affiliation, created a sense of community. Among the German-American Catholics
                    these things deserve a place somewhere in the historical record because they formed the foundation
                    of the Central- Verein; and when they ceased to be, the Central-Verein disappeared with them.
                    Gleason asserts that "to the degree that it is a structured body rather than a formless
                    collectivity of individuals, ethnic organizations actually <hi rend="i">constitute</hi> the
                    group" (p. 217). This carefully phrased assertion places too much emphasis, I believe, on
                    the role of organizations in society, for ethnic organizations can not survive in a vacuum without
                    individuals who share a common culture and a desire to perpetuate it.</p>

            <p>The manuscript for this volume was unfinished at the time of Fred Shannon's death; but with
                    the cooperation of the Shannon family, Robert H. Jones, his former student, completed it for
                    publication. Some of the chapters had gone through several drafts, others were only in rough draft
                    when the editor began his work. Some materials were deleted, others relegated to foot- <pb n="336" id="VAA4025-064-4-070"/> notes by the editor. But the editor attempted to preserve
                    Shannon's style and organization as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Shannon knew more about the American past than any other historian this reviewer has encountered. And
                    as one who had great respect for Shannon as a historian, he regrets that the book was published. The
                    reviewer is confident that Shannon would never have submitted the volume to his publishers until it
                    had been greatly improved over the version which has now been published. It is with great pain that
                    the volume is assessed for it clearly is not characteristic of the work which Shannon produced
                    during his distinguished career.</p>
            <p>The basic weakness of the volume is its inadequate conceptual framework. It covers essentially the
                    years between 1876 and 1892, but there is no adequate conceptual explanation provided as to why
                    these years constitute a significant period of American history. A consequence of the
                    book's weak conceptualization is its encyclopedic nature.</p>
            <p>The best sections of the volume deal with agriculture. But very little is presented that was not
                    originally in Shannon's excellent volume <hi rend="i">The Farmer's Last
                    Frontier</hi>. Indeed, the basic tragedy of this volume, apart from its inadequate
                    conceptualization, is that very little new information or interpretation is presented. The focus is
                    primarily on politics and economics. Because this was a period when the nation's economic
                    and political systems were undergoing significant changes, it is unfortunate that there is no
                    adequate attempt to explain systematically the changes of the political and economic structures of
                    the period. The political analysis is too much confined to presidential politics, and not enough
                    emphasis is placed on other levels of political activity— particularly at the state and
                    local levels. For all practical purposes, the emerging bureaucratization of politics at the local
                    and state levels is ignored. And for this reviewer's tastes, the economic analysis is
                    overly moralistic, with not enough explanation as to why and how new economic structures were
                    emerging in American society.</p>
            <p>Even so, there are few general histories of the late nineteenth century, and this one, despite its
                    inadequacies, does provide a useful synthesis of the period for the general reader. But this
                    reviewer is confident that many who knew Fred Shannon will share the conclusion that this is not the
                    book that he would have published.</p>

                    doubtless quite familiar with Arville Funk's various booklets and articles on Indiana
                    history. The commentary, tables, maps, and illustrations in this booklet provide much interesting

                    war upon life within Indiana. The list of suggested readings, with which Funk closes this work, is a
                    useful guide to writings concerning Indiana in the Civil War era.</p>

                    during the 1830's and 1840's, when he lived briefly in southern and then for a
                    longer time in northwestern Indiana. They are particularly useful in illustrating contrasts between
                    frontier agriculture in the southern and the northwestern parts of the state. Robinson's
                    role as a pioneer farmer in Indiana, and as a leader in agricultural innovation and improvement,
                    merits increased consideration by both Indiana and agricultural historians. Hopefully the reprint of
                    these volumes, originally published by the Indiana Historical Bureau, will encourage such
                    consideration.</p>

                    bibliography, index. Paperbound, $2.95.) Sosin has produced a quite readable and a very
                    informative account concerning the West during the two decades from the conclusion of the French and
                    Indian War to the end of the American Revolution. Moreover, his annotated bibliography affords a
                    most helpful guide to both the basic primary and secondary sources for the West during the period
                    under review. Sosin gives much emphasis to land speculation and the role of big-time speculators in
                    the development of the West. He also portrays relations between East and West as well as the impact
                    of the frontier on political and social life in a manner which he believes is at considerable
                    variance with the view espoused by Frederick <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> Turner about such relations and impact. This reviewer, however, doubts whether Sosin
                    has represented Turner's views as adequately as is desirable or in a context which presents
                    the larger perspectives in which his views require consideration. The two decades between 1763 and
                    1783 are too early and also too brief a period to allow an appropriate testing and evaluation of
                    Turner's views about the influence of the frontier in the development of the United States.</p>

                    has made a statistical analysis of hundreds of roll call votes in both houses of Congress,
                    1841-1852; Alexander <pb n="339" id="VAA4025-064-4-073"/> has done the same for the lower house of
                    Congress, 1836-1860. Each author has assembled, computerized, and evaluated a massive amount of
                    data, and both arrive at countless conclusions about various issues and votes as well as at numerous
                    generalizations about trends and important developments. Used wisely these volumes can be thought
                    provoking and helpful. On the other hand, if used without adequate regard to subjective factors
                    involved, to variations in numbers included from vote to vote, and to the fact that votes cast must
                    inevitably be interpreted in much more than their mere mathematical context, they will be of limited
                    value.</p>
