                        Fort Wayne
                    , like other communities throughout the North in the middle of the nineteenth century,
                    was caught in the growing storm over slavery. Controversies that had long been brewing suddenly
                    intensified as a result of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act of 1854. Defying the threat of heavy penalties, a small group of 
                        Fort Wayne
                     citizens helped runaway slaves in the secret work of the Underground Railroad. After
                    Congress passed the 
                        Kansas

                     Act of 1854, 
                        Fort Wayne
                     people of various political allegiances worked together to stop the spread of slavery
                    into new western territories. A small, persistent body of them were abolitionists. Inspired by their
                    religious convictions, they called for the end of slavery and for equal rights for African
                    Americans.
            Historians have given little attention to the debates over slavery in the rapidly growing town of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . In part this reflects the scarcity of primary sources, such as diaries, letters, and
                    other personal papers of antislavery leaders. Moreover, 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's financial and political leaders, such as Allen 
                        Hamilton
                    , Hugh McCulloch, and Samuel Hanna, apparently took little interest in the antislavery
                    movement. Late-twentieth century studies by Charles R. Poinsatte and George R. Mather, however,
                    demonstrate that citizens in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     participated in the contest between supporters of slavery and freedom that was being
                    played out elsewhere across the country.1
            
            This study will view the debate over slavery in northeast Indiana during the turbulent 1850s as it
                    was seen by a weekly abolitionist newspaper, the

                     June 1, 1854, and June 7, 1855, this newspaper supported the
                    major reforms of the day: repeal of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act, temperance, and public education. However, its support for temperance and
                    universal education seems pale compared with the paper's agitation for equal citizenship
                    for African Americans. Events in 1854 and 1855 cast a long shadow across a country increasingly
                    divided between North and South. The Standard records the stories of anonymous
                    African American slaves who escaped through Indiana and neighboring states in search of freedom. Its
                    issues also record how individual leaders responded to the growing political and moral debate over
                    slavery. A largely unknown primary source for abolitionism in Indiana, the Standard reveals an aspect of radicalism in the state in this period that has been
                        overlooked.2
            
            Why did a radical abolitionist newspaper come to be located in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    ? By 1854 
                        Fort Wayne
                     was a rapidly growing center for trade in northeast Indiana and northwest 
                        Ohio
                    . While the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Erie
                     Canal had accounted for much of the town's growth over the previous twenty
                    years, railroads being built to connect 
                        Fort Wayne
                     to 
                        Pittsburgh
                     in the East and to 
                        Chicago
                     in the West promised faster year-round shipping. In the early 1850s the town had
                    attracted thousands of newcomers from middle Atlantic and north central states as well as from 
                        Germany
                    . The town of approximately 6,500 people was home to 
                        Fort Wayne
                     College, a public lecture series, a theater for traveling entertainers, and a public
                        library.3
            
            Some newcomers were known for their opposition to slavery and undoubtedly attracted others with
                    similar views. Physicians Mary F. Thomas and Owen Thomas moved to the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     area in 1849 from a strongly abolitionist settlement near 
                        Salem
                     in 
                        Columbiana County
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    . Mary Thomas's father, Samuel Myers, was a leader of the 
                        Ohio
                     Anti-Slavery Society. Lindley Ninde, an attorney who came north to 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in 1850, grew up in the intensely antislavery community of Camden (now Pennville) in 
                        Jay County
                     in east-central Indiana. Active in Free Soil politics, Ninde had close ties to
                    Indiana's leading political abolitionists, including George 
                        Washington
                     Julian of Centreville in

                    "president" of the Underground Railroad. Charles Case, another attorney, grew up
                    in Austinburg, 
                        Ohio
                    , a community settled by New 
                        England
                     abolitionists, and by the time he settled in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in 1850, Case had already won a fugitive slave case and edited a Free Soil newspaper.

                        Fort Wayne
                    's Berry Street Methodist Episcopal Church, joined other leaders of the North
                    Indiana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in September 1853 to call for the end of all
                    slavery in the 
                        United States
                     "by all peaceable as well as reasonable means."4
            
            An abolitionist newspaper could expect to attract subscribers from the surrounding rural areas as
                    well. Northern Indiana provided more supporters of the Free Soil party, formed in 1848 to oppose
                    slavery in new territories, than other parts of the state did, and the region's
                            
                  Randolph, Elkhart
               , La Grange, and 
                        Steuben
                     counties were the only ones in Indiana that had rejected Article XIII of the revised
                    Indiana Constitution of 1851, which prohibited black people from settling in the state.5
            
            The Standard's publisher, Daniel W. Burroughs, like so many other
                    abolitionist leaders and reputed operators of the Underground Railroad, remains largely elusive to
                    historians. He was born September 8, 1808, in eastern 
                        Vermont
                     and by 1830 seems to have moved to 
                        Ohio
                    . Within the next five years, Burroughs was called to the ministry, and in 1835 he
                    served the Baptist church in the village of Chazy in the northeast corner of 
                        New York

                    , where he briefly served the Baptist church.6
            
            Burroughs was probably converted to abolitionism in the 1830s while serving as a minister in 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Vermont
                    . Antislavery organizations in both states were among the earliest and most influential
                    in the East; agents traveled widely to lecture, organize local societies, and pass out literature.
                    Furthermore, the crusade against slavery was largely driven by religious leaders, Baptists included.
                    By 1836 the Baptist State Convention of 
                        Vermont
                     endorsed "the speedy and entire abolition of slavery in the 
                        United States
                     and in the world." In this same period, seven out of the nine Baptist
                    associations in 
                        Vermont
                     supported antislavery resolutions at their conferences, and the Baptist journal for 
                        Vermont
                    , the

                    publisher for the

                     Anti-Slavery Society.7
            
            How Burroughs came to be called in 1848 to serve as minister to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's First Baptist Church is not known. The 
                        Fort Wayne
                     church was hardly an easy assignment for a 
                        Vermont
                     abolitionist, because most Indiana Baptists feared radicalism and many had strong ties
                    to southern states; most congregations preferred to avoid the slavery question. Burroughs may have
                    agreed to the new assignment because Baptists in northern Indiana had already firmly condemned
                    slavery. In 1842 the Northeastern Association of Baptists, composed of churches in La Grange, 
                        Steuben
                    , Noble, and Dekalb counties, had gone on record as "deploring" human
                    slavery. In 1846 the 
                        Huntington
                     Baptist Association, which included the 
                        Fort Wayne

                            means alone, to overthrow this great evil.
                     The following year, the association once again condemned slavery and called on their

            Burroughs's service as pastor to the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     congregation was apparently a mixed success; his church reported to the Hunt-ington
                    organization in 1849 that he was well accepted by some members of his congregation, despite a loss
                    of members and low attendance: "[W]e are at peace among ourselves," the report
                    proclaimed. "[I]t has been a painful duty to exclude quite a number from our communion, and
                    our prosperity is not of a very encouraging character, we have stated [sic]
                    preaching by our beloved brother D. W. Burroughs, but the ways of Zion mourn, because few come to
                    her solemn feasts." The degree to which attendance at the First Baptist Church declined
                    because of its minister's views on slavery can only be guessed. Certainly, in his sermons
                    Burroughs made it no secret that he considered slavery "a sin against God, humanity and
                        nature."9
            
            After two years as minister, Burroughs resigned his pulpit to open a printing business and sell
                    books. He was also appointed to minor posts in the town's government: in 1850 he served on
                    the board of health, and in 1854, he was sealer of weights and measures. The latter position gave
                    him responsibility for inspecting local businesses to ensure that tradespeople were buying and
                    selling in accordance with set standards, no minor task given 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's growing importance as a commercial center. When he launched the Standard in June 1854, Burroughs apparently had the capital to invest in his new business
                    and the respect of other local businessmen.10

                        sin against God, humanity and nature; therefore, we will in no wise contenance
                        either, but will bear our testimony against these as against other sins."

            The appearance of the Standard reflected a new sense of political urgency about the
                    antislavery issue in 1854. Political rallies in the late spring and early summer brought together
                    hundreds of voters on all sides of the antislavery controversy to form a new anti-
                        Nebraska
                     party called the People's party. Old political allegiances disappeared as some
                    former Democrats, Whigs, Free Soilers, and Know Nothings pledged to work together to restore the 
                        Missouri
                     Compromise of 1820, which had restricted slavery "forever" to lands
                    south of 36° 30' latitude. In spite of their differences and conceding that
                    slavery in southern states was constitutional, party members collectively resolved to
                    "never consent to any compromise with slavery."11
            
            
               
                        Fort Wayne
                     already had two viable newspapers in 1854, the antislavery 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Times and the Democratic

                    Sentinel. The Times, published by John W. Dawson, was staunchly
                    opposed to the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act, while the Sentinel, published by Thomas Tigar, endorsed it as
                    the key to saving the union. Although the Times was antislavery, it was also
                    strongly opposed to abolitionism and characterized abolitionists as "fanatical"
                    and "impractical." 
                  
                     11The Know Nothing party had come into being in 1852. Many members
                            were former Whigs who opposed the increased political powers of foreigners and Catholics.

                        Fort Wayne
                     newspapers folded in the early summer of 1854: Thomas Cook's literary 
                  
                            Laurel
                         Wreath, which he had published for two years, and the short-lived temperance
                    newspaper, the Prohibitionist.
               12
            
            Their demise provided an opportunity for 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's abolitionists, led by Burroughs, to take the argument against the extension
                    of slavery much farther than the compromise platform of the People's party had done. In the
                    first issue of the Standard, on June 1, 1854, Burroughs and his fellow editors,
                    Case and John Hough, Jr., (like Case, also an attorney) promised to advocate not only for the repeal
                    of the 
                        Kansas
                    -
                        Nebraska
                     Act but also for the constitutional right of all people to equality. "The Standard will be unequivocally and prominently the advocate of Equal
                    Rights' opposing whatever conflicts with such rights, whether it be Involuntary Personal
                    Servitude or any other violation of the doctrine of ‘equal and exact justice to all
                    men.’" Furthermore, the Standard pledged to "deal
                    plainly and fearlessly with the question of Slavery in all its bearings." The paper further
                    intended to champion other key reform issues of the day—temperance and public
                        education.13
            
            Although the Standard introduced a radical voice never before represented in a 
                        Fort Wayne
                     newspaper, it was not the first abolitionist organ in the state. In the village of 
                        Newport
                     (now 
                        Fountain City
                    ) in 
                        Wayne County
                    , the state's center for political abolitionism, New 
                        England
                     abolitionist Arnold Buffum had started the first antislavery newspaper in Indiana, the 
                        Newport
                    
                    Protectionist, in January 1841. Soon 
                        Quaker
                     physicians Benjamin Stanton and Henry Way took over Buffum's newspaper and
                    changed its name to the 
                        Newport
                    
                    Free Labor Advocate and Anti-Slavery Chronicle; they continued publication until
                    September 1848. In addition to reporting meetings of anti-slavery societies concentrated primarily
                    in east-central Indiana, this newspaper presented the positions of Quakers who broke away from the
                    more conservative and more powerful Indiana Yearly Meeting over slavery.14

                    Democrat (published from January 9, 1850, to December 16,1852) had appeared briefly in near by 
                        Wayne County
                    . Both newspapers supported Julian, Indiana's leading Free Soil politician, who
                    was elected to Congress in 1849 and ran on the national Free Soil ticket for Vice President in 1852.
                    (Newspapers elsewhere in Indiana also appeared in this same time period to support Free Soil
                    candidates.) In early January 1853 the Indiana True Democrat's publisher,
                    Rawson Vaile, changed the paper's name to the Indiana Free Democrat and
                    moved it to

                     published in Indiana during 1854 and 1855 is difficult to
                    gather. Burroughs also published a daily newspaper, the 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Daily Standard, between November 1854 and January 1856. No copies are known to
                    have survived, and its rival weekly newspaper, the 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Times, provides what little is known about this paper. When the Free
                        Democrat ceased publication in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at the end of December 1854, the Standard "appeared to be
                    the only avowed anti-slavery newspaper in the state" for the next six months.16 Isaac Hoover Julian, an attorney from 
                        Wayne County
                     who joined Burroughs as editor in September 1854, claimed that the Standard was "the most thorough-going and radically reformatory paper in the
                    entire State." Certainly, the newspaper's plea for equal rights and its attention
                    to the struggles of African Americans placed Burroughs and his editors among the most liberal
                    newspaper crusaders of their day.17
            
            Burroughs's assistants on the Standard, Case and Hough, were prominent 
                        Fort Wayne
                     attorneys and former editors of the Prohibitionist. Before moving to 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in 1850, Case had briefly edited a Free Soil newspaper in Bryan, 
                        Ohio
                    . He had also established a reputation as a bitter opponent of slavery, a "bona
                    fide" abolitionist of the "law and order" class. During the Standard's first months, he took charge of the slavery department, but he
                    withdrew in the fall of 1854 to run on the People's party ticket for the Indiana state
                    legislature. Hough, a leader in temperance efforts and a founder of 
                        Fort Wayne
                     College, briefly directed the temperance department.18
            
            In September thirty-one-year-old Isaac Julian, an attorney and writer from centreville, took over as
                    the Standard's editor. Julian belonged to a 
                        Wayne County
                     family long known for opposition to slavery, fondness for learning, and political
                    activism. Two of his uncles, Frederick Hoover and William Bulla, were known to be conductors of the
                    Underground Railroad. Isaac's older brother, George, had been elected to Congress in 1849
                    on the Free Soil ticket to represent the intensely antislavery Fourth Congressional District of
                    Indiana (

               , and Union counties). One of only nine Free Soil members of

                     Julian had fought the bills known as the Compromise of 1850, especially the fugitive
                    slave bill. Isaac had supported his brother's campaign for Vice President on the national

            Burroughs and his editors were highly controversial figures in the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     of their time. An editorial in July 1854 indicated that they were prepared for the
                    risks associated with controversy: "It [publication of the Standard] will
                    cost money, and time—it may cost more—it may cost those who are connected with
                    it, the displeasure of some, whose friendship and society were prized." Bert Griswold, a
                    local historian, claimed that Burroughs, in fact, "brought upon him many threats of
                    personal injury" as well as "the ‘egging’ of his newspaper
                    office." It is likely that the views expressed by the Sentinel's
                    publisher, Tigar, in the summer of 1855 represented a widespread racism that sanctioned attempts to
                    intimidate the abolitionists. If black people were given the vote, Tigar warned, before long they
                    would be "made equal, in all things, with the whites. … Will the people of
                    Indiana endorse … such unnatural doctrines? ‘Down with the poor white man, but
                    up with the negro."’ Moreover, Burroughs also incurred the anger of some local
                    citizens because he supported the Underground Railroad. While no records prove his direct
                    involvement, he came close to admitting his participation when he wrote in the Standard that "most abolitionists belong to the Underground Railroad."20
            
            Burroughs and his editors left a record in the Standard of their willingness to
                    "deal plainly and fearlessly with the question of Slavery in all its bearings."

                     and his editors enthusiastically supported the election of
                    Samuel S. Brenton, People's candidate and Methodist minister, to Congress from the large
                    Tenth District. They carried news of slaveholders rushing to settle in 
                        Kansas
                     Territory. Compared with the coverage in the Times, however,
                    Burroughs and his editors devoted far more space to exposing the injustices of the slave system. Not
                    only did the Standard frequently reprint stories from other newspapers or
                    "exchanges" noting slave rescues and escapes, it also reported incidents that
                    occurred close to home, in northern Indiana. Moreover, the Standard's
                    editorials reflected the high-minded radical convictions of its publisher and editors; in an era
                    when newspapers included little local news and when publishers often indulged in petty personal
                    attacks, the Standard proved an exception.21
            
            While the Times occasionally reprinted accounts of fugitive slaves who gained
                    national attention, the Standard's frequent and more localized reporting
                    of escaped slaves both aroused sympathy for the plight of runaway slaves and alerted readers to the
                    possibility that fugitives might come through their own neighborhoods. On July 6, 1854, the paper
                    reported that twenty-three slaves from 
                  Grant County,
                            Kentucky
               , "made their escape on
                    Tuesday night. They descended the Licking river in disguise, and crossed the 
                        Ohio
                     below 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and immediately set out for 
                        Canada
                    ." After this notice, the following report appeared: "Nine fugitive
                    slaves from 
                        Boone County
                    , Ky., were arrested in the suburbs of 
                        Cincinnati
                     on Wednesday night, including four men and three children. They are said to present a
                    deplorable sight. One of the men was over sixty years of age." Late in August the Standard informed its readers that Jesse Johnston, a former slave, had
                    "succeeded in ‘stealing’ his daughter from Boone Co., Ky. She is now
                    safe and under the care of a conductor of the underground railway." In November,
                    "[f]ive slaves—three men and two women—made their escape from 
                        Bourbon county
                    , Ky., on the 22d ult. They were traced to the Ohio river, after
                    which all clue to them was lost. Probably they took passage on the Underground
                        railroad."22
            
            The Standard also printed accounts of abolitionists who helped fugitive slaves in
                    neighboring states. For example, in the fall of 1854 
                  
                     21For Samuel S. Brenton see George R. Mather, "Samuel S.
                            Brenton, Clergyman and Congressman," Old Fort News, LII (No. 1,
                            1989), 2-9. Brenton was elected to three terms in Congress—as a Whig in 1851, for
                            the People's party in 1854, and as a Republican in 1856. Brenton believed that
                            slavery was both morally wrong and inconsistent with the principles of the Constitution and
                            that the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 should be unconditionally repealed. His positions
                            paralleled those of the North Indiana Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

               , for helping fugitive slaves escape, was given full coverage in the
                    August 3 issue. In October the Standard reported that "A negro [who] had
                    acted out the Declaration of Independence, by leaving 
                        Kentucky
                    " was freed by a judge in 
                  Hamilton
                        County, Ohio
               , "who was not
                    long finding out whose man he was, because the Judge holds that every man belongs to God and to
                        himself."23
            
            Occasionally, the Standard also carried news about fugitive slaves very close to
                    home. On October 12 the paper reported that slave hunters from 
                        Kentucky
                     had been in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     the week before looking for "three ungrateful
                    wretches" who, "unmindful of the blessings and benefits of Slavery, which had
                    been bestowed upon them from infancy up to manhood, without leave[,]" had escaped to 
                        Canada
                    . The fugitives had then traveled back to 
                        Detroit
                    , where slave hunters spotted them and pursued them to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . Outraged that the local sheriff and city marshal had aided the slave catchers, the Standard urged the fugitives to get back to 
                        Canada
                     as quickly as possible and to stay there. "If we can help you by giving you a
                    cup of water or a meal of victuals, we will do it, gladly; but we say to those who have succeeded in
                    getting into 
                        Canada
                     once, stay there; don't cross the river again, for you are
                    in the greatest danger of being caught up when you think not of it." In a brief notice the
                    following December, the Standard gave this general but stunningly bold report of
                    Underground Railroad activity in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    : "The U.G.R.R. is doing a larger business at this time than ever before. We
                    hear that it averages over twenty five weekly and they all go through safely." Two months
                    later, business on the Underground Railroad was so busy that helpers were struggling to keep up.
                    "The Under Ground Railroad, has become so over run with business, as we learn from some of
                    its managers that it has been obliged to send out extra trains both day and night, and then could
                    hardly keep their Depots cleared of Freight, with what was transported, on the ABOVE GROUND
                        Railroad."24
            
            Unlike the Times, the Standard also reported on the condition of
                    African Americans already living in Indiana. Black Laws adapted by the Indiana legislature and added
                    to the revised state constitution in 1851 denied free blacks basic rights of citizenship, such as
                    the right to vote, to testify in court against a white person, to serve in the militia, 
                  
                     23
                     Ibid., September 14, October 19, 1854. The trial
                            of Delia Webster was given much publicity in abolitionist newspapers.

                     and to send their children to public schools. After 1851 it was
                    illegal for African Americans even to enter Indiana. Furthermore, because of the fugitive slave law
                    of 1850, black residents were liable to be kidnapped and sold into slavery. Two incidents alerted
                    the Standard's readers to some of the injustices local blacks
                    experienced.
            In the late summer of 1854, free African Americans from western states, primarily from western
                            
                  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana
               , and 
                        Illinois
                    , met in 
                        Cincinnati
                     to promote "the intellectual and religious improvement of the colored
                    people." Of highest priority to both races in the free states, they asserted, was
                    "that all the colored people should receive at least a good common school
                    education" and that well-qualified teachers should be available for this purpose. The
                    reality black people faced, however, was that only a few private academies in Indiana, most notably
                    Union Literary Institute in 
                        Randolph County
                     and the Eleutherian Institute in 
                        Jefferson County
                    , offered them an education beyond elementary grades. Most other efforts to improve
                    educational opportunities in Indiana were delayed until after the Civil War, when public schools for
                    black children first became available.25
            
            Under the Fugitive Slave Act, fugitives and free African Americans alike could be arrested and forced
                    into slavery upon a sworn affidavit by the alleged slave owner or an agent of the slave owner. Risks
                    were particularly great in southern Indiana because of activities of slave hunters and the policy of
                    the 
                        Kentucky
                    -owned Jefferson and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad. In August 1854 the Standard reported that the railroad
                    required black passengers to show proof that they were free in the form of a letter from
                    "some well known 
                        Jeffersonville
                     resident." Otherwise, railroad officers were empowered to take anyone without
                    such papers into 
                        Kentucky
                    , where they were "imprisoned and whipped, until their freedom could be
                    proved." If no proof was provided, the captives could then be sold into slavery.26

                        anyone with one-eighth or more "Negro" blood could not vote or testify in
                        court against a white person. Beginning in 1831 blacks moving into the state were required to
                        post bond as a guarantee they would not become dependent upon public welfare or convicted of a
                        crime. Under the 1851 revised constitution, Article XIII, blacks were not allowed to move into
                        Indiana. Those already living in the state were encouraged to move to Africa. Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, 14-15.

                         for nine years before being tried under the Fugitive Slave Act. The slave owner was
                        not able to prove that Freeman was in fact his escaped slave, and the case was dropped.
                        Nonetheless, Freeman was imprisoned "for more than sixty days" and incurred
                        expenses "exclusive of lawyer's fees of near fifteen hundred

            In December 1854 the risks faced by those who helped fugitive slaves were brought home to the Standard's readers with the trial of abolitionist Benjamin B. Waterhouse
                    in the federal district court held in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Waterhouse, a resident of 
                        La Grange County
                    , was accused by a deputy marshal of transporting two former 
                        Kentucky
                     slaves to a relative's home in Kinderhook, 
                        Michigan
                    , in August 1853. The former slaves had run away from their owner, Daniel M. Payne of
                            
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , ten years earlier, in August 1843. At that time
                    Payne's son had pursued them to 
                        Louisville
                    , then into Indiana, to 
                        Madison
                    , to Napoleon in 
                        Ripley County
                    , to Clarksburgh, and finally to 
                        Richmond
                    , where he "lost all trace of them." Almost ten years later, in June
                    1854, the deputy marshal made arrangements for the slave owner's son and a 
                        La Grange County
                     witness to travel with him to 
                  Windsor,
                            Ontario
               , to identify the fugitive
                        slaves.27
            
            The Waterhouse trial dramatized for the Standard's readers the power the
                    law gave to slave owners to hunt fugitives in northern states and 
                        Canada
                    . Under the law's provisions, public funds paid the slave owner's son,
                    Wellington Payne, and witnesses to travel to 
                        Windsor
                     to identify the two accused men. Moreover, the Waterhouse trial had legal significance
                    because it was the first case tried in Indiana that tested the provision for severe penalties under
                    the 1850 law. Waterhouse was liable for fines of $1,000 and six months'
                    imprisonment if found guilty of helping fugitives and was further liable to the slaves'
                    owner for $1,000 for each fugitive whom he aided.
            The verdict in the Waterhouse trial was a clear victory for abolitionists. The defense provided by
                    George Julian and E. H. Brackett won a verdict that mocked the harsh provisions of the fugitive
                    slave law. Although they found Waterhouse guilty as charged, the jury and the presiding judge fined
                    him only $50 and imprisoned him for one hour.28
            
            The Standard reminded readers that the previous spring "seven or eight
                    indictments" brought against 
                        Steuben County
                     abolitionists in Judge Elisha Mills 
                        Huntington
                    's district court had been dropped because of insufficient evidence. The Standard's readers no doubt found such legal victories indeed
                        heartening.29
            
            The Standard consistently ran editorials denouncing all aspects of slavery. In the
                    paper's first issue in June 1854 Case argued that slavery was incompatible with the
                    Constitution, since the Constitu-

                     tion was "ordained and established to secure the
                    blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity." Moreover, Case wrote, Congress had no
                    power to establish slavery. Congress was instead "empowered … to do
                        Right; therefore it [was] within its province to inhibit Slavery throughout its own
                        territories."30
            
            Later that summer Case rebuked the Sentinel's publisher, Tigar, for
                    criticizing ministers, particularly Methodist ministers, for preaching against slavery. Using
                    Tigar's logic, Case responded, "Sin ceases to be sin if a man commits it as a
                    politician, or if the law commands it, and therefore God's ministers have no right to
                    rebuke it as such! Such is the Gospel according to pro-slavery democracy."31
            
            Case also criticized 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's Fourth of July celebration. Most citizens, he wrote, "went it on
                    their own hook." The Germans had a gathering in Ewing's grove, "where
                    they had an oration in their own tongue and other spirited proceedings. Of course they had good
                    music—they always have that," he added. While the Declaration of Independence
                    had asserted human equality and rights, three million black Americans were held in slavery.
                    "Strange progress have we made since July fourth Seventeen hundred and seventy
                        six!"32
            
            In August Case hailed the decision by the 
                        Wisconsin
                     Supreme Court in a case tried under the Fugitive Slave Act as "the first
                    judicial blow at the monstrous law." According to Case, the law was a poison, "a
                    nauseous cup," that freemen of the North drank "in remembrance of that Union which
                    they loved." Every attempt to enforce it, however, caused "a terrible
                    retching." In the decision regarding the fugitive slave Sherman M. Booth, Judge A. D. Smith
                    declared that federally appointed commissioners had no legal authority to bring cases against
                    fugitive slaves and that, furthermore, fugitive slaves had the right to trial by jury under the
                    Constitution. "Years hence … on the record of our country's history,
                    for the year 1854, it shall furnish a bright page amidst its general darkness," the Standard predicted.33
            
            When Isaac Julian took over as editor in September 1854 he too pledged to support "the holy
                    cause of Freedom." He promised as well to promote the principles adopted by the Free Soil
                    party at their 1852 
                        Pittsburgh
                     convention and to avoid the "narrowness and intolerance" he found to
                    be common with other editors. But after only a month in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     Julian returned to Centreville "very much out of health."34 Thereafter, through the spring of 1855, Julian contributed articles as
                    corresponding editor from Centreville.

                        Julian's first reaction to 
                            Fort Wayne
                         in September 1854 reminds us of how isolated and disease ridden this northeast
                        Indiana town was at mid-nineteenth century. He had reached 
                            Fort Wayne
                         by an overnight
            
            
            Perhaps Julian's physical absense made him an easier target for Dawson. The Times's editor called him "facetious,"
                    "garrulous," "distempered," and "a hybrid between the
                    fool and the knave." Above all, as a radical abolitionist, Julian was guilty of the
                    greatest sin of all: "impractical ultraism."35 Certainly
                    Julian's record in the Standard demonstrates that he was an impassioned
                    champion for social justice.
            Isaac Julian was probably still in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     the week of September 14, 1854, when his essay on "Legislation of Indiana
                    respecting Colored People" appeared in the Standard and quickly drew
                    national attention. The Indiana Yearly Meeting of Anti-Slavery Friends had solicited his analysis
                    following the overwhelming approval by Indiana voters of the revised 1851 constitution. Two weeks
                    after its publication in the Standard, the essay was reprinted in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Indiana Free Democrat. A month later, it appeared on the front page of William
                    Lloyd Garrison's 
                        Boston
                    
                    Liberator. Decidedly direct in style, Julian's analysis revealed
                    systematic and deeply entrenched racial discrimination in the Hoosier state.36
            
            After 1831 African Americans, upon settling in Indiana, were required either to post a
                    $500 bond as proof of their financial independence or be hired out for six months, but
                    Article XIII of the new 1851 constitution altogether forbade "Negroes" and
                    "mulattos" (defined as anyone with one-eighth or more "Negro"
                    blood) to come into or settle in Indiana. Anyone employing or otherwise encouraging African
                    Americans to remain in the state was to be fined. Furthermore, a fund gathered from such fines was
                    to be used to buy land in Africa for colonizing African Americans already living in Indiana; those
                    who wanted to stay in Indiana were required to provide witnesses to prove that they had settled in
                    the state before November 1851. Moreover, they had to register with a circuit court. Point by point
                    Julian listed other basic rights of citizenship denied to African Americans: the right to vote, the
                    right to testify as a witness in any case involving a white person, the right as taxpayers to send
                    their children to common schools.37
            
            Julian explained that, in part, the harsh provisions came about because Indiana citizens were on the
                    whole "sick of all agitation connected with the African race." But it could not be
                    denied, he added, 
                  trip on the Wabash and Erie Canal "through a peculiar, rather amphibious,
                            region." According to Julian, 
                                Fort Wayne
                             was "decidedly behind the times, with respect to news and matters of
                            that sort." The town also had "considerable sickness,"
                            "not only of the usual types, but also cholera … chiefly among the
                            foreign population." Ibid., September 7, 1854. Burroughs
                            announced Julian's departure from the editorship on October 19, 1854.

                            Times, October 29, March 29, 1855. Patrick Riddleberger described Isaac
                            Julian as "a romantic and a poet who was never able to adjust to the practical
                            realities of life." Riddleberger, George

                     "that the grand primary cause, underlying all others,
                    was hatred to the negro race." Moreover, Julian emphasized that unstated
                    rules affecting the treatment of African Americans were every bit as mean-spirited and damaging as
                    those that were written. Under the "unwritten code," black people were
                    "constantly subject to insult and annoyance in traveling and the other daily avocations of
                    life" and were "practically excluded from all social privileges, and even from the
                    Christian communion." Julian added that Indiana was "in political and social
                    sympathy with the Slave Power, ready to obey, ‘with alacrity,’ its
                    Negro-catching mandate! Verily, our first work of repentance, of reform, lies within our own
                    borders—even at our very doors. May the spread of liberal education and the spirit of
                    Christianity hasten our preparation for it!"38
            
            Julian's enthusiasm for the Standard ran high in November when he
                    challenged readers to support this "pioneer enterprise." Although 
                        Fort Wayne
                     seemed an "unpropitious place" because of the "inveterate
                    prejudices" of its citizens, Julian saw potential supporters in the "rural
                    districts" and assured readers that as "the most thorough-going and radically
                    reformatory paper in the entire State," the paper was sorely needed. Comparing the Standard's bloodless war for reform with General Anthony 
                        Wayne
                    's struggles during the Revolutionary War, Julian called on 
                        Fort Wayne
                    -area citizens to become champions of "the conflict now waging—a
                    conflict, not of blood and carnage, but a peaceful, moral warfare, requiring, however, on the part
                    of its champions, at least equal firmness and determination." "Rally, then, and
                    thus make 
                        Fort Wayne
                     a centre, from which light shall radiate through the land!" he urged.39
            
            From Centreville Julian sent news of fugitive slaves back to Burroughs. On December 21 he wrote that
                    sixteen fugitives, believed to be from 
                  Covington,
                            Kentucky
               , "were recently
                    ‘put through’ the section of the Underground R.R., which runs through this
                    county." In January 1855, Julian took advantage of the Waterhouse trial the previous month
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to point out again the racism pervasive in Indiana.
            While the verdict could be seen as a victory for abolitionists, Julian still found the case
                    profoundly disturbing. "[T]he most damning fact connected with it," he charged,
                    was that "the prosecution was got up on our own soil—by the Marshal and his
                    aids." Julian believed that "we must begin a reformation here at the
                    North—in Indiana—before we can, with a good grace, condemn the peculiar
                    institution of the south, for we chiefly sustain it, and its spirit exists and bears rule among
                        us."40

            In March Julian made a rare plea on behalf of American slave women. At a recent women's
                    college commencement he had attended, the college president encouraged graduates to support missions
                    in foreign countries. The "Reverend President," Julian complained, "had
                        not one word to say in behalf of the million or more of women in
                        our own country, hard by our very borders, who are degraded to a degree scarcely paralleled
                    in the darkest regions of paganism!" Even though the speaker, like "intelligent
                    persons generally," knew the conditions of slave women, he had not acknowledged the 
                        system which not only robs them of all the common rights of humanity, but sets utterly at
                            naught all the domestic relations, in which woman is so pre-eminently interested, - wantonly
                            separating, daily and hourly, husbands and wives, parents and children, and consigning all
                            these helpless females … to nothing short of wholesale prostitution!
                                … [W]e hold that the time has gone by when the Anti-Slavery sentiment of
                            this community, based, as it is, both on Christianity and common humanity, can be ignored in
                            this way without exposure and rebuke.41
                  
                    
                
            A combination of problems ended Burroughs's career as an abolitionist publisher in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in the early winter of 1856. No doubt the "heavy expenses" of
                    printing two newspapers had led him to quit publishing the weekly Standard in the
                    summer of 1855 to devote all his energies to the daily paper. As though financial problems had not
                    been burden enough, in December Burroughs severely injured his hand in his steam printing press.42 But, according to articles in the Times in the fall of
                    1855, Burroughs's problems were deeper still.
            Dawson, well known for his bitter attacks upon Catholics and foreigners, continually struck out at
                    Burroughs as well. Although he had earlier welcomed Burroughs as a professional competitor, Dawson
                    now described him as "billious," "[o]ur neighbor of long heel and woolly
                    head sympathies" with "the dullness of a Dutch burgomaster. … He
                    snarls, and snaps, and bites at every thing and every body."43 While
                    Dawson was hardly an unbiased commentator, the harshness of his attacks perhaps suggests that the
                    publisher of the Standard had become a target for even so-called moderates.
            Certainly, Burroughs may have felt more and more isolated as most voters pushed for compromise
                    instead of calling for what he believed was morally right. The People's party of 1854 was
                    now the Republican party, but Burroughs and other radical abolitionists believed the problem of
                    slavery was not being fully addressed by the party's platform. He agreed with the new
                    party's position on the extension of slavery, he wrote in the Daily
                    Standard in late October 1855, but he continued to insist that the country move much farther.
                    "[W]e

                                Fort Wayne

                     stop not at this point, we go not only for prohibiting the
                    extension of Slavery, but for that and the annihilation of it wherever it
                        exists."44
            
            Dawson announced at the end of January 1856 that Burroughs would soon retire "from his
                    complicated duties to the scenes of quiet life in the far west, where we wish him
                    to enjoy the sweet serenity which should always bless old age." Burroughs was then
                    forty-eight years old. A few days later under a heading entitled "Obituary,"
                    Dawson again blasted at length the Standard and its editor.45
            
            After he closed down his printing press in the early winter of 1856, Daniel W. Burroughs, the Baptist
                    minister, printer, and abolitionist newspaper publisher, disappeared from 
                        Fort Wayne
                    's records. Nevertheless, the cause that he had championed so forcefully
                    continued to gain momentum. Case, the Standard's first antislavery
                    editor, had earned local respect for his defense of a free black man arrested in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in August 1855 under the Indiana Black Laws. In the fall of 1857 Case was elected as a
                    Republican to serve the remaining term in Congress of Brenton, who had died in office, and Case was
                    reelected in 1858. Years later a congressional colleague remembered him as one of the original
                    antislavery members of Congress, a small group of "dreadfully hard workers" who
                    "hung on to their principles and objects with bulldog like tenacity." Case and his
                    fellow abolitionists "won in the end, after years of persecution and what would be now
                    called brutality." Isaac Julian, the Standard's other champion
                    for antislavery reform, took over the Centreville Indiana True Republican in 1858.
                    He supported his brother's congressional career and become one of the 
                        Lincoln
                     administration's strongest Indiana supporters. The True
                        Republican earned a reputation as "the foremost radical newspaper in eastern
                    Indiana, if not in the whole state."46
            
            Studying the Standard today enhances our understanding of the tumultuous
                    1854–1855 period in Indiana. Published midway between the passage of the Fugitive Slave
                    Act of 1850 and the outbreak of the Civil War, this abolitionist newspaper illuminates the major
                    moral debate of our country's history. The struggles of African Americans for fuller
                    citizenship are implicit in accounts of kidnappings of free people of color, of pursuits of fugitive
                    slaves, and of trials that tested the authority of the federal government. Indifference over slavery
                    "agitation" was replaced by determination to stop the spread of slavery into new
                    territories and by heightened opposition to the fugitive slave law. Although the nation was far from

            From Benevolence to Reform: The Expanding Career of Mrs. Rhoda M. Coffin
            Ellen D. Swain*
            
            In September 1909 
                  Richmond, Indiana
               , paid its final respects to reformer Rhoda M. Coffin. An
                    Orthodox 
                        Quaker
                     from a prominent Richmond family, Coffin had devoted her life to improving the plight
                    of the wayward, the poor, the incarcerated, and the afflicted women of Indiana. Energized by the
                    sweeping revivalism of the 1860s and 1870s, she and her husband, banker Charles Coffin, had
                    established a mission school and women's home in 
                        Richmond
                    , lobbied successfully for a female-controlled women's prison in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and secured a female doctor for the Indiana Hospital for the Insane. Although a
                    banking scandal later stripped the Coffins of much of their wealth and influence and forced them to
                    move to 
                        Chicago
                     in 1884, Rhoda's accomplishments, while tarnished, were not forgotten.
                    Twenty-five years later, 
                        Richmond
                     honored the achievements of its former citizen.
            Rhoda Coffin was a leading figure in humanitarian and reform work in Indiana from the 1860s to the
                    1880s, when the establishment of prisons for juveniles and women significantly changed the justice
                    system. Her life illuminates the process of nineteenth-century reform and the role of women in it.
                    Some have argued that Coffin fought to expand women's rights in a male-dominated society.
                    Others have defined her actions as socially acceptable benevolence accomplished in the shadow of her
                    prominent husband. But Coffin's life cannot be summed up neatly by either contention, since
                    the boundaries between nineteenth-century traditional benevolence and political activism were too
                    blurred. Instead, her career was characterized by activities to assert women's moral
                    leadership in the public sphere while fighting for women's fundamental rights as well.
            Coffin's life also represents the direction taken by many Orthodox 
                        Quaker
                     women during this period. Although she reflected traditional 
                        Quaker
                     interests in pursuing prison reform and aiding the poor and disadvantaged,
                    Coffin's actions were also influenced by the evangelistic fervor of nineteenth-century non-
                        Quaker
                     denominations.
            Rhoda M. Johnson was born on February 1, 1826, near Paintersville, 
                        Ohio
                    , the fourth child in a well-to-do 
                        Quaker
                     farm family. The John-

                     sons were strict Quakers, adhering to traditional practices of
                    plain dress and speech and separation from the "outside" world. They also
                    practiced quietism, a meditative form of worship in which an "Inner Light" or
                    voice of God could be revealed. Although Rhoda accepted these teachings, she questioned the rigidity
                    and formality of their practice. Quietly, she envied the spiritual freedom exhibited by the
                    evangelical Methodists around her.1
            
            In 1845, Rhoda's world quickly expanded when her parents enrolled her in the Whitewater
                    Monthly Meeting School in 
                  Richmond, Indiana
               . Located halfway between Indianapolis and
                    Cincinnati, Richmond was a growing trade center in the 1840s and 1850s, due in large part to the
                    construction and final completion of the National Road. The German Lutherans, Catholics, and
                    Scotch-Irish Protestants who were attracted to 
                        Richmond
                    's construction and trade industries added an increasing diversity to the
                    historically 
                        Quaker
                     population.2 Moreover, 
                        Richmond
                     was the center for midwestern Quakerism. Quakers, or "Friends," from
                    the eastern 
                        United States
                     and Great Britain traveled to the town to attend the Indiana Yearly Meeting, the
                    largest 
                        Quaker
                     organization in the country, and they exposed the community to worldly religious ideas
                    and attitudes.3
            
            
               
                        Richmond
                     was also the home of the prominent Coffin family, headed by Elijah Coffin, clerk
                    (presiding officer) of the Indiana Yearly Meeting and respected 
                        Richmond
                     banker. Rhoda soon became acquainted with his son Charles (1823–1916), a
                    fellow lyceum attendee who shared her disdain for the rigidity of many 
                        Quaker
                     practices. In 1847, the two were married and took up housekeeping in 
                        Richmond
                    .4
            
            From the outset, Coffin felt stifled by local 
                        Quaker
                     customs. Members followed a dress code, remained aloof from other religious groups, and
                    adhered strictly to traditional forms of "quiet" worship and governance by elder
                    members. In her words, her "soul longed for liberty but there was none." Years
                    later, she remembered:

            Coffin was not alone in her dissatisfaction with 
                        Quaker
                     formality and separatism; she represented a larger movement among Orthodox Friends that
                    was grounded in the evangelical teachings of Joseph John Gurney. A 
                        Quaker
                     banker from 
                        England
                    , Gurney preached the importance of scripture, education, and benevolent works and 
                  
                     5
                     Ibid., 57-58.
               
                     reform outside the Society. Collaborating with non-Quakers was
                    not only acceptable but also advisable in promoting the greater good of temperance, antislavery, and
                    prison reform.6
            
            Rhoda's father-in-law, Elijah Coffin, supported Gurney's evangelical goals and used
                    his influence as clerk of the yearly meeting to unite and guide Orthodox Quakerism toward the
                    Gurneyite camp. His was a difficult task, since Orthodox members had divided over many theological
                    issues. One major split, for example, occurred in 1827, when Elias Hicks and his followers broke
                    away over doctrinal issues. Many Hicksite Quakers, including Lucretia Mott, became involved in such
                    "worldly" causes as antislavery and women's rights.7
            
            Another challenge came from disagreements over slavery. In 1842, a group contending that Orthodox
                    Friends' stance was too weak broke away to form the Anti-Slavery Friends (ASF). The ASF
                    remained separate from the Orthodox fold until 1857, at which time they felt the Orthodox had
                    embraced their position.8 Others left the Orthodox body for conservative
                    reasons. John Wilbur, convinced that the Society under Gurney was becoming too evangelical,
                    established his own meetings in 1843, which embraced the old principles of isolation, plain dress,
                    and reflection.9
            
            By mid-nineteenth century, Quakers were deeply divided, with Gurneyite Orthodox Friends occupying a
                    middle ground. Within these confines, the Coffin family made some attempts at charitable activities
                    "in the world." As early as 1835, Elijah had established the first Friends sabbath
                    school in the region, which many Orthodox Quakers disapproved because of its evangelical origin, its
                    outreach to non-Quakers, and its tendency to draw Friends into society.10 Rhoda

                     Protestant groups participated more fully in the reform activities of the 1840s and
                    1850s. Caught up in a national surge of revivalism, antebellum 
                        Richmond
                     was, in historian James Sellman's words, "a veritable hotbed of
                    reform" where "reform values seem to have penetrated almost every aspect of
                    community life."12 Evangelical Protestants, most of them from the upper
                    class, sought to eradicate evil. Their efforts focused on temperance reform and alleviating the
                    poverty caused by economic instability in the 1850s. The national religious revival of 1858
                    dominated 
                        Richmond
                    's religious community for months. Only the Catholics and Quakers were
                    untouched by its force.13
            
            Two years would pass before Orthodox Quakers would join in 
                        Richmond
                     reform activities. By 1860, a new generation had assumed leadership of the Orthodox
                    body. Charles succeeded his father as clerk of the Indiana Yearly Meeting in 1858 and assumed the
                    presidency of the 
                        Richmond
                     National Bank the following year.14 With the support of Rhoda and
                    other 
                        Quaker
                     associates such as John Henry Douglas, Timothy Nicholson, and Murray Shipley, Charles
                    envisioned a Society of Friends that would incorporate the evangelistic activities of other
                    Protestant groups.
            In October 1860, Charles and Rhoda made the first step toward this goal when they requested
                    permission from the elders to hold a youth prayer event at the Indiana Yearly Meeting's
                    annual gathering. Led by the Coffins, the meeting was an overwhelming success, attracting nearly two
                    thousand, many of whom prayed and testified publicly for the first time. From this meeting, a weekly
                    prayer group was established at the Coffin home, where younger Friends, who felt dominated by elder
                    members in worship services, could pray and testify freely.15 For Rhoda, the
                    event was a liberating experience that marked the beginning of her benevolent career.

            Thomas Hamm has argued that this prayer meeting reflected a great renewal movement in Orthodox
                    Quakerism. Inspired by national and local evangelicalism, members sought to modify and reform 
                        Quaker
                     practices and renew 
                        Quaker
                     vitality and commitment to service. Leaders copied institutions they found attractive
                    outside the Society, promoted education by establishing more 
                        Quaker
                     schools, and stressed the importance of scripture reading. Most important, renewalists
                    argued that Quakers were to be "lights" in their communities by working for social
                    reform "in the world."17
            
            As leaders in the renewal movement, the Coffins worked as partners in reform activities, as did other
                    Orthodox renewalist couples.18 Joel and Hannah Bean, prominent in the 
                        Iowa
                     Yearly Meeting, also worked together in the sabbath school movement and as
                    missionaries. Well-known 
                        Quaker
                     author Hannah Whitall Smith and her husband, Robert, similarly conducted reform work
                    together. In addition, fellow Richmondite and reformer Sarah Smith and her husband, James, were
                    important renewalists who worked for Indiana prison reform. In many cases, Margaret Bacon states,
                    "it was not unusual to find the wife the stronger member of the team."19 Certainly Hannah Smith and Sarah Smith were the more prominent spouses in
                    their marriages. However, both Coffins were well known for their reform activities, and Rhoda
                    described their work as a team effort: "My husband threw his whole soul into the various
                    branches of work, and in all the various interests we went hand in hand … I praise the
                    Lord that we were permitted to be united."20
            
            Although Rhoda Coffin's reform activities were carried out largely in conjunction with those
                    of her husband, she also worked closely with other women. During the 1860s, women's reform
                    groups responded to the Civil War's expanded challenges to aid the wounded and minister to
                    the poor. The war brought evangelical women into public life more fully, although they were under
                    the supervision of men. Sellman observes that men initially directed charitable activities in 
                        Richmond
                     during this period, "but as the War dragged on women

            While they drew on men's connections, Coffin and her associates gained important
                    organizational skills and leadership abilities through reform activities. Carole 
                        Spencer
                     concludes that the evangelical enthusiasm of the 1860s and 1870s served as a catalyst
                    for many 
                        Quaker
                     women, "infusing them with a spunk and independence that propelled them into
                    active evangelism and led them to explore new avenues of social reform. …"22 These women, she believes, gained experience and self-confidence by
                    establishing their own programs and methods. As 
                        Richmond
                     suffered from the poverty and misery of war, its women took up benevolent causes.
            During the 1860s, both 
                        Richmond
                    's population and its poverty increased substantially, and the winters of 1862
                    and 1863 were especially hard on the poor. While local farmers helped by donating wagonloads of
                    wood, flour, meal, and potatoes, Rhoda and a group of women Friends undertook house-to-house visits
                    to determine the extent of suffering and the need for religious guidance.23 As a
                    result, she and several other young women founded a mission school in which children, many of whom
                    were living in "unsavory" conditions, were, she reported, "brought to
                    Christ" and instructed in the "right standard of living."24 With Charles's assistance, the women received permission to use an old public
                    school building and began classes with thirty students; by the time of its first anniversary in May
                    of 1865, the ecumenical 
                        Marion
                     Street Sabbath School, headed by Charles and Rhoda as joint superintendents, had an
                    enrollment of two hundred and fifty students.25 The Coffins kept the town
                    abreast of the school's progress through articles and reports published in the local
                        newspapers.26
            
            Rhoda Coffin's work in the sabbath school remained well within the realm of socially
                    acceptable behavior for women. Promoting morality and Christian virtue in the community were
                    activities inherent to women's benevolent role. Since the Second Great Awakening, women,
                    formerly confined to the "domestic sphere," had been called upon by evangelicals
                    to exert their moral influence on a harsh and

                     corrupt world.27 As a result, great numbers
                    of women's benevolent societies and an increased female participation in the public realm
                    created what one historian has called a "feminization" of American
                    nineteenth-century culture.28
            
            The establishment of the 
                        Marion
                     Street Sabbath School not only illustrates the important role women played in 
                        Richmond
                     reform, it also offers insight into relationships among segments of 
                        Richmond
                    's diverse population. In his analysis of 
                        Richmond
                    , Sellman points to the social as well as the religious mission of the school. Charles
                    Coffin insisted that the school brought together "all parts of the City &
                    vicinity" with no regard for rich or poor.29 However, its location on
                    the south side of town, an area heavily populated by German immigrants, created problems. The school
                    sought to heal tensions and divisions between rich and poor and native and immigrant, which had
                    intensified since the 1840s and 1850s because of the increased number of immigrants in town and an
                    unstable economy; but the placement of the school in south 
                        Richmond
                     instead "sharpened the tensions between immigrant and rich
                        Protestant."30 Immigrants resented upper-class intrusions into
                    their neighborhoods.
            Class differences were evident in 
                        Richmond
                    's reform projects. Evangelical reformers were largely upper-class, native-born
                    Protestants. Using Nancy Hewitt's categories of women reformers—upper-class
                    "benevolents," middle-class perfectionists, and radical ultraists
                    —Coffin falls in the category of a benevolent reformer.31 While they
                    were sincerely motivated by Christian mission, her activities among the lower classes reflected her
                    sense of superiority. As the wife of a successful banker, she enjoyed a comfortable life quite
                    unlike that of the persons she sought to assist. Living in a large home, employing domestic help,
                    and circulating among the cultured elite of 
                        Richmond
                    , the Coffins raised their six children with the best that money

                            between women and morality provided strong justification for women's participation
                            in organizations and activities outside the kitchen or the nursery."

            To some extent, class awareness was evident in relationships among Quakers as well. Less educated
                    farmers and workers in Meeting had little in common with the Coffins and other leaders in the
                    renewal movement.33 The Coffins' son, Charles Henry, praised the
                    presence of "a sprinkling" of 
                        Philadelphia
                     Friends in Indiana Yearly Meeting, "who dressed better than the others and
                    lived better than the average … [which] helped to hold up the tone of the
                        Society."34 He described the poorer Quakers who arrived from 
                        North Carolina
                     during the Civil War as "shiftless" and "lazy"
                    people who did not pay their debts at the bank.35
            
            Despite class differences among them, 
                        Quaker
                     women were dedicated to providing assistance and salvation to Richmondites. Many of
                    Coffin's associates in the school were her former students. Others were well-to-do Quakers
                    such as Valentine. Rhoda assumed leadership both because of her position in the church and because
                    of her ability to take command; when she saw something that needed doing, she wasted little time in
                    discussion. Her leadership ability is evident in all of her benevolent work with women in 
                        Richmond
                    , especially in founding the Home Mission Association (HMA), which helped to unite
                    Orthodox 
                        Quaker
                     women. In 1866, she and fellow Friends Harriet Steer, Sarah J. Smith, Mary J. Taylor,
                    Elizabeth Hopkins, and Anna Pugh of 
                        Cincinnati
                     decided to form a new charity organization, "free from Church trammels, one so
                    formed as to be adjustable to the various needs."36 To form such an
                    organization was a big step, for, as Rhoda remembered, 
                        Women Friends were not accustomed to special organized effort among the women, and in our
                            church organization there was but little for the younger portion to participate in. The
                            voice of a woman in church action was rarely heard in expression of personal opinion?37
                  
                    
                
            Coffin believed that the energy of 
                        Quaker
                     women needed to be harnessed for reform efforts, as many women felt
                    "frightened by their own voices and fearful to take hold and step out into a new
                        field."38

                     Ibid. Hewitt argues that Quaker women perhaps
                            "raised the suspicions of their elders sooner than did men, since their worldly
                            actions were probably considered by the Society as more disruptive of the accepted
                            order." See Nancy A. Hewitt, "Fragmentation of Friends: The Consequences

                     With the assistance of men—Charles and the
                    Coffins's close friends and fellow revivalists, Shipley and Douglas—the women
                    drew up a constitution and planned how best to avoid church elders' restrictions. Rhoda
                    recalled that the men "were ready to throw in their mite to strengthen the few women
                    Friends on whom the Lord had laid the call for organizing in our field."39
            
            Elizabeth Comstock, a 
                        Quaker
                     minister and prison reformer from 
                        Michigan
                    , agreed initially to call the meeting to organize the group. However, she soon reneged
                    for fear of angering the Meeting elders. Annoyed, Coffin decided that as assistant clerk she could
                    call the meeting herself with "intense burning in my soul for the advancement of the
                    work" and with great fear that "I was about to break the rules of the
                    Church," she made the announcement.40 Seven hundred women attended the
                    organizational meeting. Electing Rhoda president, the HMA sponsored weekly prayer meetings,
                    distributed religious tracts, established Sunday schools, and visited jails.41
            
            One of the Association's greatest accomplishments was the establishment of a Home for
                    Friendless Women. As a consequence of their reform work in the community and at the sabbath school,
                    HMA members identified the need for a place where "helpless women with children, friendless
                    girls, strangers passing though the city … and diseased, deformed, and illegitimate
                    children" could go for refuge.42 At the request of Rhoda and six other
                    women, each of whom represented a different church denomination in town, Charles agreed to pursue
                    the issue as head of the newly established Young Men's Christian Association.43 However, when the "Y" did not follow through with the project, the
                    Association took charge. With Charles's assistance and donations from community members,
                    the Home was built and ready for occupation in 1868.44
            
            As president of the Home's board of managers, Coffin supplied the local newspaper with
                    annual reports outlining the personal stories of the "fallen" and
                    "wayward" inhabitants. She claimed that "very few enter who do not come
                    under the blessed influence of God's spirit."45 To reform the
                    "friendless class," the Home sponsored Sunday

                            public," Rhoda pleaded for "second-hand furniture, beds and bedding,

                            the Home.

                    instruction. Through visits to community members, the Home superintendent and supporters promoted
                    their Christian messages and targeted prostitution. Although men were made the trustees of the Home
                    as required by law, women served as the managers.46 As president of the HMA and
                    the Home for Friendless Women and cosuperintendent of the 
                        Marion
                     Street Sabbath School, Rhoda gained important leadership skills. However, Charles also
                    played a central role in these activities by serving as cosuperintendent and trustee of the school
                    and by assisting his wife's group to form the HMA and to establish the Home for Friendless
                    Women.
            As the Coffins' reform activities expanded to the state and national level, Rhoda would work
                    more closely with her husband than with women's organizations in confronting legislators
                    and governmental officials on behalf of prison reform. But this work challenged her ideas concerning
                    women's roles by leading her into new situations in which she would fight for
                    women's rights. These activities have inspired some historians to label her an Orthodox 
                        Quaker
                     "feminist." 
                        Spencer
                     observes that the "Holiness Revival" of the 1860s and 1870s provoked
                    "a flood of creativity and energy in 
                        Quaker
                     women that had been suppressed by a century of Quietism and rigid legalism."
                    She argues that Coffin and other Orthodox 
                        Quaker
                     women became feminists through their work as reformers.47
            
            Women who justified their move from the private arena into reform with the argument that
                    women's morality and influence was needed in the public realm have been labeled by most
                    historians as "social feminists." Nineteenth-century reformers who challenged the
                    sexual social hierarchy and fought for equal political and legal rights have often been called
                    "radical feminists." For Coffin, the 
                        Quaker
                     renewal movement was the key to her establishing a philanthropic career. Hence, to
                    label her a "feminist" without qualification is misleading.48
                    Her reform work, especially in the 1860s, was grounded in the idea that women's morality
                    was needed in the world. While many other Hicksite women challenged the political structure by
                    campaigning for women's rights and suffrage, Coffin always acted within a socially
                    acceptable public role. And, like most other wealthy women philanthropists, her reform work was
                    carried out in close partnership with her husband, whose financial resources and high position
                    provided invaluable support.

                     women advocated less "radical" reforms than their Hicksite
                    counterparts. The wealthy urban 
                        Quaker
                     men who dominated the Orthodox branch "absorbed" the idea of separate
                    spheres for the sexes from their non-
                        Quaker
                     business associates, while the Hicksite fold, primarily composed of rural Friends, held
                    fast to the seventeenth-century 
                        Quaker
                     ideal of equality between the sexes. Wealth and power, as Bacon demonstrates, always
                    undercut gender equality within Quakerism. Moreover, Gurney's attitudes toward women also
                    affected Orthodox Quakers' thinking in the mid-nineteenth century. While Gurney believed
                    that women had a right to preach, he said they must not usurp authority from men; the stronger sex
                    should "fight the battles of the Lord."49
            
            Some women activists in 
                        Richmond
                     were significantly more radical than Rhoda Coffin and her Gurneyite colleagues. The
                    Friends of Human Progress, also known as Progressive or Congregational Friends, who were composed
                    primarily of former Hicksites, promoted equal rights for blacks and women in the 1850s. Mary Frame
                    Thomas, a physician and Richmond's most prominent women's rights activist and
                    Progressive Friend, edited and published the national women's rights journal The Lily from 1855 to 1857.50
            
            In 1851, Progressive Friends sponsored the first statewide women's rights convention since
                    the one held in Seneca Falls, 
                        New York
                    , in 1848. The group's second meeting in 1852 resulted in the establishment of
                    the Indiana Women's Rights Association, which called for every woman to find
                    "useful and lucrative ernployment."51 In 1855, the Association
                    again gathered in 
                        Richmond
                     to promote equal pay for women. They demanded suffrage and promoted the participation
                    of women in mercantile business, law, and medical careers. In 1859, Thomas and three other activists
                    became the first women to address the Indiana legislature.52
            
            Coffin was not involved in these women's rights organizations. During her early career she
                    used only moral suasion to achieve her goals. She also placed family responsibilities first. In her
                    words, no Christian work should interfere with the "relation of or duties as husband and
                    wife," and she asserted that these responsibilities were compatible with reform work only
                    with a "proper system and arrangement of home and its duties."53
                    
                        Spencer
                    's term "feminist," therefore, is misleading when not
                    properly qualified, since it groups together women who subscribed to a diverse range of ideologies.

                    by twentieth-century conceptions, erases the richness of her experience.
            The Coffins' activities in prison reform grew out of their experiences with the 
                        Marion
                     Street Sabbath School. Boys who had little parental supervision, many of them the
                    children of immigrants, contributed to 
                        Richmond
                    's increasing crime rate.54 In 1866, Charles attempted to
                    convince Indiana Governor Oliver Morton that the state needed an institution in which boys could be
                    reformed through education and discipline, and on January 11, 1867, the governor appointed a
                    commission to investigate the issue. As a member of this board of control, Charles Coffin visited
                    Houses of Refuge in 
                  Chicago, Cincinnati
               , and 
                  Lancaster, Ohio
               . Based on the
                    board's findings, the House of Refuge for juvenile offenders was founded in
                            
                  Plainfield, Indiana
               , in 1867, and Charles was made president of the board of
                        managers.55
            
            Lobbying with Charles at the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Republican headquarters in support of the House of Refuge project gave Rhoda Coffin a
                    taste for Indiana politics and led to a yet larger opportunity. In 1868 Governor Conrad Baker,
                    recognizing the Coffins' contributions, requested that they visit Indiana's two
                    state penitentiaries to assess conditions and recommend improvements. The Coffins believed that this
                    opportunity would enable them to improve prison conditions and bring the gospel to inmates.
                    "Our first work as far as we conceived it," Rhoda recalled, "was to carry
                    the glad tidings of the Gospel to those in bonds." They were unprepared for the
                    "great need for reformation in the conduct of the prisons" that they found.56
            
            At the state prison in 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , they heard reports of sexual abuse from both male and female inmates. Guards entered
                    women's cells "when they wished to satisfy their lusts," bribed female
                    inmates for favors, and beat them in the presence of other guards. On 
                  
                     54Sellman argues that disorder was a direct result of the substantial
                            growth of 
                                Richmond
                            's population in the 1850s, which swelled by over 150 percent, from
                            2,500 to 6,600 inhabitants. As immigrants settled in town, Quakers became outnumbered, and
                            strangers and newcomers became a threat. The 
                                Marion
                             Street Sabbath School and Home for Friendless Women, both located in the
                            immigrant-populated southside neighborhood, were means to "control" the
                            German population. With their distinctive language and close-knit neighborhood, Germans
                            became

                     Sundays, the guards forced women inmates to bathe in their
                    presence. Upon hearing the Coffins' report Baker visited the prison himself and instructed
                    the prison committee of the Indiana legislature to investigate. In a letter to the prison warden,
                    Charles proposed methods to improve management, including religious instruction through prayer
                    meetings and sabbath schools.57 However, both Coffins were perceptive enough to
                    know that holding sabbath school would not end the abuses women were subjected to in such a system.
            Coffin's response to the shocking testimony she encountered at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     was to propose that the state establish a separate female prison operated solely by
                    God-fearing women. Like other women prison reformers of her time, she believed that a
                    "woman is the best adapted to have charge of, meet the wants, and supply the needs of
                    female prisoners" and that a woman alone "can understand the susceptibilities,
                    temptations, weaknesses, and the difficulties by which such prisoners are surrounded."58 Most important, she felt that women, who would have the female
                    prisoners' interests at heart, could best reform them.
            Her philosophy on prison reform fit well within a new reform movement that began in the 1860s.
                    Estelle Freedman suggests that where early prison reformers visited prisons and established private
                    homes for "friendless" or discharged women, post-Civil War reformers, bolstered by
                    their wartime social service experiences, "adopted new methods and added new
                    responsibilities to their reform agenda, including authority on state correctional boards and
                    institutions." These "professional" reformers argued that only women had
                    the ability to properly care for their sex. As Freedman points out, three principles guided their
                    actions: "The separation of women prisoners from men; the provision of differential,
                    feminine care; and control over women's prison by female staff and management."59 Coffin's ideas and efforts on prison reform were in the vanguard of
                    the movement and would make her a national leader.
            Governor Baker's visits and a subsequent legislative investigation uncovered a pattern of
                    corruption at 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . On March 16, 1869, the Palladium printed the
                    investigation's report under the byline "Disgusting Developments." The
                    report cited evidence of the directors and employees accepting bribes. In the meantime, the Coffins
                    lobbied members of the General Assembly to support a women's prison. In January Charles
                    addressed legislators at a YMCA meet-

                        Indianapolis
                     on the subject, and in the same month he was invited to address the General
                        Assembly.60
            
            The board of managers for the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Home for Friendless Women supported the women's reformatory bill as well. The
                    board memorialized its plea to the legislature by appealing to members' concern for
                    "our homeless and friendless daughters." On May 13, 1869, the bill was approved.
                    "he Indiana Reformatory Institute for Women and Girls was established in 
                        Indianapolis
                     under the direction of a visiting board comprised of both men and women and a managers
                    board comprised only of men.61
            
            Although women did not achieve sole control of the institution, the reformatory law did grant them
                    specific rights. Its passage also pushed Coffin further into the political realm. Her lobbying with
                    her friend Sarah Smith, superintendent of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Home for Friendless Women, increased her visibility, prompting the governor to appoint
                    Coffin to the prison's first board of visitors.62
            
            Her belief that female prisoners could be reformed and thereafter lead productive lives reflected a
                    new philosophy in prison reform. Rather than serving as penitentiaries (in which prisoners were left
                    alone to repent their conduct), prisons were to become rehabilitation centers. By the 1860s, prison
                    matrons already supervised an increasing number of women prisoners, but they had little reformative
                    effect; reformers believed it was because "as working-class women, they were unlikely to
                    provide the middle-class role models that progressive penologists recommended." By the
                    1870s, the reformation of female inmates by the care and instruction of "respectable
                    women" became the prison reformers' objective.63
            
            Just as 
                        Quaker
                     women constituted a substantial segment of leadership in other reforms, one-third of
                    all prison reformers in the 1870s and 1880s were Friends, and 
                        Quaker
                     women had been associated with prison reform throughout their history. Elizabeth Gurney
                    Fry had sought to improve English prisons in 1815, and American 
                        Quaker
                     women visited state prisons in the eastern 
                        United States
                     in the 1820s to promote religious and educational programs. By the

                        Quaker
                     women expanded this traditional concern to advocate a reformative prison agenda for
                        women.64
            
            Rhoda Coffin's contemporaries in prison reform included 
                        Quaker
                     Elizabeth Buffum Chace, a leader of the campaign for a women's reformatory in 
                        Rhode Island
                     as well as a leader in the purity movement, a national campaign to "stamp out
                    vice, raise standards of sexual morality, and strengthen the American home."65
                    
                        Quaker
                     Abby Hopper Gibbons worked along with Josephine Shaw 
                        Lowell
                     in 
                        New York
                     to establish a women's reformatory in the 1870s and 1880s. In 
                        Massachusetts
                    , Hannah Chickering and Ellen Cheney Johnson, both members of the 
                        Massachusetts
                     Prison Commission, led a statewide campaign in 1873–1874 for a separate
                    women's prison.66
            
            Freedman points out similarities among these late-nineteenth-century reformers. Most received strong
                    religious training, were educated at female academies, and sought benevolent reforms while they were
                    also wives and mothers. Even as they entered the public sphere as volunteers, and later as
                    professional reformers, they continued to value domesticity and female moral superiority. In
                    contrast, the Progressive era reformers who followed them were mostly paid professionals; they had
                    little religious impulse to convert fallen women and dropped the idea of female superiority.67
            
            The passage of the women's prison bill did not mark the end of Coffin's involvement
                    in the movement. Although the Indiana women's prison would not be completed until 1873, she
                    remained active in overseeing its progress and in promoting prison reform nationally. In 1870 she
                    and Charles traveled to 
                        Cincinnati
                     to attend the first National Prison Congress, a body of reformers, public officials,
                    and prison administrators who recommended penal reforms.68 In the fall of 1871,
                    the Coffins visited prison systems in 
                  Ireland, England
               , Europe, and the Middle East. During this journey,
                    Charles ded detailed reports about their findings to Governor Baker and to the newspapers in 
                        Richmond
                    .69
            
            On October 8, 1873, the Indiana Reformatory Institute for Women and Girls was finally ready for
                    occupation. Coffin later remembered the "peculiar sensation" she felt as she stood
                    to meet the female prisoners transferred from the state prison in 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . Next to her stood Sarah Smith, the new matron of the prison, dressed in

                        Quaker
                     costume … with snow white cap and handkerchief," ready to meet the
                    "most hardened, debased, and undisciplined of women, scarcely a vestige of womanly instinct
                    in them."70
            
            Clearly, the contrast was not lost on Coffin. In Smith, she saw an angel "illuminated by a
                    sacred light direct from the Holy Spirit under whose inspiration she was then acting."71 Coffin felt that she and her fellow reformers were women of high moral
                    character whose duty was to help the fallen woman travel the narrow path. While she supported and
                    comforted her female charges, theirs was not a relationship between equals. If, as 
                        Spencer
                     claims, her work promoted a "sense of sisterhood with women of all classes and
                    conditions," it was a sisterhood of the upright reaching down to aid the fallen.72
            
            This unequal relationship is evident in Coffin's reformatory philosophy, which focused on
                    the special needs of female prisoners. To make them productive, God-fearing wives and mothers, her
                    programs stressed the concept of domestic womanhood. Although she promoted this ideal for inmates,
                    her own experience clearly pushed her outside the boundaries of this restrictive sphere. As an
                    author, lecturer, and manager, Coffin herself moved comfortably into the male-dominated realm, even
                    as she continued to prescribe traditional roles for inmates.
            Her emphasis on the value of labor in the reformation process calls attention to the prominence of
                    class divisions in her theories. "The poorer classes," she reflected,
                    "imbibe the spirit of their more favored sisters" who believed that labor was
                    "beneath the dignity of a lady of culture," and thus ignored ways in which they
                    could make an honest living. Coffin believed that labor was "essential to
                    reformation," since "idleness and pride engender vice." In the
                    reformatory women were taught housewifery and sewing skills.73
            
            Only a few years after its establishment, the Indiana Reformatory Institute received national acclaim
                    for its accomplishments. Comstock (who had withdrawn under pressure from issuing the call to form
                    the HMA a decade before) visited the prison in 1875 and afterwards wrote to Indiana Governor Thomas
                    Hendricks, "I have visited all the State Prisons from the Atlantic to the 
                        Mississippi
                    … this surpasses and excels all that I have seen for women and
                        girls."74

                        precluding bonding. Freedman, Their Sisters' Keepers, 105.

                        "imposed on inmates a limiting definition of femininity and required them to conform to
                        a stricter morality program than that expected of men."

            Although the Institute received praise from outsiders, its internal management was riddled with
                    division. Despite Coffin's urging that women manage all aspects of the prison's
                    operation, the reformatory law gave a male board of managers full financial control. During the
                    first three years Superintendent Sarah Smith and Board of Managers President J. H. Kappes battled
                    with increasing intensity over Kappes's insistence on supervising domestic and financial
                    affairs. Coffin and Lewis 
                        Jordan
                    , members of the Institute's board of visitors, took matters to the
                        legislature.75 Rhoda also took her case to a national audience. In 1876, she
                    spoke to the National Prison Congress about the importance of femaleantrolled women's
                    prisons. In her words, "a woman's prison should be entirely under the control of
                    women, from the board of managers to the lowest officer."76 As the
                    first woman to speak before the congress in its six-year history, she was relieved to hear strong
                    applause signaling approval of her proposal.77
            
            In March 1877 a select committee of the Indiana Senate found that the Institute's budget had
                    been poorly managed under the board. In light of this evidence and the problems between the
                    superintendent and the board of managers, the legislature passed a bill creating a new female board.
                    The governor immediately appointed Coffin to the office, and soon afterwards she assumed the
                    board's presidency. Although opponents were convinced that the
                    "experiment" would fail, within a few years, the women rectified the
                    Institute's poor financial state.78
            
            As the first prison operated solely by women, the Indiana Reformatory Institute set the standard for
                    prison reform in the state and the nation. Coffin proudly recalled that Indiana Governor James D.
                    Williams described it as the "best managed institution in the State" and ordered
                    all state institutions to model their reports on those of the Institute.79
                    Coffin received national recognition as the founder and board president of this pioneering
                        institution?80 As an expert on

                            between Smith and Kappes: "the President of the Board has given much time to the
                            business of the Institution and to some extent has supplanted the Superintendent in
                            supervising and directing the domestic affairs of the Institution." Kappes made
                            frequent visits to the Institute to supervise the "minutiae of the
                            household." Indiana Reformatory Institute for Women and Girls, Annual

                     80Shortly after the Indiana Reformatory's founding, the
                            movement moved eastward. In 
                                Massachusetts
                             and 
                                New York
                            , women's reformatories were built and met with great success. Yet
                            Indiana's experiment stood out from the others as the single
               
                     female prisons she was asked to write articles and speak at
                    prison conferences.
            Like many other benevolent women of her day, Rhoda Coffin was swept up in the Woman's
                    Crusade of 1873–1874. Community-wide 
                        Quaker
                     revivals, held in 
                        Richmond
                     in 1869 and 1873, had firmly moved Orthodox Quakerism into the evangelical culture.
                    Sellman argues that this revivalist spirit allowed 
                        Richmond
                     women to transcend social boundaries in the name of redeeming men, particularly in
                    relation to temperance. The winter of 1873-1874 saw a rapidly spreading national grass-roots
                    uprising of evangelical women against saloons, which broke out in 
                        Richmond
                     in Feburary 1874. From February to mid-May evangelical women gathered to "pray
                    and sing hymns outside of local saloons," and Coffin was one of the strongest leaders of
                    the group.81
            
            Initially, the crusaders employed moral suasion and revivalist tactics to shame patrons into
                    abandoning saloons. Later they recorded saloon patron's names and threatened their jobs.
                    The women also increasingly excluded male allies, who were involved in the beginning of the
                    movement. Sellman concludes that "although most had no intention of embracing
                    women's rights, it seemed clear that the Crusade helped transform these women."82
            
            Class and ethnicity played strong roles in the movement. Crusaders were native-born women of British
                    ethnicity from the most prominent and wealthy families, and their targets were saloons on the south
                    side of town, which was populated heavily by German immigrants whose culture included the use of
                    alcohol. Germans strongly resented the wealthy reformers' intrusions into their
                    neighborhood—intrusions that dated back to the establishment of the 
                        Marion
                     Street Sabbath School and the Home for Friendless Women. Germans also argued that the
                    evangelicals were violating woman's proper role and evoking ethnic prejudice.83
            
            In March 1874, Rhoda Coffin became the target of 
                        Richmond
                    's growing distaste for the crusaders when she allegedly remarked to a
                    newspaper reporter that she "had not sinned in three years … but enjoyed the
                    smiles of Jesus perpetually."84 The local newspapers 
                  institution run by women. Rafter, Partial Justice, 33-34. In 1875, the
                            governor and a joint committee from the Indiana General Assembly visited the Institute and
                            commented favorably on its success. James D. Williams, governor of Indiana from 1877 to
                            1880, spoke briefly of the "excellent work done by the institution." Rhoda
                            Coffin, "a lady of philanthropic purpose and earnest life," described its
                            success as the result of its female superintendence.

                     erupted with disgust. Articles expressed disbelief and anger at
                    the "presumptuous" statement that a person could be perfect,85
                    and in the next election voters rejected the Republicans who had supported the crusade.86 The evangelical message in 
                        Richmond
                     had lost its power and momentum.
            Curiously, Coffin does not mention her participation in the crusade in either her memoirs or her
                    personal papers. By the crusade's end, she admitted that she found the women's
                    "praying band … somewhat embarrassing."87 In
                    November 1874, like other former crusaders all over the country, Coffin and other 
                        Richmond
                     women organized a "more traditionally-structured temperance
                    organization," a chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, which was less
                    revivalist and more institutional in its approach to reform.88
            
            The crusade's outcome caused Coffin to reevaluate her evangelical activity. By the
                    mid-1870s, a new movement began to change Quakerism in yet more radical ways. While the older
                    renewal movement had attempted to eliminate practices it thought archaic and outmoded, such as
                    strict rules on marriage, elder member governance, and isolation from the world, the new revival
                    movement "obliterated the plain life [and] revolutionized the basis and form of 
                        Quaker
                     worship" by discarding 
                        Quaker
                     marriage regulations altogether and requiring participation in meeting. By the 1880s,
                    the Society was deeply divided into holiness revivalists, conservatives, and heirs of the renewal.
                    Seeking unity, the Coffins steered a moderate course.89
            
            In the midst of this turmoil, Coffin encountered opposition to her leadership of the women's
                    prison board, and in 1881 she resigned her position as president.90 That same
                    year, the prison was embroiled

                                last four years." With a new election at hand in 1881, Hendricks was sure to be

                            Coffin continued to work in the field. In 1880, Governor James Williams appointed former

                    Journal's sensational coverage raised questions about the motives and
                    competence of the prison's leadership.91
            
            In 1880 Coffin had begun to work toward securing a female physician for the Indiana Hospital for the
                    Insane, and she met opposition here as well. A group consisting of Dr. William B. Fletcher,
                    superintendent of the Hospital, Dr. Mary Thomas of

                    , Sarah Smith of the Women's Reformatory Institute, and Coffin attempted to
                    persuade the hospital's board of managers that the asylum needed a woman doctor on the
                    staff. The board was uncooperative and constructed obstacles to the appointment. A member requested
                    numerous detailed recommendations from the institutions the reformers' candidate had
                    attended, as well as a petition signed by leading businessmen of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , who, unlike women, were voters and constituents. Finally, board members demanded a
                    recommendation from the governor.92
            
            A frustrated Rhoda Coffin met with Governor Albert Porter, who told her he had promised the position
                    to her colleague in the project, Dr. Thomas. Rhoda knew this to be false and informed Thomas, who
                    then wrote to the governor that she preferred to remain in private practice. Cornered, the governor
                    wrote a recommendation for their candidate. In 1884, Superintendent Fletcher remarked in his annual
                    report that the hospital's new doctor, Sarah Stockton, had "given complete
                    satisfaction in every way" and that a "special improved condition of the female
                    patients under her charge" was evident.93
            
            Her work to secure a female doctor for the hospital changed Coffin's outlook towards
                    women's rights: "I came out of that contest a full-fledged woman suffragist. If a
                    vote was necessary before I could succeed in getting a woman physician to care for the helpless of
                    my sex, I decided that I must have a vote."94
            
            However, she did not fully embrace the cause. Other Hoosier women, including Thomas, had taken on the
                    suffrage fight decades

                            Coffin's work with the Indiana Hospital for the Insane is not documented by other
                            primary sources. A rare exception is a letter from Dr. William B. Fletcher's wife,
                            Agnes, to Coffin that mentions her involvement in improving the hospital. Agnes relates that
                            her "plan for turning the eastward Dormitory into a room for work, amusement and
                            instruction will be delightfully feasible just as soon as the eight additional wards are
                            finished." She also proclaims that "scarcely a day passes that I do not
                            wish it were possible to see you and make 'comparison of ideas." Agnes

                     earlier. Even as she and Coffin were fighting for a female
                    physician, Thomas was also fighting for the passage of a women's suffrage bill in the
                    Indiana legislature. Along with other members of the Women's Suffrage Association, Thomas
                    and May Wright Sewall, an 
                        Indianapolis
                     reformer with a national reputation, spoke at political conventions across the state,
                    addressed the General Assembly, and worked closely with Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone. Although
                    their proposed suffrage amendment was defeated in 1883, the participants in the women's
                    rights campaign laid the foundation for final ratification of suffrage by Indiana in 1921.95
            
            Although Coffin claimed that her involvement in securing a female physician for the asylum led her to
                    support women's rights, she never fought for suffrage. She continued to collaborate with
                    Charles, embracing asylum reform as passionately as she had prison work. In 1882–1883,
                    she and Charles toured asylums in 
                  France, England
               , and 
                        Scotland
                     on a fact-finding mission, and Charles provided his observations to Governor Porter and
                    religious newspapers.96 Upon their return, Rhoda supplied the Indiana hospital
                    with drawing supplies, dolls, and other amusements for women patients.97
            
            The campaign for a woman physician may have influenced Coffin to urge women's equality
                    within 
                        Quaker
                     establishments. In 1881 Professor Mahalah Jay, who taught at the Earlham College
                    preparatory school, criticized the small number of female professors and the large pay discrepancy
                    between men and women faculty members at the school. While others remained silent, Coffin came to
                    Jay's support by emphasizing that Quakers, who professed "the equality of men and
                    women should [not] have such an inconsistency in their institution."98
            
            Her support for equal pay for women professors is consistent with her new thinking at the time.
                    Although she continued to emphasize women's moral superiority in justifying their presence
                    in the workplace, Coffin now spoke of a woman's right to hold positions for which she was
                    qualified. Although her view of women's morality continued to shape her argument, her
                    emphasis had shifted perceptibly.

                    feminist's fight for women's rights in a male-dominated society.99 Hamm, by contrast, points out that while Hicksite

                     women were fighting for suffrage and testing their talents in
                    medicine, science, and other male-dominated fields, Coffin an Orthodox Friend, chose "a
                    career of benevolence of the sort common to evangelical upper class women of the era."
                    Women in the renewal movement, who were at best their husband's partners, worked behind the
                    scenes. Rhoda Coffin, in Hamm's opinion, was content to remain in the socially acceptable
                    and subordinate roles her more radical Hicksite counterparts had rejected.100
            
            Each historian has captured a side of Coffin's character. What is missing from both
                    portrayals is an understanding of the complexity at the core of her actions. As Hamm indicates,
                    Coffin displayed many of the characteristics of the "benevolent" woman. She
                    believed women's Christian morality was an important force in society, and she promoted
                    women's roles as wife and mother. However, her involvement in combating abuses against
                    female prisoners and fighting legislative battles shaped her increasingly progressive stance for
                    women's equality. By the 1880s, Coffin had recognized the need for women's
                    political rights to bolster the power of moral suasion in fighting the ills of society.
            The 1880s represented not only a time of ideological growth and continued public service for the
                    Coffins, they also were marked by a devastating scandal. In July 1884 Charles's bank in 
                        Richmond
                     failed and was placed in receivership, an event that cast a shadow on the
                    Coffins' previous accomplishments and restricted their future endeavors. Not only did they
                    lose much of their fortune, but their fellow Richmondites blamed both Charles and his sons for the
                    bank's demise. According to Hamm, the investigation showed that "while Coffin was
                    outwardly a pillar of religion and morality, he had extended large, unsecured loans to his sons for
                    speculative purposes, watered his bank's stock, misrepresented its assets, and embezzled
                    funds from estates for which he was a trustee."101
            
            The 
                        Richmond
                     National Bank, of which Charles had become president in 1859, had been widely
                    patronized by members of the working class, who had trusted his judgment and reputation. The
                    community was outraged by his behavior. 
                        Richmond
                     Quakers had little sympathy for him, since he would not take responsibility for his
                    actions and repent. Claiming that he was of "unblemished character,''
                    Coffin blamed the failure on a business panic. Under threat of their lives, the Coffins moved to 
                        Chicago
                    . In 1886, after escaping conviction in the courts, Charles Coffin was disowned by the
                    Whitewater Monthly Meeting.102

                        such an edition—on the occasions of President James A. Garfield's shooting
                        and of his death.
            
            
            It is not clear whether Rhoda Coffin knew about her husband's scandalous practices before
                    the bank failure. In any event, she stood by her family in time of crisis. The cause of the bank
                    failure was never agreed upon by contemporaries. Some Quakers blamed Charles; others blamed his
                    sons. Many pointed to the Coffins' luxurious lifestyle. Their friend Hannah Whitall Smith
                    offered the charitable interpretation that Coffin "had been righteous overmuch; [he] had
                    not mixed in enough of the world in [his] religion."103
            
            In 
                        Chicago
                    , Charles found a job as an agent for Provident Life and Trust, a 
                        Quaker
                    -owned company. Although he and Rhoda attended 
                        Chicago
                     Monthly Meeting, he never regained the influence in 
                        Quaker
                     affairs he once enjoyed.104 She continued to write and speak on
                    prison reform, addressing the National Prison Association in 1884 on women's prisons and
                    visiting 
                        Chicago
                     prisons and insane asylums. A member of the Protective Agency for Women and Children,
                    she worked to secure laws for the "property rights of women and the protection and defense
                    of the rights of children."105 She also demanded that the state
                    establish schools in which such girls would be taught Christian values and housewifery.106 While fighting for women's lawful rights, Coffin still held fast to
                    ideals of true womanhood.
            As her health failed and she became less active, Coffin took comfort in her past accomplishments. Her
                    work in the prison reformatory movement had been ground-breaking. Prompted by evangelical fervor and
                    informed by the idea of inherent female morality, her benevolent career evolved to embrace the more
                    "masculine" roles of campaigner, public speaker, and author. Yet, in assuming new
                    roles, she continued to argue for and support women's moral influence in family life and
                    society.
            On September 28, 1909, Rhoda Coffin died in 
                        Chicago
                     in the presence of Charles and her family. Appropriately, Charles took her home to 
                        Richmond
                     for the funeral, which was held in the old Eighth Street Meeting where they had begun
                    their life's work, and "practi- 
                  For expressions of community outrage see ibid., March 27, 1885. One
                            editor wrote, "a complete piece of wreckage has been accomplished by one whom the
                            community honored and trusted to an unusual degree." Ibid., March
                            14, 1885. Many working-class patrons lost their life savings when the bank went under. One
                            man could not understand why Coffin removed his own money from the bank only a few hours
                            before the failure and in confronting him asserted, "now I don't want to
                            hear anymore about Jesus from you." Ibid., January 19, 1885.

            INDIANA ARCHIVES Oral History Collections
            John M. Glen, James B. Lane, Glenn L. McMullen, and Barbara Truesdell*
            
            Having surveyed local history archives over the past four years, the Indiana Archives series broadens
                    its geographical and methodological scope this year to explore some oral history resources available
                    in the state. As a relatively new research tool and field of study, oral history makes its most
                    obvious contribution in compensating, at least partially, for the absence of written documents. Yet
                    oral history also has been part of a broader effort to redefine the boundaries of traditional
                    scholarship, diversify its sources of information, and democratize the process of historical
                    interpretation. Indeed, oral history is unique in that it creates its own documents, and these
                    records are by definition dialogues between history and memory, narratives describing past
                    experiences through the present context of remembrance.
            Oral history's potential value must therefore be tempered by an awareness that it is a
                    product of historical consciousness, or the way people understand and articulate their pasts. Those
                    who generate, read, and use oral testimony must guard against the uncritical acceptance of broad
                    historical judgments made by those who have wielded political, economic, or social authority and the
                    relegation of those not in such positions to a kind of impressionistic sideshow, with little more to
                    offer than personal observations or recalled feelings. A second, related challenge is to welcome
                    first-hand accounts of events while refraining from granting sole interpretive power to them, as if
                    there were no independent sources of knowledge with which to assess their perspectives. Add to these
                    issues thought-provoking questions about the selectivity of oral history subjects and speakers and
                    about the legal and institutional guidelines affecting the interviewing process, and what was once a
                    fairly freewheeling pursuit has become more complex, problematic, and reflective.
            Indiana's oral historians have been addressing these and other concerns over the past three
                    decades, and some of the products of

                     their work are described in the following essays. Barbara
                    Truesdell summarizes the extensive collection of narratives reflecting many disciplines and nations
                    that is compiled at the Oral History Research Center at Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , and the use of the narratives in recent scholarship. James Lane recounts the
                    remarkable history of Steel Shavings, a journal based at Indiana University
                    Northwest, which over the past twenty-five years has incorporated hundreds of oral accounts
                    generated by students, faculty members, and community residents that highlight the economic, ethnic,
                    and racial diversity of the state's Calumet region. Glenn McMullen outlines the steadily
                    increasing integration of taped and transcribed interviews into collections processed at the Indiana
                    Historical Society in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the society's funding of oral history initiatives that have often become
                    part of larger projects on Indiana history.
            These contributions suggest that the effort to preserve the collective memory of residents of Indiana
                    and beyond is well established and growing. Hours of interviews are being conducted annually among
                    elites and at the grassroots, and theoretical as well as logistical questions about the interviewing
                    process continue. The next step, as these essays suggest, is to use these narratives in ways that
                    respect diversity, acknowledge interrelationships, and depict an interactive past, one that reveals
                    a conversation among various voices whose memories help construct a more comprehensive, more
                    insightful understanding.
            
                    The Oral History Research Center at Indiana University, 
                            Bloomington
                        
               
                
            It is often said in oral history circles that when a person dies, a library burns to the ground. Oral
                    history is one method for saving the story of an individual's life from that consuming
                    fire. Oral history interviews preserve, record, and make available for future generations the
                    memories, experiences, and opinions of individuals. Tape-recorded interviews not only collect unique
                    facets of a person's existence, but also reflect the imprint left upon that
                    individual's life by communities and events. Because of this duality in oral history,
                    interviews provide new data, insight, and understanding for the study of history and culture when
                    used in conjunction with written records or in situations where no written records exist.
            The primary mission of the Oral History Research Center (OHRC) at Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , is to foster the use of personal memory in the study of modern history. That mission
                    encompasses archival, pedagogical, and research goals. First, the center raises funds to conduct
                    interviews that preserve the oral history of Indiana, the Midwest, and the nation. Second, the
                    center uses the funding it receives to train graduate students from history, folklore, anthropology,
                    and other fields at Indiana University in the discipline  of
                    oral history and the study of social memory. Third, the center contributes to the emerging scholarly
                    study of memory by undertaking research projects that collect interviews to illuminate specific
                    historical issues and events. To this end, the center fosters the use of oral history through access
                    to its archives of interviews, through workshops on oral history methodology, and through its
                    website at <www.indiana.edu/~ohrc/collect.htm>.
            The OHRC began in 1968 under the direction of Indiana University history professor Oscar O. Winther.
                    Its first project was to gather information for an institutional history of the university. The
                    center's founding was also part of an innovative movement to bring the public into the
                    academy and democratize the writing and transmission of history. While interviewing witnesses to
                    historical events has long been recognized as a valuable research tool, the new center emphasized
                    its value for a wide variety of historical subjects. The influence of social history, with its
                    concentration on the lives of minorities and workers, as well as the impact of feminist and
                    post-colonial/post-authoritarian academics have prompted the center to undertake projects not only
                    for the history of Indiana but for the nation as well.
            Since its establishment, the OHRC has gathered a steadily growing archive of interviews and
                    collateral materials and a select library of noncirculating, secondary sources related to the
                    center's mission. The archives currently holds over 1,600 interviews, with a particular
                    focus on Indiana history. Approximately 85 percent of the collection is transcribed, and 50 percent
                    of those transcripts include an index and table of contents with the interview. A copy of each
                    edited, indexed transcript, along with the original audiotape, is housed at the Indiana University
                    Archives for long-term preservation storage. The interviews are available to researchers in either
                    location, although the level of accessibility in both places is determined by the permission forms
                    that accompany interviews.
            A list of the center's projects, with a brief summary of the topics covered in each project,
                    is available in hard copy and online through the OHRC website. This collections list is updated
                    regularly. The website has greatly increased the center's ability to serve researchers,
                    providing information about the collection and the field of oral history and facilitating quick
                    access to our reference resources through an e-mail link. Its text is in an easily readable format
                    for those who do not have highly sophisticated graphics capabilities on their computers. The website
                    has been used by researchers from such distant countries as 
                  Venezuela, Turkey
               , and 
                        China
                    .
            Like many other oral history centers in the 
                        United States
                    , the OHRC specializes in projects with a regional focus. In documenting the history of
                    "Middle America" or "the Heartland," the center has captured
                    first-person accounts of the cultural, social, and economic forces that have affected this region,
                    forces that have also been at work across  the 
                        United States
                    . From Indiana's part of the so-called "Rust Belt" in the
                    northwestern corner of the state, with its reliance on the steel and petrochemical industries, to
                    small rural towns, dependent on agriculture and small industries such as furniture and veneer
                    factories, to old "river towns" like 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Madison
                     that saw the earliest settlement of the state, OHRC oral histories have connected
                    Indiana's regional narratives with national economic developments.
            In addition to the regional strength of the OHRC archives, the center's collections and
                    research initiatives encompass national and international topics. A recent study of mestizo identity
                    in Central America, conducted in collaboration with the Indiana University Center for Latin American
                    and Caribbean Studies, is one example of this wider perspective. Another is the center's
                    cooperation with the Indiana University Russian and East European Institute and the university in
                    Cluj, 
                        Romania
                    , to help recover the history of that country's communist period. Such projects
                    not only contribute to the advancement of knowledge in underrepresented areas of study, but also
                    provide fertile ground for comparative research on issues such as ethnicity, nationalism, and the
                    nature of democracy.
            The OHRC's archive also serves as a resource for research, teaching, and public programming.
                    The variety of reference questions addressed through the center indicates the potential of the
                    archives. The center's holdings have been used for a Hollywood film about Alfred
                    Kinsey's pioneering work on human sexuality; a documentary film on the life and music of
                    composer Hoagy Carmichael; and a history of the Packard Motor Car Company used by James A. Ward in
                    his The Fall of the Packard Motor Car Company (1995). The Indiana State Museum
                    consulted the OHRC during the development of its labor history exhibits, as did the 
                        Monroe County
                     Historical Society for an exhibit on the county's limestone industry.
            The following sample of the OHRC's projects suggests the breadth of oral history as a
                    discipline.
            
               Biography: Oral history is an important resource for biographical research, as
                    demonstrated by the center's studies of Indiana politicians Homer Capehart and John Hurt,
                    Indiana University researcher Alfred Kinsey, and national figures Melvyn Douglas and Helen Gahagan
                    Douglas. Ingrid W. Scobie's Center Stage: Helen Gahagan Douglas, A Life
                    (1992), and the recent biographies of Alfred Kinsey by Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, Sex the
                        Measure of All Things: A Life of Alfred C. Kinsey (2000), and James H. Jones, Alfred C. Kinsey: A Public/Private Life (19971, drew upon these collections.
            
               Institutional studies: The center uses oral history to study the intersection of
                    individual lives with institutions of all kinds. Some projects have explored institutions that have
                    a wide-ranging effect on American society, such as philanthropic foundations. Fund
                        Raisers: Their Careers, Stories, Concerns, and Accomplishments, by Margaret A Duronio and
                    Eugene R. Tempel (1997), made use of these projects.  The OHRC
                    has also studied state institutions, such as the Indiana Humanities Council, the Center on
                    Philanthropy at Indiana University-Purdue University, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    . And the center has explored the impact on their communities of local institutions,
                    such as county historical societies and the influence of a single church in a small town in southern
                    Indiana.
            
               Industries and professions: This area is one of the strengths of the
                    center's collection. It includes a study of the auto industry in Indiana, an oral history
                    of labor unions in both the auto and coal industries, and a project documenting changes in the
                    medical profession as seen by local physicians. Several projects have cast a wider net, recording
                    the economic history of the state; the most recent addressed economic development as a cultural
                    concept, tracing changes in three diverse areas of Indiana.
            
               Community studies: The OHRC's community studies encompass rural towns such
                    as Paoli in south central Indiana, communities with a predominantly industrial economy such as
                    Whiting in the northwest, and vibrant urban centers such as 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The center has examined other kinds of communities as well: ethnic communities
                    composed of Korean, German, and Indian immigrants; black community initiatives, such as the Flanner
                    House homes developed during the 1950s and 1960s in 
                        Indianapolis
                     to provide low-cost housing to African Americans in an era of segregation and real
                    estate redlining; and women's community efforts, such as 
                        Bloomington
                    's women's shelter, Middle Way House. The OHRC's ethnic
                    community collections contributed to Peopling Indiana: The Ethnic Experience,
                    edited by Robert M. Taylor and Connie A. McBirney (1996). John Bodnar's Our
                        Towns: Remembering Community in Indiana (2001) brings together a number of community
                    studies the center has done over the past thirty years.
            
               Life cycle studies: This is a relatively new area for the OHRC, the result of a
                    collaboration with the Poynter Center for the Study of Ethics and American Institutions at Indiana
                    University, 
                        Bloomington
                    . The Open Society funded an examination of the experience of death in America, using
                    the OHRC's earlier social history of Paoli to place the study in a context and identify
                    interviewees. The archives also holds David Ransel's interviews with Russian and Tatar
                    women about childbirth and child-rearing practices, topics examined in his Village
                        Mothers: Three Generations of Change in Russia and Tataria (2000).
            
               Period studies: Oral history collects first-person perspectives on major social
                    movements or cultural changes, offering a human scale for massive forces at work in history. Among
                    the pivotal periods of the twentieth century represented in the OHRC's collection are the
                    civil rights movement, World War I, and World War II.
            
               Event studies: These oral history projects focus on unexplored facets of a single
                    historical event. This approach has produced stud-  ies ranging
                    from the impact of a tornado in the city of 
                        Louisville
                    , to the making of the atomic bomb, to an auto strike in Anderson, Indiana.
            Like other archives, the center faces the challenges of preserving its collection and increasing
                    access to the interviews. The OHRC's current National Endowment for the Humanities grant to
                    create a searchable electronic database of the collection online will greatly improve the
                    center's ability to serve researchers by allowing keyword searches of the interviews. As
                    part of an initiative to broaden its potential, in the fall of 2001 the OHRC will change its name to
                    the Center for the Study of History and Memory. Latin American scholar Daniel James will join the
                    center as codirector with Bodnar, and the directors will consider adding seminars and classes to the
                    center's services.
            The Oral History Research Center archives is an irreplaceable resource for the history of Indiana in
                    the twentieth century and for many of the great events, social movements, and cultural
                    transformations of the last century. The center anticipates even greater interest in and need for
                    the study of oral history and cultural memory as a means to preserve the past in years to come: in
                    an age in which many are moving toward lives that leave no paper trail—communicating by
                    electronic mail and voice mail and recording documents in computer files that can vanish with the
                    touch of a delete key—oral history offers a way to record a person's memories
                    and preserve for the future the "library" of an individual life.
            
                    Life in the Calumet Region during the Twentieth Century: A History of Steel Shavings
               
                
            The internet and digital revolutions have opened up all sorts of possibilities for disseminating oral
                    testimony. For most of the late-twentieth century, however, publishing Steel
                    Shavings magazine seemed the best way to make the fruits of oral history research available to
                    students, families, community residents, and scholars interested in "Nearby
                    History" and northwest Indiana's rich heritage.1 Originally
                    the brainchild of Indiana University Northwest historian Ronald D. Cohen, the name Steel Shavings underscored the enormous impact of area steel mills on Calumet regionites.
                    Steel industry jobs had originally lured most of those who settled in northwest Indiana in the
                    twentieth century.2 Although the area is still a major American steel producer,
                    the diminution of that influence because of automation has been quite dramatic since the
                    magazine's debut in

                     1975.3 The publication is dedicated to
                    "Life in the Calumet Region during the Twentieth Century," with special emphasis
                    on the social history of the family.4 It has undergone numerous transformations
                    but has consistently showcased Indiana University Northwest student and faculty work based on oral
                    history research. Many original papers and interviews contained in various issues are housed in the
                    university's Calumet Regional Archives (CRA).5
            
            CRA's oral history component was in part the product of the author's research
                    interests and editorship of Steel Shavings, but it also reflected the concern that
                    the interviews should be processed more systematically (storing tapes, securing valid permission
                    agreements, allowing interviewees to review and edit transcripts, and other procedures). CRA
                    archivist Steve McShane has facilitated the tasks of preservation, cataloguing, and disseminating
                    holdings on the internet. In 2001 the collection includes approximately one thousand audiotapes and
                    videotapes, many with typescripts. Some have been donated by scholars, civic groups such as the 
                        Gary
                     Historical Society and the Latino Historical Society, and media interviewers. The CRA
                    also seeks to videotape all donors who contribute manuscript collections and to respond to inquiries
                    and tips about community residents who are moving away or rapidly aging and whose reminiscences
                    would be well worth recording.6
            
            Over the past quarter century the oral interviews published in Steel Shavings have
                    centered largely around the acculturation process among immigrant families settling in northwest
                    Indiana; the work experiences, folk tales, and union struggles of Calumet region steelworkers; black
                    political power during the administration of 
                        Gary
                     Mayor Richard G. Hatcher, 1967-1987; and the social history of Indiana University
                    Northwest. What has emerged from these oral accounts has not only illuminated these areas but
                    occasionally captured unusual perspectives on the region's past as well.7

                        "Shards and Midden Heaps" is an accurate reflection of a vanishing steelworker

                            Gary
                        's History (1975). Edited by Cohen, this volume is a community study
                    with an emphasis on ethnic families (mainly Greek), urban institutions, and neighborhood support
                    groups.
            2. Families of the Calumet Region (1976). Coedited with Cohen, interviews relived
                    migration experiences from Eastern and Central Europe, the 
                        Netherlands
                    , Latin America, and the American South to the industrial cities of

                        Chicago
                    , and Whiting. Most contributors trace their families' fortunes and the
                    Americanization process over several generations, including movements to outlying suburban
                        Communities.9
            
            3. Families of the Calumet Region during the Depression of the 1930s (1977). The
                    thirty articles included in this volume collectively constitute a case study of survival strategies.
                    Strong ethnic bonds were often essential to keeping families intact through desperate times.
                    Narrators discuss the nonunion era ("You Couldn't Say Boo"), descriptions
                    of successful organizational drives, and work relief and other New Deal services that transformed
                    the Calumet region into a Democratic stronghold.
            4. Cruisin' in the Region in the Fifties (1978). Edited by Cohen,
                    respondents in this study describe events of importance about their lives, including the 1955
                    Whiting Refinery explosion at Standard Oil and the 1959 U.S. Steel strike. Other interviews describe
                    family interactions with urban institutions, in particular churches and schools.10
            
            5. Families of the Calumet Region during the World War II Years (1979). Narrators
                    recall the momentous effects of the war on the habits, obligations, social opportunities, and
                    lifestyles of men, women, and children of all ethnic backgrounds. "A Time of
                    Shocks," 1941-1945, was for some "A Time to Forget." The homefront was a
                    beehive of activity—for forty-four months Mae's 
                        Louisiana

                    's central district never closed. Thousands of war workers and veterans
                    eventually moved into the middle class.
            6. Race-Relations in the Calumet Region during the 1960s (1980). Interviews in this
                    volume reveal the pain and trauma created by generations of prejudice and neglect. There was a slow
                    ebbing of institutionalized

                     10These narratives reflect Cohen's interest in the history of 
                                Gary
                             schools. See Ronald D. Cohen and Raymond A. Mohl, The Paradox of

                     racism, but patience was at a premium. Many whites perceived
                    black militancy as a threat to their families' livelihood. Suburban white youths had little
                    meaningful contact with African Americans except for occasional encounters in sports events or
                    perhaps the weekly visit of a maid. Student-conducted interviews explore reactions to busing,
                    changing neighborhoods, public employee strikes, and the election in 
                        Gary

            7. Work Experiences in the Calumet Region (1981). A variety of on-the-job
                    experiences, such as those of a grocer, teacher, surgical nurse, and fire captain, are examined,
                    with particular attention given to steelworkers, most of whom had strong ethnic ties
                    ("Greek Immigrant's Dreams," "Polish Steelworker") and
                    job loyalties ('Four Decades at Youngstown," "Thirty-year Man").
                    Local 1010 activist at Inland Steel, Cliff "Cowboy" Mezo, interviewed by Sam
                    Cozza, lamented the increasing bureaucratization and complacency of the top union hierarchy:
                    "The guy who is getting it in the neck is the poor working slob. He feels he's
                    getting kicked from both sides."12
            
            8. Families of the Calumet Region during the Roaring 20s (1982). Most respondents
                    were children during the 1920s. Depending often on their race, class, and gender, they recall a
                    fun-filled, carefree era or a time of prejudice and toil. The Ku Klux Klan had a rancid effect on
                    local politics; Fords clogged Dunes Highway on summer weekends. Like elsewhere in the nation, it was
                    an age of ballyhoo. Victorian standards, never strong in the Calumet region, were in retreat.
                    Together the interviews depict the twenties as a decade of slowly expanding opportunities.

            Fire Fighter: I had nightmares every day for the first four years. I'd wake up dripping wet.
                    One dream was so real I could feel the mud in my boots.13
            
            9. Life of the Calumet Region during the 1970s (1983). Numerous narrators discuss
                    emigration from Southeast Asia, 
                        Greece
                    , and

                                Vietnam
                             vets, including "Fire Fighter," preferred to remain
                            anonymous.
               
                     the "Aging of the Region" are interviews
                    conducted in connection with a Tri-City Mental Health Center "Life Revue" project.
            10. Sports in the Calumet Region (1984). Interviews cover a wide spectrum of
                    activities dating back to recreational programs of settlement houses, Catholic parishes, and
                    industrial leagues. Also examined are high school basketball, Little League baseball, young
                    women's accomplishments in sports such as diving, community boosterism, the socialization
                    of adolescents, the use of leisure time, athletics as a path to social mobility, and various race,
                    class, and gender issues.14
            
            11. Darnell Lee's "2545 Pierce Street: From Ghetto to
                    Limbo" (1985). Though not strictly oral history, this haunting autobiography of a
                    black man striving to overcome poverty and a broken home shares motifs with earlier "Family
                    History" volumes.15
            
            12. Life in the Calumet Region during the Formative Years, 1900–20
                    (1986). Northwest Indiana was a microcosm of America during a period of massive immigration, rapid
                    urbanization, boss rule, and triumphant industrialization, all of which scarred the lakefront
                    landscape for the entire twentieth century. Residents recall "Scrub Boards and
                    Tubs" in the kitchen, "Free Food and Drink" at political rallies,
                    "Peddlers with Wheelbarrows" delivering coal, "Twelve-Hour
                    Shifts" at the mill, and "Cyrillic Russian Classes" at St.
                    Michael's Church.
            13. Latinos in the Calumet Region (1987).16 These family
                    histories make frequent reference to public events—festivals, holiday pageants, and
                    parades—and provide anecdotal glimpses of group dynamics, organizational activities,
                    childrearing practices, and generational strains. Many subjects struggled against discrimination and
                    cultural assimilation. Featured are interviews with Chicano activist David Castro, migrant worker
                    Pilar Gamos Norric, and members of the politically powerful Arredondo family of East 
                        Chicago
                    .17
            
            
               
                  14Inspiration for this issue came from local historian Tom Higgins and
                        reflected growing scholarly interest in sports history. See Donald Mrozek, Sports
                            and American Mentality, 1880–1910 (
                            Knoxville
                        , Tenn., 1983), and Jules Tygiel, Baseball's Great Experiment:
                            Jackie Robinson and His Legacy (expanded ed., 
                            New York
                        , 1997).
               
                  15At the time the author saw striking parallels with Piri
                        Thomas's Down These Mean Streets (
                            New York
                        , 1967). See James B. Lane, "Beating the Barrio: Piri Thomas and Down These Mean Streets," English Journal, W (September 1972),
                        814-23. In retrospect, further interviews of Lee family members would have produced a more
                        complete story, though the veracity of some information was confirmed with Lee's
                        sister-in-law.

                            Gary
                         have existed for over eighty years, and Puerto Ricans began immigrating to the
                        Calumet region during the 1940s. Broadly speaking, the term "Latino" is used
                        in reference to those whose families were from Spanish-speaking countries or territories in the
                        western hemisphere. See James B. Lane and Edward J. Escobar, Forging a Community:
                            Latinos in Northwest Indiana, 1919-1975 (
                            Chicago
                        , 1987).
               
                  17The Arredondo group interview was part of a Tri-City Mental Health
                        Center project entitled "Pass the Culture, Please." Papers related to the
                        project are in the CRA.
            
            
            14. The Postwar Period in the Calumet Region, 1945-50 (1988). During an age of
                    anxiety and affluence, region residents sought to buy homes for their expanding families, a variety
                    of products that had been in short supply during the war, and a new item on the postwar market:
                    television. Coedited with McShane, this volume contains interviews on such subjects as the 1945
                    Froebel Strike, the harassment of leftists during the post-World War II Red Scare, and the anticrime
                    Women's Citizens Committee.
            15. 
                  
                            Vietnam
                         Vets from the Calumet Region (1988). Oral histories here make vivid how a
                    flawed foreign policy degraded idealism and destroyed innocence. Special features include
                    recollections of 
                        Vietnam
                     Veterans Memorial Committee leader Jim Chancellor and excerpts from Payback by reporter Joe Klein, who reconstructed the life and times of 1981 suicide victim 
                        Gary
                     Cooper, a resident of the poor white community of Black Oak.
            16. Concerned Citizens against the Bailly Nuclear Site (1988). James E. Newman, who
                    donated newsletters of the "Concerned Citizens" to the CRA, agreed to coedit this
                    volume. It includes interviews with the major participants of the Concerned Citizens as well as
                    members of a more militant antinuclear group, the Bailly Alliance, which mobilized citizen action to
                    stop a utility company from building a nuclear power plant on the southern shore of Lake
                        Michigan.

                    working a summer, buying a car and then moving on to something else.19
            
            17. Life in the Calumet Region during the 1930s (1988). This volume contains a
                    potpourri of stories about Hotel 
                        Gary
                     maids, a "Singing Milkman," policy runners, Summer Gardens picnic
                    grove frolickers, and "Grandma Boots," who produced clothes out of flour sacks,
                    collected rainwater in a tub, and made bootleg liquor in her cellar. Also included are Depression
                    experiences—"Oatmeal Three Times a Day"—as well as a digest
                    of earlier Steel Shavings excerpts on the 1930s and some literary treasures.
            18. Life in the Calumet Region during the 1930s: John Letica's
                        "Totin' Ties in the Harbor" (1989). A Croatian-American
                    steelworker 
                  
                     18While most issues continued to stress family, the word
                            "life," as in the phrase "everyday life," seemed an
                            accurate summary of the social historian's goal of depicting some balance among all
                            aspects of human activity, including primary group ties, school and workplace experiences,
                            and leisure time pursuits. As Studs Terkel put it in reference to 
                                Chicago
                            , a city that has had a tremendous influence on the people of northwest Indiana
                            and is technically part of the Calumet region, "I guess I was seeking some balance
                            in the wildlife of the city as Rachel Carson sought it in nature." Terkel, Division Street: America (
                                New York

                     talks about the death of his mother, his relationship with his
                    brother and father, and coping with hard times. Accompanying this between-the-cultures autobiography
                    is an interview with the deceased author's brother Bart and family photos.
            19. Calumet Region Steelworkers' Tales (1990). Colorfiil anecdotes confirm
                    the validity of Richard M. Dorson's "folklore of steelworkers" findings
                    regarding recollections of "the old days," "deaths and
                    accidents," "thefts," "goofing off,"
                    "rats," and "mill characters."20
                    Supplementing these oral memories of workplace experiences are lengthy interviews with women,
                    Latinos, and union activists.
            20. A History of Portage, Indiana (1991). Indiana University Northwest students
                    employed oral histories to research Portage's modern history. The editor combined
                    remembrances of several civic leaders, material from a collection of oral histories in the local
                    library, and documentation from press clippings and council minute books to produce a profile of the
                    town's recent past.
            21. Life in the Calumet Region during the 1980s (1992). Narrators recall family
                    dynamics, school functions, gender relationships, work and leisure activities, crime, scandal,
                    strikes (the steel lockout of 1986-1987 was 
                        Gary
                    's longest ever), and other local disasters, such as the collapse of the Cline
                    Avenue bridge extension ramp. The volume also contains an installment of "An Oral History
                    of the Richard G. Hatcher Administration, 1980–1987," then in decline due to a
                    drying up of federal finds.
            22. Homefront: The World War II Years in the Calumet Region (1993). During a time
                    of ration coupons, Victory gardens, scrap iron drives, and leg makeup to simulate stockings, the war
                    years had a profound effect on women, youth, and the men who stayed behind, as the reminiscences in
                    this volume make clear. Memorable accounts are provided by Tom Higgins, an AOAs (All Out Americans)
                    leader at Holy Angels School, and defense worker Shirley Franzitta, who sent her pinup picture to a
                    dozen GI pen pals.
            23. Rah Rahs & Rebel 'Rousers: Relationships between the Sexes in the
                        Calumet Region during the Teen years of the 1950s (1994). Oral histories explore the daily
                    lives of people whose school experiences, leisure habits, gender roles, and mating rituals were a
                    byproduct of steelworkers being able to provide their families with a middle-class standard of
                        living.21 A preoccupation with sex, cars, and rock ‘n roll gave
                    the 1950s a special flavor. Considering the supposed secretive-ness and repression of the era, the
                    respondents’ stories are remarkably vivid.

                    institutions during the turbulent 1960s.23 Narrators describe the diversity of
                    region lifestyles during a decade of experimentation. The editor contributed three long interviews
                    of a 
                        Vietnam
                     vet and two young mothers, as well as an installment of "An Oral History of

                    prominence in the 1960s.
            26. A History of Cedar Lake

                    seminar students recorded the town's more recent past, conducting more than forty
                    interviews. Additional oral accounts, excerpts of news articles, town board minutes, and the
                    unpublished writings of local historian Beatrice Horner offer further insights into a community
                    whose vicissitudes have often mirrored the physical and cultural changes experienced in the region
                    during the twentieth century.
            27. Froebel Daughters of Penelope (1998). After discovering two autobiographical
                    manuscripts written by daughters of Greek immigrants who grew up in 
                        Gary
                    's working-class district during the 1930s and 1940s and attended Froebel
                    School, known as the city's immigrant school, the women and three other "Daughters
                    of Penelope" (also the name of a leading Greek-American sorority of their day) patiently
                    agreed to extensive interviews. Although each of their home environments was unique, their parents
                    generally wanted Greek spoken in the house, expected offspring to contribute to the family income
                    from a young age, and frowned on dating, especially with "outsiders."
            28. Tales of Lake Michigan & the Northwest Indiana
                        Dunelands (1998). Narrators range among a variety of subjects, from moonlight beach parties
                    and fishing tales to strange disappearances and boating accidents. Sprinkled within these interviews
                    are poems, fiction,

                    (1999). Some young subjects describe efforts to cope with the "Traumas of Growing
                    Up." Baby boomers were reaching adulthood during an age of limits that saw unemployment
                    lines lengthen as industrial jobs disappeared due to mechanization.24 Among the
                    special features supplementing the student-conducted interviews are a lengthy account of a 
                        Vietnam
                     veteran's adjustment to civilian life and the final oral history installment

                        Calumet Region during the 1970s (2000). Coedited with Mike Olszanski, this study employs
                    over three dozen interviews, as well as union records and other primary sources, to recount the
                    history of Inland Steel Company's Union 1010 (known as the "Red Local").
                    Highlights of the insurgency are the local and district campaigns of Jim Balanoff and Ed Sadlowski,
                    progressive unionists supported by feminist

                    discovered his musical passion as a teenager during the 1950s while hanging out with

            Throughout the publishing history of Steel Shavings, the central challenges facing
                    those who have sought to integrate hundreds of oral histories into a chronicle of the Calumet region
                    have been more or less constant and will likely remain so: verifying the accuracy of testimony and
                    persuading narrators to be candid about family life while respecting people's privacy.
            
                    Indiana Historical Society Library's Oral History Collections
                
            The oral history collections housed in the William Henry Smith Memorial Library at the Indiana
                    Historical Society (IHS) are both wide-ranging and extensive. Oral history interviews reside in
                    collections resulting from specific research projects and as components of collections of personal
                    and family papers and organizational and business records. Occasionally, an oral history interview
                    by itself will form a small collection.
            In general, the IHS library has been the recipient of oral histories produced by others more than it
                    has pursued an active oral history program of its own. The society provides guidelines for
                    interviews, offers training in some cases, and makes sure that potential interviewers use the
                    standard legal instruments allowing interviews to be used and cited. The IHS is beginning to
                    incorporate oral history interviews into processing collections, using them to fill in gaps in the
                    documentary record.
            Oral histories are subject to the same collection development policy that governs other materials
                    coming into the IHS's collections. The library is actively documenting women's
                    history, ethnic history, black history (all limited to Indiana and the Old Northwest), and railroad
                    and interurban history (more widely defined to include Indiana and other parts of the Midwest). Thus
                    it is not surprising that most of the IHS oral history collections fall in these same areas, and
                    many of the examples mentioned below reflect these collection emphases.
            The society has been involved with two programs that give funding for oral history projects: Clio
                    grants and Indiana Heritage Research Grants. These projects, when completed, usually require the
                    deposit of tapes and transcripts that they produce in the IHS library, where they can be mined by
                    others for additional information and insights.
            
            Collections based on projects funded by Clio grants include Remembering Indiana in the Twentieth
                    Century, 1995-1997; and the Indiana Broadcasters Pioneers Foundation, Inc., Oral History Project
                    Collection, 1994-1997. The Remembering Indiana project, for which John E. Bodnar served as project
                    director, deposited fifteen transcripts of interviews in the IHS library. Eight reminiscences deal
                    with 
                        Evansville
                    , six with 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and one with Tell City. Family and personal history, trade unions, and African
                    Americans in 
                        Indianapolis
                     are among the topics discussed. Excerpts from these interviews have been incorporated
                    into Bodnar's Our Towns. The Indiana Broadcasters Pioneers Foundation
                    oral history collection led to the publication of "In the Public
                        Interest": Oral Histories of Hoosier Broadcasters (1999), compiled and edited by
                    Linda Weintraut and Jane R. Nolan. The collection itself contains the tapes and transcripts of
                    interviews with twenty-six Indiana pioneer broadcasters, covering topics in Hoosier broadcasting
                    from 1926 to the mid-1990s.
            The Indiana Heritage Research Grant (IHRG) program, jointly funded by the IHS and the Indiana
                    Humanities Council, assists in research efforts that range from cataloging and translating primary
                    materials to creating and transcribing oral histories. Two IHRG-based oral history collections are
                    the Margaret Robbins Oral History Project, 1992, and Reclaiming a German-American Past: The 
                        Dubois County
                     Area Oral History Interviews, 1993-1994. Weintraut and Nolan interviewed Margaret Ruth
                    Schricker Robbins, the daughter of former Indiana Governor Henry F. Schricker, in 1992. They covered
                    topics such as Robbins's family; local, state, and national politics; the Depression; and
                    the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. Heiko Muehr conducted three interviews as part of the Reclaiming a
                    German-American Past project. Interviewees describe German-American life and efforts to preserve
                    their culture in southwestern Indiana.
            The IHS formerly organized some of its holdings into interest groups, or sections, and its Military
                    History Section operated an oral history program from 1979 to 1985 that documented the experiences
                    of military veterans from the Hoosier state. Interviewees include a ninety-seven-year-old veteran of
                    the Moro Wars in the 
                        Philippines
                     in 1904; a veteran of the 
                        Vera Cruz
                     Expedition of 1914; and veterans of World Wars I and II, the Korean War, and the 
                        Vietnam
                     War. By the end of the program, nearly one hundred interviews had taken place. One
                    particularly lengthy series of conversations, conducted over a three-year period, were with Frank R.
                    Dillman, who saw service in 
                        France
                     during the First World War. Although most of those interviewed are white males, Eugene
                    B. Bailey, a member of the 809th Pioneer Infantry, a black World War I regiment, and Anna A.
                    Cranston, a nurse in a tuberculosis hospital in 
                  New
                        Haven, Connecticut
               , during the
                    same conflict are also narrators who contributed to the program.
            
            There were never formal initiatives in the 1970s and 1980s to document Indiana's ethnic or
                    black heritage through oral history as there had been for military history, but a few concerted
                    efforts generated significant groups of tapes and transcripts in these areas. For example, Jean
                    Spears interviewed black residents of Lyles Station in 1970, and Margaret Trauner interviewed
                    Slovenian, Yugoslavian, and other residents of 
                        Indianapolis
                    's Haughville neighborhood in 1983. Carl Cafouros interviewed members of the
                    city's Greek community in 1980. Collections representing more recent efforts to chronicle
                    African American experiences in Indiana have included two IHRG-funded projects: Remembering The
                    Past: Oral and Pictorial History of African Americans in 
                  Grant
                            County, Indiana
               ; and the 
                        Wabash
                     College Oral History Project Collection, which concentrated on African Americans in 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and at 
                        Wabash
                     College.
            A number of interviews contained in personal papers and organizational records document the history
                    of women in Indiana. Women's history, which the IHS has collected for years, has received
                    renewed attention since the 1980s with the creation of the Indiana Women's History
                    Association (IWHA, originally ded the Indiana Women's History Archives, Inc.). The IWHA has
                    been helpful in bringing to the society collections documenting recent women's history.
                    Records ranging from the Indiana chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to the
                    state's League of Women Voters and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club all contain interview tapes and transcripts.
            Other IHS collections—especially personal and family papers— contain
                    women's oral history interviews. Information on many of these is readily accessible through
                    the IHS website <www.indianahistory.org> and in A Guide to Indiana
                        Women's Oral History Interviews in Selected Repositories, the first comprehensive
                    guide to these interviews in repositories across the state, which include the Indiana Division of
                    the Indiana State Library, the OHRC at Indiana University, 
                        Bloomington
                    , the 
                        Irvington
                     (Hilton U. Brown) Branch of the 
                        Indianapolis

                        Marion County
                     Public Library, the Batesville Memorial Public Library, and the IHS. This ongoing
                    project relies upon IWHA volunteers to locate and describe collections that include women.
            The IHS website can be used to locate these and other oral histories in the Smith Library collection.
                    Researchers looking for materials can do keyword or more structured searches in the
                    library's online catalog, or do keyword searches only using the IHS website's
                    search mechanism. Either approach will lead to detailed collection guides, though the online catalog
                    also provides subject headings through which related materials can be sought.
            Oral history interviews and transcripts continue to make their way into the IHS collections. Indeed,
                    oral histories are becoming almost standard components of family papers and organizational

                     records. The IHS Library staff is also beginning to view oral
                    history as an integral step in the processing of existing collections, especially as a way of filing
                    gaps in the historical record. In these cases, the archival processor, who gains knowledge of
                    individuals and families during the course of organizing their papers, is taking on the additional
                    role of interviewer, and the resulting taped and transcribed interviews become part of the
                    collection. Meanwhile, members of the IHS's Musical Heritage Committee have begun an oral
                    history program under the auspices of the Smith Library, seeking to record the memories and
                    observations of those who have contributed to Indiana's rich and diverse musical past.
            In areas ranging from Indiana's military history to its musical heritage, oral history plays
                    an important part in the Indiana Historical Society's efforts to document the
                    state's history. The society's recent move into a new headquarters building has
                    given it the opportunity to create an audiovisual room for researchers using media as diverse as
                    microfilm, audiotapes, and videotapes. With these new facilities, and with new generations of
                    researchers who expect historical documentation to come from a variety of media, the use of oral
                    histories will certainly continue to grow.

            Few Americans today remember Carl Fisher or know anything about his remarkable career, which was
                    based on the culture of speed, spectacle, and leisure in the early years of the twentieth century.
                    Born in 
                  Greensburg, Indiana
               , in 1874, Fisher grew up in a single-parent family in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , quit school after the sixth grade, and went to work to help support his mother. He
                    spent several years during his teens riding the rails as a "news butcher," selling
                    newspapers, magazines, and tobacco on passenger trains. It was a prophetic beginning, as
                    Fisher's early career was to be built around wheels, engines, and salesmanship. Captivated
                    by the bicycle craze of the late 1880s, the young Fisher helped organize a bicycle club in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , participated in bicycle races, and tinkered with new types of bicycles; he eventually
                    turned his diversion into a lucrative business, first by repairing bikes and later by using creative
                    advertising to sell them.
            Two-wheelers provided a career start, but the emerging automobile industry ultimately offered
                    enormous financial success. One of the first car owners in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Fisher soon began selling automobiles from his downtown bicycle showroom and then
                    formed the short-lived Empire Motor Car Company to manufacture them. In 1904, he formed the
                    Prest-O-Lite corporation, which produced the first successful auto headlights and made his fortune.
                    The restless Fisher soon abandoned bicycle racing as too slow and too tame and became an avid auto
                    racer. This avocation led him and his associates to build the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Speedway, which held its first 500-mile auto race in 1911, perfectly combining
                    Fisher's interests in speed and spectacle. Similarly, Fisher was deeply involved in the
                    Progressive era's Good Roads movement, organizing his 
                        Detroit
                     auto friends, known as the "gasoline aristocracy," to promote and
                    build the crosscountry 
                        Lincoln
                     Highway and later the Dixie Highway, which connected the Midwest with 
                        Florida
                    .
            An accidental stay in 
                        Miami
                     after a yachting trip in 1910 resulted in a dramatic shift in Fisher's
                    entrepreneurial interests. Using Prest-O-Lite profits, he bought huge tracts of undeveloped and
                    seemingly uninhabitable marshland on the barrier island that became Miami Beach. Over the next
                    fifteen years, he created and effectively promoted a magnificent winter vacation paradise centered
                    upon sun, sand, surf, and outdoor sports—fishing, yachting, motorboat racing, tennis,
                    golf, and polo—not to mention Prohibition era booze and gambling. By the mid-twenties,
                    Fisher's holdings were worth about $100 million, mostly profits based on
                    escalating land values.  When 
                        Florida
                     was battered by a hurricane in 1926, the boom collapsed at the same time that Fisher
                    was sinking millions into a resort project at Montauk on the eastern end of Long Island. The Great
                    Depression finished off Fisher's entrepreneurial dreams, and he died in 1939 with few
                    remaining assets.
            Mark S. Foster has written a compelling biography that captures Carl Fisher's amazing spirit
                    and drive. He has mined the Fisher papers housed at the Historical Museum of South 
                        Florida
                     in 
                        Miami
                    , and he has exploited other relevant source material. Fisher was no Rockefeller,
                    Edison, or Ford; he created no great corporations, and he carried out most of his expansive projects
                    with only a few associates. In the age of giant corporations and huge bureaucracies, he worked
                    mostly alone. Fisher's extraordinary talent was to dream up and then promote popular new
                    applications for technology. He was the salesman extraordinaire. Selling the 
                        Florida
                     dream to chilled northerners in the midst of winter tapped into Fisher's flair
                    for promotional extravaganzas. Except for a laudatory and unreliable biography written by his wife,
                    Jane Fisher (Fabulous Hoosier, 1947), little had been written about Fisher.
                    Fortunately, Foster has recovered the fascinating history of this creative businessman whose
                    accomplishments have persisted while his memory has dimmed.

               Life in a Three-Ring Circus: Posters and Interviews. Essays by Sharon L. Smith
                    and Stephen J. Fletcher. ([
                        Indianapolis
                    ]: Indiana Historical Society, 2001. Pp. 79. Illustrations. $39.95.)
            "When the circus came to town, they paraded right down Main Street…. Businesses
                    closed, all the schools closed, everybody went to the circus…. [T]hey had bands, they had
                    wild animals, they had horses, they had pretty ladies, all coming down Main Street. It was just
                    magical" (p. 68).
            And magical it was, as vividly described and illustrated in Life in a Three-Ring
                    Circus. This is a gloriously colorful volume that has both fascinating facts and beautifully
                    reproduced posters from the golden age of the circus. Whether or not one has ever attended a circus,
                    it is a book that everyone can enjoy. Especially interesting are the accounts of circuses in the
                    state of Indiana, specifically the town of 
                        Peru
                    , which so many companies used for their winter quarters and which perpetuates the charm
                    of the circus to this day.
            The book opens with a brief and lively history of the circus from 
                        Rome
                    's Circus Maximus to today's so-called Shrine Circuses. There are many
                    familiar names in this section, which outlines the careers  of
                    movers and shakers like P. T. Barnum, James Bailey, Clyde Beatty, and John Ringling. Other names
                    important to the development of the circus are not so familiar. For example, one learns about
                    William Cameron Coup, a native of 
                  Terre Haute,
                            Indiana
               , who contributed significantly to circus
                    travel by inventing a process of loading trains with circus equipment that greatly streamlined the
                    movement of the circus from place to place. He also perfected the technique of plastering the
                    countryside with gaudy posters to whet the appetites of prospective customers.
            Some of these posters are wonderfully reproduced here, and they alone are worth the price of the
                    book. A glowering hippo (p. 8), a striking clown (p. 55), and a supremely confident Frank Buck
                    amidst a jungle menagerie (p. 44) are among the most exciting examples. Unfortunately no mention is
                    made of the approximate dates of these posters. An excellent photo of downtown
                            
                  Greensburg, Indiana
               , (p. 17) gives us an idea of how these posters were used. It is
                    obvious that the advance advertising was overwhelming in those more innocent times. When the
                    photograph of 
                        Greensburg
                     was taken in August 1907 there was no radio or television, and movies were just
                    beginning to catch on. The circus was the big event in entertainment for small towns like 
                        Greensburg
                    .
            Sharon L. Smith and Stephen J. Fletcher relate stories and interviews that are of great interest. For
                    example, this reader was quite taken with the story of Lilian Leitzel, who appeared in 
                        South Bend
                     in 1914; her act consisted of "a never-before-seen stunt, the one-armed
                    flange, for which she separated her shoulder joint again and again, throwing her entire body
                    vertically over her shoulder." According to Smith, Leitzel commanded top billing longer
                    than any other circus performer in history.
            Gilbert Taylor, presently curator of the Crispus Attucks Museum in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was interviewed about his father, Hugh Taylor, who was a trombonist with the
                    Hagenback-Wallace Circus in the 1920s. Taylor tells what the life of an African American traveling
                    with the circus was like. He recalled that his father reported that black performers were not
                    treated differently in the circus, but with townspeople it was a different story.
            The book closes with an episode concerning the antics of a female elephant named Modoc that bolted
                    during a performance at the 
                        Wabash
                     (Indiana) High School gymnasium in 1942. Modoc caused considerable consternation around
                    the countryside for about four days before she was effectively corralled.
            This is a valuable and entertaining book.

               The Shawnee Indians: An Annotated Bibliography. By Randolph Noe. (
                        Lanham
                    , Md.: Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2001. Pp. xxxv, 721. Notes, indices. $98.50.)
            A quarter of a century ago the anthropologist Noel William Schutz, Jr., lamented that the Shawnee
                    Indians had been neglected by scholars. Today their significance is still widely underappreciated.
                    The memory of Tecumseh, it is true, remains a durable monument to Shawnee enterprise, but long
                    before his rise on the eve of the War of 1812 Shawnees were acknowledged pan-Indian diplomats. As
                    John Norton, an adopted Mohawk, testified in 1804, the tribe was recognized as "the most
                    leading nation of the [Indian] Confederacy—most polished in their language &
                    manners & those who convene the Councils & bring the rest together" (p.
                    352). Shawnees orchestrated resistance to the white settlement of the Old Northwest over a period of
                    seventy years, and their influence filtered deep into the South, spurring the Cherokee war of 1776
                    and the Seminole and Creek uprisings of 1812–1814.
            However, apart from their stand for 
                  Kentucky,
                            Ohio
               , and Indiana, Shawnees commonly
                    responded to pressure by migrating, and their extraordinary peregrinations partly explain the lack
                    of an adequate modern history of the tribe. Ranging widely between 
                        Canada
                     and 
                        Mexico
                    , the Shawnees left source materials that are scattered and difficult to marshal. 
                        Randolph
                     Noe's excellent bibliography, which describes nearly three thousand published
                    references, reflects this rich past. The extensive indices allow students to pursue selected themes,
                    but the references are grouped around chronological time periods and demonstrate the uneven scope of
                    the writing. Most treat the tribe's occupancy of the Ohio Valley
                    before "removal" in the 1830s, but while the experiences of the emigrant
                    communities in 
                  Missouri, Kansas
               , and elsewhere now attract attention, research on
                    twentieth-century Shawnee history remains depressingly thin.
            The great strength of this book is its comprehensiveness. Nearly all the pertinent items are here,
                    along with many little-known articles and dissertations, and most scholars will make discoveries
                    among these gleanings. Inevitably, in a work of such scope, there are some omissions. The
                    biographies of Clark, 
                        Wayne
                    , and Harrison, respectively written by James A. James, Paul David Nelson, and Dorothy
                    B. Goebel, ought to have found a place, while Carl J. Fliegel's index of the Moravian
                    records details essential Shawnee documents. The most striking omission is the Atlas of
                        Great Lakes Indian History, edited by Helen H. Tanner and published in 1987. Given the
                    confusing movements of Shawnee communities in the colonial and early national periods, this is an
                    essential reference. However, there are surprisingly few oversights, and the listing of such legal
                    documents as statutes at large and executive orders is particularly thorough.
            
            If there is a criticism, it is that the evaluation of sources might have had a sharper edge. Much
                    that has been written about the Shawnees is unreliable. For example, Thomas Wildcat
                    Alford's description of the responsibilities of the different divisions of the Shawnee
                    tribe is not applicable to the eighteenth century. The Mekoche division, not the 
                        Chillicothe
                     or Hathawekela, managed tribal affairs, and Alford's much repeated errors (pp.
                    xix-xx) have led to serious misinterpretations of Shawnee politics. To his credit, Noe usually
                    cautions readers about questionable sources, and some notorious examples of fraudulent writing have
                    wisely been omitted altogether.
            Quibbles aside, this conscientious, wide-ranging, and valuable volume is a mandatory first stop for
                    any student of the Shawnee. What we now need is a balanced history of the tribe—that one
                    hopes Noe will undertake—and the restoration of these people to their rightful place in
                    American history.

               A Fragile Capital: Identity and the Early Years of 
                     Columbus, Ohio
                  .
                    By Charles C. Cole, Jr. (
                        Columbus

               A Fragile Capital offers a broad description of the origins and forty years of
                    development of the capital city of 
                        Ohio
                    . In addition, it describes the process of creating a new city to serve as the capital
                    of the state. Unlike most local historians, Charles C. Cole, Jr., does not just follow a
                    chronological description of the happenings in 
                        Columbus
                     from 1812 until 1850. Rather, the book is organized by topic, including business,
                    politics, education, religion, the arts, transportation, and the press. This arrangement opens the
                    possibility of penetrating the background in depth, which the author accomplishes.
            Cole relies on primary sources such as letters, diaries, legal documents, and newspapers, rather than
                    depending, as so many local historians do, on folklore and other informal sources. While the use of
                    primary sources tends to emphasize white male leaders, the author has also worked to uncover
                    evidence about the role of women and the antislavery efforts in political activity.
            Change is the theme of the capital city's first four decades. The impact of the improvement
                    in highways and railroad building and their effect upon the mobility of the people of central 
                        Ohio
                     is explored. Cole analyzes the increase in writing and publishing and illustrates that
                    cultural opportunities in 
                        Columbus
                     expanded during this period, by mid-century attracting internationally known performers
                    such as Swedish soprano Jenny Lind.

                        Columbus
                     residents who were abolitionists was very small, but Cole conducts distinctive research
                    in this area, offering a detailed analysis of the antislavery issue's influence on politics
                    in 
                        Columbus
                     and the state of 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Indiana readers will note many similarities between the pioneer period in their own state and that of
                    their 
                        Ohio
                     neighbor: both were settled by westward migration on the Ohio
                    River; both established early capitals in the southern part of their territory; and later
                    both chose a more central location for their state's capital city. Cole's use of
                    the term "fragile capital" reflects the political compromises required to create a
                    new city for the state capital and the turbulent changes in the pioneer period that threatened its
                    permanence.
            This book should be attractive to the general public as well as professional historians. Teachers and
                    librarians seeking a reference on early nineteenth-century life in what was then considered
                    "the west" will appreciate Cole's in-depth descriptions of specific areas
                    as well as his more general discussions. Cole's work reflects an extended period of
                    research and will be appreciated by lay readers as much as by professional historians.

            Have you ever driven the leafy boulevard, 
                        Fall Creek
                     Parkway, along the White River as it winds its way through
                    downtown 
                        Indianapolis
                    ? Or maybe you enjoy quiet pastimes or ball games in the park and parkway systems of

                        Fort Wayne
                    ? Did you attend or have you visited Indiana University in 
                        Bloomington
                     and strolled through Dunn's Woods, admiring the forested setting of the Old
                    Crescent historic district? If you have enjoyed any of these places, then you have experienced the
                    work of pioneers in the practice of landscape architecture in the Midwest: George Edward Kessler
                    designed the park and parkway systems of the three Indiana cities, and the Olmsted Brothers firm was
                    responsible for the campus development of the 1930s that adjoins the Old Crescent. Percival
                    Gallagher, the Olmsted Brothers designer responsible for the firm's work at Indiana
                    University, single-handedly saved Dunn's Woods from development! Kessler, the senior
                    Olmsted, and the Olmsted Brothers are included in Midwestern Landscape
                    Architecture, edited by William H. Tishler, who is a member of the department of landscape
                    architecture at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    .
            
            This book is a scholarly collection of profiles of the careers of pioneers in landscape architecture
                    in the Midwest states of 
                  Illinois, Ohio, Michigan,
                            Wisconsin
               , and 
                        Minnesota
                    , with references to the practitioners' projects in Indiana. The thirteen
                    profiles present the careers of eleven landscape architects (two of them women), one architect, and
                    a horticulturalist.
            The careers of these professionals are presented by a talented group of scholars, including eight
                    faculty members and administrators in landscape architecture, a preservation planner, two editors of
                    scholarly publications in landscape architecture history, an architect, a landscape architect, and a
                    landscape historian. They have meticulously researched biographies, professional careers, and
                    projects. They have become the "alter-egos" of these gallant crusaders for
                    appreciation of the midwestern landscape and its natural heritage.
            While most of the practitioners included in this book are not widely known (Frederick Law Olmsted and
                    Jens Jensen are the exceptions), the authors want to introduce them to a broad readership. Their
                    work spans the 130-year period between 1852—the beginning of the career of Adolph
                    Strauch, the "Father" of 
                        Cincinnati
                    's Spring Grove Cemetery—and the death of 
                        Michigan
                     landscape architect and conservationist Genevieve Gillette in 1986. Each chapter
                    summarizes an individual's role in midwestern landscape architecture, offers biographical
                    highlights, discusses key innovative projects, assesses contributions to the profession of landscape
                    architecture, and notes the extent of recognition of his or her work by peers, professional
                    organizations, and clients. The chapters are filled with plan drawings, photos, correspondence, and
                    interviews with colleagues, mentors, and family members. Many charming anecdotes are included, not
                    only in the chapter text, but also in extensive footnotes.
            The impact of these professionals is staggering. They provided innovative ideas in the design of
                    cemeteries, parks, playgrounds, parkways, and park systems (for cities, regions, and states),
                    residential subdivisions, and residential gardens. This book promotes interest in the protection of
                    regional landscapes and opens the door for further research, as did Cynthia Zaitzevsky's
                        Frederick Law Olmsted and the 
                            Boston
                         Park System (1982). That publication stimulated the development of regional
                    and national movements to protect and to restore the work of America's great park maker,
                    Frederick Law Olmsted, Sr. Might Professor Tishler and his colleagues have a similar impact on
                    behalf of the Midwest landscape?

               "Rally, Once Again": Selected Civil War Writings of Alan T.
                    Nolan. By Alan T. Nolan. (
                        Madison

                     House Publishers, 2000. Pp. x, 308. Illustrations, notes, index. $29.95.)
            Alan T. Nolan here presents a self-described "late in career vanity piece." It is a
                    compendium of various writings, most of them previously published. Nolan is a fine scholar, though
                    not a professional historian (he practices law). While he expresses strong and controversial
                    opinions, he makes a good case for them.
            Nolan has divided the work into four major divisions: 1) leaders, which focuses mostly on Robert E.
                    Lee but also treats Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                    , John Gibbon, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 2) 
                        Gettysburg
                    , 3) the Iron Brigade; and 4) selected reviews. Nolan points out that he "was
                    introduced to the war as a child on a trip to 
                        Gettysburg
                     and 
                        Antietam
                    " with his "history-loving father," who also told him about
                    his "Irish Civil War grandfather" (p. ix). Nolan claims to have been
                    "studying, writing, talking and thinking about the war for sixty years," and he
                    does "not see the war as at all romantic or glorious." Placing himself squarely as
                    a-not-likely-to-be-well-received person in many places, especially in the South, Nolan finds
                    "all of the contentions of the Southern myth of the Lost Cause … offensive
                    … and unhistoric." Instead, he puts himself in the camp of the current chief
                    historian of the National Park Service when he says that "In fact, slavery was the source of the sectional conflict"—a view that, when unqualified,
                    is challenged by most historians. He also rejects as absurd "the romantic cliche that
                    ‘both sides were right’…." He almost invites the ire and
                    rage of some readers by concluding, "In short, except for the valor of Confederate common
                    soldiers, I find almost nothing in the Confederate culture or tradition to admire or
                    celebrate" (p. x).
            As to Lee's "greatness" as a general, Nolan's position is summed
                    up with his opening statement "I believe that Lee's generalship hurt the
                    Confederates' chances for victory" (p. 10). Indeed, Nolan clearly reveals that he
                    is much more a critic than an admirer of Lee. Nolan departs widely from the view of most historians
                    when he asserts that Lee was sure that the South's loss was inevitable by June of 1864, ten
                    months before 
                        Appomattox
                    . Recent scholarship has indicated that evidence shows Lee did not decide that the war
                    was lost until sometime after the first of January 1865 and probably not until well into February.
            About 
                        Gettysburg
                    , Nolan believes "the first day and its decisiveness in reference to the
                    outcome of the battle are not sufficiently emphasized in much of the 
                        Gettysburg
                     literature" (p. 141). Certainly fans of Thomas J.
                    "Stonewall" Jackson would agree: if only Old Jack had been at the base of
                    Culp's Hill on July 1, 1863, Lee's orders to secure those heights " if
                    practicable" would (supposedly) most assuredly have been carried out. Nolan also asserts
                    that "the 
                        Gettysburg
                    
                     campaign involved substantial and unacceptable risks for
                    Lee's army" (p. 157).
            Nolan has made a major hobby out of writing pieces on the Iron Brigade. His various contributions are
                    significant and noteworthy, but especially impressive is his short piece, "Giants in Tall
                    Black Hats."
            The section on book reviews is very good. For one thing, it shows just how broad is the range of
                    Nolan's careful and critical reading. While many readers may be acquainted with the work
                    Nolan has reviewed, few will have seen Nolan's published critiques, since he has written
                    for widely varied publications. "his work is everything that reasonably might have been
                    hoped for or expected.

               William Z. Foster and the Tragedy of American Radicalism. By James R. Barrett. (

                    : University of 
                        Illinois
                     Press, 1999. Pp. xiii, 352. Illustrations, notes, index. $34.95.)
            "The working class had its own geniuses, though they are seldom celebrated," writes
                    historian James R. Barrett. William Z. Foster, who organized 
                        Chicago
                    's packinghouse workers and led 1919's Great Steel Strike, in his own
                    sphere "was every bit as cosmopolitan and sophisticated as the corporate strategists he
                    loved to battle" (p. ix). Indeed, Foster stands among the giants of the left in the 
                        United States
                    . Had indigenous Communists selected their leader democratically, they certainly would
                    have chosen him, and Barrett explains why in a compelling analysis. From Foster's
                    "young adulthood on, class conflict was not simply an element of theory, but the central
                    experience" in life, from which all else developed. "Even in his
                    fifties," Foster "worried far less about confrontations with the police than other
                    Communist leaders did. He seldom advocated violence, but he seemed to accept its prospect as a
                    matter of course" (p. 178).
            Barrett's account contributes much to a field of study in which historiographical disputes
                    often seem likely to spill into street battles. In examining Foster's life and career,
                    Barrett employs both domestic and Russian sources to strike a refreshing balance between focus on
                    "the genuine radical impulses generated by social conflict in the 
                        United States
                    " and emphasis on "the exigencies of international Communist politics,
                    particularly the policy interests of the 
                        Soviet Union
                    " (p. 225).
            Foster, who was reared in a 
                        Philadelphia
                     slum and forced early into unskilled labor to help support his family, obtained his
                    education  on the open road. He hoboed to most parts of the 
                        United States
                     looking for employment and worked on tramp steamers that took him to Africa, 
                        Australia
                    , and Latin America. He advocated socialism, joined the Industrial Workers of the World,
                    and then studied syndicalism and foreign languages in Britain, 
                        France
                    , and 
                        Germany
                    . Although Foster clearly possessed more gifts than most of his contemporaries in the
                    movement, his final ideological journey, from syndicalism to communism, typified "a whole
                    generation of labor radicals, men and women who made the ideological leap in faith that the
                    Communist Party represented a more suitable vehicle for achieving a working-class
                    revolution" (p. 197). Barrett argues that the movement's failure to achieve a more
                    egalitarian American society resulted from a complex dynamic of bad Communist party decisions and
                    government repression.
            In telling Foster's exciting story, Barrett displays an insight applicable to other top
                    Communists as well. "It would be difficult to analyze Foster's own development as
                    distinct from … organizations he helped shape, because his identity had merged with these movements" [emphasis in original]. "The paucity of
                    personal material … reflects Foster's personality as much as a dearth of
                    sources" (p. x). His individuality became "fused with his politics." To
                    "disengage the two" would be "misleading and artificial" (p.
                    xi). Decades earlier, contemporaries Elizabeth G. Flynn, Joseph Freeman, and Steve Nelson made
                    observations that support Barrett's point (pp. 203, 241).
            If commitment to the class struggle was Foster's strength, distrust of democracy was his
                    weakness. When he was a Syndicalist, Foster wanted "facts and figures" to replace
                    the capitalists. "These would be interpreted and executed not by rank-and-file workers, but
                    by technical experts in each industry" (p. 56). As a Communist, Foster always sought rule
                    by a Leninist vanguard, not a mass toilers' party. After Nikita Khrushchev's
                    "secret speech" caused other American Communists to reconsider their
                    movement's entire nature, Foster continued to defend Joseph Stalin.

               Much More Than a Game: Players, Owners, & American Baseball Since 1921.

            In the very last paragraph of this fascinating labor history of baseball, Robert F. Burk writes of
                    the "contentious history … [and] the 
                    self-destructive hatreds" of team owners and major league baseball players that has
                    characterized the sport from its beginnings in the nineteenth century to the present (p. 312).
            Burk, a professor of history and chair of his department at Muskingum College in New Concord, 
                        Ohio
                    , began charting baseball's labor woes in Never Just a Game:
                        Players, Owners, & American Baseball to 1920 (1994), and he continues his detailed
                    narrative in this book, dividing the last eighty years into "The Paternalistic Era: The Age
                    of Rickey," and "The Inflationary Era: The Age of Miller."
            His division makes sense, as does his selection of Branch Rickey and Marvin Miller as the two most
                    influential figures in his story. Although baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis presided
                    over the sport from 1921 to 1944, Burk punctures Landis's importance—much of it
                    self-importance—and shows that Rickey, in his perfection of the farm system and his
                    relentless cost efficiency, was the main force in baseball from the late 1920s through the 1950s.
                    Rickey was also the master of paternalistic labor practices, including his most famous
                    action—the racial integration of organized baseball with his signing of Jackie Robinson,
                    first to a minor league contract and then to the 
                        Brooklyn
                     Dodgers. Burk argues persuasively that Rickey acted more from economic interests than
                    racial idealism. The clever executive saw African American players and their Negro leagues as an
                    untapped pool of cheap labor for his and other major league teams, and he signed Robinson mainly
                    because he wanted to demolish incipient player unionization as well as a possible competitor to
                    major league monopoly, the Mexican league. In this action and many others, Rickey shaped organized
                    baseball into a cartel that maximized profits for owners, particularly the bosses of the Dodgers and
                    the 
                        New York
                     Yankees, and kept player salaries at an amazingly low level.
            Rickey's triumph prepared the way for the 1960s Player Association and its hiring of an
                    experienced labor union official, Marvin Miller, to press salary and pension demands. The
                    intransigence and stupidity of the team owners allowed Miller to maneuver the sport into 1970s free
                    agency and its subsequent consequences—a relatively open market that allows veteran
                    players, particularly stars, to sell themselves to the highest bidder for fabulous sums of money.
                    During the Rickey era, the average major league salary never topped $15,000, and player
                    payroll consumed a minor percentage of team operating costs; now, on many teams, average salaries
                    are at the $1.5 million mark, and total player payroll far exceeds the book value of the
                    franchise.
            Burk tells this story well, drawing upon many sources and transforming his research into a highly
                    readable narrative. He also adds a long "Bibliographic Essay" on the literature of
                    baseball history, treating the many sentimental paeans to the sport, including ones by fellow
                    historians, with a kindness that they do not deserve and that 
                    is undercut by his own clear-eyed view of what actually occurred, particularly between players and
                    owners. After finishing Much More than a Game and its predecessor, Never Just a Game, no reader will be able to swallow another essay by an Ivy League
                    academic treating the 
                        Boston
                     Red Sox as if they were cursed heroes of Greek mythology. For this gift and his superb
                    labor history of baseball, serious fans of the sport should give Burk a standing ovation.
