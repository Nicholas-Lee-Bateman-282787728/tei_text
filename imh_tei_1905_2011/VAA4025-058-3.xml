            <p>The October, 1880 election for state officers was important to the Democratic party in Indiana, and
                    the November, 1880 presidential election in the Hoosier State was doubly important to the national
                    fortunes of the party. Yet the Democracy lost both of these political contests by narrow margins of
                    less than 8,000 votes in a total count of approximately 470,000.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This occurred
                    despite the fact that in early September of 1880 the state had appeared to key observers as safely

                    participants, as well as historians, have offered a myriad of explanations about the elements,
                    issues, and mistakes which contributed to this debacle. Stress usually has been placed on national
                    factors: e.g., the supposed political ineptitude of the Democratic presidential candidate, General
                    Winfield Scott Hancock; the unfortunate appearance of the phrase "a tariff for revenue
                    only" in the party platform; the general disorganization and anarchy within the party
                    following the loss of the disputed election of 1876; and the <list type="footnotes">

                    energy, money, and imported voters which were supposedly poured into Indiana in the closing weeks of
                    the campaign by the Republican national committee under the direction of its secretary, Stephen W.
                        Dorsey.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>During the campaign, after the October election, and in the months following the November defeat,
                    many voices in Indiana and neighboring states suggested that the failure had been due largely to the
                    faulty operations of the Democratic State Central Committee of Indiana. This committee had operated
                    under the chairmanship of William H. English, who was also the vice-presidential running mate of
                    General Hancock on the national ticket.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> The papers of English, which are
                    available for scrutiny, provide a remarkably full picture of the policies, problems, techniques, and
                    financial activities of the state central committee in that highly significant election year. These
                    manuscripts and records make possible a somewhat detailed study of the committee's
                    operations. Such an analysis throws considerable light on the actual causes of defeat and offers a
                    variety of interesting detail about the tools and tactics as well as the strategy and scope of a
                    state political campaign some fourscore years ago.</p>

                    there was little danger that any of the southern or border states could be stolen again from the

                    practically before the contest began. The addition of <placeName>

                    </placeName> (35) and Indiana (15) would make a total of 188 votes and victory. Tilden and Hendricks
                    had carried these key northern states in 1876; therefore, they might be presumed to be Democratic in
                    1880. It is true that the picture had changed somewhat in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but it was thought that some truce could be worked out between the John Kelly and
                    Samuel J. Tilden forces to enable the Democrats to achieve the necessary unity. Since <placeName>

                    </placeName> (6) was no longer considered as probably Democratic even strongly Democratic <placeName>

                    </placeName> (9), when added to the anticipated votes from <placeName>

                    </placeName> (35), would not be sufficient. Thus, the fifteen votes of Indiana were crucial.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> While a scattering of Democratic electors might be forthcoming from <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the Far West, these developments could not be relied upon. Democratic managers
                    agreed that <placeName>

                    State was especially important because of its October election of state officers. Republican victory
                    in this contest would undoubtedly affect the psychology of the presidential campaign and breed
                    discouragement in Democratic quarters.</p>
            <p>Usually voter support in Indiana throughout the last half of the nineteenth century was almost
                    equally divided between the two major parties. This perhaps reflected the remarkably even cultural,
                    economic, and regional balance within the State. For a decade and a half before 1875 Oliver P.
                    Morton was the driving and domineering spirit and force of the Republicans. In the same period
                    Thomas A. Hendricks was the strongest leader of the Democrats. Following the Civil War Indiana
                    became a bloody political battleground with parties <list type="footnotes">

                    happy with this development, since by that date many of them had come to regard Hendricks as
                    something of a renegade Bourbon because of his dalliance with inflation.</p>
            <p>But the star of Hendricks faded somewhat from the political horizon in the years
                    1877–1880. He made plain his resentment of Tilden's studied failure to consult
                    him during the campaign and electoral count of 1876–1877 by announcing that he would
                    never again run on the old ticket of 1876.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> He felt the pressure of the

                    death in the fall of 1877.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Both the Democratic party and the incumbents of
                    elected and patronage state positions hoped to continue their good fortune. But Hendricks'
                    preoccupation with his presidential ambitions bid fair to confuse the Democratic state machine and
                    to decrease the party's prospects in both 1880 elections. Although it must be remembered
                    that the gyrations of national party conventions usually are unpredictable, careful scrutiny of a
                    considerable volume of evidence on the 1880 nominations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> strongly suggests that Hendricks did not have a real chance of being nominated for
                    either president or vice-president. He had to share the title of "leader of the
                    West" with others such as the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    away his chance for the second spot by his vigorous anti-Tildenism of the previous three years; and
                    he was <hi rend="i">persona non grata</hi> to the great party fund contributors of the East because
                    of his flirtation with the inflationists.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Hendricks' past services and the tradition of his heroic leadership during the
                    Reconstruction years enabled him to send to the 1880 convention an Indiana delegation pledged to
                    support him for the presidential nomination. This meant that Indiana, a state needed by the
                    Democrats that year, would have no representative on the national ticket unless another Hoosier
                    could be found. Some of the delegates turned first to Senator Joseph E. McDonald, who sought
                    permission to allow his name to be presented for second place from Hendricks, his life-long
                    political colleague.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Since this permission was not forthcoming, the convention
                    turned to ex-Congressman William H. English, who was nominated by acclamation.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vice-presidential nominee English was comparatively unknown to many Democrats in 1880. He had served
                    for several terms in the national House of Representatives in the 1850's with a somewhat
                    routine record of cooperation with the southern slavery interests then dominating the party and

                    sensed the eastern Bourbon Democrats' dissatisfaction with Hendricks and realized that that

            <p>The methods employed by the central committee for raising and spending party funds in 1880 in Indiana
                    were casual and in line with tradition. According to available evidence, no sums were asked or
                    expected of the common man. Instead, holders and aspirants for state office as well as devoted and
                    wealthy party adherents were expected to foot the bill.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Assessments of up to
                    $2,000 were levied against each major candidate on the state ticket. Contributions were
                    channeled to the treasurer of the committee by whatever means were convenient and available.
                    Collections began on August 4 and continued until October 30, 1880. Some collections of
                    contributions when handed in were credited to the efforts of particular nominees and earmarked for
                    their campaigns. T. W. Woolen, the committee treasurer, kept a little black book in which thirty-one
                    entries, varying from $100 to $10,250 for a total of $38,432.30,
                    were recorded. Of this amount, $28,636 was turned in by Chairman English and there is
                    considerable evidence that $15,000 of this figure came from the vice-presidential
                    nominee's own pocket. In addition, it is possible that he was out of pocket for a variety
                    of incidental expenses. Because of his spot on the national ticket, he probably also made a
                    significant cash contribution to the expenses of the national committee although evidence to that
                    effect is not available. In passing, it is interesting to note that Thomas A. Hendricks was not
                    listed in the records of the central committee as a contributor. It is possible, of course, that
                    Hendricks supplied some funds to contributions listed here and there by lump sum.</p>

            <p>The total amounts raised and expended by the Democratic central committee of Indiana in the 1880

            <p>While modern political operators at the state level might be amazed at the limited finances and
                    sources of funds available to the Democratic central committee of Indiana in 1880, certified public
                    accountants of the mid-twentieth century would undoubtedly be horrified at the informal and
                    indifferent methods employed in making and recording party expenditures in 1880. A practice
                    seemingly existed whereby those against whom assessments were levied could partially or wholly work
                    out their financial responsibility by paying a variety of small bills presented to them by party
                    workers operating under their direction. Subsequently these paymasters gave the party treasurer
                    vouchers, complete with receipts signed by the party workers or other persons presenting the bills.
                    The most spectacular example of this procedure is found in the extensive records (vouchers numbered
                    1 to 82) which William Fleming presented to the Democratic State Central Committee in 1880.<hi rend="sup">44</hi> This gentleman, then serving as treasurer of state, had those who received
                    payment from him sign <hi rend="i">official State of Indiana receipts.</hi> This is a shock to the
                    researcher examining the records, since at first glance it appears that Fleming was using state
                    funds to pay off party debts. More probably, however, most of these bills were presented to him
                    while he was at his desk in the capitol; thus, he merely reached for the receipt blanks which were
                    closest at hand and in generous supply. After all, a receipt was still a receipt regardless of the
                    printed heading. The openness and extensiveness with which he followed this procedure make it
                    difficult to attribute to it any corrupt implication. One shudders to think of the deluge of charges
                    of corruption which would overwhelm a state treasurer today if an opposition newspaper uncovered
                    such a practice.</p>

            <p>State Treasurer Fleming succeeded in paying so many miscellaneous bills that his account shows the
                    central committee owed him $2,770.74 even after deducting his $2,000
                    assessment. Fleming's vouchers covered charges for: benches and chairs freighted to the
                    Wigwam for rallys; postal paper-wrappers and postage; Glee Club transportation; shirts, belts, and
                    campaign suits; fife and drum corps; county chairmen's campaign expenses; telegrams; the
                    varied services of the publisher of the <hi rend="i">Deutsch Amerikaner;</hi> and finally the cost
                    of a special train to transport Franz Sigel around the state on a speaking tour. The scope and
                    variety of these expenditures suggests that, although T. W. Woolen was treasurer of the central
                    committee, Fleming was the premier paymaster and bursar for many of the routine expenses.</p>
            <p>The bulk of expenditures which accounting purists might classify as administrative was handled
                    through the office of Chairman English. In addition to the office rent (approximately
                    $1,400 for four months), the salary for secretary and assistant ($360), and
                    poll books ($467.90), four bills for general office supplies and printed circulars
                    totaling $442.30 were recorded.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Considerable attention to the
                    problems of uniforms and badges for party workers on parade was given by both the national and state
                    committees. In August, 1880 Barnum dispatched two detailed letters to English describing the items
                    of clothing which his subcommittee had recommended to be worn by Democrats on parade in all regions;
                    he also suggested the proper process of selection and the prices to be paid for these articles. This
                    decision was based on a desire to benefit from the price reductions possible with large orders
                    (85¢ was to be the total cost per outfit) and also to make the uniforms "uniform
                        everywhere."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> This <placeName>

            <p>Telegraph and express charges were other significant administrative expenses of the central
                    committee. Fortunately for Chairman English his cousins James 0. and Norvil Green were prominent
                    executive officers in the International Ocean and Western Union Telegraph companies. These obliging
                    relatives, upon hearing of his nomination for vice-president, promptly sent him
                    "franks" enabling him to send messages over the lines of these organizations free
                    of charge for six months.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> This bonanza undoubtedly reduced the total of all
                    telegraph bills, but the records of the committee include a thirteen-page itemized list of telegraph
                    messages covering the two months from September 4 to November 4, 1880 for a total of
                    $439.03. The records of express charges are incomplete, but apparently three different
                    companies shared in the bundle business of the central committee. Adams Express Company was employed

                    </placeName>, with charges varying from 50¢ to $5 per shipment. The services
                    of the American Express Company were engaged for the distribution of packages to more distant points
                    throughout the state at costs running from $5 to $12 each, while the <placeName>

            <p>Although the over-all assumption of Chairman English was that there were more Democratic than
                    Republican voters in Indiana in 1880, he was well aware of the necessity of reassuring the faithful
                    by the printed and spoken word. The former is clearly demonstrated by the variety, volume, and
                    incessant use of newspaper facilities to carry the message of the Democracy to the people. Extensive

                    Storey's belief that the southern wing of the Democratic party would overwhelm the northern
                    and western leaders if the party ever achieved national power. Doolittle, recalling that Storey had
                    changed his tune after being helped financially during the 1876 campaign by Tilden money, asked the
                    vice-presidential nominee to explore the possibility of a similar largess to Storey by English or

            <p>Since the debacle of the <hi rend="i">Literary Digest's</hi> presidential poll in 1936,
                    remarkable progress has been made by both commercial and academic analysts in evaluating the factors
                    which influence public preferences for consumer goods or candidates for office. In the realm of
                    political behavior, teams of scholarly interviewers have established a close correlation between
                    "interest or a sense of involvement" and political action. They have demonstrated
                    that the hard core of both parties is not influenced by the course of the campaign. They have also
                    made clear that many of those who at first are little interested in the issues, programs, and
                    promises usually become concerned in the last days of the contest with the outcome and proceed to
                    vote. Today political parties pour massive sums and energy into political speaking campaigns,

            <p>But the only machinery for evaluating political behavior known to exist fourscore years ago was the
                    hierarchy of party workers. On the lowest levels, their reports of voter interest and reaction
                    served as a guide to political techniques. The size of crowds at parades and speeches was considered
                    an indication of the voters' intentions although such turnouts may have reflected only
                    curiosity. The basic problems of survival in the 1880's were uncomplicated and revolved
                    around questions of public policy much simpler than those confronting voters in the twentieth
                    century. In addition, it should be recalled that the Australian ballot had not yet been adopted and
                    that the "channels of communication" from party to people were sharply limited to
                    printed and spoken words.</p>
            <p>Regardless of how sophisticated moderns may evaluate the effectiveness of campaign speeches, a
                    hurried glance at the extensive data in the records of the Indiana Democratic central committee and
                    at the frantic correspondence between Chairman English and a multitude of prospective speakers
                    reveals that the leaders of the Indiana Democracy regarded the spoken word as the number-one weapon
                    in beating back the Republican challenge. The two months after the adjournment of the <placeName>

                    numerous distinguished speakers for a concentrated campaign of near saturation beginning during the
                    last weeks in August. The theory seemed to be that if the party kept all Democrats busy listening to
                    its speakers, they would not have time or opportunity to listen to the opposition!</p>

                    their demonstrated capacity to influence independents made them appear indispensable. There must
                    have been considerable uproar, however, in the ranks of the Indiana central committee when it became
                    known that the national committee was paying Julian $1,500 plus most of his expenses for
                    two and one-half months of work.</p>
            <p>The considerable reliance of Chairman English on national headquarters for financial assistance and
                    guidance in putting together this "maximum effort" speaking campaign is attested
                    to by seven letters from General Hancock<hi rend="sup">71</hi> and ten letters from Chairman Barnum
                    in the English Papers.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> These letters were written largely in August and the
                    first two weeks of September, 1880. The majority of General Hancock's communications were
                    written in his own hand. Contrary to traditional political mythology, they reveal the keen mind of a
                    decisive and shrewd political operator. In nearly every one of these missives the general's
                    opening sentence attempted to reassure Chairman English that all responsible leaders in <placeName>

                    </placeName> were aware of Indiana's crucial importance for national Democratic victory and
                    were working full time to achieve that objective. English was probably asking for money in addition
                    to advice, literature, and speakers; but, on his requests for financial help, he received only
                    generalized assurance from <placeName>

            <p>Early in August, 1880 English had asked the national committee to provide him with thirteen speakers
                    from thirteen different states to speak in the thirteen congressional districts of Indiana. <placeName>

            <p>Four of the letters addressed by Barnum to English during the planning period for the speaking

                    gentleman's cash income since leaving Congress had been meagre, and his very limited
                    personal estate had declined through unfortunate loans and other financial difficulties. During the
                    war and early Reconstruction Julian had been a snarling, opinionated, dedicated supporter of
                    antislavery movements and leaders; but he could not support the Stalwart Republicanism of Grant,
                    Conkling, Cameron, and company. On August 26, 1876 in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> he had made a powerful speech, "The Gospel of Reform," which gave the
                    Tilden campaign a tremendous lift in Indiana and throughout the country.<hi rend="sup">76</hi> Over
                    two million copies of this speech, printed by the national committee at the direction of Abram S.
                    Hewitt, had been distributed widely.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> Although Julian had been a leading
                    Liberal Republican in 1872 and a belated but enthusiastic supporter of Tilden in 1876, he had never
                    affiliated himself openly and fully with the Democracy. Instead, he was an independent reformer with
                    a conscience and a reputation for sincerity.</p>
            <p>Barnum explained, one might even say apologized, to English for signing up Julian. He confessed that
                    he "did not like his [Julian's] stile [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] &amp; way but
                    under all circumstances I have concluded we had better shut our eyes &amp; swallow him

                    by saying that <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Although the speaking campaign was their major effort, Chairman English and his central committee did
                    not neglect other possibilities for increasing the Democratic vote in 1880. The special attention

            <p>Very early in the campaign English was faced with the age-old question about the proper treatment of
                    special interest groups, which, although limited in numbers and not genuine segments of the party,
                    might be the balance of power in a close election. Organized labor, a new and somewhat controversial
                    element on the political scene, soon attempted to project itself into the Indiana campaign.

            <p>Twentieth-century registration and voting legislation plus widespread use of voting machines may have
                    greatly reduced the threat of fraudulent voting. In 1880, however, neither of the major parties in
                    Indiana could relax its vigilance but was forced to watch the opposition continuously to ferret out
                    and, if possible, forestall schemes for ringers, repeat voting, fraudulent voting lists, and
                    manipulation during the counting of ballots. The closeness of the party totals in Indiana elections
                    was an open invitation to smart political operators to practice their tricks. Tilden had carried
                    Indiana in 1876 by about five thousand votes and the Democrats had won the state elections of 1878
                    by about fourteen thousand. Thus the importation of new voters, the rigging of election lists, and
                    the hiring of repeating voters, if practiced judiciously and strategically, might overcome this
                    narrow margin of Democratic strength—unless the Democrats either stopped such activities
                    by the opposition or adopted similar ones of their own.</p>
            <p>Very early in the campaign Indiana Democrats were put on their guard by a letter to Chairman English
                    from Judge W. B. Beach. This <placeName>

            <p>Echoes of this threat were repeated by other correspondents. Chairman Barnum, for example, revealed

                    personal descriptions, including pockmarks on their faces, supplied. Barnum was sufficiently
                    impressed with the threat to pay the expenses of the detective who had been tracking these men so
                    that he could follow and watch them in the Hoosier State. Finally, on August 24 Blanton Duncan, that
                    perennially suspicious gadfly, called Chairman English's attention to the national club

            <p>The state election of 1880 was the last one held in October in Indiana. In fact, until early that
                    year it was thought that recent legislation and constitutional amendments combining the state and
                    national elections in November had already eliminated separate state contests. A state supreme court
                    decision, however, temporarily reinstated the usual election date.<hi rend="sup">96</hi> This meant
                    both parties had to engage in strenuous electioneering somewhat earlier than they had planned.
                    Originally the Democrats had hoped to begin in mid-August with major speeches by the two
                    distinguished independents, Doolittle and Julian.<hi rend="sup">97</hi> Doolittle did give a fine

                    but Chairman English refused to use any of the state committee's funds for Julian. So the
                    celebrated reformer merely refused to say a word on a public platform until arrangements were
                    completed for the national committee to pay his fee and some of his expenses. Thus, on the very hot
                    evening of August 24, Julian's opening blast was delivered at the Wigwam in <placeName>

            <p>Any dissident party worker who might have grumbled at the fancy fee for George Julian's
                    speeches in Indiana and elsewhere would surely have changed his tune if he had had an opportunity to
                    read the October 14, 1880 entry in Julian's journal. Here Julian described his continuous
                    speaking tour of nearly all the major population centers of the state. During that tour, which began

                    lost to the Democrats anyway. The serious divisions in the party leadership, the skillful attention
                    showered on both labor groups and Greenbackers by the Republicans, and the Democrats' lack

            <p>The Democrats were defeated in the October state elections by pluralities varying from forty-seven
                    hundred to seven thousand for the various candidates on the state ticket. George W. Julian wrote in
                    his journal that he was "perfectly stunned &amp; dumbfounded with disappointment.
                    Universal gloom among democrats succeeded universal joy &amp; exultant

                    causes of the defeat by commenting that <quote rend="blockquote">

                    Republicans, having found a winning formula in Indiana, continued to beat the drum on the tariff
                    issue. In November, <placeName>

                    his popular vote was only eight thousand less than that of Garfield. This figure was the approximate
                    margin of the Garfield victory in Indiana. Once again the Democrats were denied the White House,
                    apparently not because of their program and principles but because of their tactical rigidity and
                    inability to unite in the common cause. In no state was this more dramatically illustrated than in
                    Indiana, where the varied political segments were not fused into a common mold. As might be
                    expected, Chairman English was selected as the whipping-boy for the defeat in Indiana. Sixteen

            <p>It is difficult to agree with Senator Voorhees' blanket endorsement of William H.
                    English's contribution to the 1880 campaign in Indiana. Undoubtedly mistakes were made and
                    opportunities missed, but the detailed survey of the operation of English and his central committee
                    contained in this study suggests that a final answer about the reasons for the Democratic defeat in
                    Indiana is not to be found in the devil theory of history. English had been absent from the firing
                    line of political conflict for two decades. Like many other Democratic public figures such as Samuel
                    J. Tilden, who had reached political maturity in the prewar years, he absorbed the political,
                    social, and constitutional views of that era. These were a blend of Jeffersonianism, Jacksonianism,
                    Southernism, states' rights, regionalism, and decentralization. The Civil War not only
                    destroyed the federal union as a concept and made obsolete many earlier political and constitutional
                    traditions and values, but it also set in motion a myriad of "national" trends and
                    goals. New economic policies and questions, great population expansion and diversity, and
                    technological changes in the economic bases of society emerged when William H. English was on the
                    political side <list type="footnotes">

                    patterns of American life through his service as a banker, but his political education had not kept
                    pace with the implications of these changes for electioneering. All this was known when he was
                    nominated for the national ticket and elected as chairman of the state central committee. Because of
                    his national eminence, extensive eastern contacts, and fat pocketbook he was considered the
                    appropriate man to run the canvass. The fact that he ran an old-fashioned campaign should not have
                    surprised anyone. Nor can he be criticized for not listening to the new voices in the party. He was,
                    after all, a Bourbon holding the fort in a region being subjected to dynamic upheaval. His political
                    arena was a dichotomy of conflicting needs and aspirations. As such, the Indiana Democracy was a
                    perfect illustration of the party's contradictory weaknesses on the national scene in
                1880.</p>

                    more important, than they are now. Some may already be looking back nostalgically to days when the
                    steam locomotive and sleek diesel were dramatic symbols of commercial progress, or when a train ride
                    was the standard means for making a trip to <placeName>

                    certainly it is one falling near the close of a long and fascinating story.</p>
            <p>The phases of Indiana's 130 years of railroad history can be capsuled into a few simple
                    statements. From the late 1820's until around 1850 there was much <hi rend="i">talking</hi>
                    but not much <hi rend="i">building</hi>. From 1850 to the early 1870's the basic network
                    was established, very much along the lines projected by the earliest promoters. During the latter
                    decades of the past century, consolidation of major lines took place, and many branch and feeder
                    lines were built to supplement the basic network. Since World War I consolidation has continued
                    while the network has retrenched due to competition from other forms of transportation. With minor
                    modifications, this summary might be applied to the history of railroads in most of the states

            <p>The present study is concerned primarily with railroad developments in the state of Indiana during
                    the period 1850–1855 when, after a somewhat lengthy prelude, the rail network of the
                    state finally began to take shape. In a sense this presentation is a "progress
                    report" on a more ambitious research project designed to encompass the story of
                    Indiana's railroads from their origins to their current operations. Because of the
                    abbreviated scope of this report, developments preceding and following the first half decade of the
                    1850's have been dealt with in a cursory manner only; and although a judicious effort has
                    been made to base conclusions on defensible data, this study must naturally suffer from a lack of
                    perspective because of incompleted research. It is hoped, nevertheless, that what is presented here
                    will serve as a sample of the kind of study that railroad history in the state and nation gives rise
                    to and, in fact, demands.</p>
            <p>The decade of the 1850's began with little actual railroad construction accomplished in

                    fragmentary lines, prompted largely by local interests, did make some sense when plotted on a

                    125 years ago, should have been connected. In fact, some of the routes were of such intrinsic
                    importance that companies to construct railroads over them were authorized again and again after

                    stage, but it is likely that at one time or another through the thirties and forties almost every
                    settlement in the state at least dreamed of an all-important rail connection.</p>
            <p>Stripped of certain emotional overtones which accompanied the formation of the early railroad
                    projects, the problem the planners and promoters tried to solve with their schemes was an economic
                    one. Paraphrased in a single word, it was <hi rend="i">markets.</hi> They wanted means to dispose of
                    their surplus commodities and facilities to obtain products their own economy was not advanced
                    enough to provide. In simplest terms, this meant they must somehow attach their locality to a point
                    or points where the advantageous exchange could take place. When the railroad fever first hit the
                    Hoosier State, waterways were the accepted mode of transporting bulky materials over long distances.
                    The initial purpose of the railroad was to supplement the waterway system.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
                    Since the state's population was weighted toward the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>,<hi rend="sup">12</hi> towns along its banks had a strong priority as terminals for the earliest
                    chartered roads. Of the hundred or so authorized before 1850, twenty-five were to have points on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> as one of their terminals. Almost this many more were to touch the <placeName>

                    natural waterway supplied by the Great Lakes. A few of the more ambitious routes, most notably the

            <p>If it had not been for the establishment of the state's capital near the geographic center

                    have prevailed somewhat longer. The location of the capital town itself came to be an important

                    Indiana's history.</p>
            <p>By the close of the 1840's Indiana was recognized as a valuable hinterland for any
                    established marketing center which could arrange to tap it. The larger <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> towns, and some of the not-so-large ones, early visualized themselves in this
                    highly profitable role. Promoters in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>

                    Ultimately, however, it was larger, out-of-state cities which exerted the real gravitational pull: <placeName>

                    early railroad promoters that anything they might accomplish would eventually fall as gain to
                    commercial interests in distant cities, but there is little to indicate that by the early
                    1850's they were seriously disturbed about it.</p>
            <p>Although there was no sharp break between rail developments of the late 1840's and those of
                    the beginning 1850's, the new decade did promise certain advantages over the previous
                    period. The state had gotten over most of the financial shock resulting from the internal

            <p>No systematic study has yet been made of the eighteen completed roads' financial statements,

                    $21,000,000—roughly twice the estimated cost of the whole projected internal

                    $150,000 to more than $1,000,000.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Since the charters
                    governing the roads constructed in the 1850–1855 period had been issued some years
                    before, when practical information on costs was unavailable, the capitalizations specified in these
                    charters obviously were little more than guesses. On the other hand, increases in capitalization
                    were apparently obtained with ease.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> From evidence thus far studied, it appears
                    that the capital to be raised by selling stock in a new company was intended to cover about 50 per
                    cent of the railroad's total cost. The other half was to be procured from the sale of
                    bonds, frequently with an interest rate as high as 10 per cent.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                    region of the state decided that they should have a railroad. A mass meeting was then held in a

                    area were designated officers of the company, and an application for a charter was forwarded to the
                    state government. The charter, running anywhere from a few summary statements to several dozen
                    paragraphs, included information <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Once the charter was approved, solicitation began for the sale of stock. This was one of the crucial
                    phases in the destiny of the new company, for if officials failed to sell enough initial stock to
                    build up momentum for their enterprise, the venture halted right there. A strong appeal was made to
                    residents at all points along the proposed line to purchase or to make pledges for stock. In
                    exchange for stock certificates the buyer might give cash, real estate, equipment of various sorts,
                    or his promise to contribute so many days labor. When enough stock was thus distributed to indicate
                    to officials that the project was likely to succeed, the president and his agents began their
                    campaign to sell bonds to larger investors, usually at an attractive discount, and a man was
                    selected to supervise the engineering. Hereafter the president spent much of his time in eastern
                    commercial capitals peddling bonds and seeking bargains on rails and other needed equipment. This
                    was another crucial point in the affairs of the project. If times were good and the president could
                    make a convincing case for his railroad, money from the sale of bonds poured in and the road was
                    brought to completion with a minimum of delay; if times were bad and money tight, the project slowed
                    up or was indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>The eighty-four-mile Bellefontaine line (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> to Union) may serve as an example of railroad financing in the 1850's.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> The road's 1848 charter authorized a capitalization of
                    $1,000,000 with a stipulation that this amount might be increased at the pleasure of the
                    company. The line was completed early in 1853 at a reported cost of about $1,300,000. A
                    little over half of this initial indebtedness was in the form of stock; the remainder was divided
                    between 7 per cent foreign bonds and 10 per cent domestic bonds. During its first six months of
                    operation (July-December, 1853), the Bellefontaine had gross earnings of $118,000. Almost
                    $40,000 of this amount went for running expenses, $27,000 for paying interest
                    on bonds, and $31,000 for paying 4 per cent dividends <list type="footnotes">

                    as "surplus." Since the Bellefontaine's connections were excellent,
                    earnings could be expected to increase dramatically within the next few years. In the case of other
                    roads not so favorably located, the margin of surplus profits left little for maintenance,
                    improvements, and removal of bonded indebtedness.</p>
            <p>Income for the completed or partially completed roads consisted of receipts from the transport of
                    passengers, freight, mail, and baggage.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> To encourage further investment in
                    their enterprises, officials of some companies regularly publicized their income figures. When
                    viewed cautiously, such data does give some insight into the roads' financial condition
                    during their first months of operation. Company reports show that when completed between terminal
                    points the Peru and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    during the first full year of operation; the Lawrenceburgh company, for example, in March of 1855
                    reported monthly receipts of $33,275—25 per cent greater than those reported

                    the so-called "surplus" accrued during the first months' service.
                    Dividends of 4 to 6 per cent were usually granted in the form of bonds or additional stock in the

            <p>Approximately half of the gross receipts of most early Indiana railroads came from the transport of

                    considerable data exists about the types and quantities of freight carried on several of the roads.
                    During the months when a road was running only to the nearest town to which track had been laid
                    down, the usual pattern was a flow of farm commodities from the smaller terminal to the larger and a
                    simultaneous flow of finished goods from the larger to the smaller. For example, during a three

            <p>Initial rolling stock for the railroads was procured by officials of the companies soon after

                    was supplied. The capacity was about fifty. Since most trains usually carried only a few passenger
                    cars on a regular run, many travelers were obliged to take seats on other cars.<hi rend="sup">70</hi> Boxcars and platform cars, which made up the bulk of the rolling stock for most of the

            <p>By 1855 most completed roads had telegraph service extended along their routes, but it is not clear
                    from available reports just what this facility contributed to the operation of the railroads.<hi rend="sup">72</hi> Most companies also were granted contracts for carrying mail over the area of
                    their routes.<hi rend="sup">73</hi> Although mail was thus speeded to distant points, postal service
                    to smaller communities which had been regular stops on stage lines was sometimes slowed.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> Express service, operated principally by the Adams Company, became an
                    important adjunct of the railroads. Express cars were included in some of the larger trains, and the
                    company's agents were kept busy transferring more valuable freight at important
                        junctions.<hi rend="sup">75</hi>

            <p>Confining the account of railroad developments to a description of track laying and scheduled train

                    immeasurably more important than what is visible; for example, <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-058-3-057"/> the number of railroad proposals of the early 1850's
                    almost defies enumeration. Distinguishing between projects which were more and those which were less
                    serious in intent requires the utmost vigilance from the later investigator. Just about everybody
                    wanted to build railroads whether the building made sense or not. "There seems to be a kind
                    of Railroad mania abroad," remarked the editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> in
                    the spring of 1853. "In almost every newspaper within our own and adjoining States, we find
                    some new Road projected. The last one is from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>! There are at least a dozen talked of from the Atlantic to the Pacific."<hi rend="sup">76</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As yet no attempt has been made in the present study to determine precisely how many separate
                    companies were chartered in the 1850's to build railroads in Indiana, but a day by day
                    survey of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Journal</hi> reveals scores of newly projected roads. A
                    conservative estimate of their proposed mileage would be over thirty-five hundred—more
                    than double the amount of track laid during the 1850–1855 period. The peak of railroad
                    optimism and agitation was reached in 1853; during this year alone at least twenty-five new roads,
                    with a total distance of over seventeen hundred miles, occasioned some degree of discussion or
                        action.<hi rend="sup">77</hi> If all the railroads created on paper had materialized, the cost
                    for the times would have been astronomical. The more seriousminded planners, faced with the
                    prospects of a tightening money market, began to realize this, and there was a sharp decline in new
                    proposals during the latter months of 1854 and on into 1855. "Railroad talk"
                    certainly continued, but it came to center upon a few favored projects, most notably the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> Straight Line Railroad, promoted as Indiana's link in the vital transportation
                    chain binding the South to the Union.<hi rend="sup">78</hi>

            <p>A report of this limited scope is likely to raise far more questions than it

                    personally from their promotional efforts? What was the relation between railroad building and
                    politics? Did the state government through its legislation aid and abet worthless schemes, or did it
                    maintain an official neutrality which encouraged restraint? What influence did local legislators and
                    lobbyists have in procuring elastic charters and other favored treatment for their projects? To what
                    degree did the rail pattern as it was being established in the 1850's determine the
                    population distribution in the state? How much was the growing urban rivalry a cause and how much an
                    effect of the creation of Indiana's railroads? What role did the land speculator and his
                    "paper towns" play in these developments? Were the farmer and other small
                    investors actually victimized when their devaluated stock slipped from their hands? By what
                    intricate processes of higher finance was local control of these railroads eventually removed? Were
                    investors in eastern cities who accumulated Indiana railroad securities at a bargain price taking
                    undue advantage of western naivete? To what extent, if any, was railroad building in Indiana one

            <p>Answers to these and other basic questions will require not only mountains of factual material but
                    also a genuine insight into the economic and cultural conditions which governed this period of a
                    hundred years ago. That the project may be beyond the time and physical capabilities of an
                    individual scholar is already apparent. But, by the grace of Clio, the project will be continued,
                    and with a demonstration of that same perseverance which characterized some of the pioneer railroad
                    builders, Indiana's railroad story will eventually be told.</p>

                    Christ) to originate by action within the ecclesiastical structure of the denomination. Known as
                    North Western Christian University for many years, it came into existence through the concerted
                    effort of the Christian churches of Indiana. This religious body was fairly well established in the
                    state by 1847, when the idea of a college was conceived. If the only known printed statistics are
                    correct, there were some 300 churches with 19,914 members at the time. A church publication lists
                    130 preachers, but most of these were preaching laymen and not settled pastors.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

               </placeName>, in 1832, it was natural that these two
                    "frontier" religious bodies should join forces in Indiana. Stone's
                    followers were called Christians and their churches, Christian churches. Campbell's
                    followers were called Reformers and Disciples. The name "Disciples of Christ" was

                    K. Harris acted as secretary. The meeting was of little importance except as the first meeting of
                    its kind among Indiana Christian church members. Minutes of the meeting were sent to Alexander

                    statistics. Several recommendations were passed at this meeting, but they were in no way considered
                    to be binding on the congregations. Similar meetings were subsequently held annually and became
                    known as state meetings, though occasionally they were called conventions. The Indiana Christian
                    Home Missionary Society was formed in 1849 with organizational machinery working within the
                    framework of a constitution. Because of the fear of ecclesiasticism on the part of many, the
                    missionary society was suspended in 1853. The society's supporters agreed to this action on
                    the basis that the state meetings would assume more responsibility and organize with a board of
                        officers.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

                    were organized and maintained on the initiative of persons who were members of the Christian church.
                    These were privately owned and operated, but because the leadership centered around strong Christian
                    church personalities the brethren had a tendency to look upon them as their own. Among these schools

                    Indiana was still ahead of other states in this respect. Numerically, the Christian church was
                    second only to the Methodist church and was represented by an unusually large number of religious
                    periodicals. In spite of this fact, there was no institution of higher learning on the college

            <p>Certain citizens in Lawrence County appear to have been the first to propose that the denomination be
                    responsible for establishing a school of higher learning. According to available sources of
                    information, some time in the summer of 1847, Elijah Goodwin and James M. Mathes, then co-editors of
                    the <hi rend="i">Christian Record,</hi> held a preaching mission at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the conclusion of their engagement they were approached by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Short and W. Malot (sometimes spelled Mallott or Mallat) of that community with a
                    proposal concerning establishing a college under the auspices of the Christian church denomination.
                    It seems that prior to this time Lawrence County citizens had raised $10,000 in
                    subscriptions to found a church college and preferred it to be under the patronage of the Christian
                    church. Goodwin and Mathes were impressed with the proposition, and after talking it over they
                    promised to publicize the matter in forthcoming issues of the <hi rend="i">Christian Record</hi> and
                    present it at the next state meeting to be held at <placeName>

                    bad faith. A resolution for the consideration of the convention was appended: "<hi rend="i">Resolved,</hi> That it is the opinion of this meeting, that the committee should be severely
                    censured for refusing to locate after undertaking to do so; and we do hereby, before God, and the
                    world, wash our hands from all participation in, or approbation of their acts."<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Thus the college proposal confronted its first big obstacle at this meeting. Fortunately, the report
                    of the special committee was supported by George Campbell, John Bowman <list type="footnotes">

                    for its location, that competent brethren visit each church to lay the circular before the members

                    circular letter, similar in form to circular letters traditionally sent out from early Baptist
                    association meetings. It explained the circumstances of the college proposal in detail and the
                    difficulties attending the work of the special committee on location and expressed a desire to learn
                    the views of all the brethren in the state on the matter. The circular asked two specific questions:
                    (1) Shall we build a college? (2) Where shall we build it? It further stated that H. St. John Van
                    Dake or other agents would visit within the year and hold a conference on the proposal and that each
                    church was invited to be represented by a letter and a delegate at the next state meeting in the
                    Christian meetinghouse (now Central Christian Church) at <placeName>

            <p>Van Dake declined the position of general agent, so Elijah Goodwin, his alternate, took the field at
                    once in a severe winter campaign. It was fortunate that Goodwin was willing to undertake the
                    canvass. Because of his association with the <hi rend="i">Christian Record,</hi> he was well known
                    throughout the state. In addition, he had held pastorates, organized new congregations, taken part
                    in several public religious debates, and held many evangelistic meetings, though he was then but
                    forty-one years old. The fact that he had worked out a plan for an Indiana Christian Evangelizing
                    Society and had written a constitution for it with the intention of promoting the project at the
                    next state meeting probably played no small part in his willingness to canvass the churches.
                    Regarding this work, Goodwin wrote, "I never stopped for rain, wind, snow, ice or
                    storm." He usually sent circulars in advance of his visits and then preached to the
                    congregation before taking the vote of the members. He claimed he advanced no personal opinion on
                    the college matter until after the vote was taken. A summary of voting results is as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>The basis of voting in the churches was one vote per member, members of these congregations being
                    primarily adults and a few persons under twelve years of age. On October 4, 1849, Goodwin made a

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Six volunteer agents also gave reports which bore "about the same tenor as

            <p>John O'Kane offered a resolution to strike out the two original resolutions of the

                    adopt the Bramwell substitute. To forestall any future criticism and better to indicate state-wide
                    approval, Ovid Butler asked <placeName>

                    breakthrough on the college matter. It meant the end of delay and argument over selection of a

                    authority from the state meeting for implementing this decision, and the emergence of Ovid Butler as

                    God had spared his life to give him an opportunity to engage in other work. It is possible that he
                    considered North Western Christian University to be his special new mission in life. As chairman of
                    the college committee, <placeName>

                    </placeName> drafted what the brethren considered a liberal charter for the new institution. A
                    letter to J. M. Mathes a year later<hi rend="sup">36</hi> indicates that he was thinking in terms of
                    an institution much more extensive than a mere church college. Actually, he objected to locating a
                    Christian college at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bedford</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the basis that it would be limited as a college of the Indiana brethren rather than
                    being "a great North Western institution," as contemplated by the charter.</p>
            <p>The charter, as adopted by the state legislature on January 15, 1850, consisted of eighteen
                        sections.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> In describing this charter in a letter to J. M. Mathes, Ovid
                    Butler declared that it should aid the college committee in discharging the duties assigned to them.
                    The charter, he wrote, proposes the founding and endowing of a univeristy through the
                    instrumentality of a joint-stock company with a capital of not less than $75,000 nor more
                    than $500,000, divided in equal shares of $100 each. One-third of the capital
                    stock, he stated, would be expended on buildings, grounds, and equipment; the remainder would be
                    kept as a permanent fund for endowment. He explained that the subscriber could retain two-thirds of
                    his subscription as a loan and be entitled to interest on the whole subscription in the form of
                    tuition. The charter, he wrote, provided that subscribers would have control of the institution
                    through directors to be chosen by them triennially.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>
            </p>

                    secretary, and two other commissioners, Elijah Goodman and Albert B. Cole. The executive committee
                    was given authority to select and employ agents to sell stock subscriptions. It chose Michael Combs

                    stock subscriptions. It must have been an embarrassing period, for it appears that Ovid Butler was
                    the only commissioner who had sold any subscriptions. In spite of this, the group felt that the
                    future for the university was encouraging. Ovid Butler had been corresponding with Dr. E. Demming,
                    of the Indiana Medical College, about removal of that college to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> under the patronage of North Western Christian University, and he shared these
                    communications with his brethren. According to the comments of Dr. Ryland T. Brown at this meeting,
                    the faculty at Indiana Medical College was favorable to moving the college to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>In the meantime, on recommendation of the commissioners and with the approval of the Indiana
                    Christian Home Missionary Society, J. M. Mathes was encouraged to move his publishing headquarters

                    reputation for wit, and popular with the Indiana brethren as a person and as a preacher. He had

                            character of his talents, consider him abundantly qualified for a solicitor. He is the
                            ardent friend of the University, and is devoted heart and soul to its interests. He will
                            make a strong effort, and we hope a successful effort, in procuring subscriptions of stock
                            to the amount of $75,000. When this is done, the Board will be organized, the

                    wrote in an optimistic vein concerning the future of North Western Christian University. He
                    explained that because of sickness in the family, O'Kane had been confined to his home for
                    some three months, but with the aid of several brethren he had been able to get subscriptions
                    amounting to $43,000 by December, 1851. The editorial also pressed strongly for interest
                    in the school project. Mathes argued that education in Indiana was fast assuming a denominational
                    character. He mentioned <placeName>

                    </placeName> College, which was supported by the Baptist denomination. Other denominational schools
                    cited in the same connection were Asbury University (Methodist) and St. Gabriel's and St.
                    Mary's colleges (Roman Catholic). The article also explained the situation at the state

                    seldom over one hundred students in actual attendance at any one time. Mathes assumed from this data
                    that the trend of higher education in Indiana was primarily denominational in character and seemed a
                    little sorry for the plight of the state university. <list type="footnotes">

                    report. He told of his eighteen months of labor on the field and of some three hundred discourses

                    of days they got around to considering building sites. After checking several possible locations
                    they voted to purchase a twenty-acre tract from Ovid Butler. It was a wooded area just north of the

                    this location advantageous because the buildings, when erected, could be seen by passengers as they
                    passed through the city on two different railway lines. Some board members thought the site was too
                    far from the city, but the majority, being farmers, preferred a site in the open country. It was

                    in need of building designs were reluctant to employ his services. He was desperate for an

            <p>North Western Christian University's building was the first Tinsley designed in America, and
                    it marked this architect's Collegiate Gothic style. It was said to be very similar to the

                    of North Western Christian University. He was also responsible for planning a building for Oskaloosa

                    rented from St. Mary's Church (called St. Mary's Seminary by the Minutes of the

                    pleased to report that three of these students "put on Christ in the institution of

                    to the permanent faculty of the new school. After Streator left, the directors decided to suspend

                    various building contractors gave the directors problems in the early months of 1854. These problems
                    were of small concern, however, compared to those raised by an antagonistic article in the January,

                    unofficially by some of the commissioners who were present at the time, but, under the terms of the
                    charter, the board of commissioners had long since been discharged. The board of directors in 1854
                    was not the same board even though some of the same men made up its membership. It would seem,

                    official "whitewash" of the affair. The unfortunate episide might have ended at

                    strong language but shed little light on the real issue. Ovid Butler, believing his personal
                    reputation to be at stake, wrote an explanatory letter to Editor Mathes, which was also

                    those who corresponded concerning the dispute ever really backed down on the positions they had
                    taken. Campbell did admit, however, that he may have "miscalled the meeting" at

            <p>To understand this unfortunate controversy it must be seen in its total context. It was not an
                    isolated local conflict but one incidental to a larger maneuver of social and political forces
                    within the denomination. The Bethany-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> episode was a vignette reflecting mounting tensions between North and South.</p>
            <p>The religious movement, of which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> was at this time the undisputed leader, had grown far beyond his dreams and
                    expectations. It had become one of the large denominations in America, and there was reason to
                    believe its phenomenal growth would continue. Then the slavery issue, which eventually divided
                    nearly every major Protestant group, began to cast its shadows among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s followers. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who considered the issue primarily political rather than religious and who wished to
                    keep the controversy out of the denomination, wrote very little concerning it prior to 1845. Under
                    pressure to clarify his position, he wrote a series of articles on slavery that year.<hi rend="sup">82</hi> He preferred to be known as antislavery in his opinions; yet being a biblical scholar,
                    he held to the master-servant relationship as he thought it was described in the New Testament. He
                    believed the system should be upheld as long as it was a law of the land. Being a pacifist also, he
                    objected to abolitionists and emancipators alike on the grounds that they advocated force to gain
                    their ends. Most of all, he was opposed to the sectionalism brought on by the slavery issue, which
                    threatened to divide his country and his religious followers. From 1845 on, there was open
                    alienation between <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, jolted him into action again.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> He knew then that there was still
                    more work to be done. The letter informed Campbell of the incorporation of North Western Christian
                    University and innocently inferred that this school would have the patronage of some hundred
                    thousand Christian church members in Indiana, <placeName>

                    </placeName> to make his first tour among the Indiana brethren within five months. In his reply to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s invitation to visit Indiana, which was one of several he had received

                    </placeName> gave as his excuse for never having visited the state that Indiana was celebrated for
                    fevers in the fall and its roads were impassable in the winter, the seasons during which he made his
                    tours. If he really believed this, his decision finally to make a tour of Indiana must have come
                    under strong inner compulsion.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s letter had made this plain enough. He probably made his position even
                    clearer when he gave an impassioned plea for Bethany College at this meeting. An off-the-record
                    policy decision was inevitable. In the best interest of North Western Christian University it was

                    immediately north of the old Bellefontaine Depot in the midst of a handsome grove of trees. The
                    completed wing, the writer stated, was about 100 feet by 103 in dimension, with towers, battlement
                    walls, projecting windows, heavy stone sills, caps and ornaments. The interior was described as
                    having black walnut staircases and massive balustrades. There were four recitation rooms and a room
                    for chapel services or meetings of literary societies. The writer concluded: "It is worth
                    the ride or walk of a mile and a half to look at it, and go through it."</p>
            <p>Although the building was completed on record time, there remained many financial problems which
                    disturbed the directors. Through the columns of the <hi rend="i">Christian Record,</hi> N.W.C.U.
                    stock subscribers were urged time and again to pay their subscriptions for stock they had purchased.
                    Ovid Butler wrote on March 1, 1855 that $6,000 was still due on contracts and that the
                    directors had instructed the treasurer to bring suit against subscribers when he deemed it
                        necessary.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> In this same issue, Mathes declared that the building was
                    finished but not out of debt.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> In a later issue he stated: "We could
                    open next week if the stockholders could pay up their dues, so the directors would have something to
                    pay the Faculty."<hi rend="sup">91</hi> In the fall of 1854, Elijah Goodwin was appointed
                    as agent for the university. He started his work early in 1855 and wrote of making a thorough
                    canvass of Indiana "from <geogName>Lake Michigan</geogName> to the mouth of the <placeName>

                    1856." Because of the shortness of time, and in lieu of a regular academic catalogue, the
                    directors issued a circular, dated November 1, 1855, in which an academic prospectus for
                    1855–1856 was given. According to the circular, the university was to be made up of six
                    schools or general divisions: (1) the English and Normal Schools, (2) the Mathematical School, (3)
                    the Classical School, (4) the School of Natural Science, (5) the School of Intellectual Science and
                    Rhetoric, and (6) the Law School. The moral and religious training of the students was to be
                    provided by daily lectures on such subjects as biblical criticism, natural theology, political
                    economy, and analogy of revealed religion. Degrees for men included bachelor of arts and bachelor of

            <p>Obtaining suitable books, pamphlets, maps, and other materials for use in the study and teaching of
                    Indiana history has long been a serious problem for students and teachers alike. Although the need
                    for such material remains substantial, improvement has been made in recent years in both the
                    quantity and quality of available items. Perhaps a concise statement about where and how materials
                    concerning Indiana history can be obtained will be especially useful to teachers and librarians.
                    This statement, however, principally concerns items suitable for use at the seventh- or eighth-grade
                    level. Both teachers and librarians should be able to obtain significant help, at modest cost, from
                    the following sources:</p>

                    individual teachers is essential to effective teaching of Indiana history. Capable and resourceful
                    teachers and librarians will manage to find a variety of additional books, pamphlets, maps, films,
                    and the like for use in teaching Indiana history as well as relevant material about the local area

                    [Also available from the Indiana Historical Society in a paperbound edition for $3.50.]</head>
            <p>The purpose of this book, as stated in the Introduction, is to substantiate the assertion that
                    "the production of Indiana writers is one of the more significant contributions to American
                    literature made by any state or region." Admittedly, this is not an easy task, not through
                    any lack of Indiana literature, but rather because of the difficulties inherent in both judgment and
                    definition of regional literature. The author, Professor Arthur Shumaker, of DePauw University, has
                    accomplished this aim, certainly, as well as it is likely to be done, and the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau, which published the book, has a volume which may well serve as a guide and model for other
                    alert historical societies to follow. In considering some of the problems which arise from a study
                    of this nature, Professor Shumaker has made some important contributions, it seems to the reviewer,
                    in approach and methodology useful to those who may wish to make similar attempts at writing
                    regional literary history. While he may not have completely solved all problems, he has indicated
                    how such solutions may be approached.</p>
            <p>Indiana seems to have produced more than its share of writers in comparison to other midwestern
                    states. As early as 1827 it was recognized that the Hoosiers were "a scribbling and
                    forthputting people," and literary histories have often tentatively recognized the
                    existence, especially in the early decades of the twentieth century, of a "Hoosier
                    school" of authorship. In analyzing possible causes of this long record of activity,
                    Shumaker suggests, among other reasons, the diversity of Indiana's settlement, its lack of
                    formal educational facilities (leading to folklore and oral traditions of storytelling), its
                    propensity to frontier oratory, and its rural character. It seems certain that there was a
                    recognizable "Hoosier" personality fairly early in the state's history
                    available to writers and sufficiently developed for literary exploitation in a fashion perhaps not
                    true of other states in the traditional Northwest group.</p>
            <p>Next, the author addresses himself to the difficult question: What is an Indiana author? Is he anyone
                    merely born in the state, regardless of other facts about him? Is he anyone who has written about
                    the state, and if so, how much and how well? In nailing down his definition, admittedly a difficult
                    job at best, Professor Shumaker includes in his study those writers who spent most of their lives or
                    their most productive years in Indiana, regardless of their birthplace, and whose <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-058-3-094"/> works show conclusive evidence of influence of the Indiana environment.
                    At the same time he excludes those whose works, in quantity or quality, do not meet normal standards
                    of literary attainment. No one, certainly, could quarrel with these decisions and definitions, which
                    reflect historical honesty and common sense. Thus, from a possible total list of 1,563 writers,
                    Professor Shumaker chooses 142 who, from the beginnings of the state to 1939, may reasonably be
                    called Indiana writers.</p>
            <p>Though under this definition Indiana loses claim to authors of such stature as Theodore Dreiser,
                    David Graham Phillips, E. W. Howe, Joaquin Miller, and Jessamyn West, there are an impressive number
                    of authentic Hoosier writers remaining. Of these Professor Shumaker identifies as
                    "major," Edward Eggleston, Booth Tarkington, Meredith Nicholson, and William
                    Vaughn Moody, reserving George Ade, James Whitcomb Riley, and Kin Hubbard for a separate category of
                    major humorists. In the second flight he places Lew Wallace, Maurice Thompson, Charles Major, George
                    Barr McCutcheon, and Gene Stratton Porter. Few will argue with his choices, though among the minor
                    authors there are some fascinating figures whose lives and works deserve not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>But do these authors, Professor Shumaker asks, constitute a singular "Indiana
                    school" of writers, with enough in common in style, method, and theme to warrant the name?
                    They were not a school, he concludes, in any accepted sense, for they wrote for national rather than
                    regional audiences, quite independently of each other, displaying no identifiable set of beliefs
                    that could be called uniquely regional. Yet at the same time, in their use of Indiana materials and
                    attitudes, and through the common influence on them of the Indiana background, they did share in a
                    broader sense something of an Indiana flavor. A list of typical "Hoosier traits,"
                    similar to the one drawn up by Carl Van Doren (pp. 459–460), who wrestled with the
                    problem of the "Indiana point of view" in one of his studies of the novel, may
                    indicate the key to the answer. The characteristics listed as "Hoosier" are in
                    fact indistinguishable from any other traits usually associated with midwestern small-town and rural
                    nineteenth-century life. It may well be, then, that the indefinable "Indiana
                    quality" one finds in these authors is a sort of concentrated essence of the midwestern
                    personality and temperament as it appeared in small-town and rural life and that the great
                    contribution of the Indiana "school," if such exists, lies in observing and
                    exemplifying these things.</p>
            <p>There is, of course, much more in Professor Shumaker's study than can be discussed in a
                    brief review. The volume is a veritable compendium of information about Indiana literary and
                    cultural history, carefully researched and incisively written. In the field of regional history, it
                    seems to be a major achievement, one from which others interested in similar literary and historical
                    problems may learn much about arrangement and interpretation.</p>

            <p>As the subtitle indicates, this is a source book–more a factual compendium than an
                    interpretative synthesis. Ethnographic data are scant until the Cartier voyages, and thus much of
                    the book is taken up with study of the maps resulting from the exploration of the period.
                    Cartographic analysis is, of course, a necessary first step for the ethnohistorian. An interesting
                    and valuable feature of the book is the inclusion of a large number of maps (or portions of maps),
                    redrawn and compared, showing the cartographic evolution of the coastline and of place-nomenclature.
                    Hoffman relies heavily, as all who use the early maps of this area must, on the works of Biggar and
                    Ganong.</p>
            <p>The areal scope is not so broad as the subtitle indicates. The author quite naturally concentrates on
                    the region of the St. Lawrence River and Gulf because there is little material available for this
                    period about other parts of the Northeast.</p>
            <p>Dr. Hoffman, an anthropologist with the National Science Foundation, wrote his dissertation
                    (University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, 1955) on "The Historical Ethnography of the Micmac of the Sixteenth and
                    Seventeenth Centuries." The present book is a natural outgrowth of this earlier work, and
                    Hoffman mentions the possibility of a companion volume to cover the second half of the sixteenth
                    century. He is also known for his contributions to <hi rend="i">Ethnohistry,</hi> a scholarly
                    journal published at Indiana University.</p>
            <p>The author demonstrates his remarkable interpretative skill especially in the concluding chapters.
                    Perhaps he raises more questions than he answers, but this is as it should be. Many interesting
                    problems are touched upon lightly but not explored, such as the distribution of Eskimos, the
                    identity of the Beothuk, and the fate of the St. Lawrence Iroquois. Surely the last topic will
                    receive thorough treatment in the projected volume covering the period 1550–1600.</p>
            <p>The bibliography and index, so important in a work of this sort, are very full and useful. One can
                    think of a few studies, mostly recent ones, which might have been included in the bibliography but
                    none which is absolutely essential. There are surprisingly few typographical errors for such a
                    detailed work. The reasonable price does not reflect the problems of printing a book so imbued with
                    scholarship.</p>

            <p>John S. Miller's <hi rend="i">The Colonial Image</hi> is another source book of sorts. It is
                    one of a series of six in an <hi rend="i">American Epochs Series</hi> under the general editorship
                    of Frank Freidel. The avowed purpose is to provide <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-058-3-096"/> "a
                    compact library of the original sources which supply historians themselves with their basic
                    material." Despite its ambiguity, this is a noble objective. Apart from Merrill
                    Jensen's monumental <hi rend="i">American Colonial Documents to 1776,</hi> there is no
                    general "readings" coverage accorded the colonial period of American history;
                    Professor Miller's volume could have filled a genuine need.</p>
            <p>The problems facing an editor in this area are indeed formidable. Students are entitled to something
                    more than the familiar yet dull documents; and they are surely entitled to more than selections from
                    familiar (and sometimes dull) colonists. Miller's book is essentially an anthology of
                    colonial literature. In this reviewer's humble opinion the selections will neither satisfy
                    the student of early American literature nor the student of early American history—the
                    omissions are too startling in both fields. This is not to say that <hi rend="i">The Colonial
                    Image</hi> is without merit but rather to suggest that it could have been a much more useful book.</p>
            <p>It begins well. Professor Miller has written a delightful introduction, and he prefaces each
                    selection with a few succinct sentences which establish an approximate context for what follows. His
                    selections are from eyewitnesses and participants in "the colonial experience."
                    Frequently the material is lively and enlightening; there is an immediacy to many of the accounts
                    which make them enormously interesting, apart from their historical significance. But there remains
                    the question of how much light these excerpts shed on American cultural beginnings. The fact is that
                    Professor Miller seems to conceive colonial culture in a very narrow fashion. His anthology bears
                    heavily upon such worthies as William Bradford, John Smith, Thomas Morton, the Winthrops, William
                    Byrd, and Benjamin Franklin. The section on religion finds room for Roger Williams, the Mathers, and
                    Jonathan Edwards. A variety of traveler's accounts is also furnished—from
                    William Byrd, Robert Beverley, Dr. Alexander Hamilton, and (inevitably, I suppose), de
                    Crèvecoeur. These seem well-beaten paths. There is so much more to the colonial image
                    than is suggested by this selection. It would have helped to have material reflecting on the
                    colonial professions—the law, education, the press, and especially colonial drama. What
                    of the colonial historians and politicians? Since so much of colonial literature was <hi rend="i">political</hi> literature, Professor Miller's apparent decision to pass it by seems
                    extraordinary.</p>
            <p>In short, the publisher's claims for this volume seem too ambitious and too extravagant.
                    Professor Miller's selections are a shade too personal and arbitrary to exert the charm his
                    felicitous introduction leads the reader to expect. There are some superb pieces
                    here—such as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s marvelous advice on taking a mistress—but the over-all portrait
                    that emerges is painfully sketchy and lopsided. Colonial culture was the product of an intellectual
                    as well as a physical environment. More attention to the colonists' educational process
                    would have been illuminating. Did the colonists read? What did they read? Did such reading affect
                    their social and political conduct? <hi rend="i">The Colonial Image</hi> is very imperfectly
                    conveyed in the choice of excerpts offered by Professor Miller.</p>
            <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-058-3-097"/>
            <p>In fairness it must be noted that a further volume is announced for this series. To be edited by
                    Adrienne Koch, <hi rend="i">The American Enlightenment</hi> may very well encompass much of the
                    material eschewed by John Miller. But if this should be the case, the general editor should have
                    indicated as much.</p>

            <p>Despite self-imposed limitations, Professor Higginbotham has written a successful book.
                    Intentionally, he has focused on his subject from very close range and, partly as a result,
                    Morgan's background is not always clear. On the other hand, Higginbotham has searched the
                    manuscripts with apparent care; and since he has a sharp eye for intriguing details, a knack for
                    describing complex matters simply, and a fine understanding of how men fought in revolutionary
                    America, the result is a brisk and enlightening study of the burly teamster who won high rank in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName>'s army.</p>
            <p>This eighteenth-century tale of success lends itself to exciting treatment. Morgan, a rough wagon
                    driver in the northern Shenandoah Valley, managed to gain land, slaves, a common-law wife (whom he
                    later married), and the patronage of influential persons in his community. When the Revolution broke
                    out, Morgan, who had served with Braddock in the wilderness, became captain of a Patriot rifle
                    company. He fought at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quebec</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Saratoga and in much of the Southeast and rose to brigadier general in the
                    Continental Army. At Cowpens, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, he achieved a brilliant tactical victory reminiscent of Hannibal's triumph at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannae</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Afterward, wracked with arthritis, he went home, speculated in military certificates,
                    amassed tens of thousands of acres, ran several business enterprises, and lived affluently as one of
                    the most distinguished gentlemen of the Valley. Ardent Federalist and enemy of those who sympathized
                    with the French Revolution, he took up arms in 1794 against back-country people in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> who refused to pay a federal excise tax. In 1797 he began a term in Congress. Five
                    years later he died.</p>
            <p>In describing these events from a narrow perspective, Higginbotham has left important questions
                    unanswered. Since he says little about the grand strategy of the Revolution, one must look elsewhere
                    to understand fully the part that Morgan played. Higginbotham's analysis of revolutionary
                    politics is sketchy and he does not make clear either what Morgan was fighting for or what Morgan
                    thought he was fighting for. The general, he tells us, battled "foremost for ‘my
                    country’" (p. 211). But what did "my country" signify to
                    Daniel Morgan?</p>
            <p>Lastly, Higginbotham does not explain adequately how Morgan learned the art of war. He describes the
                    general as an "uneducated backwoodsman" (p. 93). Yet this description, which fits
                    the stock frontier general of folklore, hardly matches Daniel Morgan. Morgan <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-058-3-098"/> was sufficiently well educated that his letters compare favorably, in
                    quality, with Washington's. Being literate, he could have increased his knowledge of
                    tactics by General Nathanael Greene's method, that is, by reading books. With comrades like <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Greene</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it is unlikely that the hero of Cowpens lacked opportunity to discuss previous wars
                    including, perhaps, the wars of Hannibal. Assuming that he took advantage of either possibility for
                    education, Morgan's accomplishments take on a new aspect and become the work not of natural
                    genius and practical experience only but of these plus a knowledeg of the past.</p>
            <p>The problem of Morgan's education is largely a speculative one; and while Higginbotham does
                    ponder other questions, such as the pros and cons of tactical plans, the forte of his book is not
                    interpretation. It is, rather, the lively, carefully organized presentation of facts. For these
                    facts scholars now re-creating Daniel Morgan's world will be grateful.</p>

            <p>Within recent years American economic development has become a popular research subject. Economists
                    and economic historians have carefully investigated different aspects of the economy in different

                    they both emphasize the part played by state governments in fostering economic development during
                    the early nineteenth century. In <hi rend="i">The Enterprise of a Free People</hi> Nathan Miller,
                    co-winner of the Beveridge Award in 1959, considers how <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> State furthered economic development between 1792 and 1838. In the first place this was
                    done by state financing of the Erie and Champlain canals after private capital failed to provide the
                    necessary funds. Secondly, Miller shows how <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, acting through the Commissioners of the Canal Fund, administered canal income to
                    assist growth and stability in the private sectors of the economy. State aid in building <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> canals and the reduced costs of transportation which followed completion of the Erie
                    Canal are well known, but the author has made a distinguished contribution by showing how surplus
                    revenues from the canals, principally between 1831 and 1837, were diffused through the
                    state's economy.</p>
            <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-058-3-099"/>
            <p>The Commissioners of the Canal Fund found that they had large surplus revenues at their disposal.
                    Since they could not retire canal stock at a favorable price, their only practical alternative was
                    to make deposits and loans to state banks. By depositing hundreds of thousands of dollars in banks,
                    the commissioners, perhaps at first unwittingly, found themselves playing an important part in the
                    state's economic development and stability. For example, a large canal deposit in a
                    particular bank could make more credit available and stimulate business in that locality, while a
                    withdrawal by the commissioners might create a scarcity of funds and bring hard times. Although the
                    commissioners could not always be governed by how their actions might affect the economy, they did
                    take into consideration the economic impact of depositing and withdrawing funds on local
                    communities. Canal deposits became an important influence on the economic life of many localities.</p>

                    lacked capital. With the approval of most citizens, this deterrent to economic development was
                    partially removed or at least mitigated by the state government. When people saw that they could not
                    perform a particular task, they turned to government.</p>
            <p>Miller's book is based on a wide range of primary and secondary sources. He has examined the
                    manuscript materials of both private individuals and state officials, as well as going deeply into
                    government documents and newspapers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Canals and American Economic Development,</hi> edited by Carter Goodrich, deals with two
                    main problems: why and by what means were the pre-Civil War canals built; and what effect did they
                    have on the American economy. Goodrich has written an introduction and conclusion, while the main
                    part of the book has been done by Julius Rubin, H. Jerome Cranmer, and Harvey H. Segal.</p>
            <p>In the first two chapters Julius Rubin discusses the important political decisions associated with
                    building the Erie Canal and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Mainline. These decisions involved government planning and state aid on a large scale.
                    He points out that it was in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> that the first public debate took place between the supporters of canals and railroads.
                    The decision of <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> to build canals over most of the Mainline system was probably a mistake in the long
                    run, but it is easily understood when the strong sentiment for canals during that period is
                    considered. While <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> built their main canals with state aid, Mr. Cranmer shows that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> relied on private enterprise to construct its principal projects, the Morris and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="deu">Delaware</region>
                    </placeName> and Raritan canals. The author quickly punctures the enthusiasm of any modern laissez
                    faire advocates who might cheer this decision when he explains that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>'s decision to rely on private enterprise was not based on any ideological or
                    philosophical objections to state aid. Rather, state help was rejected because of conflicting
                    economic interests which thought they would not get their full benefits from the state-financed
                    enterprises.</p>
            <p>In the last two chapters, Harvey H. Segal shows that there was not one major wave of canal building
                    but three definite cycles of construction between 1815 and 1860. He then evaluates and analyzes <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-058-3-100"/> the investments in canal construction, basing his estimates on
                    new materials, and concludes by showing how canals contributed to economic development in the years
                    before the Civil War. He provides firm substantiation for the general view that by connecting the
                    northern Atlantic Seaboard and the Northwest, canals stimulated and promoted rapid economic growth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Enterprise of a Free People and Canals and American Economic Development</hi> are
                    "must" reading for anyone wanting a better understanding of American economic
                    development in the first half of the nineteenth century. Moreover, these volumes are not just of
                    historical interest; they carry contemporary implications for underdeveloped countries in the
                    mid-twentieth century. Both books are clearly written and purged of excess fat. Here are examples of
                    where writers have given readers the <hi rend="i">results</hi> of their research and not all of the
                    research itself. The authors are careful in drawing conclusions and do not claim more than their
                    evidence warrants.</p>
            <p>Supporters of laissez faire will be disturbed by these books; however, the record is clear that our
                    ancestors relied heavily upon government to foster and promote economic development in the early
                    nineteenth century. Where government could be used to benefit society, American citizens had the
                    good sense to use it as an instrument of economic growth and social betterment. They seldom entered
                    into doctrinaire discussions regarding the right of the state to promote enterprise. Their approach
                    was pragmatic and these studies further substantiate the idea that the growth of government
                    functions and responsibilities in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> has come from needs the people could not supply for themselves rather than from any

            <p>Here, at long last, is a highly reliable biography of James Buchanan by a scholar who thoroughly
                    understands both the man and the nineteenth-century environment in which he operated. So far as this
                    reviewer knows, no significant attempt has been made to narrate and analyze all the events of
                    Buchanan's long and active life since the publication of George T. Curtis'
                    biography in 1883. Since that date not only have Buchanan's <hi rend="i">Works</hi> been
                    published by John Bassett Moore and numerous manuscript collections been opened to scholars, but
                    many portions of the first two-thirds of the nineteenth century have been examined in detail by a
                    succession of able historians—one might cite Roy F. Nichols" works on the
                    Democratic party in the 1850's as an outstanding example.</p>
            <p>Professor Klein makes excellent use of this voluminous literature while basing his work solidly on
                    manuscript sources. Starting with Buchanan's forebears, the author traces the growth and
                    development of the fifteenth president through his early life and, especially, through his early
                    years in <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> politics. He is convinced (and the reviewer heartily agrees) that no one who is not
                    intimately familiar <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-058-3-102"/> with Buchanan's personality and
                    character traits (which developed early) and the nature of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> political environment in which he was "blooded" can possibly
                    understand and evaluate the man. From these early years emerged the attention to detail, cautious
                    conservatism, reverence for property rights, ability to manipulate political fragments to form
                    coalition support, adherence to strict legalism, insistence upon the necessity for party regularity,
                    emphasis on restraint, and the coolly calculating political brain that marked Buchanan's
                    later career. Klein makes crystal clear the logical development of these traits in the first half of
                    his volume, which carries the <placeName>
                        <region type="state">Pennsylvanian</region>
                    </placeName> through his tenure as secretary of state, ending in 1849.</p>
            <p>Giving only brief attention to the intervening years, the author devotes most of the rest of the
                    volume to the period from 1854 to 1861. There will be more dissenting opinions filed on this portion
                    of the work than on the initial part. Defenders of Stephen A. Douglas will not be pleased with
                    Klein's evaluation of the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> troubles and political complications growing out of them will seem to some excessively
                    prosouthern and his treatment of the "Seccession Winter" is more favorable to
                    Buchanan than most. These accounts are heavily documented, but it must be said that consideration of
                    facts presented and perusal of sources cited do not seem to this reviewer to lead inevitably to all
                    of the conclusions reached by Professor Klein. His characterization of Buchanan, however, is that of
                    a man whose every action might have been predicted with considerable accuracy by anyone who knew his
                    personality, character, and political creed. This portion of the book should prove valuable in
                    creating a more honest and less emotional image of Buchanan than previous ones. The author is
                    undoubtedly correct, for instance, in asserting that Lincoln's policy of dealing with
                    secession differed from Buchanan's in no important particulars, and he clearly brings an
                    air of cool reason to the impassioned <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> issue. His observations on the political significance of Sumter to the Republican party
                    have undoubted validity. Well aware of Buchanan's personal and political faults, Klein has
                    produced a biography which is sympathetic but by no means idolatrous.</p>
            <p>One or two minor dissents might be registered. The tendency to cite secondary works as the basis for
                    accounts of congressional activities is surprising in a work so heavily based on primary materials.
                    Also, is it completely correct to say that "antislavery extremists hailed [John] <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a hero" (p. 254) after the Pottawatomie massacre in 1856? And, finally, it
                    is unfortunate that a book of this high quality should not have been subjected to more rigorous
                    proofreading which would have eliminated the numerous minor and inconsequential errors.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless this is an excellent and highly significant volume. It is well written, intensively
                    researched, and the product of careful and mature scholarship. It has been twenty-five years in the
                    making and is worth every day of it.</p>

            <p>Significant political episodes which occurred during the 1850's in which Abraham Lincoln was
                    a conspicuous participant are re-examined in this volume, making more understandable his spectacular
                    advancement to the presidency. The seven separate essays borrow heavily from monographs by the
                    author already published in leading historical magazines.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fehrenbacher's critical review of other writers with whom he has found himself in
                    disagreement has prompted him to divide Lincoln biographers into two schools: the
                    "panegyrists" represented by Josiah G. Holland and Isaac N. Arnold; and the
                    "revisionists" of whom he names Donald W. Riddle and several other prominent
                    historians, among them noted Indiana authors (p. 21).</p>
            <p>Discussing the <placeName>

                    </placeName>-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nbu">Nebraska</region>
                    </placeName> question, Riddle states that Lincoln was not "fighting for a cause"
                    but "to advance his own political standing" (p. 22). Fehrenbacher prefers the
                    middle view between "hero worship and cynicism," recognizing Lincoln's
                    "moral convictions" as well as his practical politics (p. 22).</p>
            <p>Another "revisionist," James G. Randall, was born in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, graduated from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and became a member of its faculty. His reaction to the debates, from the
                    author's viewpoint, discovers no "vital principles" at stake but finds
                    instead an "exciting show" by partisans (p. 109). The widely accepted assertion by
                    another Hoosier, Albert J. Beveridge, that Lincoln's House Divided speech was his paramount
                    move "in the game for the Presidency," is strongly refuted by Fehrenbacher, who
                    can discover no contemporary record confirming it (p. 73). He draws the conclusion that
                    "Beveridge like James G. Randall found his true hero for the 1850's in Stephen A.
                    Douglas" (p. 161).</p>
            <p>The most uncomplimentary criticisms are reserved for <hi rend="i">Herndon's Lincoln,</hi>
                    written by Jesse W. Weik in a room over a grocery store at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greencastle</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, the town where Weik was born. The sources Herndon supplied for Weik are
                    described as having been "distilled from memory and imagination … a kind of
                    retrospective ghost writing" (p. 72). This description is especially applicable to
                    statements about the House Divided speech. Herndon's statements on the "Second <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Freeport</settlement>
                    </placeName> Question" are recorded as "second hand, based on a dubious
                    source" (p. 124).</p>
            <p>The author's criticisms are also directed to a recent contributor, Reinhard H. Luthin. The
                    supposed aloofness of Lincoln towards the founding members of the Republican group, which Luthin
                    supports, is pointed out as another instance of Herndon leading "scholarship
                    astray" (p. 45). Luthin declares that up to 1860, Lincoln "had left no record of
                    achievement, except the quest for office" (p. 161).</p>
            <p>A brief essay in the biographical note states that the "revisionists'"
                    theory about the causes of the Civil War led them to become "to a <pb n="278" id="VAA4025-058-3-104"/> certain extent, anti-Lincoln." They discredited and questioned
                    the soundness of his "anti-slavery stand," qualified his "sympathy for
                    the Negro," placed his "political opportunism" above his
                    "idealism," minimized his reputed "stature" during the
                    1850's and limited his "greatness" to the presidential terms (pp. 169,
                    170). The author has been successful in showing that there were some great moments for Abraham
                    Lincoln, even in the groundwork of the decade preceding his elevation to the nation's
                    highest office.</p>
