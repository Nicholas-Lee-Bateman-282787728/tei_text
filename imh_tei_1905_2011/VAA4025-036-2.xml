            <head>My Indiana Homestead SYMBOL OF AN EPOCH THAT WAS</head>
            <byline>LLOYD MILNER GRAVES</byline>
            <p>It is a white Cape Cod house on a hill, built by my grand-father<hi rend="sup">1</hi> in 1865 when
                    the original home had burned down. It stands a quarter of a mile back from the road, though when it
                    was built—and for thirty years thereafter—it stood on the "old
                    road," once a Shawnee Indian trail.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place was originally settled in the eighteen-thirties by my great-grandfather,<hi rend="sup">3</hi> who came in with his family from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. This state had been his first home west of the mountains and, I believe, the burial
                    place of his first wife. The Indiana home place is a typical corn belt farmstead of the black land
                    section, and its history is the history of rural America of the Middle Country.</p>
            <p>It is now getting on to forty years since my family left the Old Place forever, and, during a solid
                    twenty-year stretch, I never set foot upon it. Yet always, in strange places, I have involuntarily
                    oriented myself with reference to that white-clapboard gable, pointing eastward on the hill. And in
                    later years I have fallen into the habit of visiting the place whenever in that
                    vicinity—though for more than four years now no opportunity has presented itself.</p>
            <p>It was a bright sunny day in the early spring of 1894. Wagons laden with household goods were rolling
                    up to unload, others driving away with the belongings of my aunt and her husband who had been
                    operating the place for some <list type="footnotes">

                    <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-036-2-004"/> years past. My grandmother,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> an energetic
                    and quizzical old lady of sixty-five, three or four years widowed, was busy with her last
                    "redding up," carting out bundles and portmanteaus, throwing featherbeds bodily
                    out of her upstairs bedroom door for the drivers to pick up.</p>
            <p>I went out into the garden to inspect the premises, which I was too young to remember from previous
                    visits. My father<hi rend="sup">5</hi> had now "bought out the other heirs," and
                    was moving back to his boyhood home and to the farm where he had made his first start in business.
                    Thenceforward, over a period of eight years, it was to be my home too; intimately to be known and
                    remembered, in all its physical attributes and its then still living traditions.</p>
            <p>The place was already old in that spring of 1894, legend-encrusted, peopled with the shades of two
                    departed generations—some of whom were merely names, now long forgotten; others there
                    were whose wavering outlines gradually took on form and a vague, though real, substance.</p>
            <p>There was my great-grandfather—a dim figure, of whom the only image which has come down to
                    me is that of an athletic gentleman in early middle life, chasing his fifteen-year old son (my
                    grandfather) with a blacksnake whip. The old boy could still run just a little faster than the
                    youngster, wherefore "at every jump" the lash cracked on some portion of my
                    grandsire's posterior anatomy.</p>
            <p>My grandfather had four or five brothers and sisters, but of his generation I knew but one, his
                    youngest half-brother, old Uncle Bill,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> who was a burly, smiling, blue-eyed
                    Hercules. His mildly profane speech and affectionate manner endeared him to all us children. My
                    grandmother—still very much present in the flesh, though now to live at the new cottage
                    she had built for herself in town—I was to find much addicted to boiling up batches of
                    soap in the big black iron kettle and to spinning tales of an earlier day. There were others:
                    uncles, aunts, cousins, of various degrees removed, in-laws and hangers-on, who wove themselves
                    mistily into the background, imparting the atmosphere of folk-lore and romance.</p>

                    farm up to its full potential, there still remained certain things to be done—things
                    which, under my father's direction and with the aid of active, sturdy hired hands, were
                    promptly consummated.</p>
            <p>Draining of the "Slough," the deep and all but impassable peat bog lying just below
                    the house, was an operation which added twenty or thirty acres of the richest kind of soil, though
                    it ruined the old spring where the rusty tin cup had long hung for the use of the field hands.
                    Clearing of the jack-oak grove that bordered <placeName>
                        <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
                    </placeName>, the far south field, so-called for its inaccessibility and the blackness of its earth;
                    extermination of the ubiquitous rattlesnakes; the addition of various extensions and betterments
                    about the house and farmstead—these were included in the transformation. When all was
                    completed, the place boasted certain advantages, like running water under roof, which few, if any,
                    other farm homes in the neighborhood possessed.</p>
            <p>So was fulfilled the work of development and reclamation, at which three generations, for three score
                    years, had toiled and wrought. A new era was beginning, an old one was closing, for completion,
                    fruition, must ever be realized only in death. The time was, insensibly, infallibly, one of
                    dissolution and tragedy—those years between the panic of 1893 and the turn of the
                    century. Vast, uncomprehended forces of change were, and for more than a decade had been, at work.
                    The old homestead was destined to become an example, a symbol, of their influence. When in the fall
                    of 1902, we moved away from the Old Place for good, the issue had been decided. The things that were
                    past were done. The spirit, the vital essence, that had given to my Indiana homestead character and
                    being, had passed into oblivion, surviving only in the memories of those who had known it best.</p>
            <p>He who stems from such ancestral abode, with its memories and traditions of a century gone, bears
                    forever upon his being the stamp of its molding impress. For these old places are not mere physical
                    properties, belongings, to be bargained and traded upon. They are organic entities, compound of
                    vital substance. They have hearts and souls. They are part, extension, and matrix, of the
                    owner's personality. Created by the efforts of successive occupants, they in turn mold and
                    fix the lives and destinies of their masters. Less <pb n="98" id="VAA4025-036-2-006"/> created,
                    perhaps, than creating, they set up visible boundaries of existence, mark out and define a world.
                    They keep the spirit from wandering out of bounds after unattainable and unknown objectives; prevent
                    its turning inward to feed upon its own frustration and bewilderment. Like the ordered, though
                    fictional, structure of a mystery tale, they furnish a microcosm in which the problems may all be
                    solved, the forces of unreason and disorder put to rout.</p>
            <p>The old homestead, in short, gave to life solidity and permanence, palpable content, and meaning. It
                    bred responsibility, dignity, discipline, and pride of race; lent faith and self-confidence,
                    provided an asylum and comfort of spirit which the homeless, propertyless city dweller of the
                    vaunted twentieth century is hard put to in trying to replace.</p>
            <p>On a cornbelt farm of the strangely misnamed "gay nineties," a young boy found many
                    things to divert and to instruct. In a neighborhood where small children were few and schools were
                    widely scattered, the old farm itself afforded the main facilities for both recreation and
                    education. The broad fields of waving corn were dense, shaded forests in which one played at Indian,
                    the little three-year old sister clinging close to avoid being lost and captured by the enemy.</p>
            <p>Long summer afternoons there were, out in the orchard, seated in the fork of a favorite apple tree,
                    one's pockets filled with fruit of doubtful maturity; or lying (when one was supposed to be
                    hoeing the garden) and looking far out to the southwest where stood—and still
                    stands—a lovely grove, in whose cool depths the dancing shadows played against a
                    background of open fields beyond. Riding the horses in the field, perhaps to fall asleep, and off
                    the horse, into the soft deep soil of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ua">Egypt</country>
                    </placeName>; to be laid in the fence-row and left till the dinner bell rang at noon.</p>
            <p>Winter vied in charm with summer: coasting, skating, bob-sledding, sleigh riding. One cutter ride in
                    particular stands out, impossible to be forgotten. We had been to the Corner,<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    little inland post, with its two stores and barber shop, for the week's groceries. As we
                    left for home, darkness fell. It was warm and cozy, snuggled down in the seat between my parents.
                    Lulled by the smooth flowing motion of the sleigh, the steady jogging of the horse, the singing
                        <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">7</hi> O'dell's Corner, or just Odell, four miles
                            northwest of the Old Place.</item>
               </list>
                    <pb n="99" id="VAA4025-036-2-007"/> of the runners in the crisp snow, I lay in a semi-doze,
                    wishing—half-hoping—the ride would last forever.</p>
            <p>Of all the delights of winter, hauling corn to town with my father was the chief. The wagon loaded
                    early, up to the top of the second pair of sideboards, breakfast finished in the morning twilight,
                    off we would go on the seven-mile trip to town. In severe weather, the driver on such trips always
                    walked most of the way to keep warm. And I, too small to negotiate the rough footing, would sit far
                    up on the high spring seat, my feet numb with cold in their copper-toed leather boots, while my
                    father strode the frozen road beside the swinging team.</p>
            <p>Other, less idyllic, adventures there were: the time I nearly set the barn on fire playing with
                    matches and an old brass lamp dug up from some corner of the carriage house; the night Old Mark,
                    striking flies at the horse trough, knocked me cold when I darted under him after some plaything or
                    other; the time I slipped out into the growing corn with a half-smoked cigar, present of a neighbor
                    boy, and lost all curiosity regarding tobacco for a period of approximately seven years.</p>
            <p>The essentials of substantial education lay ready at hand: the arts and equipment of agriculture, the
                    use of tools, all the treasured lore and associations of the old homestead. When a thriftily growing
                    lad had reached the age of ten, he was looked upon, by common accord, as capable of making something
                    in the way of a field hand. So, with a gentle pair of mares and a light wood-beamed plow with
                    twelve-inch moldboard, I went out to turn soil in "Grandma's Forty."
                    Being still too light to lift the implement in turning, I was allowed to "drag
                    around." Then my father, following with his heavy fourteen-inch, all-steel plow, would
                    square up the corners to leave a smooth job.</p>
            <p>To know the points of a good steer—or shoat or horse—was a basic element of
                    learning. Such things were studied at auction sales and on cattle-buying jaunts with one's
                    father, by which means judgment of weights and market values came gradually to be almost second
                    nature.</p>
            <p>The old woodshed with its great oak bench and tool-chest, left there by my grandfather, was a place
                    for earnest endeavors, whereby, with saw and hatchet, plane and drawing knife, divers instruments
                    for juvenile use were painstakingly <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-036-2-008"/> constructed, complete with
                    arsensals of wooden swords and firearms.</p>
            <p>Thus grew familiar, in some degree mastered, the varied activities of husbandry, tillage, feeding,
                    choring, chief and epitome of which was the cycle of corn: plowing; seed-bed preparation; planting,
                    the trip mechanism of the planter clicking merrily over the burrs of the checkwire; cultivation (I
                    got to use one of the new-fangled riding cultivators); "laying by;" then shucking
                    in the field, leaving the stalks and husks for the cattle to clean up; and finally, in dead of
                    winter, poling-down the bare and frozen stalks, to be raked into windrows, after the spring thaws,
                    and burned, when, on our farm, great care must be exercised to keep from setting the peat-laden soil
                    afire.</p>
            <p>Formal schooling was a matter of some difficulty. The nearest schoolhouse was two miles away, and no
                    one had time to take a small boy back and forth in bad weather. Hence, a few Indian Summer weeks
                    during one fall must serve, perforce, for the first two years of classroom work. My mother,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> however, who had been a school teacher before her marriage, saw me through the
                    first and second readers. I was not greatly impressed with the literary quality of these
                    publications. Far more intriguing, I found the stories heard about the family fireside, especially
                    the gorgeous, glamorous tales that grandmother told—tales of the olden time when she was
                    a buxom girl and my grandfather a sinewy, dark-haired, blue-eyed youth. They dealt fittingly, for
                    the most part, with family tradition involving adventure and exploit. If they were slightly tinged,
                    faintly colored, here and there, with legend or embroidery, that was all quite in order.</p>
            <p>The time my grandmother was stalked by the panther, as she worked one day alone in a distant field

                    anvil on the block" (which meant swinging the hundred pounds or more of cold iron from the
                    ground by one hand gripped upon the tapering horn); the many adventures of my grand-father, who as
                    "champeen wrassler" of his school "deestrict" and star contender
                    at all the athletic conclaves of the countryside, made records to conjure with. There was his famous
                    leap at "the old sod fence," when, alarmed by some mysterious pursuit down the
                    lonely trail one dark night, he had cleared in a mighty bound the invisible, four-foot
                    rampart—vaguely located only by familiar landmarks against the sky—leaving (by
                    measurement next morning) twenty-odd feet between his tracks.</p>

                    Emerging, unexpected and unsuspecting, from the doorway, my granddad swiftly took in the situation,
                    then "dropped his duds," seized the offender bodily, swung him high in the air,
                    and "wrapped him around a sapling" for his astonished friends to cart home.</p>

                    afterwards, the city of Des Moines was laid out. He sold out and returned a year or two later owing
                    to the untimely death of his father. It must have been on a later trip that he performed the
                    ticklish stunt of leading his horse across a high railway trestle over a flooded stream, where the
                    wagon bridge had washed out. The venture was effected without mishap, the little, black mare
                    following along docile as a dog, lifting her feet daintily and putting them down squarely on the
                    crossties, never missing a step.</p>

            <p>Sometime later, "Josey and Lucy<hi rend="sup">10</hi> —to adopt my
                    grand-mother's nomenclature—were married and settled down for their forty years
                    on the Old Place together. They it was who built the property up from its natural state and made of
                    it a substantial homestead. It was, is and will always remain, their place.</p>
            <p>One of her own cherished anecdotes, old Lucy told, a little shyly, but once. It concerned a lass of
                    twenty who, when a certain horseman hove in view one day across the horizon, adroitly got rid of an
                    unwanted suitor, sending him on his way with cockle-burrs under his saddle blanket as a subtle hint
                    that he need not return. It is my understanding that Lucy Kendall had saddled the horse herself and
                    tied him to the hitching post, where his presence could not help being noticed by his owner.</p>
            <p>The life of the old community, in the 'nineties, still flowed for the most part in
                    traditional channels. The towns were only beginning their encroachment. The folkways were not yet
                    entirely uprooted. The center of communal life was still the church: the white-gabled church near
                    "The Mound"<hi rend="sup">11</hi> with its high iron fence, its closely cropped
                    lawns, the rows of stalls for the rigs of parishioners, its spacious, dignified
                    parsonage—and its separate entrances for men and women. Eloquent and able men had
                    preached here, and the influence of their personalities remained upon the community.</p>
            <p>It was the custom, after service, for the congregation to assemble on the brick pavement in front of
                    the church and spend the better part of an hour in the exchange of greetings, news, gossip and
                    Sunday dinner invitations. As in the Europe of a thousand years ago, the church was the main vehicle
                    of a social as well as religious life. Not that the people did not take their religion seriously (at
                    least on Sunday). True devotion was to be found among them, and simple unquestioning faith in the
                    eternal verities was all but universal.</p>
            <p>A quarter of a mile below the church was the Shawnee Mound Hall—a sort of rural
                    "opry house," where came more or less famous lecturers, the Swiss Bell Ringers,

            <p>The old school at The Grove had been (and was—I came to know it too) something more than
                    the little red school house of rural tradition. It carried two or three years beyond the
                    "eight grades," and in certain fields was the full equivalent of the modern high
                    school. Its curriculum centered about mathematics and formal grammar: Ray's <hi rend="i">Third Part Algebra</hi>, and Harvey's <hi rend="i">Advanced Syntax</hi>. There was
                    also a certain emphasis on physiology and geography.</p>

                    activities included singing schools, in which the art of sight reading was imparted, and debating
                    societies where parliamentary procedure was assimilated in a way that made the participants,
                    throughout life, hard to trip up on points of order.</p>
            <p>Interscholastic athletics were, of course, unknown, but there were hard, toughening games and
                    gymnastics. There were hay rides, dancing parties, roller-skating and amateur dramatics, which bred
                    a life-long <hi rend="i">camaraderie</hi> and <hi rend="i">esprit de corps</hi>.</p>

                    class at the Grove. Whether the survivors assembled for the half century celebration in 1930, I do
                    not know. My father was then no longer of their number.</p>

                    days—and in the later 'nineties—the old neighborhood was a world
                    apart. It lived its own life, withdrawn, self-sufficient, isolated from the life of the towns,
                    careless of the distant world of finance and high affairs. The community knew its own leaders, its
                    local celebrities and enterprises, its bickerings, petty jealousies and scandals, for it should be

            <p>The men of the time lived on the soil and were of it. The land they had taken, crude and raw, from
                    their fathers, and they had made it; had, as their substance grew, built for themselves those great
                    square brick and spacious wooden houses, which yet grace the countryside, marking the sites of their
                    pride and power. Wealth they accumulated, not in gold or negotiable securities, but in broad fields,
                    chattels, and well-stored barns. They lived unto themselves, lords of their own domains, and died
                    under their own roofs amid their families and the fruits of their achievements.</p>
            <p>There was more than a flavor of aristocracy about this life. The major families, at the top of the
                    social scale, formed a true gentry. Yet it was an aristocracy of worth and merit. Members of the
                    great families—the Meharrys and McCorkles, the Hawthornes and the Shuhees—held
                    their places (with certain well-noted exceptions) through force of mind and character. Some of them
                    had come of humble origin. Men of mark there were who had risen from the low estate of tenant, farm
                    laborer, or even that of "bound-boy."</p>
            <p>It was a life as nearly free as any that men have known in any land. Opportunity lay open to
                    all—offset by clear responsibilities. The ordered communal framework provided a
                    background and support within which the individual dwelt secure and content; the clear stream of its
                    composite life was an avenue on which his separate bark might move with purpose and direction, which
                    enabled—and almost compelled—the realization of his innate potentialities.</p>
            <p>Here was the essence and foundation of nineteenth century liberal democracy, as some among us can yet
                    recall. Yet it was a restricted liberalism, intolerant to a degree, lacking in rounded intellectual
                    content. It was, in its origins, a folk culture; its values forged in the crucible of folk
                    experience; marked by a certain harshness, earthy, tinged with the vulgar. It lay under the
                    inescapable tyranny of its twin dragons: space and (increasingly, in the latter stages) the market.</p>
            <p>Sheer distance, the baffling, sequestering sense of immeasurable space, hemmed in the Middle Country,
                    cut it off from the outer influences more effectually than oceans or high mountains could have done.
                    The outlook of its people was—in some measure continues—a restricted one,
                    their interests <pb n="105" id="VAA4025-036-2-013"/> narrow and provincial. It was a hard, driving
                    regime. The rich deep soil, with its opulent prospect of wealth and independence, often
                    became—especially as the railways mushroomed and commercialization
                    progressed—a master instead of a servant. It demanded unremitting toil of man, woman, and
                    child; absorbed every vital energy, bent every impulse to its sovereign will, until opportunity was
                    turned to bondage.</p>
            <p>Life was relatively poor in things of the spirit—culture and "the finer
                    things." The mind was little cultivated as an end in itself: the head was made to save the
                    heels. Common sense and shrewdness in trading, or in "sizing up" other people,
                    were the acme of wisdom. Mental attainments were esteemed chiefly in the way of diversion, as
                    something with which to pass the time on rainy days. Here and there, already, young men were going
                    away to college, a daughter of the local gentry to finishing school, but any serious pursuit of
                    knowledge—making a career of it—was considered as something apart, not fully
                    normal. The "life of the spirit" was that which came after death, not to be
                    puzzled over, its true nature having been authoritatively revealed; merely to be accepted as the
                    ultimate foundation of morals and right living.</p>
            <p>It was a robust existence for the strong and the sanguine; its temper realistic, objective, casual
                    almost. It demanded of all that they be attuned, mind and body, to its rigors. None of fragile
                    constitution or introspective temper but found its contours rough. Few inbued with the zeal of art
                    or learning but found its confines barren and repressive.</p>
            <p>But the old order now was failing rapidly. The foundations, day by day, were buckling under it. With
                    the century, it passed—as the landed gentry of England has not yet
                    passed—leaving only its skeletons and its haunting memories. The reason of its passing
                    lay in its own functional ordering, as well as in the changes of the times. It failed, first and
                    foremost, because it lacked constituted guardianship or juridical form. There was none duly
                    appointed to preserve its physical structure or its tradition; no established law of its being to
                    express and perpetuate its inner coherence.</p>
            <p>America early abandoned the rule of primogeniture, harsh but effective measure for the preservation
                    of family estates. Under the rule of equal inheritance, land holdings began quickly to be split up
                    into smaller and smaller parcels. <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-036-2-014"/> Already, the old homestead,
                    as it had come down from my grandfather's hands, had dwindled to less than half its
                    original area. The balance had been alienated, through inheritance and sale, at the hands of
                    second-generation pioneers. With the passing of the frontier in the early nineties, no resource was
                    left for bringing in new land to take care of a rapid natural increase of population. The surplus of
                    tillers must either subdivide further and further the ancestral holdings, or else move out into
                    other occupations.</p>
            <p>The coming of the railroads, of power machinery, and the network of the gravel pikes supplied the
                    answer. The industrial revolution made employment for the surplus youth of the farms, saved American
                    agriculture from declining to a peasant status—and at an ultimate cost which we of this
                    war and postwar era are just beginning to assess. It dried up the inner springs of the old
                    indigenous rural life. The center of interest and attention was shifted to the vast outer world of
                    commerce and industry.</p>
            <p>The old homesteads, left without anchorage, were broken up and, piece by piece, sold off. Under the
                    impact of the new urbanizing influences, conveyed on the new engines of transport and communication,
                    agriculture was absorbed in the machine age, became an adjunct of the great world market which now
                    extended to the tiller's gate. The land became, not the foundation of an enduring mode of
                    life, but a marketable commodity, object of calculating speculations.</p>
            <p>Today when I drive those country roads about The Mound and The Grove, the marks of that revolution
                    are all about. Most of the old names are gone from the mail boxes, though they are on the headstones
                    in the graveyard and on name plates in the foyers of distant city apartmnets. Only now and again I
                    meet some strangely familiar, half-averted face, which might be one of the neighbor boys grown to
                    middle age. Of the old neighborhood institutions, all are gone. The church at The Mound still
                    stands, but no clergyman has dwelt these many years in the parsonage alongside. The Hall has been
                    torn down. The site of the "new schoolhouse" at The Grove—erected after
                    both my father's time and my own schooldays, is now marked only by a careless heap of
                    bricks, while the church has been converted into a garage.</p>
            <p>Life on the Old Place flowed on, in those far-lost years, <pb n="107" id="VAA4025-036-2-015"/> in its
                    ordained channel. The work of reclamation and building was completed, the hardships of the years
                    following the panic of 1893, in which my father was forced to lighten his holdings somewhat, were

                    following a long and wasting illness. My father woke me long before daylight that morning. Sister
                    was dead. After breakfast he got his horse and rode to Newton, about ten miles away, where was the
                    nearest undertaker. On his return in mid-afternoon, when he had taken off his boots and hung his
                    coat in the closet under the stair, my father swayed abruptly to one side, leaned his head against
                    the wall and sobbed aloud. Those were the only tears I ever saw him shed. My mother never recovered
                    from the loss. About her, all around the place, everything spoke of the child that was gone. The old
                    homestead became a prison house, a place of torture.</p>
            <p>At length, a neighbor made what was at the time an attractive offer on the land. My father determined
                    to sell. There was a glorious Indian summer season in that fall of 1902. My father and I drove the
                    country roads, billing our auction sale at which we would offer certain property, "Towit:
                    Items… . Terms… . No property to be removed until… . Auctioneer,
                    Colonel." We tacked up the placards on all handy trees, telephone poles, and bulletin
                    boards; left them in store windows, and on the desk at the postoffice. It was a good sale. My father
                    received many congratulations on the amount and quality of the stuff he had accumulated around him.
                    The net proceeds somewhat more than covered the unpaid balance on the mortgage. That evening we
                    drove to Linden,<hi rend="sup">13</hi> where my grandmother lived, took the train for <placeName>

                    of old Uncle Bill, that youngest brother of my grandfather. This cousin lives today on his big farm
                    just south of the village. His older children have gone, as is the way of country youth in this
                    generation; but he has one son, child of his latter years, who takes to the soil.</p>
            <p>My cousin runs true to the ancestral type. Tall, erect and smiling, impetuous of speech and action,
                    he is the sort of man who in his prime would hold an outlaw mule with bare hands for his reluctant
                    hired men to harness; the kind of man who now, when he runs for county office as a minority party
                    candidate, is assured of election. He is one of that dwindling corps of those who assisted at the
                    closing of the frontier; one of the scattered links connecting the world today with "that
                    proud and boastful democracy" which tamed the prairie. Time was, in the days of the great
                    land boom; when he could have sold his property for enough to have seen him comfortably through his
                    declining years. But too young and optimistic then to retire, he has held on instead to support the
                    farm in his old age, in this era of the fourth generation.</p>
            <p>My Indiana homestead stands peaceful on its quiet hill, looking out across the waving corn. Its
                    roots, its strivings, are in the past. No longer is it the center, originating source, of a
                    self-contained life and enterprise. Engulfed in the vast stream from without, dependent on the
                    bounty of a distant paternalism, it is a chip on the surface of a strange, uncharted sea.</p>
            <p>It is still known through the countryside under my grandfather's name, though the man after
                    whom it is called has been dead for fifty years, and during most of that time the property has been
                    continuously in the hands of another family. The old house still stands, white and square at the
                    crest of the hill. Time has dealt gently with it—a suggestion of sag along the ridgepole,
                    a new dormer here, an added portico there, but the basic identity still unmistakable.</p>
            <p>True, a closer inspection of the premises reveals many changes. Numerous features that lent character
                    and charm have disappeared. Most of the trees are gone, the outbuildings <list type="footnotes">

                    kitchen window yet stands, though sadly marred by some passing storm; and the walnut sapling, which
                    my father planted in his boyhood, has grown to a large tree. But the seedling apple at the driveway
                    gate, the big black cherry row, the cedar by the parlor door, are gone. Gone are my
                    grandmother's flower garden, my grandfather's "new orchard," the
                    great willow hedge behind the barn, and the old summer-kitchen with its morning-glory shaded lattice
                    walk that led to the swinging gate.</p>
            <p>Such landmarks as yet remain serve but to emphasize the fact of mordant change, as in the features of
                    a well remembered face. Yet here is not death. One senses, back of the clear white walls and green
                    cropped grass, an enduring reality, a lingering spirit which defies the powers of time and change,
                    and which shall never die so long as any are left who know its story or are able to interpret its
                    muted whisperings. So we turn and depart, down the lane along the Slough, to the "new
                    gravel road" which the neighbors built forty-five years ago. The old house is left to dream
                    amid the corn, to guard its haunting presences of things which there have been.</p>

            <p>The pro-slavery element in the old Northwest Territory was greatly opposed to such a provision. The
                    feeling grew so strong in many parts of the territory, that prominent men and leaders began in 1796
                    to send petitions to Congress for the repeal of Article VI, and they continued to do so until 1807.
                    One group wished for the repeal in a modified form. They believed that Congress should let slaves
                    enter the territory but permit their children to become free, the males at thirty-one and the
                    females at twenty-eight.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Another group asked for the suspension of Article VI
                    for ten years only, but asked that all slaves and their children who entered the territory should
                    become slaves for the rest of their natural lives.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> This pro-slavery element
                    made use of four legalistic arguments to support their claim: <list type="ordered">

            <p>The pro-slavery faction gave, besides the legalistic arguments, other reasons for the repeal of
                    Article VI. They said that Article VI was contrary not only to the interests but to the very
                    existence of the inhabitants of the Northwest Territory. Laborers could not be procured to assist in
                    cultivating the ground under one dollar per day, exclusive of washing, lodging and boarding.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> The wealthy men claimed that the poor man with his small plot of ground could
                    cultivate it himself, while they had to see their land lie idle. The French settlers had just enough
                    slaves to make the situation tantalizing. These conditions, according to the petititioners, were
                    causing people to leave the Northwest Territory for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Territory which permitted slavery. Slave owners, moreover, were not coming to the
                    Northwest Territory. This kept the population of the Territory from growing.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
                    The petitioners voiced the opinion that if the Federal Government ever hoped for the general
                    emancipation of slaves, it would have to disperse the negroes throughout the western territories.
                    They also contended that slaves possessed in small numbers by farmers would be better fed and
                    clothed. Diffusion of the slaves would tend to weaken slavery was another of the arguments.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Quite early, the pro-slavery group asked Governor St. Clair to give his interpretation of Article VI.
                    He sent his official opinion to Luke Decker, Esquire, of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas,

                    the last of the petitions for or against the repeal of Article VI of the Ordinance of 1787. On

                    During the first week in December, therefore, he decided to initiate his sixteen year old son,
                    William B. Harris, as editor and manager of the paper. On the following day, young William appeared
                    at the office in a "cut away coat, a plug hat and a cane." He was given about
                    twenty-five lines of reprint, but had to set them over because he had substituted several
                    polysyllabic words which were not in the original. As his father threw the proof out the window, he
                    told his son that if he made such a blunder again "he would follow' the proof
                    through the aperture." It was in March, 1873, that the young man became the actual editor
                    of the Ellettsville <hi rend="i">Republican</hi>.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> A libel suit during the first
                    year caused the younger Harris to "settle down." He learned to fill up the vacant

                    would be possible to expand his business from time to time. Mr. Cravens suggested that Harrodsburg

                    November, became a success, the enterprising Harris of Ellettsville started another at New Ross,
                    Indiana. The advertising for the New Ross <hi rend="i">News</hi> was obtained in <placeName>

                    </placeName> County), and the business expanded rapidly.</p>
            <p>Gradually Harris evolved the details of his system of founding newspapers. He decided that the best
                    towns in which to establish newspapers were those located between two county seat towns. Competition
                    between merchants of such county seats produced abundant advertisements. The system worked
                    "like the Dutchman's mouse trap," said Harris, "I got
                    ‘em a comin’ an' goin’" The first step in the
                    establishment of a local paper was a "dummy" survey of the advertisers in the
                    county seats. If it promised to be profitable, Harris then visited the selected town of publication,
                    presented the proposition to the local merchants and citizens, selected a local editor and started
                    business. He preferred a school teacher or retired minister as the local editor. The latter was to
                    send in local news and solicit subscriptions; his compensation was to be the total subscription
                    money. Mr. Harris passed on his inevitable piece of advice to each editor
                    selected—"If you can't say something good about folks, don't
                    say anything."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

                    successfully at one time. Subscriptions were taken for three months when a newspaper was
                    inaugurated; if it did not prove successful by the end of that time, it would be dropped, and
                    another started in a new place.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Later on, he might start a journal a second

            <p>In the spring and fall, Harris was gone from Ellettsville for about half of each month, but during
                    the other seasons, less frequently. After a number of years of such traveling, he knew not only all
                    of the county seats of Indiana, but also their railroads, industries, important business men and
                    satellite towns; thus becoming a veritable encyclopedia of state information. The business attained
                    such a volume that fourteen men were employed regularly for many years in the Ellettsville shop,
                    where all of the printing was done. About 1900, when the print shop caught fire, the one hundred
                    thirty-five columns of advertising which were set up, were saved from destruction by the masterful
                    directing of the volunteer firemen by Mr. Harris. To show the efficiency of the establishment, it
                    may be mentioned that within one hour after the disaster, the type had been moved to another place,

                    "Agriculture," "Doings of Women," and "Queer
                    Stories." In one story, readers were in-formed that, "A writer in the Cologne <hi rend="i">Gazette</hi> declares that servants in the United State do only half as much work,

            <p>W. B. Harris, in 1905, tried another publishing venture. He organized a company for the publication
                    of a monthly youths' magazine, <hi rend="i">Our Boys and Girls</hi>. Harris wrote most of
                    the articles and stories himself, using as subjects the doings of his own children. The company
                    adopted a plan to increase circulation by offering a Shetland pony (raised on the Harris farm near
                    Ellettsville) to the boy or girl who sold the most subscriptions during the month. Although the
                    circulation attained 35,000 after giving away eight ponies, this number was not large enough to make
                    it a paying proposition, so the magazine was sold to Colonel Hunter of <placeName>

            <p>As metropolitan daily newspapers increased their rural circulation, Harris found it more and more
                    difficult to keep his chain out of the "red." By 1907, he gave up the scheme and
                    took more interest in his Ellettsville <hi rend="i">Farm</hi>, which name the paper had received in
                    1895, besides deciding to do "job work." His interest in civic affairs grew until
                    in 1924 he was elected to the Indiana house of representatives as the representative of <placeName>

                    field alone. Unfortunately for the undertaking, however, the depression soon "caught
                    up" with the industry and the publication had to be abandoned in November, 1931. Harris
                    also edited and published the <hi rend="i">

                    more and more of the nature of reminiscences of his long and active life. In July, 1939, after a
                    period of prolonged ill health, William, B. Harris, retired as editor, and thus brought to a close
                    his unique journalistic career of sixty-seven years. He died a few weeks after his retirement on

                    Indiana were in a hot political campaign in 1898, because the new Assembly would choose a successor
                    to David Turpie to sit in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate. The Democrats were hopeful because it was an off-year campaign, and they were
                    expecting the usual reaction against the party in power. The Republican party was united and
                        confident.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Prosperity was returning, following a four-year period of
                    business depression, referred to by Republicans as the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Panic." It was the old fashioned political campaign with the issues being
                    discussed by public speakers in all towns and cities of the state. Political oratory was in demand.
                    The leading Republican sepakers in the campaign were James E. Watson, J. Frank Hanly, John L.
                    Griffith and Albert J. Beveridge. They were all great speakers, but each had his individual style,
                    and each had his special friends and admirers. Watson at the time represented what was then the
                    sixth congressional district, known as "The Burnt District".<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    None of the other three at that time held political office, though Hanly had served one term in
                    Congress. He had been elected in 1894, but was defeated for renomination by Edgar D. Crumpacker in
                    1896.</p>

                    </placeName> with Albert J. Beveridge as the speaker. It was to be the big meeting of the campaign
                    in that County. I was serving the second year of my first term as Reporter of the Supreme Court of
                    Indiana. I had moved from <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName> County had asked me to preside at the meeting and present Mr. Beveridge, who needed no
                    introduction, even at that time, to any audience in the state of Indiana. He had been campaigning
                    for the Republicans throughout the state for more than ten years, was an exceedingly popular
                    speaker, and drew great crowds from both parties. The meeting was carried out as planned, following
                    which, Beveridge and I boarded a north bound <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> train which left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> at about ten o'clock. While returning to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, we occupied the same seat, and, of course, talked politics all the way. Among other
                    things, we talked about the Legislature of 1895, of which I had been a member. It was the custom in
                    those days for all state senators and representatives to be given passes by the railroad companies
                    doing business in Indiana. I received a pass from each railroad, but sent them all back.
                    Incidentally, I so stated to Mr. Beveridge in our conversation that night. He earnestly
                    congratulated me for so doing, and remarked that he would have done the same thing, adding that if
                    he ever held any political office he would refuse to accept railroad passes or franks from telegraph
                    or express companies. That statement concurred with my view, and I at once told him that if he
                    should be a candidate for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate I would do what I could to assist him. He thanked me, but stated that it would
                    be time to announce his candidacy after the election should the Legislature have a Republican
                    majority.</p>
            <p>A few days after the election, I received a telephone call from Mr. Beveridge telling me that he had
                    decided to become a candidate, and asking me to attend a meeting of a few of his supporters. There
                    were fewer than a dozen of us present at the conference, some being representatives elected in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County. At that meeting, plans were discussed by those present, and it was decided to
                    open Beveridge Headquarters in the Denison Hotel at an early date. In fact, it was not long until
                    such headquarters were opened with John Wingate, a veteran Republican of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> County, in charge.</p>
            <p>The campaign of the next two months, culminating in the election of Beveridge by the Legislature in
                    January, can-not be understood unless I go back and review in some respects the history of
                    Republican politics and the line-up of the political leaders and groups from the time General
                    Harrison <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-036-2-033"/> was nominated and elected President in 1888. The
                    General was not the only Indiana Republican who aspired to the presidency in that year. Walter Q.
                    Gresham of Corydon was also ambitious to go to the White House. He was a Federal Judge with offices
                    in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was a man of ability and character, a popular judge, and had many friends and
                    supporters both in and out of Indiana. However, most of the Indiana Republicans were for Harrison,
                    whose leading Indiana supporter was John C. New, the proprietor and publisher of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, a staunch Republican newspaper. Harry S. New, son of John C. New, was as
                    active as his father in support of the Harrison candidacy. Others among the active Republican
                    leaders in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> at that time, who supported Harrison, were R. O. Hawkins, Dan Ransdell, W. A. Ketcham,
                    later Attorney General, Harry Adams and Merrill Moores. There were many others. James W. Fesler,
                    though still a college man, was a Harrison enthusiast. Outside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> there were numerous supporters. Among these were Joseph I. Irwin of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jesse Over-street and Robert A. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Riley McKeen and "Nick" Filbeck of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Enos Nebeker of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, George W. Steele of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>, J. H. Huston of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Smiley N. Chambers of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. There were many other leaders whose names do not so readily come to mind.</p>
            <p>Gresham was not without his Indiana supporters, but they were few in comparison to those who were
                    supporting Harrison. The leader among Indiana Republicans who preferred Gresham for president was
                    Charles W. Fairbanks, then a rising young lawyer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> with political ambitions. Among those of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> who co-operated with Fairbanks were Joseph B. Kealing and Albert W. Wishard. After
                    Harrison's nomination, the Gresham men of Indiana fell into line, and Harrison was given
                    the united support of his party in the campaign of 1888. Gresham was never quite reconciled to his
                    defeat, in my judgment, and, when Harrison was re-nominated four years later, the Judge openly
                    supported <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> for president. He was rewarded by being made Secretary of State in the second <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration. The Harrison group of Republicans, who succeeded in making him the
                    nominee in 1888, controlled the party organization in 1890, 1892 and 1894. In the campaign of 1894,
                    the party was thoroughly united, resulting in an overwhelming victory for <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-036-2-034"/> the Republican party. The Republican majority that year was more than
                    45,000, the largest given that party in Indiana up to that time.</p>
            <p>In 1896, a president was to be elected, and, for more than a year before the Republican national
                    convention, William McKinley was looked upon as a leading candidate. Mark Hanna of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, was the manager of the "McKinley for
                    President" pre-convention campaign, and Charles W. Fairbanks, a native of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, was Hanna's representative in Indiana. When the time for party reorganization
                    came in 1896, the majority of Republicans in Indiana were for Mc-Kinley, and Mr. Fairbanks was
                    fortunate in being the chief supporter of McKinley in the Hoosier state. The party was reorganized
                    during the last week in January, and there was a sharp contest between the old Harrison group and
                    the newer group of Republican leaders headed by Fairbanks. It was not known until the last, which
                    group would control the organization. By a bare majority of the district committeemen, the Fairbanks
                    group won, electing John K. ("Oom Jack") Gowdy of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Rush county</region>
                    </placeName> for state chairman. There was, however, no factional trouble, and, when the State
                    convention met on May 7 to nominate the state ticket, the party was united and confident of victory.
                    Due to the nomination of William J. Bryan at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, early in July, conditions were changed, and, it was only after a vigorous and well
                    managed campaign, that the Republicans were victorious in November. McKinley's majority was
                    only 17,181. Two years later, the organization of the Republican party in the state was again
                    controlled by the Fairbanks group. Charles S. Hernly of New Castle was elected state chairman. He
                    was not the first choice of that group, but neither was he the choice of those opposed to the
                    Fairbanks leadership. From the standpoint of party unity, his selection was wise. From the time of
                    his election until the election of Beveridge by the Legislature, he did not use his position in the
                    interest of any senatorial candidate. He had the idea, as chairman, that he represented the entire
                    party and not a faction, the only position that a wise state chairman of a political party should
                    take. We sometimes have party chairmen who put a faction of the party above the party itself, which
                    always results in party division, and often in bad government.</p>
            <p>As I have already stated, Beveridge had announced his <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-036-2-035"/> candidacy
                    and opened headquarters soon after the November election. At about the same time, J. Frank Hanly of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Major George W. Steele of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName>, Judge Robert S. Taylor of Ft. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, and Frank B. Posey of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, each announced his candidacy, and each opened headquarters in the Denison Hotel. From
                    that time until the Legislature met in January, 1899, each candidate had a group of friends about
                    his headquarters, and Republicans from over the state were invited by each group to call. Besides
                    the general invitations, special invitations were sent to leading Republicans in all parts of the
                    state. The Republican legislators were specially invited, and the Denison Hotel was filled with
                    Re-publican politicians and friends of the respective candidates continuously until the Republican
                    caucus, which was held on January 10, the first Tuesday evening after the meeting of the
                    Legislature. Some visited the headquarters of one or more of the candidates for conference; some
                    came to boost for their favorites; and some came to find, and get on, the bandwagon. For four or
                    five weeks before the caucus, the lobby and hallways of the Denison were filled with politicians and
                    friends who did not seem to weary in discus-sing the merits of the candidates. The supporters of
                    each candidate were earnest and sincere, but I recall no quarrel or angry words.</p>
            <p>Each candidate had his elements of strength. As I have already said, Beveridge had been active as a
                    campaign speaker for his party for several years. Those were the days when oratory counted for much,
                    and Beveridge was an orator of unusual popularity and ability. He had spoken in all parts of the
                    state again and again. He had made many friends. Thousands who had met him personally were his
                    admirers, and, when he became a candidate, these admirers were every-where speaking words in his
                    favor. This fact had much to do in making him the eventual choice of the party caucus. Another
                    element of his strength was the loyalty, intelligence and activity of those members of the
                    Legislature from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County who supported his candidacy. They were: Fred Joss, a newly elected state
                    senator, and representatives James W. Noel, Frank W. Littleton, Larz Whitcomb, and A. M.
                    Glossbrenner.</p>
            <p>At the outset of the campaign, none of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County holdover senators was for Beveridge—Martin M. Hugg was <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-036-2-036"/> for Hanly, R. O. Hawkins for Taylor, and Harry S. New for Steele. While
                    others were in the councils, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County Beveridge group of legislators, who had previously had little or no political
                    experience, formed the real board of strategy. Each one of them gave practically all of his time to
                    the matter for two months prior to the caucus. Beveridge supporters from points outside of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> were in and out. Those of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County group were never away. Among the many important things done by them was the
                    perfecting of an organization soon after the November election, of a group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> business men to sponsor the election of Beveridge. Another element of strength of
                    Beveridge was his own supreme confidence in the outcome. When he announced his candidacy, there were
                    many who were hopeful of his election, but there was, in my opinion, only one man in the state who
                    was sure of it, and that was Beveridge himself. He was never in doubt; he was always confident. I am
                    sure that from day to day, as the campaign progressed, his faith inspired confidence in others. A
                    potent influence in behalf of Beveridge was the friendship of John H. Baker, Judge of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> district court for Indiana. It was through Judge Baker's influence that his
                    son Francis E. Baker and Charles W. Miller of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Goshen</settlement>
                    </placeName> joined the Beveridge forces.</p>
            <p>The Beveridge candidacy was not without its handicaps. First of all, the
                    "politicians" were not for him. The leaders of the two political groups of the
                    Republican party in Indiana were for other candidates, and the "small fry,"
                    without thought of anything but political spoils, followed the leaders, as is always the case.
                    Another handicap was that Beveridge resided in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the home of Senator Fairbanks. The argument made by the supporters of each of the
                    other candidates, that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                    </placeName> Senators, was very effective with the out-state folk. Bevtridge's ability was
                    never questioned, but his availability was questioned by some, for the reason that he was young and
                    without experience as a public official. He was but thirty-six without any official experience,
                    except that he at one time had been reading clerk in the state senate.</p>
            <p>Hanly's strength lay in the fact that he was backed by most of the Republican politicians.
                    In fact, he was looked upon as the state organization candidate. He was supported <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-036-2-037"/> by Senator Fairbanks and also by James E. Watson and James A. Hemenway,
                    each of whom had just been elected to Congress for a third successive term. Among other able state
                    leaders who actively supported Hanly were James P. Goodrich, Union B. Hunt, Joseph B. Kealing, and
                    Martin M. Hugg. Hanly had served one term in the state senate and one term in the national House. It
                    was argued by his friends that this official experience should count for him in the contest with
                    Beveridge. The chief handicap of Hanly was that the leaders of the Republican group supporting him
                    were those who, in 1896, had wrested the state organization from the hands of the old Harrison
                    group. Some members of the latter were in the Legislature, while some, not in the Legislature, were
                    men of sufficient influence to control votes in the senatorial election.</p>
            <p>The backers of Maj. George W. Steele claimed support for their candidate on the ground that he was a
                    Civil War veteran, and had to his credit an extended experience as a Representative in the lower
                    house of Congress. He had been an active supporter of General Harrison for President in 1888 and in
                    1892, and some of those with whom he worked to nominate Harrison were in the Legislature supporting
                    his candidacy. Notably among them was Harry S. New, who like his father, John C. New, had been a
                    chief supporter of Harrison in 1888.</p>
            <p>Robert S. Taylor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName> had been a judge in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> and had served the Government on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> River Commission. He was a man of mature years, of outstanding ability and of unusually
                    fine personal appearance. His friends claimed support for him, not only because of his ability and
                    experience, but because, as they claimed, the section of the state in which he lived was entitled to
                    the senator-ship. Like Steele, he had been a staunch supporter of General Harrison, and many
                    Harrison men, some of them in the Legislature, were active in his behalf.</p>
            <p>Frank Posey was a distinguished lawyer of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He, like Hanly, had served one term in the lower branch of Congress. He was a good
                    speaker and had served well his party for years, his campaigning having been largely con-fined to
                    his part of the state. Evansville was the second city of the state in population, and his friends,
                    with much earnestness, <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-036-2-038"/> claimed that the city as well as
                    southwestern Indiana (the "Pocket") was entitled to a Senator.</p>
            <p>The Legislature convened on Thursday, Janaury 5, 1899. Most of the Republican members came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> be-fore the opening day. The time for the caucus of Republican members to nominate the
                    candidate for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate was fixed for Tuesday evening, January 10. There were, in all, eighty-nine
                    Republicans in the two branches of the Legislature, a majority on joint-ballot of twenty-eight. A
                    candidate to, be named by the caucus had to receive at least forty-five votes. It was at all times
                    conceded that Hanly had between thirty and forty votes to begin with and was iii striking distance
                    of the nomination. It was Hanly against the field. The bandwagon was his; all were asked to get on;
                    and it was freely predicted by most of the politicians that he would be nominated.</p>
            <p>A day or so before the caucus, Robert Mansfield and I decided that we would endeavor to find out how
                    many of those entitled to vote in the caucus would say that they would never vote for Hanly.
                    Mansfield was Steele's manager. Mansfield and I each had a complete list of those who would
                    make up the caucus. We knew it was of no use for us to see those known to be pledged to Hanly, so we
                    struck their names off. There were many others who, we already knew, would under no circumstances
                    vote for Hanly, and those we also struck from the list. Mansfield and I then decided that we would
                    personally interview each of the others. He was to see certain senators and representatives and I
                    the rest. Our reports to each other the next forenoon revealed, that, as matters then stood there
                    was a majority of the Republicans in the Legislature against Hanly. We agreed that there ought to be
                    a meeting of some of those not for Hanly. I reported to Beveridge headquarters the result of the
                    canvass which Mans-field and I had made. I suggested a meeting but John Win-gate who was in charge
                    of Beveridge headquarters could not be interested. Mansfield who reported to the Steele
                    head-quarters had better luck and a meeting was planned. A news-paper man, not for Hanly, was
                    designated as the man to round up the group desired in the meeting, and at a time fixed, the meeting
                    was held in an upper room in the old Bates House where the Claypool now stands. I was in this
                    meeting. There was also another meeting of the same group which I did <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-036-2-039"/> not attend. In the group not for Hanly, was Harry S. New, a wise and
                    sagacious leader. The opposition to Hanly was crystalized, and, as the hour for the caucus drew
                    near, it became apparent to those on the inside that Hanly's defeat was possible, if not
                    probable.</p>
            <p>The Republican caucus was held in the hall of the house of representatives. It was planned that
                    Beveridge was to be in his own law office which was on the second floor of a building on the west
                    side of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> Street, just south of the When Building. The result of the balloting, as it proceeded,
                    was to be telephoned to Beveridge by Frank W. Littleton, one of the members of the house of
                    representatives from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County. With Beveridge in his office at the time, were Thomas E. Davidson and Louis
                    Lathrop, both of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and myself. Beveridge at the telephone received and announced the reports to those of
                    us in his office. There were in all thirteen ballots, two of which were declared void because too
                    many votes were cast. Only twelve were announced. The first ballot follows: Hanly, 32; Taylor, 19;
                    Posey, 14; Beveridge 13; and Steele, 11. The thirteen who voted for Beveridge on the first, and for
                    that matter on every ballot were: representatives—James W. Noel, Larz Whitcomb, Frank W.
                    Littleton and Alfred M. Glossbrenner, from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>

            <p>Upon the announcement of the thirteenth ballot, which was at fourteen minutes past midnight,
                    Beveridge was declared the nominee. Each ballot when announced was telephoned by Littleton to
                    Beveridge at his office as planned, and the result of each ballot when received by Beveridge was
                    announced by him to those of us in his office.</p>

            <p>When, on the ninth ballot, the Beveridge vote dropped from 22 to 20, he declared: "That
                    amounts to nothing, I'll be nominated." When the result of the last ballot was
                    telephoned by Littleton, Beveridge turned to us and calmly stated: "Gentlemen, I am
                    nominated." Then he gave us the vote. We excitedly extended our congratulations and put on
                    our hats and overcoats preparatory to going over to the Denison. It was an exceedingly cold night.
                    Just as we were about to leave the office, Beveridge said, "Boys wait a minute."
                    Then he went to the telephone and called his home. His part of the telephone conversation ran thus:
                    "Is that you Kitty?" … . "Kitty, I am nominated, thank
                    God." His wife having been notified, we hastened downstairs and went to the hotel. On the
                    way, we were joined by a crowd of cheering Beveridge men, who sang "Marching Through <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>" as they went along. Arriving at the Hotel, Beveridge was carried to the
                    center of the lobby, where, standing on a chair, he addressed the large crowd that had been waiting
                    for a report from the caucus. The members of the caucus, having sent for Beveridge, waited in the
                    hall of the house. Being advised that he was expected at the State House, Beveridge was hurried to a
                    carriage which was in waiting. Some joined him in the carriage, while Robert A. <placeName>

                    the members of the caucus and friends who had assembled after the nomination, following which, he,
                    with some of his rejoicing friends, called at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> Club and later at the old <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> Club before he went home. On Tuesday, January 17, Beveridge was formally elected, and
                    was asked to ad-dress the General Assembly. The invitation was accepted, and at 11:00
                    o'clock in the forenoon, two or three days later, the Senator-elect appeared before the
                    members of the Legislature in joint session, when he delivered a prepared address of unusual merit.</p>
            <p>The nomination of Beveridge was not expected by the public, because most of the politicians of the
                    state backed Hanly to win, and the public believed the politicians. The unexpected happened,
                    however, and excitement ran high. The Beveridge forces were jubilant, and supporters of Steele,
                    Taylor and Posey who had helped make the nomination were also in high spirits. Hanly and his
                    supporters could not at first conceal their disappointment, but were, nevertheless, good losers. The
                    nomination of Beveridge was front page news, not only in Indiana, but throughout the nation. His
                    nomination and election at once met the general approval of the rank and file of the party in the
                    state. Neither of the two Republican groups nominated its choice; but with Charles W. Fairbanks and
                    Albert J. Beveridge both in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, the Republicans of Indiana felt that they were unusually well represented and
                    were justly proud.</p>
            <p>The contest was hard fought, but free from acrimony and unscrupulous tactics. There was no charge or
                    suspicion of fraud or corruption. Fairbanks, with McKinley as President, might easily have brought
                    about the nomination of Hanly by the use of patronage, but that was not the Fairbanks way. He was a
                    superior party leader, but never a boss.</p>
            <p>There was no one thing that brought about the nomination and election of Mr. Beveridge. It was a
                    combination of various forces and circumstances. He would not have been successful except for the
                    years of state-wide political campaigning for his party. In that way his superior ability became
                    generally known and appreciated. Nor would he have been nominated had it not been for the
                    continuous, <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-036-2-042"/> intelligent, active and loyal support given him by
                    five of the members of the General Assembly from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> County. He would not have been nominated if Hanly had not been the candidate of one
                    group or faction of the party. Most of the leaders of the old Harrison group, in and out of the
                    Legislature, preferred Steele or Taylor. Many of these finally supported Beveridge, not so much
                    because they were for him as because they were against Hanly, or rather because they did not want to
                    add to the growing political prestige of certain leaders who were promoting Hanly's
                    candidacy. My personal view is, that Beveridge would not have been nominated had it not been for the
                    work of Harry S. New during, and shortly before, the caucus.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am inclined to believe that Beveridge did not realize or, perhaps, fully appreciate, the support
                    rendered by New. It is my further belief, that if, after his election, Beveridge had
                    coördinated all the political forces which contributed to his election, and thereby lined
                    up with those of the Harrison group still active in Republican politics, he would not only have been
                    re-elected in 1905, but also in 1911. Following his election in 1899, Beveridge did not co-ordinate
                    the political forces which brought about his nomination, but sought to build a personal
                    organization. From the stand-point of his political promotion this was a mistake, for, in my
                    opinion, it brought about his defeat for reëlection in 1911, or rather it enabled the
                    Democrats to win a majority in the Legislature on joint ballot in the election of 1910. Al-though
                    Beveridge did not control the Indiana Republican organization in 19, his re-election by the
                    Legislature of 1905 was made certain by the election that year of Theodore Roosevelt, for during all
                    the time Theodore Roosevelt was president, Beveridge was his chief political adviser and spokesman
                    in Indiana. In 1910, the conditions were different. Roosevelt was not president, and Beveridge
                    needed the support and co-operation of all the forces which had contributed to his nomination and
                    election in 1899, and that he did not have.</p>
            <p>Such is, briefly, the story of the first election of Albert J. Beveridge to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate, as I remember it. I have verified the results of the caucus ballots by

                    which occurred forty-one years ago may be of interest to those of the present generation.</p>

            <p>Among the newer committees of the Indiana Historical Society, some of which were listed in the March
                    number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, the Committee on Bibliography of
                    Indiana Authors is in the front line of activities. The committee consists of J. K. Lilly, Jr.,
                    chairman, Benjamin D. Hitz, and Christopher B. Coleman, all of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The committee lost a most valuable member by the death last year of Albert L. Rabb.
                    Mr. and Mrs. Anthony J. Russoi have been engaged by the committee, each for half time, to gather
                    data for the compilation of a definitive bibliography of James Whitcomb Riley, with a view to future
                    publication. The committee, with the help of Mr. and Mrs. Russo, are also collecting data about all
                    Indiana authors. The first of these projects has already revealed an astonishing number of
                    questions, such as puzzle and at the same time de-light, a professional bibliographer. Both the
                    difficulties and the amount of material involved are greater than anyone who is not thoroughly
                    familiar with Riley's writings and his habits of publication would rrealize.</p>
            <p>In the more general project, the committee has not yet, and perhaps never will, reach a satisfactory
                    conclusion as to what constitutes an "Indiana" author. It is tentatively
                    proceeding to collect data upon authors born in Indiana who spent most of their lives in other
                    states, and natives of other states who lived in Indiana during any considerable period of their
                    literary activity, as well as upon authors who were born, lived, wrote, and died in Indiana. In
                    this, the committee has received much appreciated help from librarians and others through-out the
                    state who have called its attention to writers of purely local fame. The committee solicits a
                    continuation of<hi rend="sup">1</hi> such assistance with the understanding that the word
                    "author" is tentatively construed to include producers of printed works of all
                    kinds and upon all subjects. It is doubtful whether any publication can be as inclusive as the list
                    which is being compiled, but it is hoped that the entire list will eventually be made available for
                    public information. It cannot, however, be made available for some time, not until innumerable items
                    have been completed and checked:</p>

            <p>Robert Dale Owen and General Joseph Lane were not only friends; they were old-time neighbors and
                    fellow Democrats from southwestern Indiana. Owen, of course, resided at <placeName>

                    </placeName>; Lane in Vanderburg county. Then during 1852-53—the period of following
                    letters—Lane was a Democratic delegate to Congress from <placeName>

                    mid-century period, was active in Indiana politics. For one thing, he had been a guiding spirit in
                    the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1850; then, in 1852, he was not indifferent towards
                    becoming either <placeName>

                                            General Winfield T. Scott. The election occurred on Nov. 2, 1852, one day
                                            after the writing of Owen's letter.</item>

                                    exceedingly uncertain. My course last winter, in regard to radical reforms of our
                                    State laws, which, (to speak the honest truth) I think <hi rend="i">ought</hi> to be
                                    an argument of some weight in my favor, may become the reverse. I entertain no doubt
                                    whatever, that, in a few years, our new laws will be universally popular, &amp;
                                    will render those popular, who introduced, or advocated them. Be this as it may, I
                                    desire no reputation that is inconsistent with the authorship of some of these,
                                    especially our new law of descents, which is one of those that has been, the most
                                    commonly assailed. Let the tide run, for the moment, as it will, I can bide any
                                    time. But meanwhile, I may lose my election. My opponents, I have every reason to
                                    believe, will make the most of any temporary prejudice; &amp; it may last long
                                    enough to serve their turn.</p>
                        <p>My feelings, therefore, as to the chargeship remain unchanged. I should, indeed,
                                    prefer the Senatorship, not as being more agreeable, for that I doubt; but as being
                                    more useful &amp; influential; leaving more behind to which one may look back
                                    with satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>If you present my name to Genl. Pierce for the chargeship to Naples (which I should
                                    much prefer to any other) I am exceedingly anxious not to appear in the light of one
                                    of that countless army of office-seekers, who besiege the doors of every
                                    newly-elected President, almost before the votes are counted. It is some sixteen
                                    years since I was first elected to the Legislature, &amp; I have been in public
                                    life most of the time since, four years in the Legislature, one in our
                                    Constitutional Convention, four in Congress. During that time I have not only never
                                    presented my name for any office, in the list of our State Executive or of the
                                    President, but I have positively refused the offer of many of my friends to present
                                    it, on more occasions than one.</p>
                        <p>But somebody must fill these offices. And all that is really reprehensible is to
                                    apply, without the requisite qualifications. How that is, in my case, you have as
                                    good means of judging as any one. I was educated, as you know, at a Swiss college,
                                    where I became familiar with French &amp; German. That college was the resort of
                                    many of the young nobility of the Continent: Germans, Prussians, Russians, Italians
                                    &amp; others. As the students lived on terms of the greatest intimacy with each
                                    other, I acquired a familiarity with their manners &amp; modes of thinking which
                                    wd not be without its use in a diplomatic position in Europe. I read Italian, not
                                    very fluently, however, but do not speak it. I can readily master it, however, in a
                                    few months.</p>
                        <p>Whether I obtain the situation or not, I shall take my family to Europe, this for the
                                    sake of my children. But, as my means are limited (say some
                                    $1,500—a year only) it is an object with me to obtain some
                                    employment that will pay expenses. More than that I suppose a chargeship will not
                                    do.</p>
                        <p>A friend of mine whom I communicated my intention of visiting Europe, &amp; who
                                    had resided for four years at Naples, offered me <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>I wrote you a few days since, in regard to the Chargéship. Since then I
                                    have received several letters relative to the Senatorship, which render it certain
                                    that the candidates will be numerous: certainly these: Pettit, Fitch, Davis,
                                    Lockhart, probably Judge Smith (formerly Supreme Judge) perhaps Wm. J. <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                                    </placeName> &amp; others.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some of these men have already spent much time in a personal canvass, seeing
                                    &amp; seeking promises from the members,—both contingent promises
                                    before their election &amp; absolute promises since—&amp; this,
                                    as you well know, has much more weight than it ought to have. I don't like
                                    such a course, &amp; shall not pursue it.</p>
                        <p>Under these circumstances, I am not sure, in case you shd find Gent. Pierce disposed
                                    to give me charge of our country's interest at the Court of Naples, but
                                    that I may make up my mind to withdraw my name [as a senatorial candidate], before
                                    the election comes on. I have quite determined to take my family to Europe next
                                    spring, there to remain two, or possibly three years, for the benefit of the
                                    children's education. As U. S. Senator I should be very much separated from
                                    them: &amp;, in case of any dangerous political convulsion, while I was absent
                                    attenting to my congressional duty, they might be placed in precarious
                                    circumstances. These circumstances weigh strongly with me. Yet, as I cannot afford
                                    to take my family to Europe for three years, &amp; do nothing towards their
                                    support, during the time, if Genl. Pierce decides to look elsewhere for a
                                    Chargé, it will be my duty to take what pains I can, without sacrifice of
                                    self-respect, to obtain the Senatorship.</p>

                                    should deem it necessary, not only to master the Italian (with which, I think I told
                                    you, I am but imperfectly acquainted), but to become acquainted &amp; familiar
                                    with the history of <placeName>
                                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                                    </placeName>, ancient &amp; modern, including its present social &amp;
                                    political relations. I have no idea of going there to vegetate. And though perhaps
                                    the strictly official business of a Charge may not be very important, in ordinary
                                    times; yet the bearing &amp; character of the representative of a Country like
                                    this,—his knowledge of the country he is sent to reside in, its history,
                                    diplomatic relations, manners, customs, tastes form of society—cannot be
                                    without its influence, favorable or unfavorable, on his own Country &amp; its
                                    institutions, in the eyes of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>I do not think I shall leave this [place] until towards the close of next month.
                                    Please, therefore to address any letters for me to <placeName>

                        <salute>My dear Lane,</salute>
                        <p>Yesterday I received a letter from young Ellsworth,<hi rend="sup">4</hi> formerly
                                    Chargé to Sweden, informing me that he intended to apply for the same
                                    station again, for one year; that he would be recommended by our members; &amp;
                                    asking a letter to the President from me. Of course, I shall not give him any. I
                                    mention the circumstances to you, because I doubt much, whether the President will
                                    consider himself justified in granting to Indiana two chargeships. Ellsworth writes
                                    me, that he is going on to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, to see the President.</p>
                        <p>As I suppose I. L. Robinson, Gorman &amp; Lockhart<hi rend="sup">5</hi> all have
                                    some pretensions to the Senatorship, I imagine they might think it for their
                                    interest, that I should have the chargéship. And as I know Bright<hi rend="sup">6</hi> don't [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] want me to be Senator,
                                    the same motive may influence him, in my support. They ought not to recommend both
                                    Ellsworth &amp; myself, for that would only embarrass the President, in all
                                    probability.</p>

                        <p>I heard from a friend whose letter I received two days since, that it is intimated
                                    Pierce will be governed, in his appointments, a good deal by the advice of the
                                    Governors of States, especially where they have been elected by a large Democratic
                                    majority. This may, or may not be true. At all events, I thought it best to write to
                                    Wright, as I have done by today's post, asking of him a letter of
                                    recommendation; &amp; requesting him to forward it <hi rend="i">directly</hi> to
                                    you, so as to save time. If it be not necessary, at least it can do no harm.</p>

                        <p>The enclosed, just received, will explain itself.</p>
                        <p>The Governor may pe correct, in intimating, what the newspapers also suggest, that no
                                    appointments will be made until the 4<hi rend="i">th</hi> March, or even promised,
                                    until that time.</p>
                        <p>If such be Gen<hi rend="i">l</hi>. Pierce's decision, however just &amp;
                                    reasonable in it-self, it may place me, next month, in rather a difficult situation.
                                    I can't say how things may look in regard to the Senatorial election; but
                                    if I find that I can be elected, &amp; am elected, I could not, with any
                                    propriety resign, to go to Naples.</p>
                        <p>It w<hi rend="i">d</hi> be unreasonable, however in me to expect, nor do I expect it,
                                    that Gen<hi rend="i">l</hi>. Pierce will break through any general rule for me.</p>
                        <p>But <hi rend="i">you</hi> may be able to give me some intimation of the likelihood,
                                    that the chargéship may, or may not, be ultimately offered to me.</p>

                        <salute>My dear Lane,</salute>
                        <p>Your letter of the 11<hi rend="i">th</hi> December reached me only today, the 23<hi rend="i">d</hi>, after being twelve days on the road. It was the letter you
                                    wrote, on learning from me that Ellsworth was an applicant for a chargeship.</p>
                        <p>I think it possible I may have missed receipt of a previous letter of yours; as I do
                                    not distinctly understand from this, how matters stand. I <hi rend="i">infer</hi>
                                    from; it, either that you made application to the President, &amp; received the
                                    general answer that no applications would be considered till after the fourth of
                                    march; or else, that, learning such to be Pierce's decision (for which I
                                    should certainly not blame him) you judged it inexpedient to apply at all. I hope
                                    the latter. For I should be sorry indeed, if, on any account, you subjected yourself
                                    to any unpleasant reply, from a former fellow-soldier. But though I infer all this,
                                    your letter says nothing about it. So that I am left wholly in the dark as to
                                    whether or not you saw cause to change the intention you expressed to me, when I saw
                                    you at home, to see or write to the President, on the subject.</p>
                        <p>I should be much pleased,—indeed it is important to me,—to know
                                    exactly what you have done, &amp; what you think the prospects are, <hi rend="i">before the Legislature meets</hi>. And you will confer on me a great
                                    obligation, if you will write, by return of post, to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and give me that information.</p>
                        <p>I have already sent you Governor Wright's letter. You will have observed,
                                    that, by its terms, he shuts himself out from all chance of recommending any one
                                    else for a foreign mission, in preference to myself. And though, doubtless, what you
                                    say of him is correct, that he calculates closely his own interests, yet he has done
                                    all I could have asked him to do; and done, it, too, without attaching any
                                    condition.</p>
                        <p>If Bright &amp; his friends decline to second your efforts in my behalf, and
                                    refuse to sign a recommendation, I am quite aware, that it will diminish
                                    considerably the chances of success: since where a delegation is not united, it
                                    embarrasses thel President's action. If they take part for another against
                                    me, the prospect is uncertain.</p>
                        <p>If, on the contrary, they are really disposed to aid, there can be no possible
                                    objection to their signing a recommendation, before the Senatorial election comes
                                    on. Please inform me, whether they decline or not; as that may materially influence
                                    my course at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

                                    Europe with my family, yet, if it is a great uncertainty, I may think it best to
                                    take my chance, along with the rest, for the Senatorship. The other candidates have
                                    got to loggerheads already: and may even each others chances before the day comes;
                                    while I have kept out of the fight. To all inquiries,—which, by letter,
                                    have been numerous,—I have simply replied, that whether I was a candidate
                                    or not <hi rend="i">would depend upon circumstances</hi>,—which, is the
                                    exact truth. I can decide upon nothing, until I reach <placeName>

                        <p>I might write directly to Bright, &amp; others; but I am a poor hand at that sort
                                    of electioneering; and I understood you to prefer, that I should leave this affair
                                    wholly in your hands. If, however, you think it desirable to have letters from
                                    public men of our State likely to be at <placeName>

                                    refuse. Would you like to have [a letter from] the Democratic Central Committee?</p>

                        <salute>My dear Lane,</salute>
                        <p>Yours of the 2<hi rend="i">d</hi> January has this moment come to hand.</p>
                        <p>In the first place let me say to you, let this application for the Chargeship
                                    terminate successfully or unsuccessfully, I shall always consider the obligation
                                    under which your kindness has laid me the same. I do not estimate the value of my
                                    friends' efforts in my behalf by their success but by their sincerity.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, I should, under all circumstances, after receiving your letter
                                    which I found on my arrival here (dated Dec. 25) have held myself bound in honor,
                                    from the intimations you have given, not to stand in Fitch's way as a
                                    candidate. I at once stated, therefore, on my arrival, that I was not in the field.
                                    The effect of this was doubtless favorable to Fitch; as a majority of the votes from
                                    our end of the State—all of which would have stood by me to the very
                                    last—had him for second choice. I did not, however, go into the field, to
                                    electioneer for one or for the other; not conceiving it necessary or proper, in my
                                    position. I have been busy preparing an address to be delivered next Monday before
                                    the Historical Society of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                                    </placeName>; &amp; so I kept out of the arena altogether. From what I can learn
                                    the contest is very close; but, as the caucus is to be held this evening, the
                                    telegraph will tell you the result long before this can reach you.</p>
                        <pb n="146" id="VAA4025-036-2-054"/>
                        <p>I daresay it was best, at all events, for me to hold back. So don't trouble
                                    yourself, for a moment, even if the chance for Naples should fail. We have acted for
                                    the best. And it is only children who sit down &amp; complain, if, after all
                                    proper exertion, the cards turn up against them.</p>
                        <p>A word more about the Chargéship. I don't think it at all likely
                                    that Indiana can get <hi rend="i">two</hi>. There are but 14 in all, &amp; I
                                    think 8 full missions; together 22. With 31 States in the Union &amp; the usual
                                    number of applications, Indiana could not expect two. You wrote me (Dec. 11) that
                                    Robinson would be an applicant for the marshalship of this State. Has he not changed
                                    his views since, &amp; received assurance, from Bright &amp; his friends, of
                                    support for the Chargeship to <placeName>
                                        <country reg="ec">Ecuador</country>
                                    </placeName>? If he is an applicant for that mission, my opinion is, that Bright
                                    will support him in preference to me; &amp; that would be equivalent to
                                    opposition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i">Twelve o'clock</hi>. Fitch has just been here; and assures me,
                                    that, <hi rend="i">to his positive knowledge</hi>, Robinson is not a candidate for
                                    any foreign mission, that there is no other candidate for such position from our
                                    State, except Ellsworth; &amp; that the reports from Stockholm, in regard to
                                    E's habits, are such, that he cannot get it again.</p>
                        <p>I suppose, therefore, that the report about Robinson, like so many other stories
                                    started during electioneering times, is false. Fitch says, he (Robinson) is looking
                                    to the bureau of Indiana affairs. I should think him well qualified for that;
                                    &amp; it is a position, which, in a pecuniary point of view, is much better
                                    worth having than a chargéship.</p>
                        <p>I'm glad that nothing in the shape of unpleasant reply came to you from
                                    Peirce [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>], on account of your early application on my behalf;
                                    &amp; am very glad you did not go to see him. I would not, for twice the value
                                    of the chargéship, that any coolness should have sprung up between you
                                    &amp; him, on my account.</p>
                        <p>I shall get the names you suggest. As you say, they will do no harm, even if they be
                                    not necessary.</p>
                        <p>Fitch urges me to come on in February. Had I better do so, or not? Please write me
                                        <hi rend="i">on receipt of this</hi>, to this place; &amp; I shall be
                                    governed by your advice.</p>

                    territorial period, 1800-1816. The two volumes together include approximately 1,100 documents, only
                    a dozen of which have been heretofore printed. The content of the new volumes is similar to that of
                    the preceding books of the series. Considerable space is given to papers relative to the survey and
                    sale of public lands, Indian relations, territorial divisions, military problems, public patronage,
                    petitions, memorials and postal affairs. Other papers treat of such miscellaneous topics as <placeName>

            <p>Many documents have been omitted from this collection. Some have been excluded because of lack of
                    space, and others because they did not seem to deal sufficiently with administrative problems of the
                    territory. This accounts for the omission of the greater part of the National Archives material on
                    Indian affairs, relative to the War of 1812 and much of the correspondence in regard to the survey
                    and sale of the public lands. Still other documents were excluded because of their prior publication
                    in a reasonably satisfactory manner. Of these, the document most conspicious by its absence is the

            <p>It is fortunate for students of Indiana history that the Indiana papers have appeared early in this
                    series of territorial papers. It is certainly unfortunate that the need to <pb n="148" id="VAA4025-036-2-056"/> practice economy and to save space have resulted in the elimination of
                    many footnotes, such as appeared in previous volumes of the series. In such a work as this, cross
                    references and biographical citations are too valuable to be omitted. The text is well edited and
                    apparently quite accurate. It is only fair that <placeName>

                    whose papers have now been published, should insist upon the ultimate completion of this rich and
                    much needed historical compilation.</p>

            <p>This work lists the serial holdings of forty-six of the public, college, university, institutional
                    and special libraries of the state. The work of compiling and editing was done at the Library of
                    Indiana University by Miss Fava E. Goan, assistant reference libranian. The book, which contains
                    nearly seven hundred pages, is eleven by eight and a half inches. It is estimated that it contains
                    approximately 15,000 entries and references, and is therefore one of the largest state or regional
                    Union Lists to be issued.</p>
            <p>This work will contribute greatly to the reference use of periodicals and other serial publications
                    on a broad basis. It should stimulate inter-library loan service between the libraries of the state
                    of Indiana, call attention to fields of study and research in which weakness is revealed, and
                    en-courage the transfer and exchange of serials between libraries.</p>
            <p>The volume is offered in two bindings at prices that are based on the cost of printing only, all
                    expenses of organization, compiling, editing and distribution having been borne by the cooperating
                    libraries. An edition of two hundred fifty copies was printed and copies may be obtained from the
                    Indiana Union List Committee, Purdue University Library, <placeName>

            <p>There need be no attempt to extol or enumerate the many uses to which a union list of this type can
                    be put. In this <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-036-2-057"/> day of union list activities, every one is
                    familiar with the value of the coöperative service which can and does afford to the
                    scholarly workers of the state an efficiency not other-wise attained. Several libraries have already
                    used this list to effect a transfer of some of their duplicates and serials, not usually catalogued
                    by their libraries, to those needing them, and it seems well to make note of this. This union list,
                    as a basic list, will serve as a clearing house for transferring such duplicate publications and
                    placing them where they are most needed.</p>
            <p>The scope of the list is comprehensive. The interpretation of the word "serial" has
                    been made rather elastic to include many publications of local interest not covered by the limited
                    interpretation of the term. A state that prides itself upon its literary achievements may well look
                    to its libraries to reveal the titles and the history of the serial publications that have taken
                    root in the soil. This list includes many local publications that have not been and will not be
                    brought to light in a national union list. The titles of the publications of the colleges and
                    universities within the state's boundaries will be found as well as the names of the
                    publications of the religious, historical, educational, literary, political and other organizations.
                    The work may be considered a monumental feat in that it has brought to a culmination a task that had
                    no such set-up as is usually necessary to a work of such dimensions. Much credit is due to the
                    mutual helpfulness of the libraries of the state.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Pp. 150, frontispiece, $2.00.</head>
            <p>This small volume covers the life of Robert Dale Owen from 1826, when he was twenty-five years of
                    age, to his death in 1877. The five chapters are headed "The Journalist,"
                    "The Lawmaker," "The Diplomat," "The
                    Pamphleteer," and "The Mystic." The footnotes, running to thirty-four
                    pages, follow the last chapter. There is a list of manuscript sources that were available to the
                    authors, and a long calendar of the writings of Robert Dale Owen, including the names of three <pb n="150" id="VAA4025-036-2-058"/> periodicals, of each of which Owen was the editor, or
                    co-editor, for a brief period.</p>
            <p>This biographical treatise is really made up of five essays on different phases of Owen's
                    public life. The main facts of his public career are presented, but each chapter, or essay, is
                    strongly interpretive, while the life work of Owen is frequently thought of in the light of more
                    recent social and economic developments and his aims treated in relation to present day problems.</p>
            <p>The book is well written, and the work of the publishers is well done. It will no doubt be widely
                    read and appreciated. No one can read it without being impressed by the varied interests of Owen,
                    and all will have to agree with the authors that he was indeed an "Incorrigible
                    Idealist." In summing up the contribution of Robert Dale Owen to his times the authors are
                    at their best: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>His value to his generation lay in his seeing existing abuses in advance of the average man

                            prejudices [as prevailed among the people.] It was this service—educational and
                            legislative—which entitles Owen to rank as a great man of Indiana and the <placeName>

                            progress… In preaching acceptable forms of change and em-bodying them in
                            acceptable legal codes, he was helped to success by his personality: a mingling of
                            enthusiasm and caution, of speculation and practicality, of physical drive and courtly
                            graciousness, of literary sophistication and rustic comradery."</p>

                    printed, 1940. Pp. 237, illustrated, $1.25. (For sale by Rev. Chrystosom Coons, O. S. B.,
                    Ferdinand, Indiana.)</head>
            <p>This modest paper-bound book, the sub-title of which is "A Bit of Cultural
                    History," is a very carefully prepared history of the century-old parish and town of
                    Ferdinand. One can not read much of the story without agreeing with the author that he has written
                    of "a unique community" with an interesting history. Ferdinand is a thoroughly
                    Catholic village, and since the founding of the community its life has been overshadowed and shot
                    through and through with the spirit created and fostered by the institutions located in the
                    vicinity.</p>
            <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-036-2-059"/>
            <p>The author has done extensive research, and has based his history of the varied Catholic institutions
                    and their activities on the sources that he has used. He has also portrayed the common life of the
                    people of the community, to a surprising degree. He has thus written a book that will fascinate
                    readers' interest in obtaining church history and a knowledge of unique ecclesiastical
                    organizations and institutions. At the same time, readers more anxious to understand the everyday
                    life of the people who live in Ferdinand, or in the area tributary to it, will enjoy the story, and
                    agree that "Ferdinand … is human; but … human with a humanity which,
                    despite its short-comings, is ennobled by a century of genuinely Catholic life." The author
                    is no doubt correct when he declares that, "It is this that imparts to Ferdinand a
                    distinctive charm that even those who have gone forth from the community to seek their fortunes
                    elsewhere cannot put out of their minds…"</p>

                    been published by Hugh Th. Miller of that city. The history is presented in a neat pamphlet of
                    sixteen pages. This church was founded in 1829,'and services were held in a log church
                    until 1841, when a new frame building was erected. There was a union between the Christian Church of

                    Sweeney. The plans are now about completed for a new edifice on a site presented by William G. Irwin

            <head>Editor's Pages INDIANA SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO</head>
            <byline>WILLIAM O. LYNCH</byline>
            <p>Going back three quarters of a century, we find ourselves viewing Indiana at the close of the Civil
                    War. In the twenty-five years between 1840 and the return of the veterans to their homes in 1865,
                    the second state to be carved out of the Old Northwest passed through a very great transformation.
                    In 1840 the greater part of the young state was in a raw frontier condition. By 1865, every county
                    had at last received its first contingent of colonists and had achieved a degree of civilization. It
                    is true that there were yet extensive forested areas and many scattered districts were swampy. These
                    wet lands which were so difficult to drain were located on the flat divides of the northern and
                    north central parts of the state. In the aggregate, they constituted a rather vast acreage, the
                    largest continuous stretch 'of such wet lands being in the northwestern counties.</p>
            <p>The census of 1860 showed Indiana to have a population of 1,350,428, with only five states ahead.
                    These were <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>, <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, in the order named. Indiana's growth in population had greatly enhanced her
                    political importance, and, in the ‘fifties and’ sixties, the state sent eleven
                    members to the national House of Representatives and chose thirteen presidential electors. The
                    mighty movement of colonists to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> during the fifties had placed that state ahead of Indiana by 1860 for the first time,
                    but the Hoosier commonwealth had caught up with and surpassed <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> between 1840 and 1860.</p>
            <p>In 1865, Indiana could list only a few good roads, the best of which were nothing to boast of. The
                    railroad situation had greatly improved from 1850 to 1865, the several railway lines of the state
                    being extensively used during the war years. Business rapidly increased in all lines after military
                    expenditures really began to speed up and money inflation came with the issuance of paper money on a
                    large scale.</p>
            <p>The Civil War produced a new wealthy class of a sort not known before, much the same as in other
                    northern states with comparable conditions. Paper money prices, at the <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-036-2-064"/> highest nearly three times gold prices, stimulated business and
                    production. People not in debt, who spent their income as it came in neither gained nor lost much.
                    Those who purchased lands, buildings or businesses partly on credit, suffered most when the crash
                    came in 1873. Another class, including many business men and farmers of ordinary means, who
                    accumulated property of any kind during the war without going into debt, or who merely saved money,
                    were fortunate. When paper money came to par with gold in 1879 and the difference between paper and
                    gold valuations of property disappeared, the families belonging to this favored class occupied a
                    secure economic position. A survey of fine old Indiana homes, both in country and city, that were
                    built in the 'seventies and 'eighties would disclose that many of them were built
                    by dwellers in cities, towns and rural areas who had been able to accumulate property or save money
                    between 1861 and 1873.</p>
            <p>After long and ardent efforts, a small number of determined men had established some higher
                    institutions of learning in Indiana before 1861, but the number of students in the colleges was very
                    small. Academies and elementary schools had developed to a rather surprising degree considering the
                    obstacles to be overcome; nevertheless, the system of free public schools, as we have known it in
                    the twentieth century had yet to be created in 1865. Between that date and 1890, the people of
                    Indiana, as did the people of other states, performed one of the educational miracles of history.
                    With-out any intention to disparage what had been accomplished before 1865, one can say, with no
                    fear of contradiction, that, starting with almost nothing at the close of the Civil War, Indiana
                    created the extensive and hitherto undreamed of system of elementary and high school education in
                    the short space of little more than a quarter century.</p>
            <p>During the summer of 1865, Indiana's veterans of the Civil War, returned to their homes.
                    This soldier element constituted a really noticeable part of the population of every county in the
                    state for many years. For the most part, these veterans, then in the prime of life, were readily
                    absorbed by their home communities. They became active farmers or found opportunities to engage in
                    business or to work in the towns and cities. Many of them were, hoewver, drawn away to the frontier
                    areas beyond the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. Indeed, so many men who had served in the armies of the North and the South <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-036-2-065"/> migrated to the West after 1865 to engage in agriculture that
                    they increased the effects of the naturally large westward movement. They, therefore, helped to
                    create the discontent and unrest in older agricultural areas which was partly due to the competition
                    of the products of the new country so recently brought under cultivation.</p>
            <p>Until 1850, colonists flowed to the virgin lands of Indiana from the upper South, from older northern
                    states, and from foreign countries. Even before that date, however, considerable numbers of Hoosiers
                    were migrating to newer states and territories. From 1850 to 1860, there was an increase in the
                    volume of the incoming stream of colonists but an even greater increase in the numbers of native
                    born Hoosiers who were leaving to go to areas with cheaper lands and more el-bow room. In 1850, the
                    total number of men, women and children of Indiana birth who lived elsewhere in the United States
                    was 93,038; in 1860, this number had increased to 215,541. After the Civil War, since Indiana did
                    not become highly industrialized, the state continued to send large numbers of its people away, but
                    received a decreasing number from the outside. There were signs in 1865 that this would come about,
                    but the period of rapid growth and accompanying changes which was just closing was so overpowering
                    in its influence that few could be found capable of foretelling the future.</p>
            <p>There was much confusion in Indiana at the close of the sectional conflict. Some years were required
                    for people to reach a proper balance again, as was true elsewhere in the country. It is not too much
                    to say, however, that Indiana recovered her equilibrium about as early as did any state in the
                    Union, and Hoosiers were soon ready to enter on a period of solid achievement—to become
                    politically strong, to accomplish wonders in education, to advance in general culture, to enlarge
                    production and create much wealth. Nevertheless, the state was to drift too complacently with the
                    general cur-rents and to become too conservative to effectively challenge certain powerful economic
                    forces that were to foster injustice and social unrest.</p>
            <p>As one looks back, it is easy to understand why it was so readily believed that it was good to be a
                    citizen of Indiana in 1865. Opportunities lay all about, and there were few who could invent
                    reasonable excuses for failure. Insofar as it <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-036-2-066"/> was every fellow
                    for himself, even, it was hard for the Devil to catch the hindmost. It is not to be wondered at that
                    Hoosiers could then expect the conditions that favored them to last forever, as generations with
                    more experience have done since in periods that have ended with panics and depressions. In the midst
                    of forces that they did not understand nor try to control, it is to the credit of the people who
                    made up the Indiana of 1865 that they were willing to work ac-cording to their lights and attempt to
                    do so much of lasting value.</p>

            <head>My Lost Ancestor</head>
            <byline>MRS. STELLA BOGNER</byline>
            <p>For years, and I mean twenty or twenty-five years, I had been trying to get my family line completed.
                    Recently a totally unexpected letter came to me from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, with
                    certified copies of court records, giving the names of the father, mother, sisters and brothers of
                    rrv grandfather Nicholas Kidwell. This was the key that made all the little unrelated items that I
                    had collected fall into place and make a connected whole.</p>
            <p>I knew that my grandfather, Nicholas Kidwell, had married his first wife in Washington County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1810, that he came to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Daviess</region>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana, in 1816, and entered land there; that he was killed in 1838 when my
                    mother was one year old; and that my mother, whose name was Susan Ellen Kidwell and who married
                    Samuel Harmon Mulholland, died in 1886 when I was a small child. All I had of family history was a
                    faint recollection of elderly men and women coming to our home and mother calling them
                    "cousins" but I never knew the exact relationship, and could not seem to find out.
                    I remembered a few names, such as Mc-Atee, Ellen Spalding, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Val</region>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>, James Roby and Hillory Wattingly along with Felix, Sylvester Mattingly, and that was
                    all.</p>
            <p>About four years ago, I went into the part of the county where they had lived and interviewed any old
                    people I could find. My mother's "cousins" had all passed away, and no
                    one seemed to know anything about them. No one had even heard of Grandfather Nicholas Kidwell. One
                    old lady told me that she was a granddaughter of Lucy Kidwell McAtee, though she could not tell me
                    anything about this Lucy. She mentioned an "Aunt Ellen," whose full name she said
                    was Ellen McAtee Spalding, the name of one of the "cousins." Another old lady
                    remembered a Rose Jones whom she thought had been a Kidwell, and added that Lucy McAtee had died at
                    the home of this Rose Jones years ago at an advanced age. One old resident whom I stopped to visit
                    said that she had never taxed her brain with "things like that." Before I left, I
                    decided that she had never taxed her brain with much of anything. I found a woman of ninety-two who
                    told me the story of the murder of James Kidwell, as her grandmother <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-036-2-073"/> had told it to her. She gave me the names of Felix, Sylvester, John,
                    James and Julia Kidwell, but she had never heard of a Nicholas Kidwell. Thus things went over and
                    over during my twenty years search.</p>
            <p>I wrote numerous letters to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, the last one about a year ago to the
                    county clerk asking for any information that he might be able to find for me about the Kidwells. Not
                    long ago, I had a letter from him saying that in cleaning out his desk he had found my letter, and
                    that he would publish it in the local newspaper. In that way, I might learn something. It had been
                    so long since I had written that I did not remember what I had asked about, so I laid his letter
                    aside, thinking that was the last of it. Within a fortnight, I received two letters in answer to my
                    published letter, one from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the other from <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. With the letter came certified copies
                    of court records showing Hezekiah and Susanna to be the names of the parents of my grandfather
                    Nicholas Kidwell.</p>
            <p>One record read: "Legal heirs and representatives of Hezekiah Kidwell, namely; Nicholas
                    Kidwell; Juliett Mattingly, late Kidwell, and Henry Mattingly; John and James Kid-well; Lucy McAtee,
                    late Kidwell; Felix Kidwell; Elizabeth Roby, late Kidwell; Trecy, Sylvester, Rose Ann, and Thomas
                    Kidwell." So some of the "cousins" were explained. There was a copy of
                    the consent of Susanna to the marriage of her "dauter" Lucy to Daniel McAtee; and
                    the consent of Hezekiah to the marriage of his son Nicholas to Elizabeth Keith.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, during my years of searching, I had examined some <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName> records at the Indiana State Lilbrary and made some notes of wills, marriages, and
                    Revolutionary War records of the Kidwells that I found, not knowing whether they were my line or
                    not. In going through these notes I found that Hezekiah Kidwell had a Revolutionary War service
                    record from Prince Georges County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
                    </placeName>. Thus it can be seen how a collection of apparently unrelated items, like pieces in a
                    jigsaw puzzle, can fall into place when one finds the bit of information that supplies the key.</p>
