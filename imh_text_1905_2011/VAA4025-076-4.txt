        Work, Residence, and the Emergence of the Black Ghetto in 
            Evansville

        Impelled by abysmal conditions in the rural South and the opportunity for a new start, thousands of
                    blacks arrived in 
            Evansville
          , Indiana, between the end of the Civil War and the turn of the century. Along with
                    thousands of white newcomers, most of whom were from 
            Germany
          , they helped to transform this sleepy Ohio River town of 11,484 in
                    1860 into a robust commercial and industrial city of 59,007 by 1900. As noted in Table I, the number
                    of blacks rose dramatically from 127 in 1860 to 7,405 in 1900, the latter representing nearly 13
                    percent of the total population, the highest proportion among Indiana cities and one of the greatest
                    among midwestern cities. The growth rate of the black population regularly exceeded that of the city
                    as a whole. As shown in Table II, most of these black newcomers were born in the South, particularly
                    in the neighboring state of 
            Kentucky

                        1880, and 1900 differ slightly from those in the printed census volumes due either to some
                        mechanical errors by the author or the census tabulators. The difference did not exceed 1
                        percent. For an introduction to black history in Indiana in the nineteenth century, see Emma Lou

                        the scholarship on Indiana black history is surprisingly thin. Two secondary accounts of blacks
                        in Evansville are of limited historical value: Mildred Ann Clift, "A History of the
                        Negro in Vanderburgh, Gibson, and Posey Counties in Indiana" (unpublished M.A. thesis,

        In the age of Horatio Alger, work and residence were the best indices of success in pursuing the
                    American dream. The late-nineteenth-century black community of Evansville affords a valuable
                    perspective on the difficulties facing a large number of Americans attempting to reach that dream.
                    Unlike most northern cities Evansville's black population grew rapidly between 1865 and
                    1900, but not after 1915. 2 Well before 1900 the 
            
              2 This article relies heavily on the manuscript censuses of 1870,
                            1880, and 1900. For a valuable introduction to the manuscript census, see Robert G. Barrows,
                            "The Manuscript Federal Census: Source for a 'New' Local
                            History," Indiana Magazine of History, LXIX (September, 1973),
                            181-92. Despite the importance of manuscript census data, such material must be used with
                            care, as census takes tended to undernumerate children, blacks, and rural residents. Another
                            valuable source used here, city directories, must be treated with even more caution, despite
                            the paucity of data about the people of Evansville. City directories can provide a sense of
                            continuity and change in the 1890s where census materials cannot, given the destruction of
                            the 1890 census some years ago. Directories were developed, however, less for historical
                            record than for community promotion, and the number of residents listed in them was
                        often
          
           physical and institutional ghetto3
                    was established, with blacks mired in the least desirable jobs, trapped in residential enclaves, and
                    chained to a pattern of propertylessness, illiteracy, and high mortality and crime rates. The
                    largest black enclave, situated on the eastern edge of the city, was from the outset a predominantly
                    black area, not a changing neighborhood in which blacks replaced upwardly mobile white native or
                    ethnic Americans. After 1900, moreover, the black population of 
            Evansville

           began to decline. In 1910 there were 1,200 fewer blacks than in 1900, and the
                    proportion had dropped to 9 percent. In 1920, although the city's population had soared to
                    85,264, the black population remained about the same as it had been in 1910. A similar pattern
                    appeared in the 1930 census, when the total population had climbed to slightly over 100,000 and the
                    black population was 6,514.4 By examining patterns of work and residence and
                    seeking evidences of the emergence of racial segregation, one can not only identify widespread
                    social immobility among migrant blacks but can also obtain a clue to 
            defined as "representative" by their authors. Criteria for inclusion of
                            persons in directories were never provided. Nevertheless, directories can provide much
                            insight into occupational and residential mobility. Beginning in 1891 and ending in 1924,
                            the 
                Evansville
               directories listed blacks with "c" or "col"
                            after their names, which allows the historian some means of tracing the lives of black
                            residents.
            
              3 The term "ghetto" used by most historians connotes
                            the physical and institutional constraints upon urban blacks which produced a condition of
                            occupational and residential immobility. The ethnic enclave, by contrast, was not
                            characterized by rigid patterns of occupation and residence. With increased family income,
                            for example, ethnic families were able to move into city neighborhoods formerly occupied
                            only by members of white native families. For an introduction to black history in this era,

        Availability of work was a major reason for the arrival of hundreds of freedmen after 
            Appomattox

          . The federal manuscript census of 1870 revealed that about 40 percent of the newly
                    arrived blacks listed a trade or occupation, although an overwhelming majority were unskilled
                    workers. All but forty-three of the 553 persons listing a job in 1870 were unskilled. Nearly 300
                    classified themselves only as "laborer," but among other unskilled workers, there
                    were some indications of the nature of their employment. Seventy-six, for example, worked on
                    steamboats, ninety-three were domestic servants, and fifty-nine had other forms of service work,
                    such as cooks and porters. At the other end of the occupational scale, those blacks with high-status
                    employment were undoubtedly little better off than unskilled workers. Five of the seven
                    professionals were clergymen or teachers, and all six proprietors were petty shopkeepers with
                    saloons or boarding houses. Of the thirty skilled workers, seventeen were barbers.6
        

        The employment patterns of 1870 remained essentially unchanged during the succeeding thirty years. A
                    substantial proportion of black workers, as indicated by Table III, were unskilledâ€”1,182
                    of 1,308 in 1880; 1,382 of 1,552 in 1891; and 3,376 of 3,611 in 1900. In 1880, 395 blacks listed
                    their 
            
              5 A useful introduction to the concepts of class, status, and social
                            mobility is found in Richard Beringer, Historical Analysis: Contemporary
                                Approaches to Clio's Craft (
                New York
              , 1978), 177-91. Also of substantial value is Edward Pessen, ed., Three Centuries of Social Mobility in America (
                Lexington
              , Mass., 1974). It is important to acknowledge the difficulties in defining
                            class and status. Generally, as Beringer notes, class has been defined in economic terms and
                            status in social terms. Given the importance of occupation in determining success in the
                            quest for the American dream, social mobility is probably best measured by occupational
                            analysis. Residential mobility is the other prop of the American dream.

                Vanderburgh County

              , 1870. Occupational ranking and job classifications are derived from Theodore
                            Hershberg, et al., "Occupation and Ethnicity in Five Nineteenth-Century Cities: A
                            Collaborative Inquiry," Historical Methods Newsletter, VII (June,
                            1974), 174-216, and Theodore Hershberg and Robert Dockhorn, "Occupation
                            Classification," ibid., IX (March/June, 1976), 59-77. Because of
                            the variations in the information provided in the manuscript censuses and the city
                            directories, the author has used the five job categories in Hershberg, et al.,
                            "Occupation and Ethnicity." Names with the listing "works at
                            â€¦ " were not counted as a separate, unskilled group but among the
                            unskilled-unspecified group. Those with no occupation or those listing
                            "student" were not included. The handful of persons with ambiguous work
                            sites or unclassifiable occupations were not included: in each of the 1870, 1880, and 1900
                            censuses and the 1891 and 1900 city directories, these totalled no more than ten
                        persons.
          
           employment as "labor," and another 112
                    indicated they "worked at" or "helped" in such places as
                    sawmills, lumberyards, steamboats, and railroad yards. In 1900, 250 said they were laborers, 607
                    listed themselves as day laborers, and nearly 500 declared that they worked in a variety of firms
                    like steamboats and sawmills.7 Relatively few found employment as skilled or
                    white collar workers, proprietors, or professionals. Those who did were likely to be barbers,
                    clergymen, teachers, or marginal storekeepers. Put another way, as Table III indicates, the
                    percentage of unskilled workers in 1870 was large (92.2 percent) and, despite numerical increases in
                    the top three occupational categories, even larger in 1900 (93.5 percent). The proportion of skilled
                    workers, low at the outset, declined in that period. The combined percentage of proprietors, white
                    collar workers, and professionals grew slightly from 2.4 in 1870 to 3.2 in 1900. In an era of rapid
                    population growth, in short, there was significant evidence that the black community of 
            Evansville
           was at about the same point in 1900 that it had been in 1870.8
        

        When examined by the sectors of the economy in which blacks worked, the case for occupational
                    immobility is even stronger. As disclosed by Table IV, for instance, a large number of blacks who
                    specified a job other than laborer or worker were employed in transportation and domestic or
                    personal service. The 1880 and 1900 censuses indicated that many blacks held such jobs as cook,
                    domestic servant, hostler, laundress or washwoman, porter, and waiter. The census of 1900 revealed,
                    moreover, that blacks were disproportionately distributed among workers in the city. About 13
                    percent of the population, they accounted for 26 percent of the city's barbers, 74 percent
                    of the boatmen, 43 percent of the janitors and sextons, 55 percent of the porters, 53 percent of the
                    brick and tile workers, 63 percent of the laundresses and washwomen, 38 percent of the female
                    servants and waitresses, and 79 percent of the male servants and waiters.9 Table
                    V makes a similar case. Shortly

                            Theodore Hershberg, et al., "Occupation and Ethnicity in Five Nineteenth-Century
                            Cities: A Collaborative Inquiry," Historical Methods Newsletter,
                            VII (June, 1974), 188-89. The authors of that study place such jobs as carpenter, painter,
                            and brick mason in construction. Labor includes only those who list themselves as day
                            laborer or laborer. Public service comprises such jobs as cook in a hotel, porter, and
                            waiter.
           after the first wave of freedmen arrived in 
            Evansville
          , an over-whelming number were employed in certain forms of secondary and tertiary
                    jobsâ€”unspecified labor, transportation, public service, and domestic service. By 1900
                    little had changed. In 1870 the percentages of black workers in these categories were 50.6, 17.7,
                    3.8, and 23.1, or a total of 95.2 percent. Thirty years later these sectors constituted, in order,
                    23.8, 17.4, 10.5, and 33.5 percent, or a total of 85.2 percent. Within these sectors the most
                    significant changes were the increases in public and domestic service jobs. By 1900 service
                    accounted for 44 percent of all Negro employment. Of continuing importance to black workers were
                    such jobs as steamboatman, teamster, and hostler. In 1900 these positions represented about 90
                    percent of the transportation employment among blacks. Blacks who worked on the railroads servicing
                    the cityâ€”chiefly the 
            Evansville
           and 
            Terre Haute
          â€”accounted for about 11 percent of all railway  employees. Most worked as section hands, "engine
                    wipers," and in other forms of menial labor.10
        
        The proportion of blacks employed in mining and manufacturing increased only slightly, despite the
                    importance of that sector in the thriving 
            Evansville
           economy. In 1870 only six blacks had identifiable mining or manufacturing jobs; in 1900
                    the number had increased to 231. The proportion of blacks in this sector of the economy, however,
                    was about 6 percent, as compared with nearly 40 percent of the white work force. Of these, most
                    worked in sawmills, brick and tile factories, and coal mines. The significant increase in the number
                    of black coal miners occurred in the 1890s and accounted for the emergence of one residential
                    enclave on the city's north side, near the two largest coal mines in 
            Evansville

          . By contrast, few blacks were employed in the leading industries of the
                    cityâ€”foundries (which made plows and stoves) and furniture factories (in which large
                    numbers of skilled German craftsmen worked). That only seven blacks, as shown in Table IV, were
                    grinders or polishers was not, of course, a reflection of innate limitation to engage in such
                    skilled work but rather a symptom of patterns of job discrimination at the turn of the century.11
        

        At the other end of the occupational scale there was a slight increase in the number of black
                    businesses, from six in 1870 to twenty-three in 1900. Most served an exclusively black
                    clienteleâ€”saloons, boarding houses, and restaurantsâ€”but the notable exception
                    was the barbershop. Although the manuscript censuses of 1880 and 1900 do not specify whether black
                    barbers were owners or employees, the city directories of 1891 and 1900 listed, respectively,
                    fifteen and twelve black barbershops. Whatever their clientele, these businesses were marginal
                    operations and represented an extremely small portion of the black work force in
                    1900â€”less than 1 percent, as compared with nearly 7 percent of the white work force who
                    were proprietors.12

            Ibid. Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana, 347-52, notes that
                        few blacks held manufacturing jobs anywhere in Indiana in 1900.
          
            12
            Ibid. Although Hershberg, et al., "Occupation and
                        Ethnicity," classify farmers as proprietors, the author has ranked them as
                        unskilled-specified workers unless there is evidence that they owned real property.
                        Unfortunately, such evidence is available only in the 1870 and 1900 population schedules.
                        Similarly, barbers were listed as skilled workers unless there was evidence that they owned
                        their business. A person who listed "barber shop" was usuallyâ€”given
                        other data such as value of real estate or a separate listing in the
        
        

        It is also important to note that there were few jobs open to blacks in the public sector, aside from
                    positions as school teachers. No blacks worked for local government in 1870. In 1880 there were four
                    black policemen, two hose reel drivers, two janitorsâ€”one each in city hall and the county
                    courthouseâ€”and several city firemen. Twenty years later there were no black policemen,
                    several janitors, and four city firemen. It appeared that the chief means of political reward for
                    blacks was employment as janitor in a public facility or as a member of the fire
                    department's Hose Company No. 9, an all-black fire brigade organized in the late 1880s and
                    stationed at Olive and Governor streets. No black held elective office, and the highest appointive
                    office seems to have been "colored county physician," a post held for many years
                    by Willis S. Green, who was also known as "the Baptistown surgeon." The post was
                    probably an antecedent of the county health officer. There were also two "white county
                    physicians" at the turn of the century.13
        
        Another important feature of employment among 
            Evansville

           blacks was the large number of females in the work force. In an era in which employment
                    outside the home was considered inappropriate for white middle-class women, black females
                    consistently accounted for a large portion of the black work force, rising from about 17 percent in
                    1870 to nearly 30 percent in 1900. At the turn of the century about 45 percent of all black women in
                    the city had a job, compared with about 10 percent of foreign-born white women and 25 percent of
                    native-born white women. A large number, moreover, were marriedâ€” in 1880, for example, 25
                    percent of working black women. Female employment undoubtedly resulted from the need to supplement
                    family income as well as from the demand for domestic and personal service. The importance of the
                    family to married women was evident in the type of work selected, as many (for example, in 1880, two
                    of every three working wives) were employed as laundresses or washwomen, jobs which permitted them
                    to remain at home.14

                        listing, the person was listed as a skilled worker.

                        those in the eighteen-to-forty age bracket, was nearly equal. The large proportion of working
                        women was thus not the result of age imbalance.

        The implications of Tables III, IV, and Vâ€”the powerless-ness and stereotypes resulting
                    from perennial restriction to certain types of menial workâ€”could also be demonstrated by
                    the occupational immobility of those blacks who were comparatively stable in their residence in the
                    city. Due in part to lack of economic opportunity, most blacks did not dwell long in 
            Evansville

          . Of the 324 heads of household enumerated in the city in 1870, only forty-three, or
                    13.3 percent, were also listed in the 1880 census. Of the 2,083 persons listed in the 1891 city
                    directory, 568, or 27.3 percent, also appeared in the 1900 directory.15 Of the
                    forty-three who were enumerated in 1870 and 1880, thirty-one held the same kind of work for ten
                    years. All but three of the thirty-one were unskilled workers. Among the unskilled workers, eight
                    experienced perhaps a slight improvement of condition, since they moved from the category of laborer
                    in 1870 to a more specific type of unskilled work ten years later. Eli Jackson and Bryant Goins, for
                    example, were listed as policemen in 1880, and Zack Taylor had become a church sexton. Seven of the
                    forty-three clearly advanced in occupational status. The most dramatic example was that of Willis
                    Green, the physician, who had been listed in 1870 as a plasterer. Five of the forty-three declined
                    in job status."16
        

        A similar pattern was evident in the 1890s. Of the 568 blacks registered in the city directories of
                    1891 and 1900, only twenty-two experienced an improvement of occupational classification. A greater
                    number, twenty-seven, declined in status. The remainder, most of whom were unskilled workers,
                    continued to work at the same sort of jobs they had held nine years earlier. The most significant
                    advancement in status in-, volved four men who were listed as barbers in 1891 and as barbershop
                    proprietors in 1900 and four unskilled laborers who in 1900 had become proprietors of small
                    businessesâ€”a barber shop, a grocery, and two "eating houses."17

                        because of marriage are nearly impossible to trace.

        For the twenty-one black residents listed in the 1870 and 1880 censuses and in the 1891 city
                    directory, there was also scant evidence of occupational mobility. Only six seemed to be better off
                    in 1891 than they had been in 1870. John Grandison and William Jones had become proprietors of
                    barber shops; Bryant Goins, Sr., and Alex Sigler were engineers; Charles Ashbury had become a
                    foreman at Igleheart Brothers Mill; and Willis Green was a physician. In 1870 three had been
                    laborers and three skilled workers. The remaining fifteen experienced no change in occupational
                        status.18
        
        The type of work available and the likelihood of little if any advancement undoubtedly contributed to
                    the low rate of persistence, but the high transiency rate was not limited to those at the bottom of
                    the social ladder. Of the seventeen skilled or white collar workers, proprietors, and professionals
                    in 1870, only five remained in the city in 1880. Eighty-two of the 102 in these categories in the
                    1891 city directory were not present in the 1900 city directory. The persistence rate for these
                    persons was about 29 percent between 1870 and 1880 and less than 20 percent between 1891 and 1900.
                    For unskilled laborers the rate was lower in the 1870s but higher in the 1890sâ€”13.4
                    percent and 32.7 percent. High occupational status, in a word, appeared not to be a deterrent to
                    transiency, and that factor, combined with occupational immobility, had the unfortunate effect of
                    discouraging the development of a stable base of black civic leadership. With only about 3 percent
                    of the black work force of 1900 in white collar, proprietary, or professional jobs, there was scant
                    opportunity for the building of a black middle class in 
            Evansville
          .19
        

        Like work, patterns of residence testified to the severe constraints on black newcomers. Despite
                    considerable population fluidity from high growth rates and low persistence rates, blacks resided in
                    only a handful of enclaves scattered through the city.20 Between 1870 and 1900
                    these enclaves also claimed

              20 The growing percentage of Indiana-born blacks ought not to obscure
                            the significant amount of population fluidity among 
                Evansville
               blacks. The Indiana-born population was younger than the black population as a
                            whole. Of the 690 Hoosiers enumerated in 1880, for example, 435â€”about
                            two-thirdsâ€”were less than ten years of age. Most had been born since the previous
                            census, and all but a few were children of migrant parents. See U.S., Tenth Census,

           an increasing proportion of the black residents of 
            Evansville

          . By 1900 the residential clusters of 1870 had become the physical ghetto. As indicated
                    in Table VI, for instance, the black population was concentrated in Wards 1 and 3 in 1870; 1, 2, and
                    6 in 1880 and 1890; and 1, 2, and 7 in 1900. These wardsâ€”which despite changes in
                    numbering represented the same geographic sections of the cityâ€”also claimed a growing
                    ratio of blacks to whites. Conversely, certain wardsâ€”notably Ward 7 in 1870, Ward 5 in
                    1880 and 1890, and Ward 6 in 1900â€”were consistently low in the number and percentage of
                    blacks. In 1870 Ward 1 contained 415 blacks, who constituted slightly over 15 percent of the
                    ward's total population; thirty years later that portion of the city was largely included
                    in Ward 7, which had 2,656 blacks, or about 33 percent of the total population in that ward. By
                    contrast, Ward 7 in 1870 had a population which was 1.2 percent black, and that area was only
                    slightly above 4 percent black thirty years later.21
        
        Examination of residential patterns by region is even more revealing. By 1880 the city's
                    blacks were concentrated in five sections. (See Map I.) Slightly more than 44 percent lived in a
                    four-block radius of Eighth and Canal streets, an area comprising contiguous portions of Wards 1, 2,
                    and 6. Within that section 906 of its 1,184 blacks lived near the old 
            Wabash

           and Erie Canal, which had been filled in after its demise. Inside the city limits, the
                    canal had become Canal Street and a large portion of Fifth Street. The city's second
                    largest cluster of blacks was situated in Ward 3 on the near northwest side, a part of what had once
                    been the southeastern section of 
            Population Schedules for 
                Vanderburgh County
              , 1880. It is important to note that the censuses of the nineteenth century
                            probably undercounted the young and the black, and hence the number of Indiana-born
                            residents was probably higher. The 
                Kentucky
               roots of many 
                Evansville
               blacks are also evident in the military records of Civil War veterans. Of the
                            forty-nine black veterans in Pigeon Township (
                Evansville
              ) claiming pensions in 1890, twenty-two had served in 
                Kentucky
               regiments during the war. Enrollment of the Late Soldiers, Their Widows and
                            Orphans, of the Late Armies of the

              21 Ward lines changed often in this period. Hence Maps I and II are
                            useful in tracing residential patterns. They are based on B. N. Griffing, Griffing's Atlas of 
                  Vanderburgh County
                , Indiana (

            MAP I: EVANSVILLE IN 1880
          
           Lamasco, an independent town prior to its annexation in 1857.
                    Between Pearl Street on the west, 
            Pennsylvania
           Street on the north, Second Avenue on the east, and High Street on the south resided
                    222 blacks, 8.3 percent of the total in the city. This area included the city gas works, the 
            Louisville
           and 
            Nashville
           Railroad Station, and the confluence of Pigeon Creek and the 
            Ohio River
          . A third enclave was located to the north of the 
            Evansville
           and 
            Terre Haute
           Railroad yards in Ward 6; it was near the largest enclave several blocks to the south.
                    It was defined by Main and Harriet streets on the west, Division Street on the north, 
            Lafayette
           Street on the east, and Eighth Street on the south. About 6 percent of the
                    city's blacksâ€” 157â€”lived here. The fourth lay near the northwestern
                    boundary of the city in Ward 4. Nearly 5 percent of the blacks in 
            Evansville
          , 121 in all, resided in an area bounded by 
            St. Joseph
           Avenue, West 
            Virginia
           Street, Tenth Avenue, and West 
            Franklin
           Street. The last cluster was in the southeastern portion of Ward 1, where ninety
                    blacks, or 3.4 percent, lived on portions of 
            Campbell
          , Taylor, and Judson streets. The residents of these five regions constituted two-thirds
                    of the total number of blacks in 
            Evansville

          . If one excludes those who resided and worked in white households, hotels, and
                    steamboats, about 80 percent lived in these five sections.22
        

        Although these areas were dispersed throughout the city and were not all black, there were several
                    indications that by 1880 the lines between white and black residential areas were being tightly
                    drawn. One evidence of that was the paucity of blacks in the German portions of the city. In 1880
                    Wards 3, 4, and 5, which had foreign-born populations ranging from 33 to 40 percent, were from 3.6
                    to 6.1 percent black. A second illustration was the fact that certain parts of the city were
                    receiving a disproportionate number of black newcomers. Ward 1, the boundary of which was similar in
                    1870 and 1880, doubled the number of its black residents in ten years. In Ward 2, which had the same
                    boundaries in both years, the number of blacks grew by 500 percent. Slightly over half of the
                    city's blacks resided in the contiguous Wards 1, 2, and 9 in 1870. Ten years later, that
                    areaâ€”Wards 1, 2, and 6â€”included about three-fourths of the total. The number
                    of blacks in that region rose from 705 to 1,979. A third evidence was the appearance of 
            
              22 U.S., Tenth Census, Population Schedules for 
                Vanderburgh County
              , 1880. Because street addresses were not provided in the 1870 population
                            schedules, information about residential patterns in that year is essentially
                        speculative.
          
           largely black streets. Nearly one-third of the city's
                    blacks resided on only eighteen streets or portions of streets, notably Canal between Fifth and
                    Tenth, Oak between Sixth and Eighth, and Douglass, Bell, Riley, 
            Mitchell
          , Church, and Sumner, all of which were located near the old canal.23
        

        That the physical ghetto was developing was even more apparent in 1891. The black population of Wards
                    1, 2, and 6, which had virtually the same boundaries as in 1880, had risen, according to the 1890
                    census, from 1,979 to slightly over 4,000 persons. Wards 1 and 6, which were contiguous, claimed
                    53.3 percent of the total black population, about 3 percent more than in 1880.24
                    That neighborhood lines were being drawn by race was also clearer. Of the blacks listed in the 1891
                    city directory, almost 46 percent lived within the four-block radius of Eighth and Canal streets.
                    The black section north of the 
            Evansville
           and 
            Terre Haute

           Railroad yards had grown to the east and southeast, and it now adjoined the largest
                    enclave of 1880. These two sections claimed about 4 percent more of the total black population than
                    they had a decade earlier. The other three enclaves also accounted for a larger proportion of that
                        population.25
        
        By 1900 black 
            Evansville
           showed greater evidences of residential segregation. As indicated in Table VI, Wards 1,
                    2, and 7 (the latter combining what in 1890 had been upper Ward 1 and lower Ward 6) included 4,702
                    blacks, or about 64 percent of all blacks in the city. That area had comprised about 54 percent ten
                    years before. Thirteen of the fifty-one census districtsâ€” three in Ward 1, two in Ward 2,
                    one in Ward 3, and seven in Ward 7â€”constituted about 62 percent of the black population,
                    and in eight of them blacks represented at least one-quarter of the district population. In two
                    districtsâ€”numbers 126 and 129 in Ward 7â€”resided 1,453 blacks, about 20 percent
                    of the city's blacks. Census district 126, which was 80 percent black, had the highest
                    proportion of blacks in 
            Evansville

          . The Eighth and Canal area, known popularly by 1900 as Baptistown, housed 3,987 blacks,
                    about 350 percent more than twenty years earlier 
            
              23
              Ibid. Other notable examples were Taylor Avenue (Ward 1), Oak Alley (Ward
                            2), Chestnut Alley (Ward 3), West 
                Virginia
               Street between Eleventh and 
                St. Joseph
               avenues and Pearl Street (Ward 4), and East Nevada Street (Ward 5).

           and nearly 54 percent of all the blacks in 
            Evansville
          . Each of the other three enclavesâ€”the First and High area, the West 
            Virginia
           Street community, and the Taylor-Judson neighborhood, known generally as
                    Oakdaleâ€”had larger populations than in 1880 (418, 229, and 121, respectively) but
                    accounted for a smaller proportion of the total black populace than in 1880 (11.3 against 16.7
                    percent). Aside from the greater evidence of concentration in the Eighth and Canal area, the most
                    significant change was the emergence of another enclave, which traversed Wards 4 and 5 and lay
                    between the Belt Line Railway and the city limits to the north. This area, which was near the coal
                    mines of the city, included about 8 percent of the blacks in 
            Evansville
          . All told, these five clusters accounted for not only a much higher number of
                    blacksâ€”5,425â€”than in 1880, but also a higher proportionâ€”about 75
                    percentâ€”of the city's blacks. If the 726 blacks living in white households,
                    steamboats, or hotels are excluded, these areas represented slightly over 81 percent. In addition,
                    the federal census and the 
            Evansville
           directory of 1900 confirmed that there were more predominantly black streets and that
                    more blacks were residing on them. Twenty streets or significant portions of them were at least 80
                    percent black, and another fifteen were between 50 and 79 percent black. On Days Row, Short Eleventh
                    Street, and the 1000 blocks of Cherry and Canal streets lived 775 blacks; on Short Eleventh alone
                    there were 232. Almost 700 blacks lived on Ballard, Brower, Douglass, Gordon, Hogan's
                    Alley, 
            Mitchell

          , and Rowleyâ€”all short streets from two to four blocks in length. An
                    additional 591 resided on Oak between Fourth and Eighth, Canal between Seventh and Eighth, Fifth
                    between Cherry and Oak, Sumner, and Church.26
        

        The location of all-black schools and churches also attested to the growing physical separation of
                    the races. (See Map II.) By 1900 there were four black schools: Clark, Governor, Independence, and
                    Third Avenue. Clark was the oldest, having been founded shortly after the 1869 legislature permitted
                    the use of 
            
              26 U.S., Twelfth Census, Population Schedules for

                  Evansville
                 Directory, 1900, pp. 804-937. "Baptistown" was first
                            used in the 1900 directory. Streets with at least 80 percent black residents were Ballard,
                            Brower, Canal (beyond Fourth), Church, Day's Block, Day's Row, Douglass,
                            Gordon, Green's Avenue, Heidelbach (south of Division), McCormick, 
                Mitchell
              , East Nevada, Pearl, Short Eleventh, West 
                Virginia
               (between Eleventh Avenue and 
                St. Joseph
               Avenue), Thiele's Row, and Taylor. All but six were in Baptistown.

                    on Clark Street on the near northwest side of the city, began to offer a high school curriculum in
                    1889. A second school, Governor, was located at Governor and Mulberry streets. The successor to the
                    Upper Colored School situated at Fifth and Chestnut streets, which was founded at the same time as
                    Clark, Governor served Baptistown students. Independence School, founded in the 1880s, was located
                    in the far northwest part of the city, and Third Avenue School, established in the 1890s, educated
                    the black children residing in the northern parts of Wards 4 and 5.27
        
        Churches also served to identify the physical ghetto. The oldest providing continuous service was
                    Liberty Baptist Church, founded in 1865 as the first wave of freedmen began to arrive in 
            Evansville
          . It was located at Seventh and Oak streets. The second oldest, Alexander Chapel African
                    Methodist Episcopal, had been organized in 1869 and was situated on Fifth Street between Chestnut
                    and Walnut. The third oldest, McFar-land Baptist, had been formed in the 1880s as a result of a
                    doctrinal dispute at Liberty. It was located at Cherry and Church streets. Two other churches had
                    been organized in the 1890sâ€”St. John's A.M.E., situated at 37 Bland Street, and
                    the Colored Christian Church, located at 1311 Canal Street. These five churches served the residents
                    of Baptistown. On the far northwest side was Independence Baptist Church, founded in the early 1870s
                    and built at Twelfth Avenue and West 
            Virginia
           Street. Liberty Baptist had established a mission extension at Taylor and Governor
                    streets in the 1890s to serve Oakdale. Two other churchesâ€”Zion A.M.E. at 1704 
            Fulton
           and Free Will Baptist at 12 East Nevadaâ€”were founded in the 1890s to serve
                    blacks near the Beltway on the north side. There were also two churches in a small enclave on the
                    northeast sideâ€”Fifth A.M.E., located at Garfield and 
            Illinois
          , and Mt. Zion Baptist, at 1515 East 
            Louisiana

          . In all there were eleven black churches by 1900. Only one area, the First and High
                    neighborhood, apparently never had a church.28

           factors seem to have contributed to the location of these
                    enclaves. In the first place, occupation and residence were closely related. Most of the coal miners
                    in 1900, for example, resided in two census districts in Ward 4, where two of the city's
                    most prosperous mines were located. Virtually all of the steamboat hands lived on the boats and in
                    the boarding houses of census district 92, a waterfront area of Ward 3. Most of the cooks lived in
                    Ward 2, where there were many hotels and substantial private homes. Domestic servants were
                    concentrated in eleven census districts of Wards 1, 2, and 7, because they either resided in the
                    homes of affluent whites along the Ohio River or walked to work from the old
                    canal area. For the same reason three-quarters of the laundresses and washwomen lived in four census
                    districts in these three wards. In the second place, black residential areas were situated in the
                    least desirable parts of the city, such as the flood-prone, mosquito-ridden environs of Pigeon Creek
                    and the old canal. Given the evidences of growing population density in such areas, moreover, the
                    physical circumstances of black newcomers must have been harsh indeed.29
                    Occupational immobility and residential segregation were the primary, although not the only, signs
                    that life in the northern promised land was far from what it might have been.30
                    Blacks also had to cope with propertylessness and segregated education and with high rates of
                    illiteracy, mortality, and crime. During this period, for instance, blacks held very little
                    property. In 1870 only twenty-nine persons, or 2.1 percent of the city's blacks, held any
                    real property, and the total value of that property, $34,000, was less than 0.5 percent
                    of the total value of city real estate. At the turn of the century the situation was somewhat
                    improved but nevertheless poor. In 1900 about 91 percent of the nearly 1,400 black residences of the
                    city were rented. Ten years later only one in ten blacks owned his home or had a mortgage on it, as
                    compared with four of every ten white heads of household.31

        Blacks also attended separate schools in which conditions were not necessarily equal to those of
                    white schools. The 1869 school law provided no means of guaranteeing equal conditions, and over the
                    succeeding decades local administrators showed little interest in it, either. Black teachers,
                    however qualified, were able to teach only at black schools, and their salaries were lower than
                    those of their white counterparts. The three black schools which existed by the early 1890s were
                    built at an average cost of $13,000, although white schools constructed between 1869 and
                    1891 cost, on the average, $41,000. Building costs per seat in these schools averaged,
                    respectively, $40 and $70. The value of equipment in black schools in 1889 was
                    $3,625; in white schools it was $29,989. Per-pupil equipment costs were, in
                    order, $4.44 and $5.79. Student-teacher ratios in the black schools, however,
                    compared favorably to those in the white schools. In 1891, for example, the ratio at black schools
                    was 33.2 students per teacher; in white schools it was 39.8. Black students were also praised for
                    their eagerness to learn. Superintendent of Schools J. W. Layne reported in 1890, for instance, that
                    black laborers aged fourteen to thirty predominated in the city's evening school program.
                    These persons, he remarked, "who not having had the opportunity to secure an education
                    earlier in life, now eagerly strive to secure at least the ability to read, write, and
                        spell."32
        

        Such an observation may have reflected the poverty of blacks as much as the inequality of educational
                    opportunities. Proportionally fewer blacks of school age than whites attended schoolâ€”in
                    1900, 44.5 percent as compared with 57.9 percent. In addition, the percentage of blacks in high
                    school was consistently lower than the percentage of whitesâ€”for example, in 1897 about 7
                    percent of blacks in school were in high school, as compared with 9 percent of whites. The need for
                    youth to go to work to supplement family income undoubtedly contributed to that situation.33
        

        A striking symptom of these different educational conditions was a high illiteracy rate. In a state
                    with the North's highest illiteracy rates,34 the number of illiterate
                    blacks in this

           Indiana city was staggering. In 1870, 257 of the 324 heads of
                    household, or about 80 percent, were illiterate; in 1880, 388 of 621, or about 63 percent, were. In
                    1870 nearly 45 percent of the illiterates in 
            Vanderburgh County
          , of which 
            Evansville
           was the county seat, were black; in 1900 about 60 percent were. In 1900 
            Evansville
           led Indiana cities in the percentage of illiterate blacks aged ten and
                    olderâ€”26.6 percent. By contrast, the percentage of illiterate native whites was 1.7. 
            Evansville
          's propinquity to the South was undoubtedly one reason for this phenomenon. In 
            Kentucky
          , for example, the city with the lowest black illiteracy rate was 
            Newport
          , which had about the same rate as 
            Evansville

          . The absence of equal educational opportunity must have been, nonetheless, a major
                    factor in determining the illiteracy rate.35
        
        Another aspect of black society in 
            Evansville
           was a high mortality rate. In 1880 and 1890, for instance, one in five persons buried
                    in the city's two public cemeteries was black, even though blacks accounted for one of
                    every eleven residents in the 1890 census. The census of 1900 revealed that, during 1899-1900, the
                    death rate for 
            Evansville

           whites had been 16.9 per 1,000 population, as compared with 22.6 for blacks. For
                    children under one year old, the mortality rates per 1,000 births for whites and blacks were,
                    respectively, 167.1 and 267.6.36

             Archives, 
              Evansville
            ) also attest to high mortality rates. Inquests were conducted in cases in which
                        natural means of death were not considered probable, and there is no reason to believe that
                        these records provide an inherently distorted picture of deaths among blacks and whites. Between
                        1888 and 1894, for example, county coroners conducted 507 inquests, 136 of which involved
                        blacks. Although the black proportion of the county's population in 1890 was about 9
                        percent, the proportion of blacks in these inquests was nearly 27 percent. It is interesting to
                        note the age distribution and the causes of death among blacks. In 1888-1890, half of the blacks
                        who died were aged two and under, and one-quarter were between ages twenty-one and forty. Only
                        one-sixth were aged forty-one or more, a suggestion of the short life expectancy of blacks. The
                        most common causes of death were complications at childbirth and respiratory illnesses. Among
                        whites in the same two-year period, 16 percent of the inquest cases involved children aged two
                        and under, and 21 percent were for persons aged twenty-one to forty. Almost 40 percent involved
                        persons aged forty-one or more. Aside from these differences in age patterns, the causes of
                        death were different.
        
        
        The lowest rung on the social ladder, 
            Evansville

           blacks also contributed disproportionally to the crime rate. Between 1883 and 1892, for
                    example, the proportion of blacks among those arrested by city policemen ranged annually from 19.7
                    to 32.3. Of the 1,808 cases brought to police court in the last three quarters of 1893, blacks were
                    charged in 602, or one-third of the total. In 1895 blacks were the defendants in 748, or 39.4
                    percent, of the 1,898 cases. During the 1880 census five of the thirteen inmates in the city jail
                    were black, as were eleven of the fifteen in the county jail. Between June, 1893, and March, 1894,
                    424 of the inmatesâ€”44.2 percentâ€”were black.37
        

        Such occurrences were symptomatic of growing separation by race and, in turn, undoubtedly contributed
                    to the formal and informal revelations of white racism. In response, blacks created institutions of
                    their own as a means of perpetuating their culture and of providing mutual assistance. The most
                    obvious examples were churches and clubs. In addition to the early evidence of religious
                    institutions, by the early 1870s four lodgesâ€”two each of the Masons and the United
                    Brothers of Friendship (U.B.F.)â€”were organized. A ladies' auxiliary to the
                    U.B.F. was created in 1868. That the black newcomer needed such associations was unmistakable. In
                    May, 1867, for example, U.B.F. Lodge No. 2 held an "Ethiopian Festival" consisting
                    of 
            Of the 147 inquests involving whites, only five listed respiratory illnesses as the cause
                            of death. Twenty-four whites died of heart failure, fifteen were run over by trains, fifteen
                            died of accidental causes like drowning, and eight died of "general
                            debility." Twenty whites committed suicideâ€”three times the rate among
                            blacks. Seven moreâ€”twice the rate of blacksâ€”were murdered. (Interment
                            records at the city's private cemeteries provide no information about blacks, since
                            they were supported by churches which did not admit blacks-Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and
                            Jewish.)

              ). The high incidence of arrest and imprisonment probably stemmed from several
                            causes: the rootlessness of newcomers (for example, in 1895 about 24 percent of the those
                            charged in Police Court were German natives, although the German-born population of the city
                            was about 10 percent); poverty (most of those arrested were laborers or servants); and
                            racism (that is, policemen might have been more likely to arrest blacks than whites).
                            Criminal records for the period indicate that blacks were arrested for such petty crimes as
                            drunkenness, disorderly conduct, vagrancy, and petty larceny. No jail census is provided in
                            the 1900 population schedules (U.S., Twelfth Census, Population Schedules for 
                Vanderburgh County
              , 1900).
          
           several days of music, dance, and banqueting. White observers
                    were not always appreciative of such efforts. The Republican 
            Evansville
          
          Journal intoned that "we presume to their sooty beaux [the black women]
                    looked extremely fascinating" and admitted great surprise that "the order
                    prevailing would have done credit to any assembly."38 The importance of
                    such organizations was underscored by their growth despite the reaction of whites. By the turn of
                    the century there were, in addition to eleven black churches, nineteen associations: two male and
                    two female chapters of the International Order of Odd Fellows; five Masonic lodges; three male and
                    five female units of the U.B.F.; McElroy's Brass Band and Orchestra, founded in 1899; and
                    the Col. John F. Grill Post of the Grand Army of the Republic, founded in 1888. Several associations
                    founded in the 1870s and 1880sâ€”two bands and a marching societyâ€”were defunct
                    by 1900.39
        
        There were also many illustrations that separation by race was the product of extralegal as well as
                    legal forms of racism. The earliest evidence of the former was a reign of terror in early August,
                    1865, following an allegation that two black men had raped a young German Catholic woman on her way
                    to church. The two were lynched, the homes of several blacks were destroyedâ€”including the
                    home of one black resident of twenty yearsâ€”and gangs of whitesâ€”identified by
                    Conrad Baker, the lieutenant governor, as Copperheads and Kentuckiansâ€”threatened to
                    destroy any business which employed blacks. Before order was restored, scores of blacks had fled 
            Evansville

          . In December, 1867, posters appeared in the predominantly German west side, warning the
                    few blacks who had settled there to leave. Such warnings seemed effective: by 1880 few blacks lived
                    west of Pigeon Creek. Political leaders also encouraged separation. Republicans urged party workers
                    to treat blacks as children, and Democrats were openly hostile. In March, 1869, local Democrats held
                    a mass meeting to oppose Indiana's ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment.40

        During the succeeding three decades, formal means gave force to what most whites expressed
                    informally. In some cases state law was the vehicle, such as Indiana's "separate
                    but equal" school law of 1869 or its statutory prohibition of miscegenation. Although the
                    state's Civil Rights Law of 1885 banned discrimination in public accommodations, litigation
                    was difficult and costly for the few blacks who dared to challenge discriminatory practices. In
                    other cases local ordinances and practices were the instrument. A notable example of the pattern of
                    segregation was the 
            Evansville
           Orphan Asylum, which cared for white and black orphans in separate buildings at the
                    west end of Indiana Street. Certain institutions like the 
            Evansville
           Home for the Friendless and the 
            Evansville City

           Hospital never admitted blacks (although the two private hospitals, St. Mary's
                    and Deaconess, had black patients enumerated by census marshals). The employment of black policemen
                    illustrated another trendâ€”exclusion after initial acceptanceâ€” as there were
                    four black policemen in the 1880 federal population schedules and only one in the 1891 city
                    directory. No black policemen were listed in either the 1900 manuscript census or the 1900 city
                        directory.41
        

        By the turn of the century leadership in the black community was predictably reflective of these
                    occupational, residential, and social constraints. In a 1903 Christmas supplement of the Journal-News, a Republican daily, the editor, William W. Ross, featured the civic
                    leaders of the city in such categories as law, religion, medicine, and government. Listed at the end
                    of the publicationâ€”and in no business or professional categoriesâ€”were only two
                    black leaders, S. S. Dupee and J. D. Rouse. Dupee, a physician, was described as "the most
                    prominent and well-to-do-colored man in 
            Evansville
          ." He was head of

                Vanderburgh County
              , 1900; Eleventh Census, Crime, 902; Thornbrough, Since Emancipation, 6-7, 87; 
                
                  Evansville
                 Directory, 1891, pp. 22-51; 
                
                  Evansville

                 Directory, 1900, pp. 20-63. In the manuscript census of 1880, St.
                            Mary's reported ten black patients; in 1900 it reported that three of its
                            twenty-seven patients were black. Deaconess, a newer institution, indicated in 1900 that two
                            of its twenty-one patients were black. Another example of the growing separation by color
                            was the opening of a "Colored" Y.M.C.A. in 1887. To be sure, the lines
                            were not absolute. Some neighborhoods in 1900 were racially mixed, and a few organizations
                            did not exclude blacks. The Hod Carriers Union admitted blacks, although to a separate black
                            chapter. The National Brotherhood of Operative Potters had a racially mixed local in 1900.

                    stores, editor of the "Colored Column" of the Journal-News, and
                    Republican politician who had demonstrated his influence by thwarting the "few colored
                    Democrats" who had tried "to decoy his people to ruin." Rouse, pastor of
                    Liberty Baptist Church, was pictured as a noted orator who had built his church to a membership of
                    2,000 and become an officer of the National Baptist Convention. He was praised as a model father as
                    well, since both of his children were local school teachers.42
        
        In addition to the clergy, the physicians like Dupee and Willis Green, and the black school teachers, 
            Evansville

          's black leadership included such men as Julius Coleman, captain of Hose
                    Company No. 9; William Glover, proprietor of a barbershop at 327 Upper First Street which catered to
                    white businessmen; John W. Roberts, a porter, who was captain of the Bennett Rifles, a drill
                    society; and Augustus Carter, a barber, who led Carter's Quadrille Band. There was,
                    moreover, some evidenceâ€”although slightâ€”of the emergence of a black
                    bourgeoisie, since there were a few black proprietors in the city at each of the federal censuses
                    between 1870 and 1900. One significant problem was that only a handful of these businesses lasted
                    for more than a few years; moreover, those which did well were no more sophisticated than boarding
                    houses, saloons, and small restaurants.43
        
        Above all, patterns of work and residence were the clearest signs of the social structure that had
                    been established in black 
            Evansville
           by 1900. The city's ghetto was unusual among northern cities, for it grew
                    simultaneously with the ethnic sections of 
            Evansville
           and did not replace parts of the city being vacated by ethnics. Its major part,
                    Baptistown, emerged at the eastern edge of the city, not its inner core. By 1900 that enclave was
                    slightly larger in area and substantially larger in the proportion of blacks in the city who lived
                    there. Like the inability of most blacks to rise above menial occupations, Baptistown symbolized the
                    fate of thousands of black southern newcomers who had hoped to find a better life in this gateway to
                    the North. Despite major obstacles to equality, one result of which was undoubtedly a high
                    transiency rate, 
            Evansville
          's black population continued to grow between 1870 and 1900. Between

           1900 and 1930, however, it declined significantly. Perhaps a
                    clue to that decline might be found in the inherent problems of the post-Civil War era. For most
                    black newcomers, the experience in 
            Evansville

           aptly illustrated W. E. B. Du Bois' observation in 1903 that "the
                    Nation has not yet found peace from its sins; the freedman has not yet found in freedom his promised
                        land."44

        The Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company, 1894-1903
        James S. Measellâ‹†
        
        In 1880 there were just four glass manufacturing plants in Indiana; by 1890 the number had increased
                    to twenty-one, and by 1900 there were 110 such establishments. The 1900 census showed Indiana second
                    only to 
            Pennsylvania

           in number of glass factories, total invested capital, average number of wage-earners,
                    total wages, and value of glassware products.1 The discovery of natural gas was
                    largely responsible for this growth, as factories sprang up in many central Indiana towns in the
                    1880s and 1890s, especially in 
            Blackford, Delaware
          , Grant, Howard, 
            Madison
          , and 
            Tipton
           counties. Many gas-belt towns were eager to attract a glass bottle works, a window
                    glass plant, or a glass tableware factory and frequently offered free sites or other inducements.
                    One particularly interesting and successful glass tableware factory was the Indiana Tumbler and
                    Goblet Company, which was begun in 1894 in Greentown, Indiana, a small hamlet near 
            Kokomo
           in 
            Howard County

          . From its modest origin as a family-owned firm making plain utilitarian glassware, the
                    factory developed into a major producer of colored and patterned tableware and novelty items. This

                Cambridge

           brought about expansion of the factory and attracted the
                    attention of 
            Pittsburgh

           businessmen interested in merging a number of tableware concerns. Such a combination
                    was effected in 1899, when Indiana Tumbler and Goblet joined several firms in forming the National
                    Glass Company. Subsequent personnel changes among the consolidated factories brought glass color
                    chemist Jacob Rosenthal to Greentown. Rosenthal perfected two unique glass color formulas which
                    ensured the factory's success. The glass tableware made by the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet
                    Company generally sold well at the time, and in the 1930s the unique colors developed by Rosenthal
                    began to attract the attention of glass collectors. In recent decades several published sources have
                    sustained collectors' interest.2 The establishment of the Greentown
                    Glass Museum in 1970 and the National Greentown Glass Association (a collectors' group) in
                    1974 are the most recent evidences of strong interest in the glassware manufactured more than three
                    quarters of a century ago.
        The history of the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company began with the natural gas boom in central
                    Indiana. When natural gas was discovered in great quantity near Greentown in 1887, the prospects for
                    industrialization must have risen considerably for this farm town of about six hundred inhabitants.
                    The 
            Kokomo
          
          Dispatch predicted a rosy future indeed:
        

          All Greentown is delirious with the fever of a great joy; they have struck natural gas. And well
                        may they rejoice over their lucky find, for it assures them a material blessing that few things
                        else could vouchsafe them. No greater boon to any town just at this juncture of time is
                        conceivable than the possession of an unlimited supply of nature's light and fuel. The
                        possibilities of this

             wonderful new element of civilization and commercial
                        prosperity have as yet scarcely been dreamed of, much less had a practical test. Penetrating the
                        unborn years with prophetic eyes, we see the entire natural gas fields of Indiana, 
              Ohio
             and 
              Pennsylvania
             thickly dotted over with manufacturing industries, and the whole region presenting
                        the appearance to the traveler passing through it on the [railroad] cars as one continuous and
                        vast city. We see 
              Kokomo

             and Greentown united by an unbroken chain of factories, with a belt railroad line
                        connecting the extreme limits of this magnificant |sic| city and all under one municipal
                        government. And all this too, is to be witnessed by generations now living.3
          
        
        Natural gas alone was an insufficient lure, however, and it was not until 1894 that industry was
                    brought to Greentown by the promise of a free industrial site. David C. Jenkins, Jr., an experienced
                    glassmaker and glass factory superintendent, had severed his relationship with the 
            United States
           Glass Company's plant, Factory U, at 
            Gas City

          , Indiana. He was attracted to Greentown through the efforts of Dr. Amos A. Covalt,
                    longtime Greentown physician and real estate developer. Covalt convinced a number of townspeople to
                    subscribe to a land purchase agreement which would provide a site for the factory on the northeast
                    side of Greentown. David C. Jenkins, Jr., and other members of his family applied for a corporate
                    charter as the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company on February 10, 1894. On February 28, Covalt
                    concluded an agreement between Jenkins' firm and the lot subscribers. The pact obligated
                    Jenkins' Indiana Tumber and Goblet Company corporation to construct and operate their glass
                    tableware factory in Greentown in exchange for eventual clear title to the lots upon which the
                    factory and its yard were to be built. Lot subscribers were pledged to contribute $100
                    per lot, subject to the following payment schedule: $20 when the factory foundation was
                    completed; $20 when the buildings were erected; $10 when glass production
                    began; and the remaining $50 in payments of $10 per month thereafter.4 This sort of arrangement was relatively common in western 
            Ohio
           and eastern Indiana during the gas boom of the 1880s and 1890s, as many glass concerns
                    were lured from the Ohio Valley area around Wheeling, West 
            Virginia
          , to the newly discovered gas fields.5 In an editorial headed
                    "Plucky, Lucky Greentown," the 
            Kokomo
          
          Dispatch lauded the "enterprising and progressive men" who
                    brought the factory to Greentown and noted that "every dollar of foreign capital invested
                    in this county is an aid to each and every

                    of her own progressive citizenship deserves the praise of all."6
        
        The 
            Kokomo
           newspaper records the progress of the plant's construction. By the end of
                    April, 1894, a main building ninety by ninety-two feet with a seventy-by-seventy-four-foot extension
                    had been completed, as had an office building, a cooper shop, and two warehouses along a siding
                    provided by the 
            Toledo, St.
                            Louis

           and Western Railway, known locally as the Cloverleaf. Gas
                    wells were drilled and glassmaking furnaces and equipment installed. On June 11, 1894, the Indiana
                    Tumbler and Goblet Company began making glassware, chiefly common tumblers and bar goods such as
                    beer goblets and ale schooners virtually indistinguishable from the products of similar glass
                    factories. David C. Jenkins, Jr., was president of the firm; his father served as
                    secretary-treasurer and as day manager and foreman. An uncle, Thomas Jenkins, was night manager, and
                    the street on which the factory was located was subsequently named Uncle Tom Street in his honor.
                    Lewis Jenkins, another uncle, was in charge of the shipping department. A traveling salesman, Jule
                    Braun, was also employed.7
        

        Shortly after operations began at the factory, the skilled workers organized as Local Union No. 61 of
                    the American Flint Glass Workers Union. This chapter was not a large one; records in 1895 showed
                    forty-seven members with a total weekly payroll of $650, or about $14 per
                    hand. Such wages were earned only by the skilled gatherers, pressers, and finishers; the unskilled
                    "boys," who carried glass tableware items from place to place during the
                    manufacturing process, earned twenty-five or fifty cents per five-hour shift or
                    "turn," as it was called.8 Throughout its history the Indiana
                    Tumbler and Goblet Company seems to have had unusually amicable relations with its unionized
                    employees. Neither the 
            Kokomo
          
          Dispatch nor the publications of the American Flint Glass Workers Union make
                    mention of any strikes or other work stoppages hindering production, which often continued day and
                    night.

        The Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company began to advertise in the weekly trade journals in October,
                    1894, and in January, 1895, the firm participated in the glass trade show at the Monongahela House
                    hotel in 
            Pittsburgh
          .9 This annual display was a longstanding tradition in the glass
                    tableware industry, and the various firms rented suites and erected tables and shelves to show off
                    their products to department store buyers and "jobbers"â€”middlemen who
                    bought at wholesale prices from the factory and sold small lots at slightly higher prices to retail
                    outlets such as grocers and general stores. During the rest of the year glass tableware was sold
                    through manufacturers' representatives in major cities and through the efforts of Jule
                    Braun, the firm's traveling salesman.

                    Company's wares in January, 1895:
        

          The Indiana Tumbler & Goblet Co., Greentown, Ind., the farthest west of any factory of
                        its class, are represented in Glass Fair for the first time, having their goods in room 137,
                        with the veteran Jule Braun in charge. Being a comparatively new factory, their display is not
                        so comprehensive as some others, but what is shown is in all respects first class, and, as new
                        molds are being put in as fast as they can be secured, the Indiana will soon have as big a
                        display as the best of them. They show full lines of tumblers and goblets, wines, etc., plain
                        and engraved, and about as good an assortment of packers' goods as can be seen
                        anywhere. A new departure has been made in the taking up of tableware, and the first essay in
                        that direction must be pronounced a success. It is to be known as No. 11, simulates cut ware
                        closely, and the few pieces thus far completed are very pretty in design as well as brilliant in
                        appearance. The factory only went into operation last June, has been running to its full
                        capacity ever since, and doing a phenomenal business, the trade being highly pleased with the
                        goods. The shipping facilities West and South are superior.10
          
        

        During the next few years the company expanded and prospered through the application of current
                    technology in glassmaking. Another warehouse was built, and a second main building one hundred feet
                    square was added, along with a structure forty by one-hundred feet to house the conveyor-equipped
                    glass cooling ovens or lehrs.11 A large day tank furnace

                    still used today, melted a large quantity of raw material, called "batch," during
                    the night hours in order to have sufficient molten glass ready for the next day's work,
                    which consisted of two five-hour turns. Then the day tank was filled again, and the cycle began
                    anew. The day tank made possible the large-volume production of transparent colored glasses in such
                    hues as amber, blue, canary, and various shades of green.

        In November, 1898, an even greater technological advance took place when a seventy-five ton capacity
                    continuous tank was readied. This apparatus was similar in shape to a large swimming pool; batch was
                    fed into the shallow end, and, as the gas-fed flames played over the raw materials, they melted and
                    became more dense, sliding down toward the deep end. Since raw materials were constantly introduced
                    and molten glass ready to be pressed was continuously withdrawn, this operation was termed a
                    continuous tank. According to the Commoner and Glassworker, the big continuous
                    tank was to be used for clear glass tumblers and jelly glasses.12 The huge
                    volume of production made possible with this equipment no doubt enabled the firm to compete
                    successfully with other concerns.

        The success of glass tableware factories during the 1890s was dependent upon both production volume
                    and the ability to design attractive patterns to catch the public's fancy. All
                    manufacturers strove to produce a sales "winner" year after year. The Indiana
                    Tumbler and Goblet Company's successes were widely reported in both Crockery
                        and Glass Journal and

            , Glass and Pottery Review and Glass and Pottery World, which
                    also noted the firm's new patterns.13 In July, 1897, pattern No. 200,
                    also known as Austrian, was introduced and became an immediate hit. Other successful pattern lines
                    were developed, including No. 137 (Pleat Band) in 1898 and No. 140 (
            Columbia

          ) in 1899. When Admiral George Dewey became a Spanish-American War hero, there was a
                    nationwide rush to commemorate his triumphs with all manner of memorabilia in

                    Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company, although the pattern bore no resemblance to Dewey or to anything
                    even remotely military.14 The association with his name apparently was
                    sufficient to create demand for the glassware.

        Although the 1890s were marked by steady progress for the Greentown-based factory, other plants were
                    not nearly as fortunate. Strikes plagued the Ohio Valley area, and one plant,
                    the Buckeye Glass Company, was burned down during a union dispute.15 Factories
                    in the Findlay, 
            Ohio

          , area were running short of natural gas, especially during cold weather. Competition
                    was keen, particularly in prices for common tumblers, and some factories could not keep pace with
                    such firms as the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company. Neither the nonunion plants nor the union-run
                    cooperative firms were able to match the Greentown factory's prices for tumblers. In 1896
                    the National Glass Budget reported the concern to be "making and selling
                    common tumblers so cheap under union rules as to have made several nonunion firms tired all
                        over."16

        A possible solution for the financial problems caused by intense competition and exacerbated by
                    strikes and other factors was the merger of several companies under the aegis of a parent
                    corporation. Formation of industrial pools, consolidations, and combines was common during the last
                    quarter of the nineteenth century. A glass combination had been attempted in 1891 when fifteen
                    factories formed the 
            United States
           Glass Company. This company got off to a shaky start as natural gas shortages, labor
                    difficulties, and the general economic depression plagued the venture from 1892 to 1897. Individual
                    factories became more specialized, and some factories were shut down as the company strove to
                    maintain its financial stability. By 1898 the 
            United States
           Glass Company had overcome its labor problems and was in reasonably good condition.17
        
        David C. Jenkins, Jr., had been part of the 
            United States
           Glass Company's Factory U at 
            Gas City
          , and he was a prime mover in establishing a new combine of which his Indiana Tumbler
                    and Goblet Company was a part. After several abortive attempts, the National Glass Company was
                    formed in July, 1899. Chartered as a corporation in 
            Pennsylvania
          , it embraced twenty prominent glass tableware firms.18 Jenkins was
                    a member of the initial board of directors, and he held stock in the firm as well. Other board
                    members were: Harry C. Fry, president of the 
            Rochester
           Tumbler Company; John Jamison, president of the 
            Greensburg
           Glass Company; David Baird, president of the Riverside Glass Company; and Daniel C.
                    Ripley, president of the 
            United States
           Glass Company. For some reason Ripley withdrew his interests sometime in August or
                    September, 1899, and the board was reconstituted to bring in other company representatives,
                    including A. Hart McKee of the McKee and Brothers Glass Company, the largest glass tableware factory
                    then operating in the 
            United States

          . Some trade journals speculated that McKee was the driving force behind the scenes for
                    the merger, probably with a view to closing down factories which competed with his own firm and/or
                    stabilizing prices among the combine's members.19

        On November 23, 1899, the National Glass Company announced its formation with full-page notices in
                    all the glass trade journals.20 Nineteen separate factories were listed as
                    member firms:

          ; Robinson Glass Co., 
            Zanesville,
                            Ohio
          ; Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Co.,
                    Greentown, Indiana; Canton Glass Co., 
            Marion
          , Indiana; Beatty-Brady Glass Co., Dunkirk, Indiana; Model Flint Glass Co.,

            Virginia
          ; and Cumberland Glass Co., Cumberland, 
            Maryland

          . Each factory shut down briefly to inventory stock on hand; the Greentown
                    plant's stock exceeded $125,000.21
        
        Although a 
            Kokomo
          
          Dispatch article assured 
            Howard County

           residents that the new combine was only a "gentleman's
                    agreement," fears that local control of the plant would be lost were voiced.22 In fact, the deed and corporate title of the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Company were
                    transferred to the National Glass Company, which had its home office in 
            Pittsburgh
          . Within a few months several of the National's plants were closed, including
                    the Robinson factory in 
            Zanesville

           and the Central Glass Works in Summitville, and there was apprehension that the Indiana
                    Tumbler and Goblet Works also would be closed. In January, 1900, the plant was indeed shut down
                    briefly, and a trade journal carried this disconcerting report: "[A]lthough it is stated
                    that the shut-down is only temporary, it is believed in certain sections that the idleness will be
                    continued for some time."23
        

        The Greentown factory resumed production almost immediately, but during the summer and fall of 1900
                    there were

           major personnel changes. Apparently disenchanted with the
                    combine, David C. Jenkins, Jr., liquidated his stock in the National Glass Company and left
                    Greentown for 
            Kokomo
           to start his own glass factory, incorporated as the 
            Kokomo
           Glass Manufacturing Company.24 The rest of the Jenkins family
                    followed, as did many employees, including salesman Jule Braun and a number of skilled workers. To
                    fill the void the National Glass Company moved William Barris and Jacob Rosenthal to Greentown from
                    the 
            Ohio
           Flint Glass Works to become superintendent and factory manager respectively.
        Rosenthal was an experienced glassworker when he came to Greentown in September, 1900. He began to
                    learn the trade in 1866 when, at age eleven, he toiled as a carrying-in boy at the 
            Pittsburgh
           firm of 
            Campbell
          , Jones and Company. During the next thirty-odd years, he worked at many glass tableware
                    factories on the South Side of 
            Pittsburgh
           and in the upper Ohio Valley area of Martins Ferry, Bridgeport,
                    and Bellaire. He was active in AFGWU affairs and served as president of Local Union No. 15 in
                    Martins Ferry. In 1898 he became manager of the Royal Glass Company in Marietta, 
            Ohio
          , then a new firm. When the Royal was absorbed by the National Glass Company in 1900,
                    Rosenthal was sent to 
            Lancaster, Ohio
          , as manager of the 
            Ohio

           Flint Glass Works. Within a few months he was dispatched to Greentown, where his glass
                    color inventions were to make the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Works one of the few successful glass
                    factories in the rapidly crumbling National combine.25
        
        Rosenthal developed two unique glass colors at Greentown. The first, called Chocolate glass, was an
                    opaque brown glassware ranging in color from a dark, rich chocolate to a light 
            Boston
           coffee hue. The glassware probably was introduced to the public during the Pan American
                    Exposition at Buffalo, 
            New York

          , where the National Glass Company sold souvenirs and erected a small working glass
                    plant. By the close of 1901 the glass trade journals praised Chocolate glass as
                    "novel" and "a glass color winner" while noting that
                    "demand â€¦ has been enormous and almost the entire capacity of a large
                    [continuous] tank has been required to supply it."26 A special menu

                        production.
          
           for Greentown's Union Hotel Christmas day dinner in
                    1901 had this to say about the Greentown glass plant and Chocolate glass: "The Glass
                    Factory, one of the National Glass Company's plants, manufactures the rare Chocolate
                    Glassware that is rapidly making Greentown famous. No other factory produces this ware."
                    Within a few months, however, Rosenthal sold the formula, called the "receipt" by
                    glassworkers, to the National Glass Company, which began to make Chocolate glass in several of its
                    other plants, no doubt to capitalize as much as possible upon its financial success.27
        

        The second glass color creation perfected by Jacob Rosenthal was called Golden Agate. Trade journals
                    reported that he was working on "something new" as early as July, 1902, but Golden
                    Agate was not introduced to the trade until January, 1903, when a full-page color advertisement
                    appeared in Housefurnisher: 
              China
            , Glass and Pottery Review.
          28 The new color was favorably
                    received by the trade, and the factory must have been extraordinarily busy producing it, for more
                    than three dozen items were in the pattern line, a large number as glass pattern lines went.
        The commerical successes of Chocolate and Golden Agate glass were probably overshadowed locally by
                    persistent rumors that the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Works would be dismantled and moved to a
                    location nearer the National Glass Company's 
            Pittsburgh

           headquarters. Only ten of the National's nineteen factories were in operation
                    by March, 1903, and during that year and the next the trade journals carried reports of the
                    company's precarious financial condition.29 Like David C. Jenkins, Jr.,
                    some of the National's former officers, notably Harry C. Fry and Harry North wood, had left
                    the combine to start factories of their own, which, in turn, became successful and competed directly
                    with the National Glass Company. In order to assure the survival of the factory at Greentown, area
                    citizens attempted to raise five thousand dollars in the spring of 1903, much as they had pledged
                    their dollars for the free factory site some nine years earlier.30

        Both the citizens of Greentown and the National Glass Company suffered an economic blow when fire
                    destroyed the Indiana Tumbler and Goblet Works on June 13, 1903. Estimating the loss of buildings,
                    equipment, and stock at $125,000, the 
            Kokomo
          
          Daily Tribune called the calamity "the greatest fire loss that has ever
                    occurred in Greentown and probably the largest that has ever occurred in 
            Howard County
          â€¦." The reporter went on to note the extent of the economic loss to
                    Greentown:
        

          The factory employed 300 men and boys and it's [sic] pay roll yielded to Greentown
                        merchants a very large per cent, of their business. It is the opinion of the people of Greentown
                        that the plant will not be rebuilt and if it is not it will mean a loss of 500 in the population
                        of the town and the emptying of from eighty to one hundred of its houses. The people feel the
                        loss already and are greatly cast down that the factory should be taken from them just when they
                        had been given assurances that it would remain and after they had raised $5,000 to
                        retain it. They know that the company had been wanting to abandon the plant and now that it has
                        burned they feel that it will not be rebuilt.31
          
        

        The National Glass Company quickly decided not to rebuild", but Greentown citizens began
                    raising funds once more in the hope of attracting another glass tableware factory. Crockery and Glass Journal saw this effort as a poor investment, largely because of
                    failing natural gas supplies in the Indiana gas belt.32
        

        Accounts of the fire in local newspapers mentioned no cause for the blaze, but one glass trade
                    journal attributed it to "chemical combustion, the result of water dropping upon a heap of
                        soda."33 About a year after the fire, however, the National Glass
                    Company filed suit against the 
            Toledo, St. Louis
           and Western Railway in 
            Howard County

           Circuit Court, alleging that sparks from a passing locomotive had caused the
                    destruction of the glass plant.34 Legal motions and countermotions were filed
                    during the next two and one-half years, and the suit finally went to trial before a jury on October
                    23, 1906. The 
            Kokomo
          
          Daily Tribune predicted "one of the hardest fought battles seen in a
                    local courtroom in a long time," but rulings on

                            1904, and revealed that the damages requested were $86,591.82.
          
           the admissibility of evidence apparently went against the
                    National Glass Company, and the company dropped the suit abruptly on October 26, 1906.35 The National made another attempt to pursue the suit, however, and it was refiled on
                    February 21, 1907.36 This may have been a ploy to prompt an out-of-court
                    settlement, as the 
            Kokomo
          
          Daily Tribune had speculated earlier,37 for no legal
                    proceedings took place. Whatever its cause, the the fire ended Greentown's industrial
                    history.

        The factory's successes in harnessing natural gas, using available technology, and obtaining
                    key personnel are mirrored today in the reputation of "Greentown glass," as it is
                    known to collectors across the nation. Several reunions of former glassworkers have been held.38 The Greentown Glass Museum displays over seven hundred glassware articles,
                    and the town hosts an annual Greentown Glass Festival on the second weekend in June, marking the
                    anniversary of the factory's demise and the close of a short but significant period in the
                    history of this

           town.

        George Rogers Clark and the Campaign in the West: The Five Major Documents
        
          Robert M. Suttonâ‹†
          
        
        To be told that the only American invasion during the Revolutionary War in which enemy territory was
                    captured and retained was George Rogers Clark's foray into the 
            Illinois
           Country in the late 1770s would surprise most Americans. Nonetheless, this was true.
                    Not nearly so well known in American revolutionary history as the thrilling drama of 
            Lexington
           and Concord, the gallant defense of Bunker Hill, or the inspired
                    victories at Trenton and 
            Princeton
          , the western campaign of Clark and his intrepid band of riflemen culminating in the
                    occupation of 
            Kaskaskia
           in 1778 and the recapture of 
            Vincennes
           in 1779 is certainly one of the great epics of American history.
        Clark had been commissioned by Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia to raise a force of frontier
                    volunteers and had been furnished with two sets of orders. The public orders directed him to use his
                    small army to defend 
            Kentucky
           (then a county of 
            Virginia
          ) against the attacks of Indians led by British agents, while the secret orders
                    authorized him to carry the war deep into enemy territory. This would mean attacking the English
                    strongholds in the 
            Illinois
           Country, north of the 
            Ohio River
          . The interaction of Colonel Clark and his men with the British, French, and Indians of
                    the region constitutes the story of the war in the West. Even though Clark was continually
                    frustrated in his efforts to capture 
            Detroit

           and completely neutralize the western Indians, he was successful in disrupting British
                    military plans as well as in persuading a number of tribes to cease their attacks on American
                    frontier settlements.

           In spite of disappointments and setbacks the American presence
                    was never completely removed until the vast Northwest became a part of the 
            United States
           with the signing of the Treaty of 
            Paris
           in 1783.
        The sources upon which Clark historiography rests are extensive and reasonably well known. In
                    attempting to account for the abundance of Clark manuscripts, one must remember that he was a
                    respected 
            Virginia
           military officer, honored with high rank and bearing enormous responsibilities. In this
                    capacity he had a voluminous official correspondence in addition to a modest private correspondence.
                    Furthermore, he belonged to a large, harmonious, and affectionate family who corresponded
                    extensively and who saved their letters and papers with such enthusiasm and industry that the
                    historian is often torn between admiration and despair.
        In preserving these materials the pioneering work of Lyman C. Draper stands out above all others.
                    Draper intended to write a biography of George Rogers Clark and collected material in a most
                    aggressive fashion for several decades with that aim in view. The result is that a great body of
                    information, much of it contemporary in nature, is available in the Draper Collection housed in the
                    State Historical Society of 
            Wisconsin,
                            Madison
          . In fact, the Clark Papers
                    constitute the largest single collection in the Draper manuscripts. Another sizeable body of
                    Clark-related papers is to be found in The Filson Club of 
            Louisville, Kentucky
          . Much
                    of it placed there by Temple Bodley, it represents his searches in connection with his Clark
                    biography published in 1926. The 
            Virginia
           State Archives' collection of Clark documents consists of nearly twenty
                    thousand individual items, including the long-lost financial records and accounts which were
                    discovered in the attic of the 
            Virginia
           Capitol in 1913.1 Additional Clark papers are located in the 
            Missouri
           Historical Society (
            St. Louis
          ), in the Library of Congress, and in the collected works of such prominent Americans as
                    George 
            Washington
          , Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and George Mason.
        The most readily available and thus the most useful published collection of Clark documents is the
                    magnificent James Alton James edition which comprises two volumes in the long series of

           1781-1784 make up Volume XIX.2 There has been no systematic collection
                    and publication of Clark papers covering the period 1785 to the year of his death, 1818.

        One of Clark's recent biographers has called attention to the irony inherent in the fact
                    that he is perhaps the most copiously documented American frontier hero, and yet one of the least
                        known.3 Though the most familiar biographies of Clark were written in the
                    twentieth century, a sizeable body of Clark literature developed during the nineteenth century. Not
                    surprisingly much of this took the form of hero-worshipping homage not always reserved for
                    mythological figures.
        There are those who believe that Clark intended to be his own biographer and that the Memoir (which will be discussed at greater length later in the article) represented only

           preliminary phase of a much larger work.4
                    Unfortunately, Clark's effort carried the story only through 1779, and that portion which
                    he did finish lay in obscurity for many years. As time passed, Clark's fame was confined
                    more and more to his admiring family and to a small group of devoted friends, most of whom lived in
                    the immediate vicinity of 
            Louisville
          . His death in 1818 seems to have gone unnoticed beyond the borders of his own state.

        Interest in a Clark biography persisted, nevertheless, and a younger brother, William (of Lewis and
                    Clark fame) was diligent in collecting and preserving many of the family papers and documents. Dr.
                    John Croghan, a nephew, seriously considered undertaking the biographical task and actually went to
                    the length of recovering a number of Clark's papers which had been previously lent to
                    several prospective biographers.5 At about the same time, both Jared Sparks and 
            Washington
           Irving indicated a flicker of interest in the Clark story. Sparks actually made
                    overtures to the heirs in 
            Louisville
           for material which would have enabled him to include Clark in his series of American
                    Biographies, but he did not receive sufficient encouragement to pursue his plan. Irving stopped in 
            Louisville

           while on a western tour in 1832 and was approached by friends of Clark with the request
                    that he undertake the biography. Engaged at the time with what must have been less noble themes,
                    Irving missed the opportunity to work his magic on the Clark saga.6 The
                    temptation is strong to speculate on how differently this portion of western history might have been
                    received if either Sparks or Irving had been willing "to bring General Clark
                    forward," as Thomas Jefferson once phrased it.7
        
        On at least four other occasions during the first half of the nineteenth century serious beginnings
                    were made to produce an adequate and reliable Clark biography. All of them came to either failure or
                    frustration, however, in a mournful repetition of tragedy and unfavorable circumstance. Two of the
                    would-be authors met violent and untimely deaths, a third soon left the area as a result of a
                    federal appointment in 
            New Orleans
          , and the fourth seems simply to have lost interest in the project.8

          , 1834) contained the first lengthy treatment of Clark's 
            Illinois
           mission, but he, too, failed in his earlier intention to produce a full-length life of
                    Clark.

        One figure stands alone among the company of individuals who entertained the hope of writing the
                    definitive biography of George Rogers Clark. That person is Lyman Copeland Draper, and the fact that
                    he, too, failed in his life-long ambition to produce the Clark opus is largely forgotten in the
                    light of his truly prodigious accomplishment. "I am very passionately devoted to the
                    Pioneer history of the romantic West," Draper wrote in 1842. "My tastes and
                    predilections long since led me into the inviting field of Western pioneer historyâ€”so
                    much of which has been but partially and imperfectly explored. I have found it a far richer field of
                    epic than I had dared to hopeâ€”so much so that I shall doubtless make it â€¦ the
                    study of my whole life."9
        
        For almost fifty years Draper translated that intention into restless action. Though his interest in
                    western history was wide-ranging, he never abandoned his Clark study, and he pursued every possible
                    source of information with a spirit and a relentlessness which can be exhausting even to his
                    readers. His conception was encyclopedic. In the course of his searching he visited both 
            Washington
           and 
            Richmond
           and spent weeks copying from the archives there. He had copies of pertinent documents
                    made for him in the British and Spanish archives; he corresponded with the families of the British
                    officers captured by Clark; he visited and interviewed every available relative or descendant of the
                    Clark family; and he sought out as many of those who constituted Clark's army as he could
                    find. He learned all he could about the routes Clark followed and the exact position of every
                    camping place, river, or ford mentioned on the way. He sought information about Clark's
                    personal characteristics and habits; bits and pieces of information, no matter how trivial, found
                    their way into his notes. At the Sanitary Fair in 
            Cincinnati
           in 1863, he was able to purchase the papers of the Bowman, Logan, and Pogue
                    familiesâ€”all 
            Kentucky
           pioneers. Such activity continued for the remainder of his life.10

           limited sense of the word. Disappointed in his own failure to
                    leave behind published works of timeless value, he has placed later generations in his debt by his
                    indefatigable efforts to preserve the warp and woof of history. But for Draper's protecting
                    care, who can estimate how many valuable sources might have been lost to later generations? And
                    instead of leaving a life of Clark, magnificent as that might have been, his efforts and
                    achievements have made possible not one but many Clark biographies. Thanks to Draper,
                    Clark's exploits do not require romantic exaggeration; the man and his character are
                    fascinating without the addition of myth and legend.

        This one fact stands out: quite apart from the availability of evidence and the manner in which that
                    evidence is handled, all studies of George Rogers Clark and the Revolutionary War in the West rest
                    on five major historical sources, all of which arose directly out of the frontier campaign.11 Truth is often said to be stranger than fiction. The contemporary records
                    which describe Clark's mission to 
            Illinois
           in 1778 and 1779, having stood the test of time, have a ring of verisimilitude about
                    them. Needing no apology and requiring no embellishment, they have emerged after nearly two
                    centuries of scrutiny as trustworthy accounts of an incredible series of events. The leading
                    American sources for the history of the West between 1777 and 1779 are Clark's diary, which
                    records scattered events between December 25, 1776, and March 30, 1778; his journal, which gives the
                    earliest known account of events, after February 23, 1779, connected with the capture of 
            Vincennes
          ; and Joseph Bowman's journal, which contains entries from January 29 to March
                    20, 1779, and which describes the 
            Vincennes
           expedition in somewhat more detail and often in very human terms.12
                    Much of the information concerning the hardships and suffering endured on the 
            Vincennes
           march comes from the Bowman Journal. All three of these accounts are
                    briefâ€”both in terms of space and time. Two additional sources, each longer and much more
                    detailed than those mentioned above, round out the contemporary (and not so contemporary)
                    information on Clark and his 
            Illinois
           venture.

        The first of these is the so-called Mason letter. This remarkable document, forty printed pages in
                    length, was addressed to George Mason, the noted Virginian and longtime

              12 All of these documents are printed in the James edition of the

           friend of Clark and his family. It was dated November 19, 1779,
                    which means that it was written almost nine months after the recapture of 
            Vincennes

          . James believed that one of Clark's companions, more literate than the
                    general, acted as his secretary in writing the letter and may have helped with its composition. The
                    signature, clearly, is in Clark's own hand.13 The location of the Mason
                    letter was unknown for a number of years. Correspondence reveals that Clark, while composing his
                    memoir, sought unsuccessfully to ascertain its whereabouts.14 Some years later
                    Draper discovered it in the possession of Mason's grandson, Colonel John Mason. The younger
                    Mason refused to give the document to Draper but assured him of his intention to deposit it in a
                    public institution for safekeeping. Colonel Mason subsequently placed it in the 
            Kentucky

           Historical Society, where it remained until that organization was dissolved at a later
                    date. Soon after the close of the Civil War the narrative was in the possession of Henry Pirtle,
                    former president of the society, who permitted it to be published, perhaps for the first time, in
                        1869.15 At the time James completed the first volume of the Clark Papers (1912) the original letter was still in the hands of the Pirtle family, in
                    the possession of Judge James S. Pirtle of 
            Louisville
          . Following his death the Mason letter was purchased by the president of The Filson
                    Club, Rogers Clark Ballard Thruston, who presented it to the library of that eminent society. It is
                    certainly one of the most valuable existing documents of American history and the only major Clark
                    paper from that period which did not become part of the Draper Collection.
        Considerably more controversy has swirled about the Clark memoir, which is the last and longest of
                    the five major sources of information on the 
            Illinois
           campaign.16 Theodore Roosevelt, historian, was one of
                    Clark's severest critics, and it was toward the memoir that Roosevelt directed much of his
                    fire. The document consists of 128 manuscript pages, and the original is in the State Historical
                    Society of 
            Wisconsin
          . It provides by far the

        Undoubtedly, Clark had been importuned from time to time to provide more information concerning
                    events with which he had been connected during the war years. There began, during the summer of
                    1789, an interesting exchange of correspondence between Clark and John Brown, Kentucky's
                    territorial delegate to the new federal Congress. 
            Brown

           pointed out that "posterity will regret the loss of what would constitute the
                    most interesting Pages in the Annals of the Western World & would be an ornament to the
                    History of the American Revolution," adding that "All wish to know it &
                    you alone are in possession of this Information â€¦,"17
        
        Clark, already entered upon that dreadful treadmill of loneliness and despair which was to shadow the
                    remainder of his life, replied somewhat bitterly that to comply with 
            Brown

          's request would result in "destroying a resolution that I have long
                    concluded on, that of burying the rise and progress of the War in this quarter in oblivion; which is
                    in my power, as all light cast on it by another person, must be faint indeed." At several
                    points in the letter Clark's animus boils over. For him, the victorious leader, the war in
                    the West had brought only sorrow and ruin. He could not, he said, "be void of some
                    affection for the people I had suffered so much for," and for that reason he had destroyed
                    many of the papers that aroused his sense of injustice and "tend to aggravate the crime of
                    the people." By removing himself from the reminders of the indignities which he had
                    suffered, it was his hope that "I might again reconcile myself to live in a country that I
                    was always fond of, and with people whose prosperity I have, until lately, studied with
                        delight."18
        
        Eventually, Clark settled down to writing his memoir after apparently considering at first trying to
                    provide the documents and having it "ghostwritten." In his initial letter 
            Brown
           had indicated that James 
            Madison

           was very much interested in the project and was willing, if Clark would furnish the
                    material, to provide it with an "arrangement & Style so as to usher it into the
                    world in a Dress suitable to the importance of the Subject."19 Clark
                    seems to have composed the bulk of the memoir in 1789 and 1790 and to have completed it in 1791.

           finished, nothing in particular seems to have been done with
                    it. Neither Jefferson nor 
            Madison
           mention it in their correspondence, and 
            Brown

           seems to have forgotten that he ever asked its author to write it. That it was
                    preserved at all may be due to the concern which William Clark had for family records and
                        documents.20 Attention was first called to the memoir in 
            Butler
          's History of the Commonwealth of 
              Kentucky
            

          , published in 1834; John B. Dillon, who apparently owned a copy, made
                    extensive use of it in his Historical Notes of the Discovery and Settlement of the
                        Territory of the 
              United States
             Northwest of the River 
              Ohio
            

          , which appeared in 1843. Dillon subsequently published the memoir in a
                    slightly abridged form in his History of Indiana (
            Indianapolis
          , 1859). How Draper came into possession of the original is not known, but he did, and,
                    as mentioned earlier, this priceless document has rested in the responsible care of the State
                    Historical Society of 
            Wisconsin
           for nearly a century.
        These five personal and (except for the memoir) very nearly contemporary records furnish the
                    foundation for our knowledge of the Revolutionary War in the West. Taken together they provide a
                    valid and dependable narrative of events in 
            Illinois
           during 1778 and 1779. It is an exciting and rewarding experience to compare the
                    documents and to note the points and places at which they depend on each other. While it is possible
                    in most cases to check salient events from the vantage point of two or more of the original
                    documents, each document has an independence and an integrity of its own which contributes to its
                    credibility.
        For example, when Clark was getting down to serious work on the memoir (in 1790), he tried
                    unsuccessfully to recover the long letter (or a copy thereof) which he had written to Mason more
                    than a decade earlier. Consequently, the Mason letter is not a possible source or point of origin
                    for the memoir, nor is the memoir merely an enlarged version of the Mason letter. Granting the
                    influence of memory (and Clark possessed a remarkably sharp and active one), the two documents were
                    written independent of one another and yet are in basic agreement; the points' of
                    difference are remarkably few and relatively insignificant. The memoir is more than twice as long as
                    the Mason letter, much more detailed, and covers a longer span of time.

        On the other hand, it is entirely possible that Clark still had the original of his diary in his
                    possession while he was 
            
              20 Bakeless, Background to Glory, 7, 350.
          
           writing the memoir. The diary provides a sketchy record of
                    events between Christmas Day, 1776, and the spring prior to his departure for the 
            Illinois
           country.21 In both documents the facts are related in much the same
                    order, and there is often only slight variation in the statements, although the memoir is far more
                    complete. Clark must have felt himself fortunate at that point, for all who reconstruct a narrative
                    of past events recognize the value of a log or even a sketchy diary.

        Ironically, Clark was not able to use the journal, which he seems to have prepared just prior to the
                    surrender of Fort Sackville and subsequent to that event.22 This more or less
                    official message was being carried to Governor Patrick Henry by one of Clark's trusted
                    messengers, William Myers, when the latter was ambushed and killed by Indians near the falls of the 
            Ohio
          .23 As a result of this unhappy occurrence the fragmentary journal
                    found its way into British hands and rests today in the British Museum in 
            London
           where it can be viewed by interested persons. Three weeks after the death of Myers,
                    Clark prepared another account of the fall of 
            Vincennes

          ; guarding against a similar mishap, he made more than one copy. The official dispatch
                    was again directed to Governor Henry with a copy going to Thomas Jefferson,24
                    who succeeded Henry as governor of 
            Virginia
           on June 1, 1779.

        Most of the controversy which has arisen concerning the historicity of the Clark-related documents
                    has focused on the memoir, and much of that was generated by Roosevelt. Throughout most of the
                    nineteenth century those authors who touched on the war in the West or who brought Clark into their
                    state histories accepted (though perhaps uncritically) the reliability of the memoir.25 Not only historians, but novelists also, such as Winston Churchill in The
                        Crossing (1904) and Maurice Thompson in Alice of 
              Old Vincennes
            

           (1900), drew heavily upon it and accepted the statements found there seemingly
                    without hesitation.26
        

        It remained for Roosevelt to first question the memoir as an historical source. In volume two of his
                        The Winning of the West, he wrote: "It was written at the desire of
                    Presidents

          ; and therefore some thirty or forty years after the events of which it
                        speaks."27 Of course, Roosevelt was both ill informed and in error
                    on this point.28 Still, he believed the manuscript contained "some
                    rather serious errors" and described it as "written by an old man who had
                    squandered his energies and sunk into deserved obscurity."29 Clark was,
                    in fact, about thirty-eight years old when the memoir was composed, though, of course, Roosevelt had
                    miscalculated its time of preparation. While indulging in an almost savage indictment of Clark,
                    Roosevelt also revealed an early flicker of what is sometimes described as the prejudice of the
                    eastern literary establishment when he wrote: "Unfortunately, most of the small western
                    historians who have written about Clark have really damaged his reputation by the absurd inflation
                    of their language â€¦. Moreover, they base his claims to greatness not on his really great
                    deeds, but on the half-imaginary feats of childish cunning he related in his old age."30 One cannot but wonder whether in Roosevelt's view the mid-winter
                    march to 
            Vincennes
          , which occupied more than twenty pages in the memoir, would come under the heading of
                    "really great deeds" or "half-imaginary feats of childish
                    cunning!"

        While it would be futile to attempt to prove that the memoir is trustworthy in every detail, it
                    receives generally high marks for accuracy and authenticity when compared with the other documents
                    of the period. History is clearly on the side of "the small western historians who have
                    written about Clark." The Rooseveltian disservice to Clark's memory (as well as to
                    his veracity) was a momentary thing, now largely forgotten.31 There are
                    literally dozens of events described in the memoir which can be compared with one or more of the
                    contemporary documents. The conclusion is certainly warranted that the memoir is not made up of the
                    recollections and reminiscences of an old man seeking to be dramatic even as he sought public
                    recognition and approval. To grant that the memoir may not be

              . Actually the request mentioned Mr.

              31 Temple Bodley refers to Roosevelt as the "ever brilliant
                            but superficial and reckless Roosevelt" and suggests that except for what he found
                            in books, he knew little of western history or of Clark. Bodley, "Clark's

           as authoritative on a particular point as are some of the other
                    contemporary documents detracts little from its overall worth and historical value. At the very
                    least the memoir must be accepted as a trustworthy supplement to all of them.32
        

        Perhaps a final observation is in order concerning the journal kept by Captain (later Major) Joseph
                    Bowman, one of Clark's most valuable commanders. Of the five original documents examined
                    here, this is the only one not authored by Clark. There is clear evidence that Clark had access to a
                    copy of it or was thoroughly familiar with it when he was working on the memoir.33 Prepared under the most trying of circumstances, one can only marvel at the discipline and
                    fortitude of leaders who managed to keep an almost daily record of events in the face of nearly
                    indescribable obstacles. The remarkable thing is that any of the contemporary diaries and journals
                    actually composed in the field ever survived. Bowman's journal did not.34 Though the original has never been located, copies exist in the George 
            Washington
           Papers in the Library of Congress and in the Draper Collection. A copy was published in
                    the 
            Louisville
          
          Literary News, for November 24, 1840, and Henry Pirtle included it in his Colonel George Rogers Clark's Sketch of his Campaign in the 
              Illinois
             in 1778-79 (
            Cincinnati
          , 1869). Clearly one of the key sources of primary evidence in reconstructing the Clark
                    record, its account of the hardships which drove Clark's men to the limits of physical
                    endurance on their march to 
            Vincennes
           has taxed the credulity of readers from that day to this.

        The unknown author (apparently one of his own men) who later revised Bowman's journal has
                    left a most fitting and thoughtful epitaph for Clark and his gallant band. "Although a
                    handful in comparison to other armies, they have done themselves and the cause they were fighting
                    for, credit and honor, and deserve a place in History for future ages; that their posterity may know
                    the difficulty their forefathers had gone through for their liberty and freedom."35

        Over the past century no state's electorate has been more fully mobilized or strongly
                    partisan than Indiana's. The persistence of these characteristics belies attempts to
                    explain them as responses to candidate personalities, particular clusters of issues, or dramatic
                    events. Instead, they reflect the active and partisan orientations toward electoral politics that
                    have characterized most Hoosier voters.
        
          Voting in Indiana documents these aspects of the state's electoral scene.
                    To do so it uses state-and county-level election results, and it supplements these with some
                    exploration of sub-county (i.e., city and township) returns and data describing county
                    office-seeking. Its use of aggregate-level voting and census materials to decode patterns of

           locates this book squarely within an older but venerable
                    tradition of election analysis.

        While that tradition originated in the late nineteenth century, it reached its apex in the 1950s in
                    the seminal work of V. 0. Key, Jr.1 Since the 1950s, however, political
                    scientists have increasingly turned to analysis of survey data, or to "interviewing samples
                    of the electorate" (p. 131), as these authors phrase it. That shift in emphasis reflected
                    the growing influence of psychological approaches to the study of politics. In conjunction with the
                    computer revolution, the refinement of sampling techniques, and the development of better
                    statistical procedures to analyze non-interval data, this influence served to reorient the study of
                    electoral politics. The older approach, which posed its questions of aggregate election returns,
                    largely was displaced by a new line of inquiry that focused on how the individual voter arrived at
                    the voting decision and on the psychological components of that decision.2
                    Voting-behavior studies, in other words, displaced election studies.

        Three decades of survey-based analyses of voting behavior have considerably advanced our knowledge of
                    the individual-level dynamics underpinning party selection and voting decisions. But they have not
                    summed to a better understanding of the linkages between these microlevel behaviors and the larger
                    sociopolitical contexts within which they have been shaped. In fact, most survey-based
                    investigations implicitly have assumed that for all practical purposes the macrolevel variables can
                    be treated as constants. Yet even a simple comparison of the political attitude linkages that marked
                    the mid-1950s with those that characterized the late 1960s and 1970s should lead us to wonder
                    whether changing macrolevel contexts produced the observed differences. It is plausible to argue
                    that the transformation of the organized political alternatives available to the public gave rise to
                    changes in the microlevel behaviors contingent upon them. Exploring and explaining these
                    across-level linkages surely must now be a high analytic priority.3

        To address that priority we cannot depend exclusively on survey data. Such data are timebound, and
                    scholars have available a relatively consistent time series of survey responses covering only three
                    decades. Aggregate-level time series can be constructed for much longer periods and thus make
                    possible a dynamic analysis across changing historical contexts. Analyses of aggregate data, then,
                    must be viewed as indispensable to resolving an important analytic problem. Detailed studies that
                    use such data, if well designed and executed, can make important contributions to
                    the development and/or proper specification of theory. But that is a big if, and it is one that Voting in Indiana fails to satisfy.

        On at least three major counts, this is a disappointing book. First, despite its avowed interest in
                    persistence and change, it does not give the "attention to trends over time" that
                    it claims (p. 237). Indeed, there is a curiously static quality to much of its description and
                    discussion. True, there are presentations of data averaged for specified election sequences (e.g.,
                    the unnumbered data arrays on pp. 26-28); summary classifications for designated periods (e.g.,
                    Table V-l, p. 91, and Tables VI-1 and VI-2, pp. 100-101); and cross-sectional measures of
                    association for different time points (e.g., Table XI-6, p. 187, and Figure XIII-1, p. 214). But
                    nowhere do the authors present a longitudinal analysis of their data. Yet
                    time-series analysis is the proper approach for detecting trends over time. While long a part of the
                    technical arsenal of econometricians, the application of time-series analytic procedures to election
                    data is by no means novel.4 More to the point, the failure to utilize
                    longitudinal procedures simply prevents the authors from seeing important trends present in their
                    data.

        Second, the book is intentionally a descriptive and atheoretical exploration. The result of that
                    strategic decision is a "roaming inspection of congruities and disparities of
                    behavior" (p. 240). And emphasis must be added to the word roaming, for
                    findings are reported in a remarkably diffuse fashion, unlinked either to theory or to other
                    election studies. Consequently, the book is as heavy on data presentation as it is light on
                    interpretation. And as one struggles through the opaquely phrased descriptions of these data arrays,
                    the same questions recur. What do the data mean? What do they tell us of the

           operation of Indiana's electoral system? Even more
                    importantly, what do they suggest of the individual-level behavior that shaped them? Where in this
                    mass of data is the Indiana voter? How do we extract from these tables some sense of the Indiana
                    voter's orientations toward electoral politics and political parties?
        These authors could not have tackled such questions with the statistical procedures they used. This
                    limitation stands as the third overarching weakness of the book. The authors rely heavily on
                    descriptions of percentages, averages, and cross-classifications, occasionally supplementing these
                    with correlational techniques and a limited application of multiple regression procedures. But the
                    bulk of the findings are reported in descriptive terms, too frequently without any easy-to-grasp
                    summary measure of the behavior being investigated. That often obscures the point the authors want
                    to convey, but even more seriously it sometimes prevents them from seeing important patterns that a
                    more rigorous data analysis could have detected.

        The heavy reliance on descriptive statistics has an even more disabling consequence: the book loses
                    sight of the Indiana voter. Because these authors used aggregate data, they speak of counties (or
                    other geographic units) and not of voters. In other words, they not only recognize
                    the problem of ecological fallacy but allow their analysis to be paralyzed by it. It is true, as W.
                    S. Robinson pointed out in 1950, that the correlation between two variables calculated across some
                    set of geographic units cannot be presumed to be an accurate measure of the association between
                    those variables among the individuals within those units.5 But it is also true,
                    as others have shown since then, that ecological regression procedures can be used to generate
                    unbiased estimates of the underlying individual-level relationships.6 The
                    application of such techniques to the data base available to these authors could have produced an
                    important analysis of voting behavior. That would have been especially likely had they used the
                    opportunity to test hypotheses

           derived from the survey-based research of the past two decades.
                    Such a study would have made an important contribution to our understanding of the ways in which
                    macrolevel contexts shape microlevel behaviors. It would have deservedly earned a place at the
                    cutting edge of the subfield.
        But these authors have written a different book, the reading of which evokes a peculiar sense of
                    dÃ©jÃ  vu. Its research design, its statistical procedures, and even its quaint
                    (and sometimes rococo) manner of expression remind one more of works published before 1950 than of
                    those dating from the late 1970s. Still, because this is a book which reports a mass of information
                    on important aspects of Indiana's electoral politics, it is only reasonable to assess it on
                    its own terms. How well have these authors described the past and present patterns and trends of
                    Indiana's electoral politics? What do they explain of the state's patterns of
                    turnout and partisanship? More importantly, what clues do their data offer concerning that matrix of
                    political and cultural expectations that shaped the electoral behavior of the Indiana voter?

        Typically, evaluative essays of this sort summarize findings, praise or criticize, and perhaps
                    suggest some unasked questions in the hope that someone at some later time will pursue them. But
                    otherwise they do not contribute much to the accumulation of knowledge. In this instance, however,
                    since I have access to much of the state-and county-level data that these authors explored, it is
                    possible to probe the data either to supplement their descriptions or to pose new lines of
                        inquiry.7 The objective of this somewhat unconventional approach is simple:
                    to restore the Indiana voter to the study of the state's electoral politics.
        We can begin by examining one of the hallmarks of the Indiana electorateâ€”its high rate of
                    mobilization. Two chapters of this book (chapters 2 and 13) are devoted to discussions of electoral
                    turnout, and the topic also is dealt with at other appropriate points. That attention is merited,
                    for, as these authors correctly surmise, since the 1870s the state's turnout rates have
                    been among the highest in the nation.
        
          
            7 The Indiana census and voting data are from larger files of state-and
                        county-level data for all nonsouthern states covering the 1840-1972 period. In addition to data
                        for presidential, congressional, and gubernatorial elections obtained from ICPSR, I have
                        compiled files of county-level returns for two minor statewide offices for sixteen states,
                        including those for secretary of state and state treasurer for Indiana. Since the analysis of
                        the returns for federal and minor state offices produced quite similar results, throughout this
                        essay I have opted to present the measures derived from the use of presidential and
                        congressional vote returns.
        
        

        But having said that, there is surely much more that we need to know about the long-term trends
                    displayed by the turnout data. Because these authors never systematically examined the time-series
                    data, they are either unable to detect discrete trends or they misidentify empirical breakpoints in
                    the series. If we analyze the 1840-to-1978 data longitudinally, we can use the peak cutpoints to
                    decompose the full time series into discrete turnout eras. Each of the two statistically independent
                    approaches that I have used for that purpose point to four such eras in Indiana's turnout
                        series.8 The years included in each of these are reported in Table I, as are
                    the turnout means for each sequence and the regression slope and r2 generated by
                    regressing the turnout value on "time" for each of the indicated periods.

        The message of Table I is clear: while Indiana's turnout may now be "high"
                    compared with that of other states, it is considerably lower than it used to be. Each succeeding era
                    has witnessed a decline in the general level of mobilization. The 
            
              8 The time-series analysis used follows Burnham, Critical
                                Elections, 13-14. Both longitudinal t tests and discontinuity coefficients were
                            calculated separately for presidential and off-year congressional series. In isolating the
                            key transition points the two procedures produced identical results. It is important to
                            observe that the estimates of the size of the eligible electorate that were used to
                            calculate turnout took into account the legal requirements that pertained in Indiana at each
                            election. For the details on the procedures and census data used to make those estimates,
                            see Paul Kleppner and Stephen C. Baker, "The Impact of Voter Registration
                            Requirements on Electoral Turnout, 1900-16" (paper presented at the annual meeting
                            of the American Political Science Association, 
                Washington
              , D.C., August-September, 1979), Appendix A.
          
           high turnout means and reasonably steep positive trends that
                    marked the nineteenth century gave away after 1900 to lower participation rates accompanied by steep
                    negative trends.9 And it is important to notice that these negative trends set
                    in before the 1911 imposition of personal registration or the 1920 enfranchisement of women.10 The New Deal produced a participation surge, as the authors point out
                    (especially p. 113), but that tended to fade by 1940. As a result, while the longer 1928-to-1960
                    period again shows lower turnout means than its immediate predecessor, they are accompanied by
                    relatively mild negative slopes. Developments since 1960, however, have been of a quite different
                    order. Not only have the turnout means again declined, but their associated negative trends are
                    steeper than those for any other period in the state's history.
        What such data testify to is the across-time demobilization of the Indiana
                    electorate. This began at the turn of the century, but its pace has become especially rapid over the
                    past two decades. As we shall see below the longitudinal rhythm exhibited by the turnout data
                    parallels rather neatly that displayed by other critical indicators of the performance of
                    Indiana's electoral system.

        However, the data in Table I provide still further insight into the character of the state's
                    electoral turnout. Notice, for example, the difference in the size of the turnout means for
                    presidential and off-year congressional elections within each time segment. As we would expect, the
                    off-year means are consistently smaller than their presidential-year counterparts. The high stimulus
                    normally associated with presidential campaigns tends to draw into the active electorate some
                    citizens who would otherwise stay home. That much is hardly novel, 
            
              9 If we examine only the 1876-1892 elections, turnout was even higher:
                            the presidential turnout mean = 93.4 percent, and that for off-year Congress = 84.1 percent.
            
              10
              Voting in Indiana (p. 27) notices this absolute decline, attributing it
                            largely to the legal changes. But neither of these developments, nor both of them together,
                            serves as a sufficient explanation. For a systematic empirical assessment of the role of
                            voter registration laws see Kleppner and Baker, "Impact of Voter Registration
                            Requirements." A shorter version of this paper will be published in a forthcoming
                            issue of the Journal of Political and Military Sociology. The impact of
                            female enfranchisement in Indiana was weaker than these authors presume. In fact, both the
                            1916-1920 presidential and the 1918-1922 congressional turnout declines were smaller than
                            would have been predicted on the basis of the turnout trend over the five preceding
                            elections of each type; for the Indiana data and those for all other nonsouthern states, see
                            Paul Kleppner, "The Impact of Woman Suffrage on Measures of Voter Turnout,
                            1890-1930" (paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science
                            Association, 
                Atlanta
              , Ga., November, 1980).
          
           and it accords with the observations of these authors (pp.
                    27-28). But notice further that the size of the difference between the two means increases
                    substantially across time, from 8.7 for 1840 to 1900 to 16.9 for 1960 to 1976. The most recent
                    period shows a difference between presidential and off-year turnout that is nearly twice the size of
                    the corresponding nineteenth-century figure. This increase in the difference suggests that a smaller
                    proportion of Indiana's voters now are regular participants than was the case much earlier.
                    But these comparisons, or even more exact dropoff calculations, only point obliquely to such a
                    change. Since the matter is important, it is one that we should pursue.
        Voting-behavior studies have identified distinctive types of voters.11
          Core voters are those who can be expected to participate regardless of the
                    stimulus levels associated with the election type or campaign activities. At the other extreme are
                        nonvoters, those who regularly abstain regardless of the stimulus level.
                    Between these extremes are peripheral voters, those who vote sometimes and whose
                    likelihood of participating is a direct function of short-term stimuli. Of course, any electorate
                    contains all three types of voters, but what is critical is the prevalence of core voters compared
                    with peripheral and nonvoters. The higher the proportion of core voters, the more fully and
                    consistently mobilized the electorate.

        Comparison of the presidential and off-year turnout means in Table I suggests the possibility that
                    the sizes of the peripheral and nonvoting components of Indiana's electorate have increased
                    across time. But movement into and out of the electorate between types of elections is only one way
                    to gauge the phenomenon. It is more revealing to observe movement between elections of the same
                    type. Here we are concerned with estimating the probability that a voter who turned out in one
                    presidential election repeated that behavior in the next. We can apply ecological regression
                    procedures to county-level turnout percentages to recover this estimate of individual-level
                    behavior. We can then apply that probability estimate to the observed turnout rate for the first
                    election to derive the estimated proportion of those participants who cast ballots at the second
                        trial.12 In analogous fashion, we can develop estimates of non-voters at the
                    first election who balloted at the second, and of

           those who abstained at both elections. We can develop separate
                    estimates for each of these categories of behavior across every successive pair of 1876-1972
                    presidential elections and then calculate means for designated time periods.
        It is a relatively simple matter to translate the theoretical categories into operational terms that
                    parallel these procedures. Core voters can be defined as those who voted at two successive
                    presidential elections; nonvoters abstained at both; and peripheral voters cast ballots at one, but
                    only one, of the two elections. The estimated sizes of these components of Indiana's
                    electorate are in Table II. The table presents means of the estimates between successive pairs of
                    presidential elections for

           the time periods designated. Since by definition realigning elections involve considerable
                    voter instability, these have been excluded from the calculation of the means. Thus, what we can
                    observe are the relative sizes of the core, peripheral, and non-voting components of
                    Indiana's electorate under the "normal politics" conditions of the
                    state's (and the nation's) third through fifth party systems.

        Not surprisingly, what the data reveal is a considerable contraction in the relative size of the core
                    electorate. That shrinkage began at the turn of the century, accelerated during the 1920s with the
                    enfranchisement of electorally inexperienced women, and has proceeded apace in the post-New Deal
                    period. What is especially impressive (and alarming from the point of view of democratic theory) is
                    that since 1940 the distribution has tended to become bimodalâ€”the shrinkage in the size
                    of the 
            "Critical Realignments and Electoral Systems," in Kleppner et al., The Evolution of American Electoral Systems (
                Westport
              , Conn., forthcoming in 1981).
          
           core has its parallel in a nearly corresponding increase in the
                    size of the nonvoting component of the state's electorate.
        What do such data suggest about changes in the electorate's orientations toward the voting
                    process? They imply that low levels of psychological involvement are now much more broadly diffused
                    than was the case in the nineteenth century, or even earlier in this century. They point out as well
                    that the erosion of involvement levels is not solely a recent development, but one that originated
                    at the turn of the century. The electoral-system transformation that occurred in Indiana (and
                    elsewhere) in the mid-1890s had profound consequences. Not the least of these was to begin the
                    process of reshaping citizens' attitudes toward electoral politics and toward the value of
                    voting. Whatever sets of attitudinal linkages sustained the high involvement and correspondingly
                    high mobilization levels of the late nineteenth century progressively decayed thereafter.

        Why might this have been so? Why and how were those earlier linkages displaced? Why were they not
                    replaced by other linkages that produced similar mobilization effects? These, of course, are the
                    critical analytical questions that must eventually be confronted.13 But they are
                    the types of questions that can be generated only when theory and data analysis are united and when
                    the behavior of the Indiana voter is conceived as the proper focus of inquiry.

        Of course, at no point has Indiana's turnout been uniform across its ninety-two counties.
                        Voting in Indiana appropriately draws attention to within-state variations in
                    turnout rates (especially pp. 28-37, 120-27). However, its efforts to give coherence to an
                    impressive body of data fall short of the mark. The descriptive cross-classifications and labored
                    explications simply do not serve to clarify the patterns. Indeed, in minor particulars the
                    discussion tends to mislead somewhat. If we approach the data from a different angle, we can gain a
                    much better view of two important matters that were of concern to these authors.

        How much county-to-county variation in turnout was there? An examination of the cross-sectional
                    turnout means and their associated coefficients of variability (V) enables us to respond to that
                    question (see Table III).14
        
        
          
            13 For an initial effort to do so, see Paul Kleppner, "The Demise
                        of Ethnocultural Politics: Parties and Voters, 1896-1920" (paper presented at the
                        annual meeting of the Organization of American Historians, 
              San Francisco

            14 The table presents presidential data, but the off-year congressional
                        data show similar patterns. The coefficient of variability (V) is the ratio of the standard
                        deviation of the distribution to its mean. It is a better measure for

        In one sense, and especially when compared with other states, what is striking is how little spread
                    there is about any of these means.15 In light of the known differences in
                    socioeconomic composition, partisan competitiveness, and the like across the state's
                    counties, the turnout distributions are surprisingly tight. Even so, there is a clear pattern of
                    longitudinal change: the value of the coefficient of variability for the most recent period is
                    nearly triple its earliest size. So while the distributions remain more compact than in most other
                    states, the general mobilization level has declined and as it has the spread about the mean has
                    increased. Such a pattern of change indirectly suggests some longitudinal tendency toward socially
                    distinctive turnout rates.

        We would have expected as much from the authors' discussion of the differences between urban
                    and rural turnout rates. The finding that at the aggregate level turnout associates inversely with
                    urbanism is not the "startling disclosure" (p. 121) that they imagine. Other
                    studies, even some survey-based ones, have arrived at a similar conclusion.16
                    Nevertheless, 
            these purposes than the standard deviation. That is so since V is a measure of relative
                            dispersion and since we are interested in comparing the amounts of spread about different
                            means for discrete time periods.

           since it is the social factor to which they devote greatest
                    attention, it merits consideration.

        The data supporting their description of the patterned relationship between turnout and urbanism is
                    much less conclusive than the authors suppose. The cross-classification of counties by urban-rural
                    condition and by turnout (Table VII-1, pp. 122-23) is not particularly persuasive, especially in the
                    absence of any summary measure of association. The greater problem, however, is that we have been
                    given no way of knowing to what extent these patterns occurred because both turnout and urbanism
                    were related to a third variableâ€”population change. There are good reasons to suppose
                    that population change would also be inversely related to turnout, and that it would be positively
                    related to urbanism.17 Thus, the posited relationship may be partially, or
                    wholly, spurious. Cross-classification of ninety-two counties is not the appropriate way to handle
                    the problem. Multiple regression procedures provide a stronger approach, and the results of such
                    analyses are presented in Table III.

        The negative association between turnout and urbanism does not disappear when controlled for
                    population change. Both variables show inverse associations with turnout. But the patterned
                    relationships have not been constant over time. First, compare the relative sizes of the betas for
                    the two variables within each time period, and then across time periods. Second, notice the total
                    amounts of turnout variance (R2) that the two variables together explain.

        What observations can we derive from such comparisons? Together these two variables show a relatively
                    weak association with nineteenth-century turnout. Of course, we might have presumed as much: when
                    turnout averages 94.0 percent it is not likely that it varied much across any meaningful social
                    categories. It is only when the general mobilization level declines that we can expect to see some
                    stratification patterns 
            (August, 1977), 543-65; and Raymond E. Wolfinger and Steven J. Rosenstone, Who Votes? (
                New Haven
              , Conn., 1980), 30-34. Most of the analysts who refer to lower rural than urban
                            turnout cite 
                Campbell
               et al., The American Voter, chapter 15. But it is important
                            to notice that that chapter reports no data on turnout.
            
              17 On the inverse relationship between population change and turnout,
                            see Voting in Indiana, Table A-III-4, p. 259. For every census year since
                            1870, urbanism and population change over the previous decade in Indiana have shown
                            reasonably high correlations: e.g., 1920, r = .676; for 1930, r = .686. The value of the
                            correlation turns downward after 1930, a fact that reveals much concerning the nature of the
                            population shifts in the state over the past five decades.
          
           emerge. One of the stratification dimensions that structured
                    Indiana's turnout, at least in the 1930s, was a clear rural-urban distinction. The steep
                    negative association between urbanism and turnout is a phenomenon dating from the 1930s. Moreover,
                    the form of that association has not changed much since then, while its strength has declined. That
                    pattern implies that the demobilization contagionâ€”and especially since
                    1960â€”has spread as well to the state's rural areas.
        Other indicators of the performance of Indiana's electoral system have exhibited similar
                    patterns of longitudinal change. It is not feasible to discuss all of these here, but one merits
                    particular attention: partisanship.
        Indiana has long been "an arena of â€¦ intense combat between people who call
                    themselves Democrats and people who call themselves Republicans" (p. 42). So it remains, at
                    least when compared with most other states. Yet that statement misses an important longitudinal
                    dynamic: the across-time erosion of party-vote linkages. Partisan identifications now guide the
                    voting selections of fewer Hoosiers than earlier. This is the case whether we view vote selections
                    at a single election or across adjacent pairs of elections.
        Straight-ticket voting is a good indicator of the role of party identification as a cue to the
                    voter's decisions. The more voters whose choices are guided by internalized senses of
                    belonging to a political party, the higher the levels of straight-ticket voting and the lower the
                    rates of ticket splitting. The difficulty lies in constructing a measure of those rates when we are
                    confined to the use of aggregate data.

        One approach is to take a party's percentage of the two-party vote for each of the contested
                    offices, and then to calculate its mean percentage across those offices and the variance about that
                    mean. The variance measure serves as a crude indicator of split ballots. Walter Dean Burnham has
                    calculated this measure for Indiana's statewide contests from 1880 through 1968. His data
                    show virtually no variance across offices in presidential years through 1892, a slight increase (to
                    1.28) for the 1900-1920 period, and then a further increment (to 1.39) for the 1940 through 1968
                        elections.18 The difficulty with the measure, however, is that at best it
                    taps net party crossovers and it confines attention to the two-party option. The authors of Voting in Indiana used correlational techniques 
            
              18 Burnham, Critical Elections, 195-96. The variance
                            across offices for the 1960-1968 period is 1.46. Rolloff data exhibit a similar longitudinal
                            pattern and reach a high of 5.1 percent for the 1960-1968 sequence.
          
           (Table X-2, p. 166, and Tables XI-4 to XI-6, pp. 186-87) to get
                    at the problem. But correlations, too, measure only net change and are especially insensitive to
                    relatively uniform shifts across the units of analysis.

        The better tactic is to calculate regression estimates of the transition probabilities between
                    offices. This approach is analogous to that described for the calculation of turnout probabilities
                    between elections, except here we are concerned with estimating the probability that a voter who
                    cast, say, a Democratic ballot for president voted for that same party's candidate for
                    Congress. This approach enables us to generate estimates of gross crossovers and to distinguish a
                    Democrat-to-Republican (or Republican-to-Democrat) switch from movement to a minor party or to
                    nonvoting for the second office.19 The disadvantage is that to measure
                    split-ticket voting fully the estimates must be calculated between every possible pair of offices.
                    For present and practical purposes, however, I will confine attention here to the estimated
                    crossovers between two officesâ€”president and Congress. Further, the data presented here
                    cover only the estimated rates of switching between the two major parties (see Table IV).

        Two observations are pertinent. First, the rates of major-party switching between these two offices
                    are not impressively 
            
              19 This is so since the variables are measured as "party
                            turnout"; that is, the vote cast for each party for each office is calculated as a
                            proportion of the eligible electorate. Moreover, the multiple regression equations used to
                            generate the estimates took into account the four options available to the voter: supporting
                            the Democrats, the Republicans, minor parties, or abstaining. The technical details can be
                            followed in the literature cited in note 6, above.
          
           high at any point. Second, the rates for both parties are now
                    considerably higher than they were in the late nineteenth century. In fact for both parties the
                    "normal politics" conditions of 1960-1972 show rates that are closer in size to
                    the 1932-1940 realigning period than they are to the 1876-1892 sequence.
        If the capacity of standing party attachments to guide voter selections across offices has declined,
                    what of party identification as a cue to voting behavior from one election to the next? When
                    partisan feelings are intense and widespread, we expect considerable stability in party-vote
                    selections between adjacent elections. As the strength of partisan sentiment decreases and becomes
                    less widely diffused across the electorate, instability measures will show a corresponding increase.
                    When that occurs we witness a systemically significant erosion in party-vote linkages. The resulting
                    electorate is one whose collective decision is more susceptible to short-term forces and less
                    securely anchored in long-term partisan attachements.
        Some of the more original and potentially insightful sections of Voting in Indiana
                    focus on this question of longitudinal partisan stability. Departing from their usual practice, here
                    the authors link their data exploration to theoretical constructs derived from the voting-behavior
                    studies. The result (see pp. 174-84) is a more cogently structured and potentially useful discussion
                    than those in some other sections. Unfortunately, their key measureâ€”an index of
                    party-voting instabilityâ€”suffers from an operational flaw. They measure instability as
                    the arithmetic change between election pairs in each county's share of the two-party vote
                    cast for a particular party. They then construct their instability index by calculating the mean of
                    these changes across a designated series of election pairs (1948-1968). Thus, their instability
                    indices "are net changes in the percentages of votes given to a
                    party's candidates from one election to the next" (note 2, pp. 276-77, emphasis
                    added). But does net change appropriately measure instability? If a county shifted
                    by twenty percentage points toward the Democrats between the First and second elections, and then
                    swung back to the Republicans by twenty percentage points between the second and third elections,
                    its instability measure would be zero. Another county that registered shifts in
                    the same partisan direction of, say, one percentage point across each of the two election pairs
                    would have an instability index value of two. The wild gyrations of the first
                    county surely give evidence of much greater party-vote instability than the minuscule, but
                    incremental, shifts that marked the second case. But the instability  index calculated by these authors would mask that reality. What
                    captures it is an indicator of gross change, the amount of shift between election
                    pairs irrespective of the direction of the shift. If correctly measured such an instability index
                    could be fruitfully used for some analytical purposes. However, if we are concerned with the extent
                    to which standing party attachments guide current vote selections, there are even more appropriate
                    techniques. Two of these will be employed here.

        First, we can develop an aggregate-level estimate of the "normal" partisan vote
                    division and determine its efficacy in explaining the variance of the current vote. A
                    party's normal vote can be defined as the mean of its percentage of the total vote across
                    the four elections immediately preceding the one whose vote serves as the dependent variable. Thus,
                    the estimator cycles forward but always includes four elections. It includes an equal number of
                    presidential and off-year contests, so that whatever differences exist between election types can be
                    expected to cancel out. It includes two elections of each type to average out any unusual short-term
                    forces that might be associated with a single contest. If past partisan performances shaped current
                    vote divisions, then the normal-vote estimator should explain a high proportion of the variance of
                    the dependent variable.20
        
        The second approach, while statistically independent of the first, is logically analogous. It
                    involves the use of party turnout percentages and multiple regression procedures to estimate the
                    conditional probability that voters who supported a party at one presidential election repeated that
                    behavior at the next. Each of these estimates is then translated into proportions of the electorate
                    by multiplying it by the observed party turnout rate for the first election. In this way we obtain
                    for each election year the estimated proportion of the electorate that voted Democrat (or
                    Republican) at both elections. We can then sum the proportions of vote repeaters for each party and
                    view the total proportion of the electorate whose partisan selections remained stable across two
                    presidential elections.

        I have applied both of these approaches to Indiana data for each presidential election between 1876
                    and 1972.21 The results

                            underlying its construction and use, see Philip E. Converse, "The Concept of a
                            Normal Vote," in 
                Campbell
               et al., Elections and the Political Order, 9-39.
            
              21 I have replicated both procedures for off-year congressional
                            elections and for contests for secretary of state and state treasurer for presidential and
                            off-year elections separately. The relevant contours of those results parallel the ones
                            reported in Table V.
          
           for each election have then been used to calculate the means

        Both techniques produce results whose longitudinal patterns are quite similar. The capacity of
                    standing party attachments to structure current vote outcomes has clearly declined across time in
                    Indiana. However, the series do not display tidy patterns of linear decay. The immediate post-1900
                    sequences show a continuing tight fit between the normal vote and the current Democratic
                    distribution. But that occurs as the Democrats' mean share of the participating electorate
                    fell by 5.6 percentage points from its nineteenth-century level. That suggests that the stability of
                    the coefficients reflects the fact that the Democrats has been reduced to a hard core of unwavering
                    supporters. Similarly, while the coefficients for both parties during the 1940-1960 period nearly
                    approximate their 1876-1892 counterparts, they occur within a context marked by generally lower
                    rates of mobilization.
        The party transition estimates tell the story even less ambiguously, especially in the
                    "total" column. The proportion of the electorate whose partisan attachments are
                    strong enough to produce a vote for the same party at two successive presidential elections has
                    declined by 22.1 percentage points from 1876-1892 to 1960-1972. A large share of that decline dates
                    to the 1900-1916 period. And while in Indiana the New Deal period stimulated turnout, increased
                    competitiveness, and reinvigorated partisanship, it only temporarily (and not very dramatically)
                    arrested the long-term decay of party-vote linkages.

        If Indiana's electoral system functioned as a system, we might expect these two dimensions
                    of change to be interrelated.  Further, we might expect an
                    across-time change in the patterned relationships exhibited by the social predictors of both
                    party-vote instability and turnout. While the authors of Voting in Indiana did not
                    choose to discuss the matter, their appendix presents some evidence pointing in these directions
                    (see the turnout correlations for 1920 to 1960 in Table A-III-4, p. 259). The arrays in Table VI
                    provide further confirmation.22
        
        First, notice the changes in the sizes of the means of the dependent variables across time periods.
                    With the exception of muted countercyclical movement associated with the New Deal realignment, the
                    value of the instability index has increased over time while the mobilization level has declined.
                    The result is an Indiana electorate that now is much less fully mobilized and more unstable in its
                    party-vote selections than earlier, and especially more so than in the late nineteenth century.

        Next, notice the relationships between the independent variables and the instability index. During
                    the 1876-1892 period, as turnout and per capita wealth increased, the value of the instability index
                    declined, but the youth and competitiveness measures registered only trivial effects. Indeed, even
                    all of these variables in tandem explain only a relatively small proportion (16.9 percent) of the
                    variance of the instability index. But after the turn of the century, the variables account for
                    decently sized proportions of the total variance, and both turnout and competitiveness display
                    steeply negative associations with the instability index. That is, as we would generally expect,
                    high turnout and high competition produced low instability rates. Tight competitiveness probably
                    stimulated both high turnout and high party-vote stability.23 But unlike the
                    figures for the nineteenth century, the youth measure shows a positive association with instability,
                    and the earlier negative association with wealth fades. The 1940-1960 sequence displays even 
            
              22 The instability index used has been operationalized as the mean of
                            the gross change between each election pair falling within the designated time period. Per
                            capita wealth is the per capita assessed value of real and personal property, and it is a
                            weaker measure than the median income indicator that is available in post-1940 censuses. The
                            youth measure prior to 1920 is the percentage of the total male population below twenty-one
                            years of age, and in and after 1920 the proportion of the total population below that age.
                            Competitiveness is an interval-level index calculated for each county as 100.0 percent minus
                            the absolute difference between the Democratic and Republican percentages of the total vote.
                            The higher the value of the index, the stronger the competition between the parties. The
                            index for each county for each election was then used to calculate means across the
                            designated election sequences.
            
              23 The data in Table VI, Panel B, for the same sequences offer support
                            for that observation.

           steeper positive associations between instability and youth and wealth measures, but the
                    turnout and competitiveness associations erode and the total variance explained drops below its
                    1876-1892 level. In the most recent period the predictive efficacy of these variables is virtually
                    trivial: they explain only 2.7 percent of the total variance, and only competitiveness serves as a
                    statistically robust predictorâ€”of low instability, in this case.

        In some respects the 1960-1972 profile of associations resembles its nineteenth-century predecessor:
                    few steep slopes, no youth effects, and a low proportion of explained variance. That might prompt a
                    suggestion that this dimension of Indiana's electoral system has come full circle. But such
                    a suggestion  would miss the critical point: the mean
                    instability index is now 6.5 times larger than it was during the 1876-1892 period. Moreover, while
                    in the nineteenth century the spread about the mean of the instability index was relatively wide (V
                    = 45.3 percent), it is now quite compact (V = 14.3 percent). Thus, the message conveyed by these
                    comparative data is reasonably clear: the high instability rates of the most recent period do not
                    show steep and powerful social associations precisely because they are relatively uniformly diffused
                    across the Indiana electorate. Party-vote instability has become a contagion that permeates all
                    components of the electorate, and one whose further spread is only mildly constrained by lingering
                    party competition. That the state's competitiveness levels also display post-1960 signs of
                    decay points to an ongoing, and perhaps epidemic, erosion of party-vote linkages.24
        

        The changed contours of the turnout associations convey a similar message. In the nineteenth century
                    the participation norm was widely diffused among Indiana's voters. Aggregate turnout rates,
                    accordingly, were not depressed by youth effects or by low levels of per capita wealth. And they
                    were only slightly stimulated by high competition and party-vote stability. The directions of the
                    age and wealth associations changed in the early twentieth century, and the stimulating impact of
                    the political variables increased slightly. By the most recent period, however, only competitiveness
                    remains as a statistically robust predictor of turnout, as even high wealth levels fail to
                    stimulate, and youth measures fail to depress, participation. Combine these observations with two
                    additional ones: the R2 for the equation nearly approximates its
                    nineteenth-century level, but the turnout mean is almost twenty percentage points below the
                    1876-1892 period. Taken together such data point to a simple, if alarming, conclusion: the
                    abstention rates of most of the components of Indiana's electorate have tended to become
                    increasingly similar. As turning out was the norm of the state's nineteenth-century
                    electorate, turning off seems well on its way to becoming its late-twentieth-century replacement.

        These longitudinal patterns of turnout erosion and partisan decay should rightly alarm policymakers
                    and democratic, theorists. The viability of democratic politics depends upon the manifest consent of
                    the governed. As the latter grow increasingly doubtfulâ€”if not cynicalâ€”of their
                    collective efficacy to influence policy, withdrawing from the active electorate becomes 
            
              24 For 1960-1972 the mean competitiveness index = 79.3; this compares
                            with 83.8 for 1940-1960, and with 88.0 for 1876-1892.
          
           a rational and nearly inevitable response. What stimulates that
                    growing doubt is a corresponding change in the roles played by the only political institutions
                    through which most citizens can articulate their interestsâ€”political parties. As
                    party-policy linkages have become murkier over the past two decades, and as party organizations have
                    withered, it is small wonder that party-vote stability has decreased and no longer serves to
                    stimulate participation.

        The broad outlines of the patterns displayed by Indiana's electoral system over the past
                    century have their counterparts in other states and on the national level. In this Indiana is not
                    behaviorally distinct. But there is a difference that is potentially of considerable importance. The
                    absolute levels of mobilization and party-vote stability still remain higher in Indiana than in most
                    other states. Scholars will be able to discern why that might be so only after they have available a
                    series of comparably designed state-level studies. But to enrich our knowledge of the past, and thus
                    to inform our present policy approaches, such studies must unite data exploration with theory. They
                    must also use appropriate statistical procedures to bridge the gap between aggregate-level data and
                    individual-level dynamics. For only by doing so can they give focus to the most important element of
                    any electoral systemâ€”the behavior of its voters. Analysts who integrate these approaches
                    into a longitudinally analytic framework will seize the opportunity to produce benchmark studies, an
                    opportunity sadly bypassed by the authors of Voting in Indiana.
        
      
      
      
        Book Reviews Local History Today: Papers Presented at Four Regional Workshops for
                        Local Historical Organizations in Indiana, June, 1978-April, 1979. By Richard Jensen,

        This brief collection of papers dealing with interpretive approaches to community history will be of
                    value to those who engage in local history research and its public presentation through museum
                    exhibits, publications, and lectures. The authors, all prominent midwestern historians, were
                    selected to present keynote addresses to four Indiana regional workshops for local historical
                    society personnel during 1978 and 1979; their addresses comprise this paperbound volume.
        While each author approaches the challenges of local history from a distinct perspective, two common
                    themes pervade the book: the vital need for grassroots community research and the necessity of
                    reorienting the topical and methodological approaches employed in research and interpretive
                    presentation. Rather than continued emphasis on frontier beginnings, first families, and
                    idiosyncratic happenings, all agree on the need for more meaningful local history utilizing broader
                    hypotheses, perspectives from the social sciences, and concepts that enlighten the process of
                    historical change rather than stressing limited historical facts.

        Thomas D. Clark most successfully points out the challenges of local history research, as well as the
                    variety of untapped issues and available sources. Clark is concerned with the historian's
                    social role and sees local history as a means by which humanity can be rescued from scholarly
                    abstractors and from the alienation produced by social and technological discontinuities in modern
                    life. Accordingly, Clark encourages the collection and interpretation of commonplace experiences of
                    the recent past and the synthesis of this social and economic history in a broader new national
                    history. Richard Jensen is far less nostalgic about earlier American life, and he adroitly makes a
                    case for the need to reinterpret local history on the basis of the conflict between
                    "modernization" and "traditionalism" and the victory of the
                    former. While some readers may fear that Jensen comes close to reifying ideal types and
                    oversimplifying a complex historical record, he is quite right 
                    about the need to recognize the basic historical direction of change in the past century and a half.
                    His reminder of the superstition, apathy, and insensitivity of the "frontier
                    generation" also is a healthy corrective for what can occur in local history
                    interpretations. Thomas J. Schlereth presents techniques and Hoosier examples of
                    "above-ground archaeology" as a new means for museum curators and history teachers
                    to encourage a search for historical meaning outside museum exhibits and history texts. Schlereth
                    advocates interpretation of the records of landscape, place names, architecture, and other material
                    culture artifacts, and he deftly demonstrates how this art is practiced. Schlereth's
                    excursion into history without tears unintentionally demonstrates the need for documentary
                    corroboration and the utility of traditional historical knowledge for gaining insight from a
                    community's visual record.

          Local Government Records: An Introduction to Their Management, Preservation, and
                    Use. By H. G. Jones. (
            Nashville
          : American Association for State and Local History, 1980. Pp. xii, 208. Notes,
                    illustrations, figures, appendixes, index. Paperbound, $6.95.)
        Among the 81,000 units of local government in the 
            United States
          , including counties, towns, villages, cities, parishes, and boroughs, there is a
                    bewildering variety of local public records. Their form and content are as varied as the
                    governmental activities they reflectâ€”collecting taxes, administering justice, maintaining
                    roads, conducting elections, providing public education, and recording vital statistics and legal
                    documents. To provide some information about the management, preservation, and use of this
                    exponentially increasing body of records, the National Historical Publications and Records
                    Commission (NHPRC) and the American Association for State and Local History commissioned H. G. Jones
                    to write this volume. Jones, past president of the Society of American Archivists, former director
                    of the 
            North Carolina
           Department of Archives and History, and presently curator of the 
            North Carolina
           Collection at the University of 
            North Carolina
          , was an obvious choice for the assignment.

        The original objective of providing a manual outlining a model for the management and use of local
                    public records had to be abandoned because there appeared to be little consensus  on what constituted a model among archivists, records managers, and
                    local public officials. What Jones has produced instead is an introduction to local records designed
                    "to stimulate public officials to examine their current method of coping with their records
                    problems and to evaluate the benefits that may be derived from a well-planned program incorporating
                    a variety of controls such as inventories, retention/disposition schedules, microfilming, and
                    intermediate storage areas" (p. 21). The first half of the book is directed primarily at
                    records custodians, emphasizing the need for proper preservation, practical steps for establishing a
                    local records program, and examples of successful programs of different sizes and ages. Perhaps of
                    more interest to general readers is the second half, which examines the range of records found in
                    local repositories, their contents, and their possible research uses.
        Jones' suggested procedures for establishing a records management system for each county may
                    underestimate the reluctance of local public officials to spend time and money on such projects.
                    However, even if it is impossible to establish national standards and model schedules, it may be
                    possible to establish uniform guidelines within states. State-based programs, such as NHPRC-funded
                    projects for a microfilming program in 
            Ohio
          , for a municipal records manual in 
            Wisconsin
          , and for a court records survey in 
            Massachusetts
          , may prove to be the only practical route to eventual control over local public
                    records. Seasoned genealogists and local historians may not find much that is startlingly new
                    concerning the research use of local records, but this section of the book serves as an excellent
                    introduction to the range and possible use of such records. The author's intensive research
                    in eight states and correspondence with state and local officials in the remaining forty-two is
                    solid, and his recommendations are sound. Whether they will bring their intended results remains to
                    be seen.

          Small Town

            : The Comic Perspective of Finley Peter Dunne, George Ade, Ring Lardner. By
                    James DeMuth. (
            Port Washington
          , N.Y.: Kennikat Press, 1980. Pp. 122. Notes, bibliographic essay, select bibliography,
                    index. $11.00.)
        This is a first-rate literary and sociological study of 
            Chicago

           in the 1890s as seen through the fictive lenses of three humorists. To the perennial
                    question "Can fiction faithfully  re-create a
                    society?" James DeMuth answers yes: fiction can indeed delineate history, even if on a high
                    level of abstraction, and fiction can dramatize environments, institutions, character types, and
                    speech patterns. DeMuth demonstrates all of this with articulateness, logical flow, and scholarly
                    rigor. His thesis is that in the 1890s 
            Chicago
           was as provincial as the small towns from which its migrants came and that
                    "the common intention which links Dunne, Ade, and Lardnerâ€”which distinguishes
                    their art from [that of] the 
            Chicago
           novelistsâ€”is their attempt to interpret 
            Chicago

           in the nostalgic terms of a small American community" (p. 105). DeMuth
                    supports his thesis with excerpts from and critical comments on Dunne's "Mr.
                    Dooley," Lardner's "Haircut" and You Know Me,
                    Al, and Ade's Artie, Pink Marsh, and 
            
              Chicago
             Stories.
        
        DeMuth regards Ade the gentlest of the three satirists. Unlike Dunne and Lardner, who depict 1890s
                    Chicagoans as insecure and alienated, Ade sees 
            Chicago
           as a frontier of acceptance for newcomers willing to work. Dunne re-creates the
                    political and social life of his native St. Patrick's parish on the West Side. Mr. Dooley
                    defends Sixth Ward "pollyticians" against the boss industrialist who
                    "makes it a felony for annywan to buy stove polish outside iv his [company] store"
                    (p. 43). As for Lardner, who remains controversial among the critics, DeMuth sides with those who
                    regard the author of "Haircut" as "among the most skeptical, cynical, and
                    heartless" of authors (p. 108). Lardner comes down hard on 
            Chicago
           newcomers from Indiana and 
            Michigan
          , "wise boobs who are entertaining, often, because they are insensitive to
                    embarrassment" (p. 110).
        DeMuth wisely warns that fictive pictures by these authors must be corrected for distortion by the
                    temperaments of the authors themselves. He describes Lardner as dourâ€”unwilling to grant
                    affirmation except to migrants from his hometown, Niles, 
            Michigan
          . Dunne appears more compassionate than Lardner. Ade, although the most humane of the
                    three, also emerges as one who "perceived 
            Chicago

           in small units that bore resemblance to his Indiana village and Purdue
                    fraternity" (p. 110). DeMuth does report that all three authors were devotees of the
                    Whitechapel Club, notorious for its macabre practical jokes and arrested adolescence. But again, Ade
                    is singled out as one whose tastes, as reflected in Pink Marsh, are influenced by
                    naive enthusiasm for vaudeville and minstrels (p. 57).

        Although DeMuth concentrates on his three principals, he appropriately compares their works with
                    those of their contemporariesâ€”Theodore Dreiser's Sister Carrie
                    and novels by  Henry Fuller. Surprisingly, DeMuth ignores George 
            Barr
           McCutcheon's The Sherrods and especially
                    McCutcheon's satirical epistolary fiction "The Waddleton Mail," which
                    inspired more than one of Ade's character types and much of Lardner's epistolary
                    fiction.

             Farmer-Laborism: The Third-Party Alternative. By Millard L. Gieske. (

            Minnesota
           Press, 1979. Pp. ix, 389. Illustrations, tables, notes, selected bibliography,
                    reference sources, index. $15.00.)
        Writing about a movement that is often neglected in studies of agrarian crusades, Millard L. Gieske
                    clearly plows new ground. His history, the first major study of 
            Minnesota
           Farmer-Labor politics since George H. Mayer's The Political
                        Career of Floyd B. Olson (1951), exhaustively chronicles Farmer-Laborism's descent
                    from the radical agrarian Nonpartisan League (1922) to its marriage in 1944 to the Democratic party.
                    Sixty-four manuscript collections, several dissertations, and representative 
            Minnesota
           newspaper sources provided rich documentation.
        No admirer of third political parties, the author pictures Democrats as making the
                    "third-party alternative" feasible in 
            Minnesota
          . There the two-party system had become inoperative by 1920 because of Democratic
                    weakness; thus, Farmer-Labor mobilized dissenting trade unionists and Nonpartisan League forces whom
                    Democrats could have absorbed had the two-party system been functional. Then, despite its
                    disturbingly radical rhetoric, Farmer-Labor rooted deeply and at the expense of Democrats who,
                    spurning "fusion" with the new party, whiled away twenty-two years. Cooperating
                    occasionally with such Farmer-Labor officeholders as Henrik Shipstead and Floyd B. Olson, Democratic
                    stalwarts otherwise stayed aloof from Farmer-Labor while its bickering conservatives and radicals
                    engineered the third party's collapse. Seemingly, Farmer-Labor's ill-fated
                    experience proved anew that the two-party system was viable, a conclusion even of Farmer-Laborite
                    Hjalmar Petersen who, in 1942, pronounced third parties susceptible to inevitable withering.
        
        This book, mainly derived from Farmer-Labor sources, points out that Farmer-Labor succeeded when
                    rightists elected "moderate reformers and progressives" and, conversely, failed
                    when radicals wrested command. In the latter event, party affairs assumed "the air of a
                    Gilbert and Sullivan opera" (p. 309) with urban leftists and agrarian conservatives
                    providing bombast and swordplay. To radicals were attributed Farmer-Labor's woes, since its
                    progressive warriors, notably Shipstead and Olson, could not always deter leftists from destructive
                    forays such as Farmer-Labor's 1934 radical binge. However, this persuasive accounting might
                    have more fully treated Democratic maneuvers which, as the writer indicates, speeded
                    Farmer-Labor's decline after 1936. Perhaps the third party's post-1936 debacle
                    could have been documented more from Democratic sources.
        Best of all, the author superbly analyzes Farmer-Labor's ideological schisms, and he clearly
                    describes its complex machinery such as farmer-labor associations which became factional redoubts.
                    Also numerous tables illuminate important electoral contests. Unfortunately, this unrelenting focus
                    on factional conflicts obscures the roles played by Farmer-Labor's varied agrarian, labor,
                    and middle-class constituencies in the movement. Probably the party's labor support shifted
                    precipitately from year to year and was, therefore, a notably important variable. Moreover, the
                    narrative leaves unclear the ethnic groups' connection to Farmer-Labor. What relationships,
                    for instance, developed between Farmer-Labor and 
            Minnesota
          's German-and Scandinavian-American populace after 1918 when some of these
                    ethnics warmed to Nonpartisan League activists because nativists and self-anointed patriots had
                    persecuted them? This well-written monograph should long remain a standard reference on early 
            Minnesota
           Farmer-Laborism.

        During the first decades of the twentieth century southern black workers began migrating to northern
                    cities in ever increasing numbers to take industrial jobs. The migration  reached massive proportions during the labor shortages of World War I.
                    Large numbers of the black migrants moved to 
            Detroit
           and went to work in the automobile plants. Black auto workers found their earliest
                    employment opportunities at Packard Motor Co., which had 1100 blacks on its payroll as early as
                    1917. Many blacks also eventually went to work at Chrysler and in the various plants of General
                    Motors. But it was the Ford Motor Company, and the personal involvement of Henry Ford, that provided
                    blacks their greatest opportunities in the industry. Ford assiduously courted black ministers and
                    other community leaders and used paternalism toward his black workers to convince them that the
                    interests of blacks and of the Ford Motor Company were the same. Ford would in later years combine
                    his benevolence with the general hostility blacks evinced toward organized labor to stave off union
                    activities in the auto industry.
        Despite Ford's efforts, by the mid-1930s the unions, particularly the newly organized United
                    Automobile Workers, which affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1936, began to
                    make inroads among blacks. Blacks generally did not participate in the strikes against General
                    Motors in 1937 nor in the organizing drives at Chrysler in 1938-1939. But by the time the UAW began
                    to organize Ford in 1941, efforts of black and white union leaders had succeeded in convincing
                    blacks that the union represented their interests. Accordingly, blacks enthusiastically participated
                    in the 1941 strike, and their involvement was crucial to the union's eventual victory,
                    particularly at Ford's huge River Rouge plant. August Meier and Elliott Rudwick assert that
                    this victory cemented the alliance between blacks and organized labor, at least in one industry, and
                    point out that by the end of World War II the UAW "occupied the esteemed place once held by
                    Henry Ford" (p. 219).
        
          Black 
              Detroit
             and the Rise of the UAW is about more than organization of the UAW among
                    blacks and the union's relations with the companies that employed its members. Meier and
                    Rudwick also write about the union's involvement with the city administration, particularly
                    during the racial upheavals associated with the Sojourner Truth Housing Project in 1942 and the
                    larger 
            Detroit

           riot of 1943. UAW officials ostensibly sided with blacks on both occasions, and union
                    leaders took great pride in pointing out that no racial violence occurred in the plants. But Black 
              Detroit
            

           is also about union discrimination. The authors point out that blacks remained
                    concentrated in low-skilled, low-paying jobs, a condition which the union did little to remedy, and
                    that few blacks attained major leadership  posts in the union.
                    Though blacks generally hailed Walter Reuther as an opponent of racial discrimination, Reuther
                    opposed bringing blacks into the union's top leadership circles. From the time he became
                    president of the UAW in 1946, Reuther stood firmly against elevation of a black man to a
                    vice-presidency, even though blacks made up a quarter of the union's membership. Such
                    action, Reuther argued, would be "reverse discrimination." By 1962 increasing
                    militance among blacks had worn down Reuther's resolve and a black worker became
                    vice-president of the UAW.

        Meier and Rudwick used an impressive array of sources for this book. In addition to extensive reading
                    in published books and articles, they interviewed individuals associated with the automobile
                    industry during the 1930s and 1940s, and they culled the archives of various black organizations and
                    of organized labor. Black 
              Detroit
             and the Rise of the UAW demonstrates their expertise as historians and stands
                    as a book that will heighten understanding of the intimate relationship between the general black
                    population and black workers in the plants and unions.

        Of the many issues that convulsed American politics in the 1930s noneâ€”not unemployment,
                    deficit spending, domestic radicalism, or foreign aggressionâ€”had quite the impact of
                    labor militancy. The union upsurge, the strikes, and the political entanglements of unionists had
                    wide-ranging, unpredictable effects which became critical factors in shaping political attitudes
                    during the New Deal years. In the second volume of his magistral biography of Frank Murphy, Sidney
                    Fine underlines the variable impact of labor activism on Murphy's political fortunes. In
                    the process he provides the most detailed examination to date of a "Little New
                    Deal," the effort to extend the Franklin D. Roosevelt revolution to the nation's
                    political grass roots.
        Murphy was an enormously attractive and successful politician. He had charisma, administrative
                    talent, a flair for the public eye. As mayor of 
            Detroit

           (covered in Fine's first volume), as Roosevelt's governor-general of
                    the Philippines (treated in the first third of this volume), and as governor of 
          
            Michigan
           from 1937 to 1939, he compiled an exemplary record. As a progressive and pre-Keynesian
                    fiscal conservative Murphy sought to improve government services by improving government. He
                    attacked political bosses and corrupt or parochial interests; fought for government reorganization
                    and the civil service ideal; and, as much as any of the La Follettes, relied on academic experts to
                    wrestle with the complexities of public administration. And he succeeded! In the Philippines he
                    extended social services, paved the way for commonwealth status, and fought the formidable Douglas
                    MacArthur to a standstill. In 
            Michigan
           he attacked the spoils system, reorganized and extended state
                    servicesâ€”particularly those that benefited the poorâ€”and ably fought the
                    catastrophic recession of 1937-1938. Observers quickly tagged him as presidential timber for the
                    1940s. But Murphy's political liabilities were also formidable. He was a Catholic, through
                    no fault of his own, and a bachelor playboy, which is harder to understand. Fine believes that he
                    was too vain and ambitious to marry, but there may have been other factors; a respectable family
                    surely would have been an aid in his political climb.
        More critical was Murphy's attachment to labor, which proved his nemesis. Murphy's
                    sympathy for the downtrodden led him into a political alliance with 
            Michigan
           unions. At first the tie was mutually beneficial. The workers helped Murphy break the
                    Republican lock on 
            Michigan
           politics, and he in turn adopted a more beneficent view of their interests than any of
                    his predecessors. Murphy achieved national recognitionâ€”and generally favorable reactions
                    in 
            Michigan
          â€”for his handling of the great General Motors strike of early 1937. He also
                    maintained a healthy relationship with the American Federation of Labor throughout his term. But he
                    could not cope with the militants. The continuation of the sit-downs after the GM strike undermined
                    his reputation as a peacemaker, and the belligerency of the United Automobile Workers provoked
                    widespread opposition to his administration. Murphy, so resourceful in dealing with politicians,
                    stumbled badly in confronting the unruly workers. He promoted an even-handed labor relations bill in
                    the legislature, a bill that the UAW vociferously opposed, only to see it die because of his
                    "inept and wavering legislative leadership" (p. 373). In other instances he
                    hesitated to criticize unpopular or irresponsible union actions. By 1938 most

           voters perceived him as a special-interest governor and consequently rejected his bid
                    for reelection.

        Murphy's fate was in many respects the fate of New Dealers generally after 1937. Unable to
                    tame the labor militants  and to keep their distance from the
                    Congress of Industrial Organizations, they became susceptible to the increasingly virulent antiunion
                    backlash. Thanks to Roosevelt, however, Murphy survived politically. Defeat dashed his presidential
                    hopes but not his quest for recognition and influence. In 1939 Roosevelt made him attorney general
                    and then associate justice of the 
            United States
           Supreme Court, posts that permitted him to exercise his talents without the labor
                    albatross to hinder him. Fine promises to describe this phase of Murphy's career in a third
                    volume. Students of American government have reason to await the conclusion of the Murphy story with
                    high expectations.

        During and immediately after World War II many states commissioned wartime histories. On the whole
                    these histories were largely traditional political and administrative accounts with local heroes and
                    local agencies substituted for national ones. Few of these works described the social aspects of the
                    war or the role of the average citizen; a notable exception were the studies sponsored by the
                    Indiana War History Commission, especially Max Cavnes' Hoosier Community at
                        War.
        

        Historian Alan Clive has broken the general pattern by providing a new style of state history.
                    Thoroughly researched, clearly and often times humorously written, State of War
                    outlines social and economic as well as political and administrative facets of the war. And the
                    people come alive; they are not overshadowed by bureaucracies, nor are they the butt of jokes.
        "On balance, the war years were good ones for America" (p. 243). In 
            Michigan
           unprecendented prosperity enveloped the state, and with it came a strong and active
                    federal government. Yet "Continuity remained a powerful force" (p. 242). Prejudice
                    against blacks did not end, and the war years were "filled with ambiguity" for 
            Michigan
           women, who were not well organized and could not take advantage of the war to improve
                    their status (p. 203). Clive's chapters entitled "Communities: Breathing Under
                    Water," "Race: Change and Resistance," and "
            Tennessee
           and 
            Kentucky

          " are especially fresh and insightful. The automobile industry is given a mixed
                         review since its leaders stalled in converting their
                    factories to defense plants as long as possible. Clive debunks the popular belief that the majority
                    of newcomers came directly from the farm to the city and sensitively portrays the plight of mountain
                    children living in urban areas. He argues that the "summer of 1943 was a turning point in
                    the history of black America" (p. 164). Clive's section on "Women, Youth
                    and the Limits of Wartime Change" is particularly unusual in a work of this type. His
                    treatment of day care centers and the problems of juveniles is quite good. While useful, his
                    discussion of the roles of women is basically a summary of the literature and does not provide new
                    data or insights.
        If there is a flaw in this book it is one which has always plagued state historiansâ€”a
                    compulsion to justify one's scholarship by arguing that the state is representative of the
                    entire nation. Clive argues that 
            Michigan
           had "all the elements that characterized mid-twentieth century
                    America" and concludes that "No American state experienced the social and economic
                    consequences of World War II more profoundly than 
            Michigan
          " (pp. 6, 234). Perhaps 
            Michigan
           is an excellent microcosm of the national history, but what if it wasn't?
                    Should that be the critical question or the critical framework? The advantage of state and community
                    histories is that they allow the scholar to examine the workings of society at the most basic
                    levelâ€”the dyadic relationship between men and women at home and at work. From such
                    studies we can build a new national history, not the other way around.

          Childhood, Marriage, and Reform: Henry Clarke Wright, 1797-1870. By Lewis Perry. (

        Henry Clarke Wright, the radical abolitionist, temperance advocate, and itinerant reformer, might be
                    considered either the best or the worst subject for study by a twentieth-century historian: the best
                    because he left an unbelievably rich written record including school notebooks, letters, extensive
                    published writings, and more than one hundred manuscript volumes of diaries; the worst because of
                    the complexities and idiosyncracies of a man who could be at once a belligerent non-resistant, a
                    lonely extrovert, a combative member of the peace movement, and a believer in families who was never
                    home. In  this superb study of Wright's psychology and
                    intellect, Lewis Perry, editor of the Journal of American History, unearths the
                    underlying themes behind Wright's apparent inconsistencies. In the process, Perry
                    illuminates the evolution of reform ideas in nineteenth-century America and the psychological
                    dimension implicit in one man's thought.
        Using an approach that combines intellectual history and psychology, Perry begins his study with the
                    identity crisis that marked the shift from Wright's early position as an orthodox
                    Presbyterian minister to his later career as an abolitionist and intinerant reformer. After an
                    opening chapter describing this shift, Perry presents a detailed analysis of Wright's
                    childhood and its relationship to his two most striking preoccupations: the family and aggression.
                    Cautiously and carefully, Perry suggests that "We suspect that nonresistance was, among
                    other things, Wright's way of living with powerfully belligerent feelings" (p. 63)
                    and that "The guilt arising from his mother's death and the awful fear of his
                    father merged in the preoccupation that he made the center of his religion and his career: that
                    children should not fightâ€¦." (p. 74). Much of the remainder of the book
                    brilliantly explains how these preoccupations influenced Wright's style of reform, his
                    ideas about religion, and his attitudes toward the family. Readers will also find, scattered within
                    the exegesis of Wright's own thought, suggestive comments on abolitionism, revivalism,
                    spiritualism, feminism, the peace movement, the cult of domesticity, and radicalism in general.

        Although Perry has written a balanced and judicious assessment of Wright's life, two major
                    questions remain unresolved. The first concerns Wright's representativeness. Perry often
                    uses great insight to place Wright's positions on particular issues within the general
                    context of reform. He also hints that Wright's experience in many ways may be typical and
                    thus that "by analyzing his life and thought we may understand dimensions of the past that
                    would otherwise be nearly inaccessible" (p. xi). But the book lacks a general conclusion on
                    this issue. How typical, ultimately, was Wright's experience? A related question concerns
                    Wright's mental stability. Perry suggests that "in certain respects
                    Wright's life as a reformer might be compared to a neurotic obsession" (p. 94). He
                    then qualifies this by commenting that such an analogy overlooks "the flexibility and
                    versatility his style of reform required" (p. 95). Yet the overwhelming impression the book
                    creates is one of the continuity of certain of Wright's obsessions. Nevertheless, this  is an important study which illuminates the inner dynamics of
                    nineteenth-century reform and documents the neurotic impulses, both destructive and benevolent,
                    which gave Henry Clarke Wright's life its aggressive power.

        This book consists of nine articles on Lincoln written by both young scholars and scholars of
                    established reputation.
        Charles B. Strozier's "The Search for Identity and Love in Young Lincoln"
                    is a conservative psychobiographical approach to Lincoln's romantic years. He argues
                    convincingly that internal confusion and fears of sexual encounter rather than hostility from the
                    Todd family temporarily blocked Lincoln's union with Mary Todd, just as they had blocked
                    the progress of his courtship of Mary Owens. Lincoln worked out his difficulties vicariously by
                    closely monitoring Joshua Speed's courtship and marriage. Kathryn Kish Sklar's
                    "Victorian Women and Domestic Life: Mary Todd Lincoln, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Harriet
                    Beecher Stowe" explores the strategies Victorian women used to control their domestic
                    lives. Mrs. Lincoln, she argues, controlled hers, probably with her husband's cooperation,
                    by having children at greater intervals and by ceasing to have them earlier in life than most of her
                    peers. Her complete commitment to her husband and family was a way of justifying a marriage
                    unpopular with her relatives. Abraham Lincoln's success, to which Mary Lincoln sacrificed
                    all, proved her relatives wrong. The third essay on the private side of Lincoln's life,
                    "Lincoln, Blacks, and Women," by Roy P. Basler, focuses on Lincoln's
                    personal encounters with individual women and blacks but is too discursive to make points as
                    important as those in the first two essays.

        G. S. Boritt's "The Right to Rise" is a succinct summary of the major
                    points of his book, Lincoln and the Economics of the American Dream. He argues
                    that Whig-Republican economics more than Jeffersonian political theory defined Lincoln's
                    vision. The importance of the idea justifies its repetition, but the essay would have had more
                    impact had it been published soon after it  was written rather
                    than after the appearance of Boritt's book. 
            Norman
           Graebner's "The Apostle of Progress," which traces
                    Lincoln's consistent devotion to improving transportation, shows a less profound grasp of
                    the central idea in Boritt's work. It is, however, proof that the view that Lincoln was
                    concerned primarily with economic questions before 1854 is an idea whose time has come.
        George Fredrickson's "The Search for Order and Community," if less
                    successful than Boritt's and Graebner's essays, does suggest an important
                    question: what effect did Lincoln's profession have on his "intellectual
                    style"? Fredrickson opts for a sane reading of the Lyceum Address as a conservative
                    document typical of lawyers, and he is skeptical of the popular psychological interpretations first
                    spawned by Edmund Wilson. Christopher N. Breiseth's "Lincoln, Douglas, and 
            Springfield

           in the 1858 Campaign" sets its sights lower than any other essay in the book,
                    but it also explores an important question: what was the effect of the
                    Lincoln-Douglas campaign on the local voters? He examines only press opinion, but he does show the 
            Springfield
           Republican paper to have been surprisingly discomforted by Lincoln's more
                    advanced doctrines. Don E. Fehrenbacher, ever able, assesses the big subject of "Lincoln
                    and the Constitution" by saying that both North and South fought for conservative goals.
                    Lincoln's thought went little further than the idea of restoring the same old republic
                    without slavery. Richard N. Current's "Lincoln, the Civil War, and the American
                    Mission" states briefly, but correctly, Lincoln's reason for opposing secession
                    and spurning compromise: secession threatened the moral example of the American republican
                    experiment.
        The essays grew out of a conference called "Lincoln's Thought and the
                    Present." Fortunately, the editors chose another title for this book. Only two authors
                    address the theme suggested by the conference's title. Both of them, Graebner and
                    Fehrenbacher, hint at the irrelevance of Lincoln's thought to the present. His economic
                    ideas were premised on the assumption of abundance. His political ideas put more faith in majority
                    will than modern society, with its proliferating protections of proliferating minorities, seems
                    willing to tolerate. The editors wisely let the scholars explore history for its own sake with the
                    result that the book serves history well.

          Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869-1879. By William Gillette. (

        In the voluminous Reconstruction literature, little inquiry has focused on the federal
                    government's formulation and execution of policy after Grant's accession to the
                    presidency. This book assays to fill that gap. William Gillette styles himself a
                    "postrevisionist" (p. 450). Without reverting to the biased judgments of the
                    Dunning school, his aim, he says, is "to replace the tendency of certain neorevisionist
                    historians to overestimate the accomplishments of reconstruction and provide apologies for its
                    shortcomings" (p. 450). Building upon an earlier work on the fifteenth amendment, Gillette
                    assigns primacy to partisan political motives in Republican policymaking. Without denying that many
                    Republican politicians held sincere egalitarian beliefs, he argues that for most moral concerns
                    counted less than the maintenance of Republican rule. The growth of the perception that the
                    party's overall strength suffered rather than benefited from its identification with the
                    defense of black rights and unpopular southern regimes is what Gillette calls the retreat from
                    Reconstruction.
        Gillette adheres to his earlier assertion that the suffrage amendment was designed primarily to
                    enfranchise blacks to bolster Republican fortunes in the North rather than to guarantee the
                    freedmen's vote in the South. Others have controverted this point, but Gillette does
                    convincingly portray the failure of voting rights enforcement caused by imperfectly drawn statutes,
                    insufficient administrative machinery, and an inadequate court system. In examining Grant's
                    southern policyâ€”that is, his administration's relationship with the various
                    Republican state governmentsâ€”Gillette ably describes the particulars but is less
                    successful in assessing Grant's overall performance. Although he justly faults Grant for
                    swinging wildly between coercive intervention and conciliatory inaction, he does not adequately
                    explain this inconsistency. But such a jumble of events does not yield easily to analysis, as is
                    shown by Gillette's own statement in one place that the Republican regimes'
                    "repeated reliance upon federal force for political survival" demonstrated that
                    "in the long run coercion could not replace a sanctioned consensus" (p. 171) and
                    in another that with more intervention "some of these regimes might have been saved and the
                    existence of others prolonged" (p. 176).

        In describing the congressional elections of 1874 as a referendum on Reconstruction which brought
                    heavy Republican  losses primarily because of the
                    Senate's passage of a strong civil rights bill, Gillette unjustifiably downplays the
                    voters' reaction to the severe economic depression. Indeed, he generally gives too little
                    notice to the role of economic factors in the abandonment of Reconstruction by northerners. But if
                    his explanation of the defeat is correct, why did House Republicans return to the 1875 lame-duck
                    session and fight desperately to pass the civil rights bill, albeit in modified form? Gillette is
                    hard pressed to reconcile this action with his portrait of the Republicans as politicians who rated
                    expediency above principle. Many scholars will question his answer that the ever-pragmatic
                    Republicans simply saw the measure as an "opportunity to rescue their party" (p.
                    260) by enlisting "black support in a future bid to regain power in the South" (p.
                    261).
        The book concludes with chapters on the election of 1876 and Hayes' new departure policy.
                    Others have treated these topics, but their inclusion here is significant in that it divests the
                    so-called Compromise of 1877 of the image of having destroyed the Reconstruction experiment. As this
                    book demonstrates, that resolution was merely the final act in a decade-old process. Although
                    Gillette's points are occasionally overargued and undersubstantiated, his work is an

          Journalism's Unofficial Ambassador: A Biography of Edward Price Bell,

        The subject of James D. Startt's well-written biography is remarkable from many points of
                    view. Born in 
            Parke County
          , Indiana, in 1869, Edward Price Bell became a reporter at fourteen, editor of his own
                    newspaper five years later, and, after graduation from 
            Wabash
           College in 1897, editor of the 
            Terre Haute
          
          Express. As a reporter in 
            Chicago
           the following year, Bell was a key figure in the expose of Charles T. Yerkes, 
            Chicago
          's infamous "king of traction." Within two years Bell had
                    earned such a reputation that the publisher of the 
            Chicago
          
          Record and the 
            Chicago
          
          Daily News sent him to 
            London
           to build what became the best of the early foreign news services, that of the 
            Chicago
          
          Daily News.
        
        
        While in 
            England
          , Bell established a reputation as "the dean of American
                    correspondents" in 
            London
           and developed the journalistic form that became his hallmark, the high-level interview.
                    Startt possibly exaggerates Bell's significance as an effective advocate of Anglo-American
                    cooperation during World War I, but there is no doubt that his journalistic work, especially his
                    interviews with Richard Haldane and Sir Edward Grey, attracted the attention of highly placed
                    persons on both sides of the Atlantic.
        Bell's career after 1922, when he returned to the 
            United States
          , was more ambiguous. Startt has captured much of the tragedy of the frustrated idealism
                    of those who championed the causes of international cooperation and peace during the 1920s and
                    1930s, only to watch their disintegration under the impact of economic depression, the rise of
                    totalitarian dictatorships, and the advent of World War II. Bell's principal vehicle in his
                    search for international understanding was the high-level interview, and he traveled far and wide to
                    interview such figures as Benito Mussolini, Ramsay MacDonald, Chiang Kai-shek, Manuel Quezon, and
                    Adolf Hitler. Like many American peace-seekers of that period, Bell was naive; he readily accepted
                    the sincerity of Mussolini's intentions and the now-incredible assertions of Hitler that
                    the Nazi dictator was also interested in furthering world peace.
        For his journalistic work and personal advocacy of Anglo-American cooperation in the late 1920s, Bell
                    was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize. Both eluded him, and it was soon
                    after these events that the journalist's fortunes began the decline which continued until
                    his death in 1943. By then Bell had become a sad and embittered figure whose frustrated attempts to
                    foster peace led to his break with the Roosevelt administration and his participation in the
                    isolationist (and hardly Anglo-American) America First Committee.
        Startt's research in archival and manuscript sources in the 
            United States
           and 
            England

           is thorough, but his use of secondary studies is less satisfactory. There is no
                    mention, for example, of the recent studies of Walter Hines Page, ambassador to the Court of St.
                    James's, who like Bell was a journalist and who campaigned perhaps too vigorously for
                    Anglo-American cooperation during World War I. The author's research seems to have been
                    completed several years before publication, as there are no references to books published after
                    1974. Despite this weakness, and despite a tendency to exaggerate its subject's  significance and character strengths, this biography is a competent and
                    professional study of the originator of the now-commonplace high-level interview.

          Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public
                        Information. By Stephen Vaughn. (

        During the past decade several worthwhile books and articles that treat domestic aspects of
                    America's involvement in World War I have appeared. Stephen Vaughn's Holding Fast the Inner Lines, a highly detailed institutional history of the Committee on
                    Public Information (CPI), is an important addition to that list. The CPI, a short-lived agency
                    created by executive order in April, 1917, had as its task the mobilization of public opinion in
                    support of World War I as a crusade to save democracy.
        The thesis of the book is clearly articulated. Vaughn argues that the organizers of the CPI, as well
                    as the high-minded journalists, academics, and social workers who carried out its program, were
                    progressive liberals who saw the agency not merely as a propaganda ministry but also as an
                    instrument for national reform to educate citizens in their responsibilities in a democratic society
                    at war. George Creel, who promoted himself as the chairman of the agency, is the major figure in
                    Vaughn's account. A journalist with little formal education, Creel infused the CPI with his
                    own naive faith in America's democracy, its citizens, and the justice of its cause in the
                    war against German militarism and authoritarianism.

        After recounting the origins of the CPI and the relationship of the reformers to its purposes,
                    structure, and personnel, Vaughn describes the literature the agency's several divisions
                    produced to define democracy, justify American intervention, and indict "the German
                    menace." In Creel's view, the task of the CPI was to be approached positively.
                    Unassimilated immigrants, including German-Americans, were not to be threatened or harassed. Instead
                    he hoped to lead them to strong loyalty to America and its democratic ideals through the
                    agency's educational programs. Nevertheless, much of the CPI propaganda  was immoderate. Despite the efforts of historian Guy Stanton Ford, the
                    head of the Division of Civic and Educational Publications, to hold his academic writers to proper
                    standards of documentation, much of the material aimed at 
            Germany
           was fabrication. Caught up in the emotionalism of the war effort, CPI authors often
                    sought to generate fear of what they understood to be the brutal, depraved nature of the enemy.
        Vaughn also describes the activities of the National School Service, a CPI branch charged with
                    promoting patriotism in the schools, and the Division of News, which produced a great quantity of
                    news releases, all factual but infused with the nationalist assumptions of the progressive
                    reformers. Particularly revealing are thirty pages of reproductions of CPI posters produced by a
                    group of well-known American artists led by Charles Dana Gibson. Some of these creations are
                    unrestrained in their presentation of 
            Germany
           as a plundering, raping, mutilating enemy.
        Vaughn's book is thoroughly researched, intelligently organized, and clearly written.
                    Originally a dissertation done at Indiana University, it is somewhat overblown as a book. The notes
                    and bibliography taken together constitute more than a third of the entire volume. Its main point,
                    the relationship of the nationalistic reformers to the prosecution of the war on the home front, is
                    convincing but non-controversial and possibly could have been made just as well in a carefully
                    crafted article.
        The book is also weakened by what the author chose not to do. By limiting himself to a description of
                    the CPI and its activities and eschewing analysis of its effectiveness, Vaughn leaves many important
                    questions unanswered. Did the CPI accomplish its goals? Was the war effort aided by this agency? Did
                    it genuinely threaten American liberties? Were the American people actually motivated by the CPI to
                    support the war? Were some people offended by its blatant propaganda but afraid to object? Was the
                    CPI actually instrumental in creating a legacy of anti-Germanism in American society? Until such
                    questions are probed we can learn relatively little about the role of propaganda in American history
                    from the example of the CPI.

                    $21.00.)
        These two volumes contribute to our knowledge of national prohibition during the 1920s. In common,
                    they are revised doctoral dissertations that begin with the newer understanding of the prohibition
                    movement as a mainstream American political and reform phenomenon, a response to the perceived
                    social problems associated with the saloon and the liquor traffic. They differ in focus, audience
                    appeal, and interpretive significance.
        
          Intemperance suffers only in comparison with Repealing National
                        Prohibition. Larry Engelmann has chosen to address a popular audience, and his book tells
                    the dramatic and colorful stories that were so much a part of the resistance of drinking Americans
                    to the imposition of prohibition. He concentrates on 
            Michigan
          , both because it was the first industrial state to enact prohibition (in 1916) and
                    because it was a center of rum-running during the 1920s. Well written, if atrociously proofread, it
                    suffers from an overdramatization at the outset that is simply incorrect. "The Eighteenth
                    Amendment, [the prohibitionists] assumed, was a final treaty of peace with the liquor traffic. They
                    were wrong" (p. xi). On the contrary, anti-saloon leaders suffered no illusions that the
                    evils of the liquor traffic would disappear with a change in the law. They thought of the amendment
                    as one major step to be followed with a sustained attack on the international traffic and with
                    either vigorous law enforcement or educational programs, or both, at home. Nevertheless, the author
                    is aware that the prohibitionists were reformers genuinely interested in addressing a widespread
                    problem of drug abuse, and he makes it clear that if their solution was unworkable, subsequent
                    generations have failed to provide entirely satisfactory answers. His thoughts deserve our
                    attention.
        David E. Kyvig's work should have a greater impact on the interpretation and teaching of 
            United States

           history. Granted access to the papers of the organized repeal forces, especially the
                    Association Against the Prohibition Amendment (AAPA), he shows that it was a compactly organized
                    movement that questioned the entire progressive faith in mitigating social ills through law. The
                    AAPA had a stroke of good fortune after 1928  when it captured
                    the headquarters of the Democratic party. The Democrats posed as the party of repeal, to 
            Franklin
           Roosevelt's discomfort, and both came to power in the post-1929 economic
                    catastrophe. Kyvig argues that Roosevelt's awareness of the anti-reform ideology of the
                    repealers and the rapidity with which they gained enormous public favor constrained the New Deal to
                    making institutional changes until after 1936, when Roosevelt defeated the AAPA, by then called the
                    Liberty League.
        Although this interpretation may attract the most attention from historians, the work has other
                    merits. It clarifies the whole legal and constitutional story of prohibition. It shows the irony of
                    prohibition's reputation as a political failure when, insofar as it is susceptible to
                    measurement, it cut alcohol consumption at least in half. The AAPA concentrated on the lawlessness
                    that prohibition produced and turned the economic benefits argument of dry leaders around after the
                    onset of the Depression.
        With the availability of these two well-researched and thought-provoking books on the 1920s and
                    repeal, a number of new questions arise about the prohibition movement itself. They involve what
                    happened to the Anti-Saloon League, so powerful in mobilizing popular sentiment and political action
                    from 1916 to 1919 and so helpless in resisting the AAPA after 1929. The newly available League
                    records in the 
            Ohio
           Historical Society will reveal answers and provide a fresh perspective on the dry side
                    of the episode.

          The Politics of Soft Coal: The Bituminous Industry from World War I through the New

        James P. Johnson has made an important contribution to the historical literature on the American coal
                    industry. Despite certain difficulties his book is both readable and informative and provides much
                    more than a chronological narrative of the coal industry from 1914 to 1940. Johnson's
                    purpose is to show how the history of the bituminous industry fits into the debate between the
                    so-called liberal historians such as Charles Beard, Richard Hofstadter, and Arthur M. Schlesinger,
                    Jr., who have argued that government has regulated American corporations in the public interest, and
                    James Weinstein, Gabriel Kolko,  and Samuel Hays, who have
                    asserted that industrialists "often captured or co-opted the regulatory agency"
                    (p. 3). Another purpose, closely related to the first, is to reveal how the structural
                    disorganization of the bituminous industry helped to determine (if not seal) its fate. Finally, he
                    tests the thesis presented by William E. Leuchtenburg in his article "The New Deal and the
                    Analogue of War" to see whether National Recovery Administration officials used government
                    regulation of the coal industry in World War I as a model for their actions during the Great
                    Depression. All three of these questions are of considerable interest to the historian.
        The author demonstrates convincingly that the bituminous industry was never really controlled by the
                    government and that it did not co-opt the regulatorsâ€”although a degree of both regulation
                    and co-optation did occur as part of the more congenial atmosphere during the war and Depression
                    emergencies. The industry was too fragmented, heterogeneous, and disorganized for either to prevail.
                    And, while evidence supporting Leuchtenburg's "analogue of war" theory
                    appeared in the rhetoric and plans of New Deal administrators, the economic circumstances of the
                    bituminous industry during the 1930s were so different from the wartime experience that controls
                    used to curb wartime inflation and to allocate scarce coal supplies were neither appropriate nor
                    workable. Efforts to raise prices and wages in the 1930s merely aggravated the long-term problems of
                    oversupply and diminishing demand as Americans turned to less expensive and more efficient gas and
                    oil.

        Unfortunately, the author's focus on specialized questions of historians blurs key economic
                    and political issues, makes the narrative difficult for the general reader to follow, and obscures
                    the larger importance of the book. In a time of petroleum scarcity and a return to dependence on
                    coal this book would be more usable and appealing as a straightforward economic history of the
                    bituminous industry. As such, it would show more clearly the many factors which worked together to
                    inhibit the industry during 1917 and 1918 and to bring its decline afterwards. The reader, for
                    example, would be able to see at once the effects of such factors as the myth of the "coal
                    trust," the strength of the United Mine Workers organization in northern mines, the advent
                    of petroleum fuels and technology, and the intense individualism and regional divisions of mine
                    operators. Readers also could see that the industry boomed but did not reach its full potential in
                    1918 because the federal government fixed prices too low. It declined in the 1930s at least in part
                    because of New Deal support for wage and price increases. The 
                    industry (including the UMW) was to blame during both periods for failure to organize itself and to
                    work with government agencies to assure its own survival. All of this material is in the book but
                    tends to be hidden by the author's historiographical orientation.

        Social history has come into its own. Over the past decade, scholars have abandoned more traditional
                    approaches to the past, which tended to focus on elites, and are now writing about the people often
                    left out of history books. Women, especially, are receiving unprecedented attention. Taking
                    advantage of the flood of primary and secondary source materials now available on the history of
                    women, Susan Estabrook Kennedy offers a carefully constructed synthesis of recent research on white
                    working-class American women. While hardly definitive and holding few surprises for those familiar
                    with the sources, her book provides a useful, compact introduction to the topic for the lay reader
                    or student.
        According to Kennedy, white working-class women were not, until recently, conscious of themselves as
                    an identifiable group. Until the industrial revolution, all women connected to a family unit shared
                    in the family work load. Unattached women hired themselves out, but since they had considerable
                    class mobility they did not develop a sense of group identity. With industrialization, home and
                    workplace became separated. Women with families tended to stay home as unpaid domestic workers;
                    those women who went out to work hoped for a future family niche and saw their work as only
                    temporary.

        Thus began, Kennedy reminds us, a pattern of exploitation of women workers. Unskilled women, planning
                    a short stay, flocked to the mills. There, without class consciousness, organization, or support
                    from male workers, who saw them as competitors, they accepted tedious jobs with low wages and long
                    hours, believing these to be only temporary. But many women stayed longer than they had planned. The
                    woman who never married, the orphaned older sister who supported younger siblings,  the woman whose family's earnings were simply insufficient,
                    the wife of a disabled man, the widowâ€”women like these worked not for "pin
                    money," but for survival. Their working conditions were often abominable, and for them
                    reform came slowly if at all.
        Kennedy enriches these generalizations with sketches of immigrant groups, individuals who wrote their
                    own stories, and the reform efforts of both working-class and middle-class women. There is a good
                    balance between narrative and example, with a sensitivity toward suffering that is not overbearing.
                    Her discussion of the "rescue" efforts of progressive reformers is especially
                    perceptive. She does not denounce them, as some writers have, for failing to be social
                    revolutionaries but appreciates the nuances and complexities of their aspirations for workers.
        Kennedy carries her history to the present, through the false promises and disappointments of the
                    postwar years, when millions of women gave up high-paying jobs and returned to
                    "women's work," to the confusing era of women's liberation.
                    Ending optimistically, she sees the beginnings of self-awareness and progress in the activism of
                    women workers today. This book is an excellent starting point for readers new to the field.

          Dixie's Forgotten People: The South's Poor Whites. By J. Wayne
                    Flynt. (
            Bloomington
          : Indiana University Press, 1979. Pp. xviii, 206. Illustrations, bibliography, notes,
                    index. $12.95.)
        Southern poor whites. The words project an image that to many Americans probably includes at least a
                    fleeting glimpse of some character from an Erskine 
            Caldwell
           novel or some dirty child from a 1960s War on Poverty photograph. Moreover, the
                    imageâ€”the stereotypeâ€”is not peculiar to the present. Antebellum travellers,
                    planters, and literary figures all took turns describing what they perceived as a woebegone people
                    not greatly different from the black slaves with whom poor whites shared soil and toil. Both Old and
                    New South, both East and West, knew the meaning (or thought they did) of the terms
                    "rednecks," "hillbillies," "woolly hats," or
                    "crackers."
        It is these "forgotten people," these men and women united by "a
                    brotherhood of misery," that 
            Auburn
           University's J. Wayne Flynt seeks to explain in this volume in the Minorities in Modern America series edited by Warren F. Kimball and  David Edwin Harrell, Jr. Arranged in a generally chronological format,
                    with a separate chapter on Appalachia, the book reads well, very well in places, displays solid
                    research over an extended time frame, and approaches some difficult questions in an appropriate way.
                    It is, simply said, a good book.
        Like all books, it is not perfect. One hundred and sixty-six pages of text allows
                    few subtle differentiations amidst numerous generalizations. Broad time periods covered within each
                    chapter occasionally leave the reader confused on cause-and-effect relationships. And the
                    differences between Appalachian poor whites and poor whites elsewhere could be better defined. In
                    fact, the whole question of who belongs to the poor white "minority" and whether
                    it is indeed an ethnic minority could be approached more systematically.
        Even given all this, Flynt's work offers many more insightful answers than disturbing
                    questions. One of his chief themes, for instance, is a refutation of the stereotype of a violent,
                    emotional, immoral people who have few aesthetic values. He stresses poor white cultural development
                    in the areas of folklore, folk crafts such as quilting, folk music of a unique kind, and a folk
                    religion that retained a sense of community. These traditional folkways, warns Flynt, must be
                    preserved, but they can be only if the nation "acknowledges that it has as much to learn as
                    it does to teach" (p. 166).
        Otherwise, the author's story is one of a struggling minority. Before the Civil War, poor
                    whites were often landless, sometimes malnourished (perhaps more so than slaves), and frequently
                    migratory. More ignored than exploited, they lived in a political and cultural isolation rather than
                    a physical one. Following the Civil War, the caste system became more rigid, and the poor received
                    even fewer crumbs from the New South economic table. Tenancy increased. The disillusioned turned to
                    industrial labor, only to find few rewards. Class divisions worsened. Then, in the 1930s, writers
                    "discovered" poor whites and told of their problems, and the New Deal attempted to
                    address some of those concerns. In the 1960s the process was repeated as only the names, agencies,
                    and nomenclature changed. Both victories and defeats followed.
        These, then, are the southern poor whites, a people history variously ignores, then highlights;
                    stereotypes, then studies; damns, then praises. They have long formed an important element in the
                    nation's past. With Flynt's effort they now are a much better understood part of
                    that past.

          Mary Beard as Force in History. By Barbara K. Turoff. (
            Dayton, Ohio
          :
                    Wright State University, 1979. Pp. ix, 85. Illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. Paperbound,
                    $8.95.)
        Barbara Turoff describes her work on Mary Beard as "an overview of her efforts to advance
                    the position of American women" (p. 2). As such, the book provides a foundation for further
                    study of this complex women, who was a pioneer in the study of women's history, a reformer,
                    a champion of labor, a proponent of women's archives, a feminist leader, and a coauthor
                    with her husband Charles Beard.

        Turoff divides Mary Beard's contributions into three categories: making history, writing
                    history, and educating women about their history. The author summarizes Beard's activities
                    in the Congressional Union and National Woman's Party and describes her writings in support
                    of suffrage and laboring women. As a writer of women's history, Beard is best known for Woman as Force in History, a polemic intended to refute the claim that women have
                    always been an oppressed group. Beard argued that status was determined by class, not by sex, and
                    that for centuries women had taken the initiative in promoting social change. Her major works on
                    women were undertaken to demonstrate women's contributions through the centuries and to
                    provide role models for twentieth-century women. In addition to writing, Beard attempted to persuade
                    women, libraries, universities, and other organizations to collect material pertaining to
                    women's history. Turoff describes the attempt to organize the World Center for
                    Women's Archives and Beard's willingness to aid colleges such as Radcliffe and
                    Smith in forming centers for the study of women's history.
        In this brief book Turoff has summarized Beard's life, provided short evaluations of her
                    contributions to history, outlined areas which need further research, collected an excellent set of
                    photographs, and included a bibliography of works by and about Beard. Turoff has benefited from
                    interviews, correspondence, and other aid from Beard's daughter and son. The result is a
                    tantalizing introduction to Mary Beard's activities and work and to the relationship
                    between the two.
