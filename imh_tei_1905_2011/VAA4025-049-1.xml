        <p>Bernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, remarked as he was traveling through New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1825 that "the little town… promises to be a flourishing

        <p>Early nineteenth century pioneers who took the long trek westward were generally seeking more than
                    just new and isolated places to establish residences. Many, of course, were farmers and planned to
                    continue the vocation and way of life with which they were familiar. But, too, there were many who
                    were inclined toward business and trade—successful merchants in the East who were lured
                    by the promise of even more success in the West—frustrated clerks and shopkeepers who
                    looked to the frontier for their one big chance. To all with mercantile ambitions the newly
                    established town offered an excellent opportunity for starting enterprises with a minimum of capital
                    and a prospect of quick return of profits.</p>
        <p>As incoming settlers established themselves in New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>

          </placeName> and increased the buying power of the community, there were merchants setting up shop
                    to supply the demand.<hi
            rend="sup">2</hi> Though there was some specialization from the beginning,
                    most of the early businesses were of the "general store" variety. As a rule the
                    merchants did not limit themselves to trade alone: there were doctor-merchants, lawyer-merchants,

                    well on the way in neighboring <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> during its first two decades. This development could be only a gradual one and come
                    about as the products from the surrounding farms were drawn to the town to be further dispensed to
                    needful areas along the river. New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> was but one of the dozens of settlements along the <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>-<placeName>
            <region reg="msu" type="state">Mississippi</region>
          </placeName> route that contributed its excess produce to the huge stock that accumulated at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
          </placeName>. Surplus crops did find their way over the crude roads to New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName>, but farm land in its immediate vicinity was not sufficiently productive to make the
                    town at this early date an important mart for farm produce. It was not until better wagon routes,
                    and eventually a railroad, enabled New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> traders to penetrate more deeply into the interior country that the town showed signs
                    of becoming an important commercial center.</p>
        <p>During the early years the supply of farm produce, if not wholly inadequate for commercial
                    transactions, was spasmodic enough to cause occasional confusion. Henry M'Murtrie in
                    commenting on this condition was referring principally to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName>, but what he said applied equally to the younger and less organized commercial activity
                    of New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName>. "The country in the immediate vicinity of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

          </placeName> can scarcely equal the demand created by them and the increasing population of the
                    town…. When there happens to be six or seven steam boats in port at once, it is extremely
                    difficult to procure the most common productions of the farm, and it is not uncommon to see people
                    riding out on horseback to intercept the provisions destined for the market. The hotels, taverns,
                    and steam boats <hi
            rend="i">must</hi> be supplied, cost what it will, and so great is the quantity
                    required for that purpose, that the citizens of the town are very frequently at a loss for
                    provisions for their table, if we except the articles of beef, mutton, and potatoes."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Still, the exchange of goods between town and country was vital from the first, and though barter was
                    the customary method of doing business, exchanged goods were successfully converted into salable
                    merchandise by the more enterprising <list type="footnotes">

                    as the periodic surplus of farm goods was passed on down the river and the profits converted into
                    new stocks of manufactured articles shipped in from the eastern cities.</p>
        <p>Customarily, New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> merchants traveled to the East at least once a year to restock their stores and prepare
                    for the next season's exchange. If successful in the year's transactions, they
                    would make the trip with full purses, but there were many last minute campaigns to gather enough of
                    the outstanding debts to make the trip to the East possible. Those failing to realize sufficient
                    cash from their businesses to replenish their stocks, gradually dropped out of the picture, only to
                    be replaced by others who were willing to take the gamble. One of the standard items of the
                    newspapers of the 1820's and 1830's was that referring to business failures
                    and the combining or withdrawing from merchant partnerships. A few stalwart tradesmen withstood all
                    the trials of the unstable market and were able to expand and prosper with the town. Others gave up
                    completely, or moved from the town to try their luck elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In 1819 five establishments received permits from the county officials to sell merchandise.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> By 1826 and 1827 an entirely new set of merchant names had made its
                    appearance. Men of this later date, such as Elias Ayres, James Brooks, the Conners, and the Shields,
                    established houses that were to last for several decades. The grocery and dry goods houses began to
                    cluster in the area along High and State streets—just about where the Scribners had
                    planned the business section. The early stores started on a retail basis, and as the outlying market
                    developed, they expanded to include wholesale transactions as well.</p>
        <p>Typical of the 1820 merchants was E. Baldwin. His assortment of goods, as advertised in the <hi
            rend="i">Chronicle</hi>, was restricted to staple foodstuffs and articles that could not be made
                    around the home. Among the items were "Kanhawa" salt, molasses, tea, sugar,
                    coffee, and lump sugar. He offered quite a selection of footwear "just received from the
                    Eastward," which consisted of men's leather shoes, men's coarse shoes
                    bound and unbound, grain shoes broad strips, grain shoes narrow strips, and men's wax
                    calf boots. He was willing <list type="footnotes">

        </p>
        <p>The earliest notices of specialization in the retail trade have to do with the drug, leather, meat,
                    and furniture concerns. Asahel Clapp established a drug business that was to prosper beyond the
                    Civil War years. He received his stock from both <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
          </placeName>, and, like his fellow merchants, tried to set his price low enough to avoid having
                    prospective customers crossing the river to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Clapp was one of the most highly respected men in the <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio Valley</region>
          </placeName> for his various medical and geological achievements, but from his newspaper
                    advertisements he apparently had no convictions against "representing in this
                    area" many of the eastern producers of fantastic remedies and quack panaceas.</p>

        <p>A number of men followed the leather business from the earliest days, combining the jobs of
                    processing the raw hides and selling the finished products. Seth Woodruff bought out George Barclay
                    in 1821 and kept on hand "sole, upper, and harness leather… also a first rate
                    two horse waggon &amp; harness." These articles were to be sold "low for cash,
                    or bartered for wheat, corn, bacon, or whiskey." Ashbrook &amp; Walker offered
                    "all kinds of Bridles, Martingales, Harness, &amp; Trunks…. By their close
                    attention to business, they hope to merit a share of public patronage."<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The embryo of the furniture business, which was to be one of the more successful enterprises in the
                    town many years later, could be found as early as 1827. Again there was the combined process of
                    manufacturing and selling. Levi Cobb's sale of "<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Windsor</settlement>
          </placeName> chairs" shows that at least some of the citizens of New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> were buying articles for more than strictly utilitarian purposes.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The meat or butchering business also began early in the town,<hi rend="sup">10</hi> and though the
                    local output never measured up to that of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName>, or even <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName>, its steady increase suggests that it was a profitable venture. Again New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> was limited by the poor productive quality of its rural hinterland, and other towns
                    were able to maintain and even increase their advantage in this respect.</p>

        <p>Industry in the new town was naturally restricted by the scanty resources and labor supply, as well

          </placeName>, dating back to the town's infancy, which stirred the pride of nineteenth

        <p>The first recorded steamboat built at New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> was a 364 ton affair, constructed by Shreve and Blair in 1817 or 1818.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The Shreve in this partnership was the same Henry M. Shreve who broke the <placeName>

          </placeName>-Livingston monopoly and successfully introduced his improved version of the steamboat
                    to the western waters. Shreve was not actually a resident of New <placeName>

          </placeName>, but rather one of the more illustrious "transients" who was

        <p>Of the forty active steamboats on the western waters listed by M'Murtrie in 1818, two were
                    built in New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName>. In addition to the "<placeName>

          </placeName>," there was the 217 ton "Volcano," built by John and Robeson
                    De Hart. William Blane, the English traveler, recorded as New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>

          </placeName>
          <hi rend="i">Ledger</hi> gave some details on the "Indiana." She was a
                    sternwheeler, with a tiny room on the main deck serving as a cabin. The New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> merchant, Charles Paxson, built her, and as captain took her to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

          </placeName>. While in that city in the spring of 1822 most of the crew died from yellow fever. As a
                    result the superstition prevailed that steamboats were unlucky, and it was a long time before
                    another crew could be rounded up to bring the "Indiana" back to its home port.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Another story of an old settler stated that the "Oranoke," was built "way
                    back about 1819."<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The launching of this boat did not occur on the
                    town river front where the industry later centered, but up above the town on Silver Creek. According
                    to the tale as related over fifty years following the event, a ship carpenter by the name of
                    Garrison built three boats on the creek, two on the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Clark County bank</region>
          </placeName>, and one on the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Floyd County bank</region>

          </placeName>. With the high water they were launched and floated down to the river. Even this early
                    there was a bottle of wine to break over the "Oranoke's" prow, and the
                    usual excitement attending such memorable events—including the fainting of two ladies
                    when the boat splashed into the water.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

        <p>Facilities for building the boats were not elaborate, the physical plant being little more than a

        <p>The boat building industry during its first fifteen years was not important because of the capital
                    investment or monetary value of its output. Such commonplace pursuits as house building, grocery
                    selling, and hog slaughtering probably surpassed it in these respects.<hi
            rend="sup">22</hi> Yet
                    there was a concentrated outlay that was conspicuous in a frontier community where people were not
                    in the habit of dealing in large lump sums. The total value of the seventeen boats built from 1818
                    to 1830 was $270,151.00, this being an average of $15,891.23.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> A fifteen thousand dollar project certainly would be enough to excite the curiosity and
                    interest of the early citizens. And of course there was an inexplicable drama about the whole
                    boat-building procedure that now lies concealed beneath the surface of a few stray statistics.</p>
        <p>If the early industry followed the pattern of later years when boatbuilding was at its peak, capital
                    did not come from within the town itself but from outsiders who sojourned in the town just long
                    enough to have the work completed. As will be shown later, this practice gave a precarious financial
                    basis to what was outwardly a prosperous business.</p>

                    give it that thriving appearance so often noted by contemporary observers. The output of the various
                    workshops was not great, and with perhaps one exception, there is no evidence that New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName>-made products were designed for more man the local market. Many of the articles were
                    undoubtedly crude, just a step beyond being "home made"; but the extent to which
                    the population engaged in these crafts suggests that during the first few decades of the town there
                    was a demand to be fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Already some mention has been made of the early attempt to establish mills in the new town. A mill
                    was one of the enterprises most obviously needed in a new settlement, not only to grind grain, but
                    to saw logs and fashion lumber for the many buildings. Josiah Trublood's mill was already
                    in operation on Falling Run Creek when the Scribners came, but it was too restricted by periodic
                    high water and droughts to suffice for the growing community. The Scribners shipped in a small steam
                    engine from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>

          </placeName>, and after a failure or two had their mill running by 1515. But another mill a few
                    miles up the river at the Falls was too much competition for them, and they had to convert their
                    ambitious project into a "roosting place" for hogs.<hi
            rend="sup">27</hi> Then
                    came the Paxson mill, which was the first really successful industrial enterprise in the town. It
                    established on a firm footing an industry that grew as the town grew. By 1819, Paxson's
                    mill was valued at three thousand dollars, and was the most valuable piece of property in town.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

        <p>The most ambitious industry started in New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> in the early years was the Indiana Cotton Manufacturing Company. John Badger, a recent
                    arrival from the East, first organized the corporation in 1820, supported by seven of the
                    town's more prosperous citizens. A year later three of the participants dropped out and
                    the company was reorganized. An editorial from a local paper shows what the company planned to do.

                    seen that was manufactured in America. Dr. Joseph Whitcomb has been appointed agent for the company,
                    &amp; has plenty of cloth for sale at his door, much cheaper than imported.
                    'Thus,' as Mr. Niles says, 'step by step we are getting up the

        <p>The machinery was operated with the power supplied by a pair of persistent oxen trying to climb a
                    tread wheel. The only report of wages in the mill is from an old resident of 1882 who worked there
                    when a boy; for a week's labor he was paid cotton yarn worth 37 ½¢.
                    In spite of this evidence of thrift on the part of the managers, the cotton manufactory did not

                    of the frontier about it to serve as a site for a project of this type and scale. Yet, the attempt
                    shows that outsiders and the wealthier townspeople alike had some regard for the natural advantages
                    of the place and were willing to take a chance on its future prosperity.</p>
        <p>Many of the small craftsmen devoted their time and skill to supplying the citizens with garments of
                    one kind or another. Henry Reinaking moved from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                    "orders for every description of work in his line." William Humphreys ran a

        <p>In addition to the previously mentioned leather, furniture, and foundry trades there were other
                    industries in the town of a heavier nature. Charles <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>

          </placeName> contracted to make wagons and coaches according to the specifications of his patrons.
                    Dorman Smith established himself in town about 1827 "to execute all kinds of coopering with
                    the exception of cedar work." The same year C. F. Fontaine began to manufacture sheet iron
                    and tin plate for both the retail and wholesale trade. There is no known record of just how
                    elaborate his establishment was. Charles Woodruff made tools at his "Plane
                    Manufactory." His customary notice in the <hi

                    somewhat puzzling advertising approach: "If the present pressure of the times effect the

            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName>, but there is evidence that while the town was in the process of settlement there was
                    work enough around for everybody. If a newcomer could not find some means of supporting himself in
                    the town, he had but to move on down the river till he found a place more suitable. Many stayed on,
                    some to work as clerks in one of the stores, most to work as laborers. Obituaries show that many
                    poor young men who stopped at New <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
          </placeName> to seek their fortune were honored at their death as prosperous and influential
                    citizens. Many more remained poor, and about all that could be said at the time of their decease was
                    that they had been stalwart citizens. The part that these "stalwart" citizens had
                    in building up the place cannot be over estimated. As an ambitious settlement, eager to expand and
                    become more populous, no other sentiment than that of welcome to all comers could prevail. The man
                    with brawn to contribute was particularly welcome.</p>

        <p>The small industries, as well as the surrounding farms, received a considerable share of their labor
                    by way of the apprentice system. This can be seen from the number of apprentices who were reported
                    to have escaped from their masters. The unflattering descriptions publicized by the wronged masters
                    suggests that the system was not working too well and <list type="footnotes">

        <p>What little information can be found on wages during this period indicates that compared to present

            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName> mechanics received from $7.50 to $10.00 a week, and a similar, or

        <p>A stable circulating medium was absent in the commercial transactions of the early town, and the
                    contemporary writings attest to the confusion that resulted from this condition. Since
                    "hard" money was scarce, the choice lay between worthless paper currency or no
                    money at all. Paper from the branch banks of the state was refused by most citizens and was hardly
                    considered current money. The newspapers ran a regular column designating the banks whose notes were
                    received for cash at the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
          </placeName> land office. This land office did not redeem its own notes of less than five dollars.
                    The nearest offices whose notes were considered good risks were as far away as Shawneetown, <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>

            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>

          </placeName> had nicely engraved notes, but they were worth only fifty cents on the dollar.
                    Merchants like Paxson and Eastburn had a profitable sideline in buying in the more valuable paper on

        <p>To the confused money market the town trustees in 1821 added two hundred fifty dollars of town
                    currency. This was to be eventually returned to the town treasurer in payment of the corporation
                    taxes. Also contributing to the general hodgepodge were the "tickets" issued in
                    small denominations by private citizens. There was no way to curb the widespread forging of
                    signatures and counterfeiting.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Notices of litigation and threatened litigation for nonpayment of debts were standard fillers in the

        <p>The threats were not baseless, for the advertisements of sheriff sales were likewise frequent. This
                    one shows that justice sometimes cut pretty near the quick. "James Pearson vs. John Lamb

        <p>Most of the legal action in the local courts concerned debts and land exchange. Many settlers came to
                    the new settlement, purchased plots of land, and then, failing to "make a go of
                    it," took off for somewhere else. The land being the only tangible asset of the debtor, it
                    was gained by the creditor through a "foreign attachment."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
                    Thus there was a constant shifting of land ownership. Speculators in land could not fail to profit
                    by the unstable economy, but taxes had to be considered in any ambitious program to "buy up
                    the town." Excess capital went into enterprises whose profits were not so distantly
                    removed.</p>

        <p>Lawyers made an early appearance in the town, and from the number who professed to practice law,
                    there was considerable legal business to be attended to. Much of the work consisted in preparing
                    briefs in debt collection cases, or giving advice to one or another of the participants in a land
                        dispute.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Occasionally a divorce suit served as a break in the routine.

        <p>Statistics have been sought after in the past by only a few scholars, and in fact avoided by others.
                    In recent years a number of historians have been more interested in social history than in the
                    political story and have gleaned the original census returns to produce their narrative. Among some
                    of those who have been actively engaged in working with the census are Frank L. Owsley of <placeName>
            <region reg="alu" type="state">Alabama</region>
          </placeName> and his student, Chase C. Mooney of Indiana University, who has completed an extensive
                    study on slaves in <placeName>
            <region reg="tnu" type="state">Tennessee</region>
          </placeName>. Another student of the census, Hildegard Binder Johnson of <placeName>
            <region reg="mnu" type="state">Minnesota</region>
          </placeName>, has won wide acclaim for her scholarly articles on a number of Middle Western States
                    and especially on Germans. And more recently, Barnes F. Lathrop has completed a study of <placeName>
            <region reg="txu" type="state">Texas</region>
          </placeName>. The authors of most of the studies that have been published or are now in progress
                    have used or are using the sampling method to arrive at their conclusions.</p>
        <p>The most detailed study now available for any state was completed in 1950. This research covers
                    twenty-one counties in Indiana north of the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash River</region>
          </placeName>. Because of the time element in reading microfilm and compiling statistics, it may
                    require another ten years before an exhaustive account can be given for the entire state of Indiana.</p>

        <p>Not until 1830 was a census taken in northern Indiana. At that time there were 3,380 inhabitants,
                    exclusive of Indians, living in this region. By 1840 the number totaled 65,-897. During the next
                    decade the population had increased to 165,286, representing thirty states and twenty-six foreign
                    countries. Some of those individuals may have migrated to this Hoosier wilderness to improve their
                    financial s'tatus, while others may have been imbued by the spirit of adventure. <list type="footnotes">

                            Seventh <placeName>
                <country reg="-us">United States</country>
              </placeName> Census, 1850, Indiana. A copy of this census in microfilm is on file in the

              </placeName>, Indiana. It should be noted that the boundaries of the counties in this study
                            were those of 1850 and not as of today. For changes of county boundaries see, George Pence

                    talents which might have remained dormant in the state or country of their birth.</p>
        <p>By the time the 1830 census was taken only four northern counties were settled. Allen, <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region type="county">St. Joseph</region>
          </placeName> were border counties, and <placeName>
            <region type="county">Cass County</region>
          </placeName> in the interior had proved the more popular area for settlement. Ten years later
                    twen'ty-one counties north of the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash River</region>
          </placeName> in the Hoosier State had been populated. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
          </placeName> County with over eight thousand inhabitants was the more densely settled. In 1850,
                    however, <placeName>
            <region type="county">Allen County</region>
          </placeName> had more people living within its borders than any other county in the region.</p>
        <p>While the increase in population in these northern counties is of interest, the more noteworthy
                    factor may be the nativity of those inhabitants who were living there at the time of the seventh
                    census. Over sixty-three per cent had been born in the North Central States and in all probability
                    were the children of parents who had migrated from other sections and from foreign countries. A
                    further analysis of the above percentage indicated that more than thirty-five per cent were native
                    Hoosiers. Six counties had more Ohioans than Indianans. Of this number four: <placeName>
            <region type="county">Kosciusko</region>
          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region type="county">Noble, Starke</region>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region type="county">Whitley</region>
          </placeName>, were interior counties; and only two, <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">De Kalb</settlement>
          </placeName>, bordered <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>. That immigration from the Buckeye State to this area was of more recent date than to
                    other counties in northern Indiana is substantiated by the fact that the younger children had been
                    born in <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>.</p>
        <p>After 1830 the National Road no longer served as a dividing line for the Southerners, who now began
                    to swing their axes to clear areas for settlement in the region north of the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash River</region>
          </placeName>. In the next twenty years approximately twelve thousand had settled in northern
                    Indiana, representing thirteen states from the South. Fifty per cent of this number were Virginians.
                    Kentuckians and Marylanders were also well represented. <placeName>
            <region type="county">Miami</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash counties</region>
          </placeName> were more favored for settlement by Southerners. As a rule, immigrants from the South
                    reached Indiana by traveling through <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>. Then, too, there were those who lived for a number of years in southern Indiana before
                    removing to the area north of the <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash River</region>
          </placeName>. Children were born in <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName> and in counties south of the National Road.</p>

        <p>Slightly less than thirty-two thousand came from the Middle Atlantic States. Over fifteen thousand
                    were natives of <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-025" n="19"/>
          <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName> with approximately sixteen hundred choosing <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Elkhart</settlement>
          </placeName> County. Since the natives of the Keystone State surpassed the number of New Yorkers in
                    the interior counties, it is likely that the Pennsylvanians may have traveled on such a central
                    route as the National Road which linked with the <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> Road at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
          </placeName>, and then gradually distributed themselves on either side of the latter highway. That
                    such a route was probably followed is further substantiated by the fact that many children of
                    Pennsylvanians were born in <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>. On the other hand, more than fourteen thousand came from <placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York</region>
          </placeName>, of which two thousand had settled in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
          </placeName> County. With only a few exceptions the counties along the lake and the <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> border were more favored by natives from the Empire State than the interior counties.
                    Except for approximately twenty-two hundred citizens from <placeName>
            <region reg="deu" type="state">Delaware</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region reg="nju" type="state">New Jersey</region>
          </placeName>, the immigrants from <placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName> comprised the entire population of the Middle Atlantic States who moved into northern
                    Indiana.</p>
        <p>Among the native-born population about three per cent were New Englanders, who had left the rolling
                    hills and rocky ledges for the open prairies and marshes of northern Indiana. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
          </placeName> counties were the choice of the largest number of Yankees. There were more sons and
                    daughter from <placeName>
            <region reg="vtu" type="state">Vermont</region>
          </placeName> than from any other New <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England State</country>
          </placeName>, although <placeName>
            <region reg="ctu" type="state">Connecticut</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region reg="mau" type="state">Massachusetts</region>
          </placeName> each were represented by slightly more than eleven hundred. The Yankees settled in
                    larger numbers in the border counties, and as early as 1850 had to their credit the founding of
                    Orland Academy in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Steuben</settlement>
          </placeName> County, thus giving some indication of Yankee interest in higher education. John
                    Stocker from the Green Mountain State did the spade work in this county and no doubt was responsible
                    for luring New Englanders to the region. Another Yankee, Solon Robinson, who came from <placeName>
            <region reg="ctu" type="state">Connecticut</region>
          </placeName>, was the leading spirit in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Lake County</region>
          </placeName>. In all likelihood the New <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England</country>
          </placeName> group made its entrance into Indiana by a northern route. Judging by the nativity of
                    children, some Yankees came by way of <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName> and others lived for a number of years in <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName> after leaving the Wolverine State before settling in Indiana. A number of New
                    Englanders and Southerners, as well as some foreigners, by-passed the Hoosier State for <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
          </placeName> and lived there from five to ten years before retreating into Indiana.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-049-1-026" n="20"/>
        <p>Interestingly enough, the counties, which were popular with New Englanders were also the choice of
                    natives from the Empire State. One may, therefore, conclude that many of the ancestors of New
                    Yorkers were Yankees. Probably fifty per cent or more of the native New Yorkers who settled in
                    northern Indiana were of New <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England</country>
          </placeName> extraction.</p>
        <p>Approximately eleven thousand inhabitants of the total population were natives of foreign countries,
                    and over a third of the entire alien population was concentrated in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Allen County</region>
          </placeName>. Furthermore, the Germans made the most indelible impression of any group. Their
                    numbers were more pronounced in Allen and Lake counties than those of all other aliens put together.</p>
        <p>In 1850, there were 433 Negroes in northern Indiana, and about thirty per cent of this number were
                    natives of the Southern States. The majority of them were living in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Allen, Cass</region>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region type="county">Whitley counties</region>
          </placeName>. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Lake, Marshall, Pulaski</settlement>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Starke counties</settlement>
          </placeName> had no colored population. Approximately fifty-eight per cent of the Negroes were
                    natives of the North Central States, to which their parents may have migrated from the Southern
                    States. In all probability some of the colored people accompanied a master from the South to the
                    Hoosier State and once on free soil continued in his employ or pursued some other occupation.</p>
        <p>At the time of the 1850 census 110 Indians were living in northern Indiana. Of this number seven had
                    settled in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Cass County</region>
          </placeName>; five, in Marshall; eighty-three, in Miami; and fifteen, in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Wabash</region>
          </placeName>. Four were born in <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, one each, in <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName>, and <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName>; and one hundred and two, in Indiana. The birthplace of one was unknown. One may assume
                    that they had never become a part of an emigration trek or that if they had removed to a western
                    state, at the time of the seventh census they had returned to their old stamping grounds.</p>

        <p>In addition to the nativity of northern Indiana's population, the age distribution of the
                    inhabitants is worthy of consideration. The largest number below twenty years were born in the North
                    Central States, with the majority being natives of the Hoosier State. Hence, the parents in most
                    cases were born in other states and foreign countries. Eighty-eight per cent of the New Englanders
                    were above twenty and fifty-four per cent above forty. The Southerners ranked next with eighty-five
                    per cent above twenty and forty-four per cent above forty, <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-027" n="21"/> and
                    they in turn were followed by the natives from the Middle Atlantic States with seventy-three per
                    cent above twenty and twenty-nine per cent above forty. While seventy-four per cent of the
                    foreigners were above twenty, there were only twenty-seven per cent above forty in this group.
                    Almost seventy-eight per cent of the Middle Westerners were below twenty years of age, but for the
                    Hoosiers it was ninety-three per cent in the same range.</p>
        <p>Although the Hoosiers constituted over thirty-five per cent of the population in the region, it
                    should be noted that the majority of them were below ten years of age. For this reason one might,
                    therefore, conclude that the number of Indianans is not of any great significance, especially since
                    the parents themselves had come from New <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England</country>
          </placeName>, from the South, from the Middle Atlantic States, or from foreign countries. It was,
                    after all, the older generation that made the furrow which the children followed.</p>

        <p>By the end of 1856, Joseph Rodes Buchanan was ready for a change of environment. The events of that
                    year, which had led to the disruption of the Eclectic Institute and the establishment of a rival
                    school, had convinced him that he was "out of his element." He felt that he had
                    been "placed in a false light by appearing as a representative of practical medicine rather
                    than as the promulgator of a new philosophy," and he longed to be away from the scene of
                    his defeats.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In addition, for more than five years he had been separated from
                    his family—except perhaps for infrequent visits—because the failing health of
                    his wife, "and other personal reasons," had necessitated their removal to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName> in July, 1851.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Thus, early in 1857, Buchanan severed his relations
                    with the newly established Eclectic College of Medicine and rejoined his family in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName>.</p>
        <p>He arrived in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName> just in time to get into the thick of the political strife which grasped <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName> in the years preceding and during the Civil War. Heretofore Buchanan had taken no part
                    in politics, having regarded politicians as nothing more than a necessary evil; but disappointments
                    in his chosen career, plus his apparent realization of the fact that basic principles were at issue,

        <p>Humanitarian that he was, Buchanan was fundamentally opposed to slavery, and he quickly lined up with

              </placeName> in that: (1) he did not consider colonization essential, though he would favor

              </placeName> recommended twenty-five); and (3) he thought the mere emancipation and
                            colonization of the Nero wholly insufficient. "If the negro is to be restored at

          </placeName> Congress. Campaigning under the banner of the Peace party, he was unsuccessful in this

                    advanced to a position of leadership in that organization, and late in 1863—or early in

                    said positively that "the convention must not be holden [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]";
                    he did, however, retain a list of the delegates, remarking that "it might be of great

                    and Leathers to explain their absence. According to his letter, which was promptly read before the

                    that he was guilty of no crime "but devotion to democracy and abhorence of war."

                    1856 to 1866. One writer has said that from 1856 to 1861 he devoted himself mainly to the care of
                    "his family and property" in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

          </placeName>. The family mentioned consisted of his wife— who for several years had been
                    in poor health, and therefore probably required a good deal of his attention—and four
                        children.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName> nothing has been found. Quite likely he owned his home, though frequent references to
                    his residence would seem to indicate otherwise; but whether he possessed any rental or business
                    property is merely a matter of speculation. In order to support a family of five, however, he must
                    have had some source of income during the years that he was not employed as a teacher, and the fact
                    that Judge John Rowan was quite wealthy leads to the suggestion that Mrs. Buchanan may have
                    inherited some property in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
          </placeName>.</p>

        <p>It is also possible that Buchanan devoted a part of his time during these years to experiments in
                    mechanical science. Like his father, he had always been interested in new inventions, and
                    occasionally he tried his hand at the art. In 1849, while discussing the various proposals for a
                    transcontinental railroad, he questioned whether, in the future, "the line of quickest
                    travel will be on solid iron rails… or whether it will be THROUGH THE AIR!"
                    Continuing this line of thought, he wrote: "For my own part, I do not believe the air line
                    of travel impossible, even without the wire-way to guide it, and the balloon to support it. It is
                    only requisite that we obtain a sufficient amount of power in proportion to the weight of machinery
                    employed. <hi
            rend="i">Such an apparatus</hi>, capable of generating the necessary power for an
                    aerial flight, <hi rend="i">I have invented some years since.</hi> It is possible that I may find
                    time and means to put the invention into operation. It is needless to say, that, for such a purpose,
                    a much more efficient power than steam or galvanism will be required—a power which may be
                    dangerous, if not carefully guarded by strong apparatus.</p>

        <p>"Such machinery I have invented: the principles are simple enough, and if my own machinery
                    should not be executed, I doubt not that others will grasp the same idea, and that in a few years
                    more, aerial navigation will be as common-place a fact as the magnetic telegraph."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
        </p>

        <p>It cannot be denied that Buchanan called this one right; and it would be of interest to know the

        <p>It is becoming more and more evident that archeology no longer limits its interests and activities to
                    the study of prehistoric peoples or to ancient civilizations that have produced great works of art
                    and architecture. Experience in this country over the past fifteen or twenty years has demonstrated
                    quite convincingly that the methods and techniques of archeology can be applied advantageously to
                    the field of local history. This has come about, I believe, not only because archeologists have been
                    willing to enter new fields, but also because the interests of local history have broadened.
                    Archeology cannot contribute much to a study of genealogy, but local history groups have certainly
                    advanced far beyond the narrower objectives of genealogical societies.</p>
        <p>It is surprising that historians in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> have been so slow in making use of this obvious historical tool, for in European
                    countries, especially Great Britain, historians and archeologists have been working hand in hand for
                    a long time. This has been especially noticable in their county "antiquarian"
                    societies.</p>
        <p>In my talk to you today I am for the most part, going to be strictly practical and discuss with you
                    how you might go about getting some digging done when and if you decide you can use more information
                    than you can find in books, letters, deeds, and other historical standbys. I am not going to try to
                    sell you on the advantages of tackling local history with a pick and shovel, for I am confident that
                    all of you are acquainted with the accomplishments and possibilities of archeological research in
                    the study of American history.</p>
        <p>I would like nothing better than to tell you about some of these projects—the recent work
                    at the site of the iron furnace at Saugus; the work on Pilgrim plantation sites around <placeName>

                    like particularly to describe the contributions that have been made by archeologists in the study of
                    the Spanish, French, and English colonial periods. Then there are the numerous projects connected
                    with the restoration of historic structures; projects, by the way, that are especially susceptible
                    to the application of archeological procedures. Since I will not be able to discuss any of these
                    projects associated with historic house restoration, I want to emphasize that the contributions of
                    archeology in this particular field have furnished much more information of historical interest than
                    just the reconstruction data.</p>
        <p>To point up some of the problems, more than to show accomplishments, I will take time to describe
                    briefly one example—the work carried on by the National Park Service over the past four
                    years at Fort Raleigh on <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Roanoke</settlement>
          </placeName> Island, <placeName>
            <region reg="ncu" type="state">North Carolina</region>
          </placeName>. Although we have completed the project there with a reconstruction of the original
                    fort, this was not the original objective. In fact, when we started the work in 1947, we had no idea
                    that reconstruction would be at all possible or desirable. Our primary aims were to locate and
                    identify the site and to add any information possible to the scant documentary sources as to the
                    layout of the settlement, types of structures built, and other facts concerning the history of this
                    first English colony. There were no maps or drawings dating from the period of the settlement and no
                    written descriptions. In fact, we were not at all certain that we were exploring the actual site
                    where the Raleigh colonists settled.</p>
        <p>It was not entirely a matter of working in the dark, for there did exist a small rise of ground which
                    tradition had long held to be the site of the, "Citie of Ralegh in <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName>." During the first season, funds were inadequate to carry out a large-scale
                    excavation, so it was important that every trench be so placed that it would be most apt to produce
                    tangible results. The first thing we did was to excavate an exploratory trench, five feet wide,
                    straight across one edge of the traditional fort site. Tradition proved to be right. Our first
                    trench cut across two old ditches, which further exploring proved beyond a doubt to be the remains
                    of an old earthwork.</p>

        <p>The next question was to determine whether these were remains of the 1585 fort, or a later defensive
                    work, possibly <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-077" n="71"/> even a Civil War fort, of which there are several
                    nearby. We were prejudiced against accepting this immediately as the 1585 fort, both because of the
                    usual "scientific caution" for which archeologists are famous, and because we had
                    always conceived of Fort Raleigh as having been a rugged structure of immense logs set upright in
                    the ground, rather than a simple earthwork.</p>
        <p>We recognized that one definite means of identification would be the finding of objects of the
                    Elizabethan period in such a position that their presence could only be explained by the acceptance
                    of this ditch as part of the original fort. Archeologists, of course, depend a lot on artifacts. Our
                    first season's work, however, failed to discover such objects, but we did uncover enough
                    of the original fort ditch to enable us to determine the approximate size and shape of the
                    earthwork. When plotted on paper the fort outline strongly resembled the earthwork built by Ralph
                    Lane on the island of <placeName>
            <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
          </placeName> where the colonists stopped on their way to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Roanoke</settlement>
          </placeName> Island. By good fortune, this Puerto Rican fort was sketched by one of the colonists
                    and the drawing is preserved to this day.</p>
        <p>The next season, 1948, we worked out the shape of the fort more exactly and even located its
                    principal entrance. It was now apparent that this was actually the fort built by the Raleigh
                    colonists for it was almost identical in plan to the one at <placeName>
            <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
          </placeName>. Moreover, it was typically medieval in form, especially in the absence of conventional
                    bastions which became so systematized and stylized in defensive works of this nature soon after this
                    time. The point of real interest is that the identification came about, not from direct
                    archeological evidence, but from the fortunate opportunity for combining archeological information
                    with historical knowledge.</p>
        <p>The earthwork erected on <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Roanoke</settlement>

          </placeName> Island in 1585 proved to be a small defensive work with an open space inside only about
                    fifty feet square. The ditch, which entirely surrounded the fort, except at the two entrances, was
                    roughly five feet deep and ten feet wide at the ground level. With the shape and orientation of the
                    fort determined, we were then in a better position to look for remains of the settlement itself.
                    Exploration within a reasonable distance of the fort has <pb

                    far failed to uncover any remains which indicate the presence of habitations, although we have run
                    some 4100 feet of test trenches. Either the remains were too superficial to have survived through
                    the years, or we have not yet explored the proper area.</p>
        <p>The final step in the study of the fort, and one that was carried out primarily for interpretive
                    purposes, was its complete excavation and reconstruction. Fairly authentic reconstruction was
                    possible because the exact shape of the ditch, as originally dug when the fort was built, could be
                    determined. First of all the entire area within the ditch line was carefully excavated, revealing
                    important information concerning the fort's construction and providing objects of the
                    period. The earth that had accumulated in the fort ditch through the years was then removed and
                    thrown up to form a parapet, much as the colonists had done in 1585.</p>
        <p>The earlier identification of the fort from its peculiar outline was substantiated by discovery of
                    several objects definitely of the period of the fort's construction. In addition to
                    information about the fort, the excavations provided other facts of interest and value. For example,
                    it was determined that the sand dunes lying between the fort and the shore of the sound had been
                    deposited since the fort was built. This helps materially in explaining the fort's
                    apparent unmilitary position behind a ridge which would have furnished perfect protection for any
                    enemy landing party. Information of this type, as well as the fort's reconstruction,
                    required extremely painstaking excavating and interpretation of the archeological evidence. The net
                    results include an informative and dramatic field exhibit and much new information concerning the
                    first English settlement in America.</p>
        <p>You are probably more interested in some of the practical problems encountered in a project of this
                    type than in the results, interesting as they are. I would say that this was a small sized project,
                    as far as work of this type goes. Even so, it represents an investment that would be out of reach of
                    many local history groups.</p>

        <p>The work, including the test trenching search for the area of habitation, was carried on during three
                    field seasons, each lasting from two to three months. Exclusive of the work of final shaping and
                    stabilizing the reconstructed fort <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-079" n="73"/> and the test trenching
                    outside the fort site, some 420 man-days of labor were used in the archeological explorations at the
                    fort site itself. Added to this was the cost of technical archeological supervision and necessary
                    supplies.</p>
        <p>We found that a crew of from six to eight men could be worked to best advantage on a project of this
                    nature. During the later stages of excavating, when considerable dirt had to be moved to shape up
                    the parapets, the crew was increased to around ten men.</p>
        <p>Now let us face the real problem of how a local history group can, and should, go about a project of
                    this sort. The problem, in fact, may be even more critical when the project is a small one, for it
                    is often more difficult to get a small job done than a large one. It is neither easy to raise funds
                    for a small project, nor to secure competent supervision, both of which are primary essentials for
                    any excavation. Many local history projects, important as they are in themselves, are not of a
                    nature that their sponsors can tap the resources of large research institutions, the Federal
                    government, or philanthropically inclined individuals.</p>
        <p>I could spend an hour admonishing you not to try to do the job without the services of a trained
                    archeologist. Even if I were to launch upon such a discourse, you could not accuse me of trying to
                    keep the plums for the profession, for there are many more projects waiting to be done than there
                    are archeologists to do them. The practical difficulty lies in the fact that the archeological
                    profession is not like architecture and most other technical professions from which you can secure
                    specified technical services no matter how large or how small your needs may be. I doubt if even the
                    classified directory for <placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York City</region>
          </placeName> carries a listing for "Archeologists."</p>

        <p>Another, and even more serious problem, is that there are relatively few archeologists with
                    experience in this sort of work, and essentially none who have had the specialized academic training
                    that would give them the necessary background. Most archeological students in this country do their
                    academic work in the general field of anthropology, having a course or so in archeological methods
                    and various courses on prehistoric cultures. Others receive highly specialized <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-080" n="74"/> training in the Oriental and Classical fields, but none have academic
                    training which qualifies them to excavate and interpret an early nineteenth century frontier
                    settlement, a Revolutionary War earthwork, a Colonial house site, or a seventeenth century Jesuit
                    mission site.</p>
        <p>Obviously, some means must be found for training enough men in the field of historic site archeology
                    to meet the growing demand for this type of research. There will be no candidates for these college
                    courses, however, until there are year-around positions available. But this is a broader problem
                    than the one we started out to discuss, and you are not necessarily concerned as individuals. As a
                    group, however, it is something that the American Association for State and Local History should
                    concern itself with.</p>
        <p>Confronted with this despairing picture, what is your course when you have an excavating project to
                    get done? Again, I am taking for granted that you have decided where you are going and
                    why you are going there, and that you have come to the conclusion, improperly or not, that your
                    problem calls for some archeology.</p>
        <p>Possibly this discussion will be more valuable if we use a hypothetical example, and let us take for
                    this purpose a traditional site of an old pottery kiln.</p>
        <p>You have, we will say, decided that, since pottery making has long been a key industry in your
                    community, it would be well to learn all you can about the presumably earliest factory, and to
                    develop the site, if feasible, as a supplement to related exhibits in your local historical museum.</p>
        <p>First of all you will need some money. If I knew something about your project, I could tell you
                    approximately how much money you would need, but I am not sufficiently clairvoyant to tell you where
                    you can get it. But the first step, even before you consider the cost of excavating and development,
                    is to gather together all available information you possibly can concerning the site, and then
                    systematically assemble the data into a comprehensive report. This material should include not only
                    that dealing with We physical history of the factory, but also information concerning the operation
                    itself; the people who operated it; the products made there; how they were made; the workmen who
                    made them; disposition of the products; and other pertinent data.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-049-1-081" n="75"/>
        <p>Compilation of this material will be needed in planning your archeological program; in fact, it is a
                    requisite to making your initial decision as to whether an archeological program should be
                    considered. The really important use of this compilation of documentary material will come during
                    the excavating and the interpretation of the archeological finds.</p>
        <p>Experience has shown that you will seldom, if ever, have the necessary information already assembled,
                    although you may have some fine studies and publications having to do with the site under
                    consideration. No single study is likely, however, to be sufficiently broad in its approach to meet
                    the present needs.</p>
        <p>This task of assembling and coordinating pertinent documentary material can often be carried out by
                    members of your local society, either as a joint project, with competent historical editing, or by
                    an individual, if one can be found with the time, interest, and ability. Do not leave this
                    documentary study for the archeologist to do. He, and you too, will be anxious to get at the
                    digging, and he will be too busy then to do any library research. Besides, you must have this
                    historical study at hand as a basis for planning the archeologist's project.</p>
        <p>The next step is to secure some good professional advice. If there is any one time in your entire
                    project when you need good, sound, experienced advice, now is that time. This advice should cost you
                    nothing, except possible disillusionment and exasperation. The counsel you are looking for at this
                    point is not how to excavate—that will come later; but you need to know the answers to
                    some fundamental questions: Is the idea of excavating the site feasible? How much will it
                    cost? How should the project be organized? How can it be
                    accomplished? Your state archeologist, if you have one, might well be the first person to
                    see, or there may be a qualified archeologist in your community or in a nearby university. But, by
                    all means, get the best possible professional help at this point.</p>

        <p>As to the expense of excavating, the two major costs are technical supervision and labor. Local
                    societies often ask if it is not possible to offset the high labor costs by voluntary help from
                    members of the society. Of course this is feasible under some circumstances, if your members are <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-082" n="76"/> willing to work. Excavating is no picnic, and it is usually not
                    practicable to carry on a project as a week-end activity. Students can often be employed during the
                    summer at nominal cost, which is preferable to hit-and-miss voluntary labor. And never, of course,
                    underestimate the ability of women in this respect.</p>
        <p>But no matter how successful you are in securing voluntary labor, I advise that you plan, if at all
                    possible, on providing a basic crew of hired laborers, say a minimum of two, to do the heavier work,
                    such as wheeling dirt. Also, be sure to save back enough money in your account to take care of
                    backfilling and final clean-up, because archeology suddenly becomes very tedious and tiresome when
                    there is nothing left but backfilling.</p>
        <p>There are other ways in which you can put local volunteers to work advantageously. Draftsmen and
                    engineers can help in mapping the site and setting the reference stakes, both of which should be
                    completed before the excavating begins. They can also help in recording finds, preparing measured
                    drawings of structural remains, and making photos and drawings for the final report. The cleaning
                    and cataloguing of excavated objects can be done by society members, and with a minimum of
                    supervision.</p>
        <p>Equipment needs are not great, and for a relatively small job they can usually be met within the
                    community. A few supplies may have to be purchased, such as photographic film, paper sacks, special
                    preservatives, and possibly certain specialized tools. Then there will be the cost of photographic
                    processing, and other incidentals. All told, these expenses can be kept relatively low without
                    jeopardizing the results of the work.</p>
        <p>Your most difficult problem will probably be the securing of a competent supervisor. You occasionally
                    hear of a baby being born in a taxi cab, but at least the mother presumably is headed for the
                    hospital. Emergencies also arise in our field, although rarely, when an inexperienced layman has, so
                    to speak, to deliver the archeological baby; but, as with childbirth, these matters can best be put
                    in the hands of a trained and experienced specialist.</p>

        <p>It is easy to say, "Hire a specialist." But, as I indicated earlier, this is seldom
                    possible on a small project that will <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-083" n="77"/> last only a few weeks, and
                    for which funds are often limited. If the work can be done during the summer, you can usually employ
                    a graduate student, but he will probably lack both the training and experience desired for the job.
                    It is not just knowing the fundamental field techniques that is important, but the supervisor should
                    preferably have had some experience with basic historical research and a knowledge of the cultural
                    remains likely to be encountered in the course of the excavating.</p>

        <p>If the project is primarily that of uncovering remains of a building for purposes of reconstruction,
                    then I am rather of the opinion you might do better with an architectural student than an
                    inexperienced archeological student. He would not know the tricks of archeology, but he would at
                    least know something about the things he would uncover. The important thing is, no matter whom you
                    get for this job, make certain that he can give full time supervision to the work. An alert,
                    intelligent person can learn quickly, but he cannot learn how to excavate from behind an office
                    desk; nor can even the most experienced man properly direct an excavation <hi rend="i">in
                    absentia.</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The technical supervisor's responsibility does not end with the backfilling of the last
                    trench; nor does yours as the sponsoring agency. The excavated objects must be cleaned and
                    catalogued and field notes and drawings have to be put in shape as part of the permanent record.
                    Then there is the final responsibility of a good report. This may necessitate further library
                    research or work with museum collections. It is best to allow a minimum of three months post-season
                    work on the part of the archeologist for every month of field work, and a safer estimate would be
                    six months.</p>

        <p>Now, if you are determined to do your digging and cannot employ a fully qualified archeologist for
                    the immediate supervision, then you should make sure that you can fall back on an experienced
                    archeologist for periodic consultation. He should be available for preliminary discussion with the
                    full time supervisor and with members of the society for working out the details of the excavating,
                    recording, laboratory processing, preservation and stabilization of structural remains, preparation
                    of reports, and other procedures. He should be consulted occasionally as the work progresses,
                    preferably at <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-084" n="78"/> the site. But if that is not practicable, the
                    supervisor can load up his field records and go to the consultant for a conference. Almost any
                    responsible archeologist, if he is not away on an expedition of his own, would be willing to
                    contribute this much, and even more, to a local project.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, then, this is what you should plan for if you decide within your local society that
                    you would like to embark on an archeological project at an historic site: <list type="simple">
            <item>(1) Assemble all readily available documentary data relating to the site and prepare a
                            well-organized report.</item>
            <item>(2) Consult a reliable, experienced archeologist, who can tell you how much the project
                            will cost and how to go about getting it done.</item>
            <item>(3) Based upon this advice, coupled with good, practical common sense on your own part,
                            secure necessary funds and set up your project. Funds should be sufficient to provide full
                            time technical supervision, adequate recordation, good photographs, laboratory processing
                            and adequate storage of artifacts and records, care of exposed remains, backfilling and
                            clean-up, and the preparation of a final report. These are "musts." You
                            should also have enough money to hire a small labor crew, even if volunteer help is
                            available.</item>
            <item>(4) Now go ahead and do the job as thoroughly and scientifically and scholarly as you
                            possibly can. Lean heavily on advice and consultation from men with the widest experience in
                            this field. Plan the job so that there is the least possible chance of having to terminate
                            it before it is finished; and it is not finished until the artifacts and exposed remains are
                            taken care of and the final report is written.</item>
          </list>
        </p>

        <p>Archeology, when properly done, can contribute a great deal to local history. It is of particular
                    value in securing knowledge about specific sites, whether the objective is restoration or simply
                    learning more about the physical history and appearance of the site, and about the people who lived
                    or worked there and the things they had and used. But archeology is not just digging, nor is it
                    simply a means of <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-085" n="79"/> acquiring museum objects; it is a useful
                    historical tool. It has come to have a very definite place in historical research, but its use as an
                    adjunct to American history is relatively new and it has a long way to go before it can be fully and
                    adequately utilized.</p>
        <p>This does not mean, however, that we must hold up on this type of research. We are bound to lose some
                    data from improper digging and through lack of adequately trained men, but if we recognize the
                    hazards and do all we can to meet them as soundly and competently as possible, then this new
                    historical tool will become increasingly valuable to the students of local history.</p>

        <p>Historians have long assigned to Caleb Mills the leading role in Indiana's free school
                    movement of the middle 1800's, a movement that culminated over one hundred years ago in the
                    passage of the state's first truly systematic free school law.<hi

                    Mills' most enduring claim to generalship in the victory lies in his six
                    widely-read "Educational Messages" written under the nom de plume

                    identity, and how and when his secret eventually became public are facts not revealed in the rather

            rend="sup">3</hi> A recently discovered letter<hi rend="sup">4</hi> from Mills to John Barron Niles is interesting therefore, both because in it Mills divulges
                    his identity as "One of the People" and because it reveals how thoroughly Mills
                    was a fighter and not simply a philosopher of the revolution. A brief narrative will place the
                    letter in its setting.</p>

                            prepared "An Address in Relation to Free Common Schools" in which it
                            pointed out that only 129,500 Indiana children, 37 per cent of those of school age, were
                            attending common schools and added "Then again it will be remembered that those who

                    the signature "One of the People."<hi
            rend="sup">13</hi> The writer pointed to
                    Indiana's lamentable inadequacy in the vital field of education, then passed to concrete
                    consideration of particular evils and of remedies. Public funds at that time devoted to schools came
                    largely from the federal land grant of one section in each congressional township.<hi
            rend="sup[">14</hi> The money derived from these sections was not consolidated and then distributed equally
                    throughout the state; instead each township kept whatever it could realize from its own section.
                    Thus the very commu- nities that most needed public assistance and could least af- ford to support
                    schools from local funds, <hi
            rend="i">i.e.</hi>, communities where land values were low and farms
                    poor, in fact received the least help from the land donation; prosperous townships got the highest
                    incomes from their more valuable lands. Such inefficient use of the funds must be rectified, said
                    the Address, by equal state-wide distribution. Furthermore and even more significant, the
                    really basic support for free schools must be raised by taxation. Finally, only if higher schools
                    improve will well-trained teachers be available; therefore let the county seminaries and the
                    state university be reorganized. Sell all the physical facilities of the seminaries and of the uni-

                            Mills was only one of many influential men who were active in championing the school
                            movement. For example the Common School Convention was attended by many men with a deep and
                            effective interest in education. Among its committees was one which, working with a
                            committee of the General Assembly, drafted a school bill for submission to the legislature.
                            The Common School Convention met on December 10, 1847, to review the report of this drafting
                            committee. This report may be found in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Documentary Journal</hi>,
                            1847, Part II, 145. The report of the committee of the legislature is on page 355.
                            Simultaneously, another group from the Common School Convention prepared a public appeal for
                            support for the free school movement, see page 161.</item>

                    The 1848 legislature to which the third message was addressed passed a new school law<hi

                    instruction in all schools in each congressional township. But this step forward was largely
                    vitiated by a local option provision whereby each county could decide for itself whether to operate
                    under the new system. The act also failed to consolidate the school funds and to require equal
                    distribution. The fourth address<hi

        <p>It was after his fifth address that Mills wrote Niles and revealed himself as "One of the

                    acquainted can be conjectured: Mills graduated from Dartmounth College in 1828, Niles in 1830.
                    Mills' reference to "scenes of bygone years" has just that touch of
                    nostalgia which supports the inference of an undergraduate acquaintanceship. Obviously Mills
                    expected sympathy from the well- educated Niles, himself a former teacher of chemistry in
                    the medical department of the Indiana Medical College of La Porte.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                <p>You may perhaps be surprised to receive a letter from me. It would be pleasant to sit
                                    down and chat over scenes of bygone years, but we revolve in such different orbits
                                    that it is utterly impossible to calculate when two such bodies will be in
                                    conjunction. Were it certain that the convention would not complete their labors by
                                    Christmas &amp; that the portion of the constitution pertaining to Education
                                    would not be disposed of before that time, I think I should confer upon myself the
                                    honor of a lobby membership for a few days. But I presume that period would be too
                                    late for the accomplishment of the principle object of such a visit and therefore I
                                    will venture to propos a conference on the subject of constitutional provision for
                                    popular Education. I presume you feel a deep interest in this subject &amp; are
                                    prepared to favor any plan that bids fair to accomplish the object in the most
                                    effectual manner. There is a strong disposition among timid polititions &amp;
                                    demagogues to skim along the surface and ask what will be popular, disregarding
                                    whatever is essential to their success, providing it is not grateful to the more
                                    ignorant or selfish of the dear people. Presuming that you do not sympathize with
                                    such &amp; are willing &amp; desirous to embody in the fundamental law of

                                    discussion. Now is the time to strike, and in the right spot. Can you not make a <hi

                                    and colleges are as indispensable to a good educational system as common schools?
                                    Show them that these higher institutions are the intellectual reservoir from which
                                    proceed the controlling influences of society. Whence proceed inventions and
                                    improvements in every department of human industry, but from awakened, cultivated
                                    intellects? Will you carefully read the several nos. if you have not already done it
                                    &amp; suggest any difficulties &amp; modifications &amp; thus give me an
                                    opportunity to explain, obviate &amp; demonstrate the soundness &amp; wisdom
                                    of the scheme. No one, who has <hi
                    rend="i">seen</hi> the operation of free schools
                                    in New England, will question for a moment, the wisdom, nay, the necessity of a
                                    partial support at least by taxation, &amp; the undesirableness of a fund so
                                    large as to superseed the necessity of taxation. This point being established, where
                                    is the necessity of a public fund larger than I have shown we should have from the
                                    three sources indicated. Let the Literature fund derived from the fines &amp;
                                    forfeitures, bank tax &amp; saline funds be consolidated &amp; appropriated
                                    for the encouragement of academics, common school libraries &amp; apparatus. New
                                    York has appropriated $90,000 annually &amp; for a series of years on
                                    the plan suggested securing the raising an equal sum by the recipiants of the grant.
                                    The fine and forfeiture funds, bank tax and saline funds would go but a little way
                                    in sustaining the common schools of the state, not amounting to 25 cents per head on
                                    all the children in the state; but for the purpos proposed, they would be
                                    sufficient, abundantly sufficient to secure a library of 150 or 200 vols such as you
                                    will see in the state library room, to every school district in the state. What a
                                    glorious point gained to secure such a result. Such a library would educate parents
                                    as well as children prove of untold value to every neighborhood. I hope you will
                                    both take hold of it yourself and endeavor to enlist others in its support. I have
                                    urged Jernigan to do what he can with the members of his acquaintance and hope you
                                    will stand up and support the Educational Committee should they propose it. Could
                                    you not get a dozen of your most intelligent &amp; influential members to unite
                                    &amp; push it thro' with a rush. In respect to the University plan, I
                                    see no objection at all. The funds are all in the possession &amp; under the <hi
                    rend="i">sole &amp; exclusive control</hi> of the State on my plan. It
                                    proposes to alienate not a dollar but to make every dollar tell on cultivated mind.
                                    It proposes nothing but what is just, liberal &amp; wise. You can see at a
                                    glance that the influence of its operation would be most happy &amp; efficient.
                                    It would do more to expose imposition &amp; elevate <pb
                    id="VAA4025-049-1-094" n="88"/> the standard of collegiate education than anything that

                    not thought the matter one to be embodied in detail in a constitution, certain it is that he never

                    and passed after amendment<hi

                    Mills' plan. True, the new constitution called for "a general and uniform system

        <p>To the 1851 General Assembly, then, Mills directed his last appeal,<hi
            rend="sup">31</hi> calling
                    attention to the peculiar significance any law passed at this time must have as a sort of
                    interpretation of the spirit of the new constitution.<hi
            rend="sup">32</hi> Buttressing his call for
                    immediate action by presenting even more depressing data from the recent 1850 census,<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Mills asked for a law embodying those details of his plan which were still permissible
                    under the new constitution. Fundamentally, the statute must provide three essentials; freedom,
                    competence, and supervision.</p>

        <p>The legislature's response must have been gratifying, for the comprehensive School Law of
                        1852<hi
            rend="sup">34</hi> was a long step in the march to organize in the state a system of
                    uniform public-supported schools. A taxing provision contained no such escape clause as
                    ruined the 1849 act; and school funds were to be consolidated and equally distributed.
                    Administrative organization too was revamped; the congressional township was abolished as an
                    administrative unit and local control of schools given to civil townships, under the super- vision
                    of a state Board of Education presided over by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Other
                    sections of the law taxed for the purpose of establishing township libraries, regulated the
                    examination and licensing of teachers, and <list type="footnotes">

        <p>Tsar Alexis, the second ruler of the Romanov dynasty and the father of Peter the Great, died in 1676.
                    Before his death he had been married twice, to Maria Miloslavskii and to Natalia Naryshkina, both
                    daughters of more or less prominent Russian boyars. These two marriages caused widespread political
                    repercussions in Russia. Before Maria's death her brother, Prince Ivan Miloslavskii, had
                    gained a dominant political influence at court and the names of various Miloslavskii relatives
                    appeared in rosters of high public office. Tsaritsa Maria's death in 1669 caused
                    consternation in the ranks of the Miloslavskiis and Alexis' marriage shortly thereafter
                    to Natalia Naryshkina aroused much resentment, especially after Natalia's favorite,
                    Artemon Matveev, displaced Ivan Miloslavskii as the principal figure at court. Gradually the
                    influence of Matveev and the Naryshkins became pre-eminent-but not for long. Upon Alexis'
                    death in 1676 Feodor, his eldest living son by his first wife, ascended the throne and the
                    Miloslavskiis came back into power. Matveev and the members of his family were immediately exiled.
                    But Feodor was a semi-invalid and it was apparent that he could not live long. The power-hungry
                    Miloslavskiis pinned their hopes on the succession of Feodor's brother, mentally
                    deficient Ivan, the second son of Alexis and Maria Miloslavskii. It was expected that a regency
                    would be needed for the incompetent Ivan, and who would be a more likely regent than Uncle Ivan
                    Miloslavskii. But the Naryshkins also had a candidate for the throne—Peter, the healthy
                    young son of Alexis and Natalia Naryshkina, who had not yet reached his teens. Obviously he, too,
                    would need a regent and who would be a more likely candidate than his mother's favorite,
                    Artemon Matveev.</p>

        <p>But the latter prospect was highly distasteful to the twenty-five-year-old third daughter of Alexis
                    and Maria, Tsarevna Sophia Alekseevna, sister of ruling Tsar Feodor. <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-098"
            n="92"/> Vainly she sought to persuade Feodor to name Ivan as his successor;
                    Feodor hesitated and died without naming anyone. Thereupon Patriarch Joachim, who favored the
                    Naryshkins, called upon a rump <hi
            rend="i">Zemskii Sobor</hi> (National Assembly) to choose a
                    successor to the throne. Although Miloslavskii partisans raised a few cries for Ivan, demands for
                    the more popular Peter arose on all sides and the nine-year-old tsarevich was proclaimed ruler. Six
                    Naryshkins were forthwith advanced to high places at court and Matveev was hastily summoned to
                    Moscow from exile. But Sophia Miloslavskii, though dumbfounded, was not vanquished. At once she
                    launched a campaign to undermine the Naryshkins. Rumors were circulated that Feodor had been
                    poisoned. Liaisons were established with some of the commanders of the Streltsy, the principal
                    military force in Moscow, and her agents ardently sought to incite revolt by forecasting terrible
                    oppressions to come under Peter. A death list of forty-six, including Matveev, many Naryshkins, and
                    their prominent supporters, was prepared of those to be killed by the Streltsy. The goal?
                    To elevate Ivan to the throne by deposing Peter or by arranging a joint rule, with Sophia as regent.
                    On May 15, 1682, word went out that Ivan was dead. The Streltsy at once moved into the Kremlin.
                    "The next few hours saw the beginning of one of Moscow's ugliest blood baths.
                    The pillage and carnage that gripped the city lasted for a week. At least seventy prominent leaders
                    in the new government were literally butchered…." Too late, it was discovered
                    that Ivan still lived, but by that time Sophia had assumed an active political role, and the
                    Naryshkins had been destroyed or vanquished by her Miloslavskii forces. Next, adopting a suggestion
                    made earlier by Sophia, the Streltsy requested that Ivan and Peter rule jointly. The
                    outcome? A new meeting of the rump <hi rend="i">Zemskii Sobor</hi> elevated the two boys
                    jointly to the throne, with actual control of affairs in the hands of Regent Sophia. For seven years
                    and four months, until she was driven from power by Tsar Peter, Sophia tightly held the reins of
                    government.</p>

        <p>Most of Professor O'Brien's volume is an intensive study of this period of
                    Sophia's rule, years which have usually been slighted by most historians on the ground
                    that they were a time of ineffective government and military failures. "Yet," <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-099" n="93"/> the author contends, "casting aside the issue of
                    legitimacy of rule, it is doubtful whether within the imperial family—during this
                    important period—a more capable regent than Sophia could have been found."
                    Professor O'Brien points to the vital changes which affected the cultural outlook,
                    economy, and foreign relations of Russia during Sophia's regency and shows how they were
                    largely the result of her enlightened and decisive leadership and that of her appointees.
                    "In the realm of cultural and diplomatic achievement, the tsarevna proved herself a worthy
                    daughter of Tsar Alexis and a distinguished representative of the Romanov dynasty. At home she
                    introduced reforms that were practical in purpose, if moderate in scope…. In both Europe
                    and Asia she and her advisers intelligently pursued Russian national interests…. It was a
                    government of distinction and promise which held together against great odds. Its policies were both
                    vigorous and enlightened."</p>
        <p>Professor O'Brien has contributed to a fuller knowledge of Russia in the years 1682-1689.
                    With the increased attention given to Russian history in American universities, it is essential that
                    more and more studies of this type be made, for Russian history under the tsars consists not alone
                    of the achievements of the outstanding and better known rulers. The book is clearly and
                    interestingly written, and is provided with copious footnotes and an extensive bibliography of works
                    in the Russian language. All in all, the author is to be congratulated on a work well done.</p>

        <p>William Dean Howells was <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> consul at Venice from 1861 to 1865. The experience was a determining one in his life.
                    It transformed him from an <placeName>

            <country reg="it">Italy</country>
          </placeName> upon Howells' literary creations. Woodress finds that five-sixths of
                    Howells' novels have some reference to his Italian experiences.</p>
        <p>The first chapter of the book is a resume of the four years which so influenced Howells. Numerous
                    letters he wrote from Venice to friends are cited; so are the references to Venice in the annual
                    reports of the Department of State. But only one of Howells' dispatches to the department
                    is cited.</p>
        <p>Woodress apparently was familiar with the contents of Howells' dispatches, now in the
                    National Archives. But they apparently did not contribute to his literary ends. Thus the book leaves
                    one wishing that one might know something of the official activities of the young consul in Venice.
                    That would have taken little space, since in one year only four American ships called at the port of
                    Venice. But the literary scholar is not interested in political and commercial history, just as most
                    historical scholars would not be interested in the material Woodress has used.</p>

        <p>The subject of this biography is well known to members of the Society of Friends as editor of the <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi> and General Secretary of the Five Year Meeting of Friends; to
                    others he is not so well known, although state and local historians will remember him as the first
                    director of the Indiana Historical Commission, organized in 1915 to direct the celebration of the
                    state centennial in each community and county of the state.</p>
        <p>Walter Woodward was a native Hoosier, born near <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
          </placeName> of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
          </placeName> parents in 1878. The family moved to the frontier <placeName>

            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>

          </placeName>, when he was two, and there he grew to manhood. The author gives equal space to his

          </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
            <region reg="cau" type="state">California</region>
          </placeName>, and to his life work as teacher, editor, and executive secretary. The first period
                    depicts the deep concern of Friends to set up schools for the education of their children, while in
                    the latter period one sees through Woodward's life the entire panorama of <placeName>

          </placeName> activities in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> and abroad.</p>
        <p>The Five Year Meeting of Friends was instituted in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

          </placeName>, Indiana, in 1887 to bring together representatives of the Yearly Meetings for
                    interchange of ideas and to bind the growing and scattered groups of Quakers into a closer union and
                    thus better preserve the common perspective and observances. The <hi rend="i">American Friend</hi>
                    became the organ of the Five Year Meeting in 1912. By this time Woodward had returned to his native
                    state as professor of history at Earlham College, and it was from this post that he was called in
                    1917 to become General Secretary of the Five Year Meeting and editor of its weekly magazine with
                    headquarters in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>

          </placeName>. He continued to hold these offices until his death in 1942. As secretary he tried to
                    get the mind and spirit of the Yearly Meetings and other Friends' meetings and to present
                    and interpret them to the church as a whole through the pages of the <hi rend="i">American
                    Friend.</hi> He shared with each subscriber his wide acquaintance and friendship with Quakers around
                    the world and the thinking and contributions of the many meetings and conferences he attended. The
                    editor's life was not an easy one; wartime and depression brought many problems; Quakers
                    in <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <region reg="ksu" type="state">Kansas</region>
          </placeName> especially rebelled against Woodward's methods and policies. The author
                    quotes extensively from his writings to portray his thinking and manner of meeting crises. A
                    bibliography is included, but there is no index. The volume was prepared under the direction of the
                    Woodward Memorial Commission. Indianans in general as well as Quakers should be grateful to have
                    this biography of a noted Hoosier whose life should be better known.</p>

                    factual material about the various men who served that post as physicians during the French,
                    British, and early American period. Yet, while admiring Mrs. Anderson's persistent and
                    careful research into all available sources, one must wonder at the importance of a good bit of the
                    material she has seen fit to include in her study. Much of the biographical data is so meager and
                    insignificant that it can serve no purpose for anyone. Take, for example, the statement regarding
                    Dr. William Holmes (p. 81) : "According to the Macomb books he bought a cow for
                    $10 on August 6, 1790, and rented a house from Captain Henry Bird of the Eighth Regiment
                    from August 10, 1790, to June 10, 1792, paying sixty shillings per month." On the other
                    hand, much of the material on the practice of medicine and surgery, the various prescriptions used
                    and fees charged, as well as the biographical material on the life of Dr. George Christian Anthon,
                    is notably good. Where the sources were adequate, Mrs. Anderson has done well.</p>

        <p>It is unfortunate that an index was not included in the volume. A biographical index at least would
                    have made the book more valuable to students of genealogy in the <placeName>

        <p>The five other selections included are: (1) John A. Paxton's "Notes on <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName>," an unpaged preface to his <hi rend="i">

              <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

            </placeName> Directory of 1821</hi>, the first part of which very clearly depends on
                    Chouteau's "Narrative"; (2) Lewis C. <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-105" n="99"/> Beck's ten-page historical and descriptive account of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>

            <region reg="mou" type="state">Missouri</region>
          </placeName> published in 1822, which says little about the opening years of the city; (3) a brief
                    article, obviously based on Chouteau's "Narrative" in the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName>
          <hi rend="i">Beacon</hi> of January 24, 1831, written by "A Creole," in which he
                    corrects a statement he had seen about the founding of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName>; (4) a lecture given by Wilson Primm before the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName> Lyceum probably in December, 1831, giving a history of the town based on
                    Chouteau's depositions but rejecting his statement that he had been in charge of the
                    beginning work on the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName> settlement; and (5) Joseph N. Nicollet's excellent account written in 184,2,
                    rich in details derived from the Chouteau papers.</p>
        <p>In McDermott's scholarly "Introduction" of forty-three pages, he has
                    enumerated and given the significance of some twenty-five other historical comments on <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName> written before 1860 by historians and travelers. Also included is a chronology for the

            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName>. This introduction is invaluable for, although the "histories" could
                    be located and read elsewhere, their significance might be largely lost without the orientation
                    given here. Few authors would be as ably qualified as Professor McDermott to edit such a volume for

          <hi rend="i">The Quiet Life of Mrs. General Lane.</hi> By Victoria Case. (<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Garden City</settlement>, <region reg="nyu" type="state">New
                    York</region>
          </placeName>: Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc., 1952, pp. 319. $3.75.)</head>
        <p>Two years ago, A. B. Guthrie, writing in the <placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York</region>
          </placeName>
          <hi
            rend="i">Times</hi>, asked some significant questions concerning the function and limitations of
                    the historical novelist: "Should he deal with the actual figures of history and the actual
                    events, or shall he go outside them?… If he employs the record, <pb
            id="VAA4025-049-1-106" n="100"/> what violence, if any, may he do it? May he invent words for
                    the mouths of skeletons, may he have dead limbs acting as live limbs never did, may he amend the
                    facts, extend the annals?" In answering these questions Guthrie expressed a
                    reluctance to assume that an actual historical personality said or did something that has no support
                    in the record, for "liberties like these tend to muddy history, as the little story of
                    George <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
          </placeName> and the cherry tree has muddied history." What course, then, is open to the
                    historical novelist? If he has respect for the canons of historical scholarship, he will
                    parallel but not employ the record. His characters will be modeled on real characters, they will
                    speak a similar idiom, their adventures will have been suggested by real adventures, but real
                    persons will figure only in the background to establish time, place, and atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Judged by Guthrie's standards, <hi rend="i">The Quiet Life of Mrs. General Lane</hi> falls
                    short of perfection by no small degree, for it employs as its central figure the wife of Jo Lane,
                    Indiana politician, Mexican War hero, first Territorial Governor of <placeName>
            <region reg="oru" type="state">Oregon</region>
          </placeName>, and Vice-presidential candidate in 1860. Victoria Case has an explanation, however,
                    for handling her material as she did. She fell heir to the research of Nina Lane Faubion, a
                    descendent and would-be biographer of the General. Miss Case determined to use this material in
                    writing a novel rather than a biography presumably because Mrs. Faubion "kept in her memory
                    the family anecdotes and interpretations which are now forever lost."</p>
        <p>This reviewer feels that such a rationalization is untenable. In the first place, the reliability of
                    family anecdotes is open to question, and family "interpretations" suggest an
                    absence of the objectivity which is the shield of truth. Secondly, it may be doubted whether making
                    up the story from an "inner conviction" of the way Polly Lane must have lived and
                    felt is any guarantee of accuracy.</p>

        <p>On the positive side, it must be said that once having chosen the medium for her narrative, the
                    author carries it off as well as could be expected. She writes with vigor and imagination. Arranging
                    in novel form events in the lives of the General and his wife must have been a sizable task, for the
                    range of Jo Lane's interests was wide. If this book fails to enjoy the sales volume of
                    Irving Stone's <hi
              rend="i">Immortal <pb id="VAA4025-049-1-107"
            n="101"/> Wife</hi>, such
                    deficiency will not be due to any inherent inferiority, but to the fact that the main characters are
                    less known to the average reader. An attempt to cast light upon any of the unfamiliar but
                    influential figures in history is in itself laudable, if not salesworthy, however, for it points the
                    way to an area that could be exploited to the advantage of both the historian and the
                    non-professional student of history. Nevertheless, from the scholarly point of view, <hi rend="i">The Quiet Life of Mrs. General Lane</hi>, unlike the works of A. B. Guthrie and Conrad Richter,
                    will do little to dispel the widely held notion that the historical novel is the illegitimate spawn
                    of history and fiction.</p>

        <p>The preliminary inventories of records of the federal government preserved in the National Archives

                    into which the holdings of the Archives are divided. These inventories are intended primarily for
                    staff use, and their purpose is to facilitate the use of the records and to serve as a means of
                    establishing administrative control over them. Each will be revised and the word
                    "preliminary" will be dropped from the title when a record group is in final
                    order.</p>

                    includes the records of all foreign service posts, diplomatic and consular, received and accessioned
                    by the National Archives through December 31, 1951. Most of the records of these posts to the year
                    1953 have been received by the Archives as well as a considerable quantity of later records from
                    closed posts in politically unsettled areas. <pb

          </hi> cuts across record groups and describes by general subject categories material
                    included in at least 92 record groups. The most numerous records are those accumulated by the State
                    Department. Some of these and other pertinent records have been reproduced on microfilm which can be
                    purchased from the National Archives. Records thus available are so indicated in this publication.</p>
        <p>Clarence E. Carter's <hi rend="i">Historical Editing</hi> has been prepared primarily for
                    the use of staff members of the National Archives who are called upon to edit for publication
                    documents of historical significance in the keeping of the Archives. It is not intended as a manual
                    of inflexible rules, but rather as a general discussion for the inexperienced editor of problems
                    that arise in the editing of historical materials and the most generally approved methods of solving
                    them. Topics discussed include the search for relevant documents, canons of selection, textual
                    criticism, transcription, arrangement, annotation, collation, preparation of copy for the printer,
                    proof reading, processing of page proof, and indexing.</p>

        <p>And yet, this is not always true. Even in a virgin country where records are few a surprising number
                    of names find "lodgment in the stream of time"—in family papers, in old
                    county histories, and in county courthouse records. And when the leads furnished by tradition have
                    been sifted, checked, and rechecked, when the facts from many sources have been gathered and
                    organized, the picture begins to emerge. Notes from records in one county illuminate the others from
                    sources in another state. A puzzling bit faithfully noted down is sometimes the answer to a question
                    not yet asked. Even so simple a device as organizing known facts into a careful chronology will
                    often reveal evidence of acceptable veracity, as a lightning flash may sometimes reveal unfamiliar
                    country and show the way a traveler must go.</p>
        <p>After a time the man sought emerges and the trails he followed become clear. One can see, at last,
                    the man "in his habit as he lived"—perhaps as clearly as he was known
                    to many of his contemporaries. After all, do not contemporaries often see each other through a glass
                    darkly, even though they are face to face?</p>

        <p>Probably a large party assembled for this migration, many of them related by blood ties. Danger from
                    Indians was less at this time than at any time previous, since the treaty which ended the War of
                    1812 had been signed the year before on December 24, 1814.</p>
        <p>The party traveled first by horseback and on foot LO Maysville, <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName>. From there, the natural highway westward was the <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio River</region>
          </placeName>. Floating down its broad levels in flatboats, they would still keep a sharp outlook for
                    Indians along the banks. They would remember many stories current of Indian attacks on river
                    travelers within the years just past. Danger was present also in the river itself, however placid
                    and beautiful it looked in the morning mists: danger in sandbars, in rock ledges, in sunken logs, in
                    submerged trees which lifted their dead sharp branches at intervals with the current, or, worse
                    still, did not show themselves but were ready at any time to rip through the bottom of a boat or
                    impale it on a sharp point.</p>
        <p>After days countering these hazards, a landing was made on the Indiana side, probably near Fort

          </placeName> preparations could be made for the northward journey by land into the interior. Every

                    thought, "We are not alone. Others have gone before us. Still others will come after
                    us."</p>

        <p>After many days of travel and nights of camping along the trail, the Scott family reached a spot on a
                    branch of the East Fork of the White River, where they decided to settle, at least for a time. The
                    branch was called Salt Creek. Later this region was named Salt Creek Township in Jackson County. <placeName>

        <p>Near Salt Creek the Scotts found new friends in the family of William Tabor, who had come to this
                    region sometime between 1788 and 1793, shortly after the general migration to the Northwest
                    Territory began. He was, in fact, a "squatter," with no governmental authority for
                    settling where he did, and no intention of giving up any part of the land he occupied through his
                    own private arrangements with the Indians. Several years earlier he had come from <placeName>

        <p>Having been so long established in the new territory, the Tabor family must have been of great help
                    to Samuel Scott, Sr. and his sons and daughters. The young people were near the same ages. William
                    at twenty-four and Samuel at twenty-two would welcome the friendship of Jesse Tabor. Rebecca at
                    twenty and Elizabeth at seventeen added those delightful elements of companionship which girls can
                    always give to their brothers and their friends. Isaac and Martin Tabor were "the little
                    boys," but young Rebecca Tabor at twelve was undoubtedly beginning to feel herself to be
                    more than a child and quite ready to enjoy the friendship of the Scott sisters. The young men and
                    their fathers would soon have raised a log cabin for their shelter. They would get ready for winter
                    and plan what to do as soon as spring came on.</p>
        <p>The dark forest was all around them. It was still Indian country. The land occupied by these earliest
                    settlers bordered on the ancient hunting grounds of the Miami, who were considered to be hostile.

          </placeName> and Shawnee were generally considered friendly, but, from the white man's
                    point of view, they too were "treacherous." In 1816, Indiana was admitted to
                    statehood, but it took five years more before what is now Jackson County could be lawfully called
                    the white man's country.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
        </p>
        <p>When the log cabin for the newcomers was finished, the Scotts must have been thankful and happy with
                    their new home and their new friends. Rebecca would be doing her best with Elizabeth's
                    help to take their mother's place in keeping their father and their two brothers fed and
                    clothed. In those days, women had few if any idle hours.</p>

        <p>The long winter evenings must have been pleasant before the big fireplaces in the cabins, where the
                    supply of fuel never failed as long as there were strong men to chop down the trees and split the
                    logs. A man could feel good chopping his daily supply, or building up a reserve stock on his
                    woodpile. "Wood chopping warms you twice," they used to say. He knew he was doing

        <p>William Tabor had many stories to tell. One of them concerned his earliest days at Tabor Mound. The
                    Indians were very bad at that time and the few settlers had built a blockhouse on Tabor Mound and
                    all moved into it. Because of the tribesmen it was very dangerous for anyone to leave the
                    blockhouse. Then one of the company died. Five men were detailed to take the corpse out and bury it.
                    They succeeded in their mission, but when the party returned from the grave, the Indians fired on
                    them, killing their leader. The other four men made their escape back to the blockhouse.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

        <p>When the War of 1812 began, there were ninety-three families in Jackson County. Seventy families
                    immediately fled from the country. Twenty-three families remained to see it through. These were the

          </placeName> lying south of the old Indian boundary line had been surveyed in the autumn of 1812 and
                    thrown into the market in 1816. In this year, Samuel, Sr. entered Section 34. The land was still
                    legally the property of the Indians until October, 1818, when it was ceded to the government as part
                    of the "New Purchase."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

        <p>In numerous other ways, 1818 was an interesting year for the Scott family. Since there were only

            <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1818, every competent man was expected to accept responsibility and do his best for
                    all. On April 18 was brought forward the first petition for a county road "to extend from <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
          </placeName> to Scott's Ferry on Salt Creek and thence to the Lawrence County
                    line." John was one of the three appointed viewers. When in May the report of the viewers
                    was accepted and the road ordered built, Samuel Scott and two others were appointed road
                    supervisors. John Scott was one of the first grand jurors of <placeName>

          </placeName>, of more immediate interest to the writer, was that of Samuel Scott, Jr. to young
                    Rebecca Tabor on October 6, 1818. Rebecca was fifteen years old and Samuel twenty-five when the
                    justice of the peace, James McTagertt, performed the simple ceremony "by consent of her
                    father she being of Lawful Age." The clerk apparently wrote all names as they sounded to
                    him. Rebecca's name is spelled "Rebekah Tabour" in License 49, and
                    "Rebecah Tabor" when the bonds were solemnized the next day.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

        <p>Rebecca was the first of the Tabor children to marry. When her oldest brother Jesse was married on

                    Theresa's name was spelled "Treasey," probably her nickname. Through
                    the years this name became so misunderstood by her descendants that it came out in 1928 as

                    Justice of Peace and a similar amount to the Circuit Court.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The trouble had
                    begun on June 19, and is probably an instance of the stubborn pride of the man in holding out on
                    what he must have considered an unfair charge.</p>
        <p>On September 7, 1827, Samuel had words with one John Morrison, and the Sheriff of <placeName>
            <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
          </placeName> was ordered "to take John Morrison if he be found in your bailwick, and him
                    safely keep so that you have his body before the judges of our <placeName>
            <region type="county">Morgan County</region>

            <settlement type="city">Martinsville</settlement>

          </placeName>, on the last Monday of February next, to Samuel Scott, Jr. in action in the case for
                    slanderous words spoken to his damage, $5000. No bail required without the
                    judge's order." This case was dismissed at the cost of the defendant, who was
                    ordered "to pay $5000 within 30 days, and on failure, that he be
                        attached."<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

        <p>In his capacity as Justice of the Peace on November 15, 1827, Samuel Scott, Jr. officiated at the
                    marriage of John Scott to Elizabeth Olds. Samuel's older brother William had married
                    Elizabeth Jones on January 20, 1823. With Samuel and William's sister Elizabeth, married
                    to Summerly Cunningham, there were now three Elizabeths in the Scott clan with the two Rebeccas, two
                    Williams, two Johns, and three Davids, not to mention the two Samuel Scotts. When Samuel and
                    Rebecca's fifth son was born, early in 1829, he was named Josephus.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    David B. Scott, and their friends the Matthews brothers and others from the Matthews and Drury
                    Neighborhood. John was mentioned as "the most skillful steersman… on the big

        <p>John Scott owned and operated the first ferryboat across the White River between <placeName>

                    Landing as to be impossible for man and horse and loaded wagons." John pleaded not guilty
                    to the charge and was at once acquitted.<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Apparently the twelve good men of the

        <p>Samuel and Rebecca had lived in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Morgan County</region>
          </placeName> for ten years. The country was filling up. The new community was well established.
                    Samuel began to feel the old restlessness, the eagerness to move on farther west to new territory.
                    Occasional travelers had brought back enthusiastic accounts of the broad open prairies, the rich
                    black soil, the groves of fine timber, the God's plenty of pheasants, turkeys, geese, and
                    other kinds of game in the wonderful country beyond the <placeName>

        <p>Samuel determined to make the move, remarking that he did not like to live so close to a village. The
                    boys were excited at the thought of a long journey. William was ten years old now, John nine, Calvin
                    seven, and David five. Josephus, the baby, was only a few months old. Plans were made, Samuel sold

        <p>One can imagine the early morning preparations: the breakfast by candlelight, the excitement of the
                    children, the wagon being loaded, Rebecca stepping about briskly and cheerfully as usual, directing
                    the packing, saying never a word of what she felt in her heart. Samuel attending to the forty head
                    of cattle they had decided to take with them probably thought of the road they would travel, saw
                    that the wagon and teams were in good condition, and kept his mind on the immediate needs of the
                    journey.</p>
        <p>Today, a hundred and twenty-four years later, the great-great-grandchildren of Samuel and Rebecca can
                    cover the whole distance by automobile in a Sunday jaunt. But in 1829, it was a different story.
                    Dangers and privations lay ahead; friends left behind would be rarely heard from, seldom if ever
                    seen again; and no one could be sure how the venture would turn out. The story of this family was
                    the story of nearly every pioneer family who helped open up the near West to civilization.</p>

        <p>They made the journey overland with teams, camping and cooking along the wayside and sleeping in
                    their wagon at night. Rebecca and the younger children rode in the wagon, while Samuel and Billy
                    walked ahead driving the cattle. "The roads were poor, through swamps and over hills,
                    fording creeks and ferrying rivers. There were few bridges. Sometimes the streams were so swollen by
                    spring rains that the travellers had to wait several days for the water to go down."<hi rend="sup">34</hi> The old pioneer proverb, "Never change horses in the middle of a
                    stream," was immediate and practical advice to them. When their provisions gave out they
                    shot their meat as they needed it. The cattle ate the grass along the way.</p>

        <p>The woods were filled with wild life and infested with wolves. John was sometimes able to count as
                    many as a hundred wolves at one time. At night the children could see <list type="footnotes">

          </placeName> may be classed under three general divisions:—the healthy, or bushy; the

                    covered with bushes of hazel and furze, small sassafras shrub;, interspersed with grapevines, and in
                    the season of flowers a rich profusion of gay, herbaceous plants. Early in March the forests are in

        <p>As in Caesar's famous passage: "All things had now to be done by Caesar at one
                    time." Along with the willing and welcome help of other settlers, there was more than
                    enough work to keep everyone in the family busy from morning to night. The cattle were turned out to
                    graze on the prairie with young Billy and Jack to herd them. Dave could play with the two smaller
                    boys and see that they did not stray too far away from the wagon. A new log house must be built
                    before winter.</p>
        <p>The new cabin was to be larger than the ones they had left in Indiana. It was to be built of the same
                    kind of split logs, notched to fit in place; it was to have a clapboard roof and windows covered
                    with oiled paper, a wide fireplace, and chimney. There was also to be a loft where the boys could
                    sleep, and a ladder to reach the loft-hole.</p>

        <p>When the log house was finished and the family had settled, Samuel rode on his horse over the
                    surrounding country to look over the land. There were many ponds and much of what he saw was marshy.
                    Fish abounded in the ponds and rattlesnakes were numerous. Another settler reported that he had
                    killed seventy-five rattlesnakes on his land in one year. He mentioned a blue-flowered weed that
                    they boiled in milk and drank for snake bites.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> The marshy lands bred many
                    mosquitoes—some of them "big enough to stand flat-footed and drink out of a rain
                    barrel," as the saying went. Much of the land was covered with the coarse prairie grass
                    which grew higher than the head of a man on horseback.</p>
        <p>But the rich black loam was there—virgin land. The deep fertility of hundreds of years lay
                    ready for use as soon as the land could be broken by the plow. And over it all arched the wide blue
                    sky with high clouds and a fresh breeze blowing. Here a man could look straight out over the rim of
                    the earth in any direction. He knew who he was and where he was going.</p>

        <p>But the land would first have to be ditched and drained. That would take time and co-operation.
                    Meanwhile, the prairie was a perfect pasture for cattle. They could graze far and wide now, before
                    all the land had been taken up. Cattle <list type="footnotes">

                    experience, and he knew now how to feed them during the winter. When they had reached the desired
                    weight, he drove them through a hundred and twenty-five miles north to a little hamlet called by the

        <p>Samuel's cattle business had been a success for many years before the land could be used
                    for farming. He knew, however, that the time would come when the black land would be valuable. Much
                    of the money the cattle brought in was put into the purchase and entry of more and more land.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Samuel had made many improvements in his home place. Barns were built, more shelters for
                    stock, outhouses, a smokehouse to cure the meat when they butchered a hog or a beef. Better
                    furniture was provided for Rebecca's house, better beds, chests, chairs, and tables to
                    replace the three-legged stools and slab tables they had started with.</p>

        <p>In the winters six of the boys were going to school. In 1837, Billy was eighteen, John seventeen,
                    Calvin, fifteen, and Dave thirteen. The "little boys," Josephus and Franklin, were
                    eight and seven. Andy and Lafayette were still too young for school. The school house was a log
                    cabin with slab benches and puncheon floor. The teachers were paid on the subscription plan, each
                    family paying according to the number of youngsters they sent. They learned reading and ciphering.
                    Spelling was considered important, too, and "writing a good hand." In the summer
                    the boys herded cattle on the prairie and did their full share of work at home.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Wolf hunts furnished great sport for the youth of the region. Wolves were very destructive to young
                    pigs and chickens, and would sneak up even to the farm yards to kill them. Grown hogs were usually
                    safe enough and could run in the timber and fatten on the wild mast found there. John was one of the
                    leaders in the wolf hunts. He liked to go hunting on old "Rube"—the
                    best horse on the prairie, he said—accompanied by his favorite chum, Abraham Smith. One
                    day they killed ten wolves and shot a great many deer, besides other game including prairie
                        chickens.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    into the yard and fires built under them. One would heat water to scald the carcasses to remove the
                    bristles. The other kettle was used for rendering the lard. After being hung up over night to air
                    out, the meat would be cut up into hams and shoulders, sidemeat, heads, and feet. The feet would be

                    his aid. Later, when the meat was sufficiently salted, it would be hung from the rafters of the

        <p>One fall morning the hired man, who had gone early to the barn, came running back to the house.
                    "Uncle Sam! There's a man in the well!" Samuel and all the big boys
                    rushed out. A new well was being dug in the back yard. It had gone down about twenty feet but they
                    had not struck water yet. A wide board had been laid over the hole to keep animals from falling in,
                    in the night. When Samuel stooped over to look into the well, he was surprised to see, sitting on
                    the muddy bottom, a supposedly respectable neighbor. Beside him lay one of the hickory-smoked hams.
                    The boys crowded round to see. "Why, it's Mr. N—!" one of
                    them said. Samuel straightened up and said calmly to the hired man, "Get a ladder,
                    Alex." The ladder was brought and lowered. "Come on up, Mr.
                    N—," Samuel said. Mr. N— slowly climbed to the surface.
                    "But, Mr. N—" Samuel said quietly, "You've
                    forgotten your ham. Go down again and get it." Mr. N—cast a wild glance out
                    across the meadow and then back at the circle of grave-faced boys. Then he slowly backed down the
                    ladder again and came up even more slowly with the ham, which he laid down on the edge of the well.
                    "Pick it up, Mr. N—," Samuel said, "That's what you
                    came here for." Nobody said anything more as the miserable little man walked across the
                    yard and through the gate and down the meadow slope toward his home. That was the last anyone in
                    this region ever saw of Mr. N. They heard he had gone farther West.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

        <p>On December 15, 1837, the eight boys received a wonderful early Christmas gift—a baby
                    sister. Her lovely name, Sarena, seems fitting for a dark-eyed little girl with eight adoring big
                    brothers. When she was six years old the last brother, Isaac, was born. So Sarena had nine brothers

        <p>As time went on, Samuel turned his attention to the drainage projects on the wide acres he now owned.
                    But these laborious projects were very slowly achieved. The prairie grass was very rank. Its thickly
                    clustered roots held the water and the high growth of the grass kept out the sun.</p>

        <p>First the settlers put in three-inch tile, which proved worthless. They drove oxen to make
                    "under ditches," and later put in eighteen and twenty-inch tile, which helped
                    some, but the land was never really fit for plowing until the dredge ditches were put in. In 1849 a
                    neighbor, Shepherd B. Smith, at nineteen, operated a ditching-machine. "I've
                    been all over the country," an old settler said, "and this is the best in the
                    world… since we got it ditched."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Andrew Scott remembered breaking prairie in the late forties, when he was fifteen or sixteen years
                    old. He drove five yoke of oxen, later plowing with one yoke with a wooden, moldboard plow, and
                    harrowing with a wooden harrow.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Four of his father's oxen were named Tom, Jerry, Buck, and Berry.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
                    Perhaps two others were named Bright and Ben. Everybody's oxen bore the same names. There
                    was something about an ox that made you want to name him with a B. They said you could tell if your
                    oxen were moving or not by setting a hazel switch, or a goad, upright in the ground and then from a
                    few paces away, sighting along the horns of the leader of the first team. They were very slow but
                    they had magnificent strength.</p>

        <p>Josephus and his wife lived near Samuel and Rebecca for about ten years. Then they moved to their own
                    farm, on the main-traveled road between <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
          </placeName>, the county seat, and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
          </placeName> covered eighteen square miles and, as one writer remarked, was "trying to pull
                    itself out of the mud." After the panic of 1857, it was still described in 1860 as
                    "one of the shabbiest and most unattractive of cities."</p>
        <p>The young couple, however, were wholly absorbed in their own affairs. The big log house they now
                    lived in had been erected about 1838, and until about 1860 had been a tavern, the "Half-Way
                    House" between <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
          </placeName> and sometimes called by that name.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> The proprietor was
                    "Bobby" Nuckles, whose fame as a genial host lasted for years afterwards. The
                    house faced east and like many taverns of the period, it had a porch, a very large general room with
                    a great fireplace, and three very small bedrooms opening off to the left. One of these was made by
                    enclosing the south end of the porch. The staircase in the northwest corner of the large room rose
                    to two very large, half-story bedrooms covering the main part of the house. One of these had
                    "accommodated" lady guests; the other, gentlemen.</p>

        <p>The house could take care of a good many persons quite adequately, according to the standards of the
                    time. When they moved to this house, there were already six in Josephus' and
                    Eveline's family. Two daughters, Luellen and Henrietta, called Ellie and Ettie, had been
                    born in 1857 and 1860; William, the first son in 1862; and Josephus, Jr., called
                    "Seph" for short, on December 19, 1863. In the little bedroom at the end of the
                    porch, Samuel was born on April 19, 1866.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> Martha Rebecca,
                    "Mattie," arrived in 1868, and young Eveline rounded out the family in 1870.</p>

        <p>Isaac had married in 1866. He was the youngest member of the family and Rebecca and Samuel were left

                    had helped in outdoor work when necessary. Her sons said that she had frequently cooked for twelve

                    had arrived at the log house in the woods where Rebecca and Samuel still lived—three
                    young people riding on horseback all the way from Indiana, Jackson, James, and Nancy Tabor, the
                    three children of Rebecca's older brother Jesse. They were emigrating, they said, to <placeName>
            <region reg="iau" type="state">Iowa</region>
          </placeName>. After a week with Aunt Rebecca and Uncle Sam, they went on to Vermilion County, <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
          </placeName>, to visit their Uncle Isaac Tabor, Rebecca's younger brother, who had come

            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
          </placeName> earlier to settle near his sister. Then the three travelers went on to <placeName>
            <region reg="iau" type="state">Iowa</region>
          </placeName> to see their cousin, Calvin. James Tabor settled permanently in <placeName>
            <region reg="iau" type="state">Iowa</region>

          </placeName>, but Jack later returned to Indiana. About Nancy it has been impossible to find any
                    other information after this one vivid picture of the young girl with her brothers on their
                    light-hearted journey.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>
        </p>

        <p>In the spring of 1861 another pretty niece came to stay for a few months—young Mary Jane
                    Tabor, one of the three orphaned daughters of Rebecca's younger brother Martin. She was
                    married to Dennis Sayre, a young auctioneer, late that same spring.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>
        </p>

        <p>In every Scott house the old hospitality still prevailed At Half-Way House in winter the bedrooms
                    were always cold so the children had to undress and dress before the fire downstairs. The bedrooms
                    were lighted only by tallow candle stubs stuck by a few drops of wax on the window sills. But there
                    was always room to tuck away another child. Blankets would be brought from the press, pallets would
                    be spread on the floor and "You can roll up your clothes for a pillow." On several
                    occasions, orphaned nieces and nephews of Josephus and Eveline came to visit and remained to grow
                        up.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>
        </p>

        <p>It was one of these young nephews who phrased what might well be considered the motto of Scott men
                    generally. Called from play and sent to buy forgotten molasses, because Aunt Eveline would not eat
                    her mush without it, he fired from the door, a parting shot: "Whatever Ma craves,

                    solemnly declared: "Women are those to whom nothing but servitude is allowed," and
                    "equality of rights would abate this artifical self-abnegation." Perhaps young
                    Purl Wood would have put his own interpretation upon these ringing words.</p>

        <p>Josephus, Sr., like his father, engaged in buying, feeding, and selling cattle. He was remembered by
                    his children for his habit of crossing his left foot on his right knee and
                    "figuring" on the high rubber boots he nearly always wore. He cut new pencils into
                    two-inch stubs for his "figuring," and he always had the extras in his pocket to
                    fish out for children who were then invited to write their names, "and let me see how well
                    you can do it."<hi rend="sup">66</hi>
        </p>
        <p>The baby daughter remembered, nearly eighty years later, how her father would come back from selling
                    his cattle, with his saddlebags full of silver because he distrusted banks and did not like
                    "greenbacks." He would sit by the fire counting his money and she would watch him.
                    When he came to an occasional gold piece he would say, "Catch it, Baby!" and she
                    would catch it in her pinafore. She had a little hoard of gold pieces hidden under a loose brick
                    beside the fireplace.</p>

        <p>Rebecca and Samuel had four years of quiet contentment among their children. In 1868, William had
                    erected on his own land "a magnificent brick residence at a cost of
                    $12,000," a large sum for those days. But his wife Elizabeth (Legate) did not
                    live long to enjoy it. She died on September 28, 1869. The next year on October 20, 1870, William
                    married a second wife, Ada (Burr) Jaquith, a widow.<hi rend="sup">67</hi>
        </p>
        <p>It was on a visit to William and Ada just before Christmas that year that Samuel died. He was
                    seventy-seven years old. On November 23, he had made his will, appointing "my two sons

                    "Many another man owes his start in life to Uncle Sammie's generosity and

                    fortunate than himself."<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
