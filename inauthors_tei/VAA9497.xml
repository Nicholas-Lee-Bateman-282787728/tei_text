						<l>In a land so far that you wonder whether</l>
						<l>The God would know it should you fall dead;</l>
						<l>In a land so far through the wilds and weather,</l>
						<l>That the sun falls weary and well nigh sped--</l>
						<l>That the heaven and earth seem coming together,</l>
						<l>Seem closing together, as a book that is read:</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>In the nude weird West, where an unnamed river</l>
						<l>Rolls restless in bed of bright silver and gold;</l>
						<l>Where white flashing mountains flow rivers of silver,</l>
						<l>As a rock of the desert flow'd fountains of old;</l>
						<l>By a dark wooded river that calls to the dawn,</l>
						<l>And makes mouths at the sea with his dolorous swan: <ref id="ref_001" rend="super"
								target="note_001">1</ref></l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>In the land of the wonderful sun and weather,</l>
						<l>With green under foot and with gold over head,</l>
						<l>Where sinking suns flame, and you wonder whether</l>
						<l>They be isles of fire in their foamy bed:</l>
						<l>Where the ends of the earth they are welding together</l>
						<l>In a rough-hewn fashion, in a forge flame red:</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>Where the plants are as trees; where the trees are as towers</l>
						<l>That toy, as it seems, with the stars at night;</l>
						<l>Where the roses are forests; where the wild-wood flowers</l>
						<l>Are dense unto darkness; where, reaching for light,</l>
						<l>They spill in your bosom their fragrance in showers</l>
						<l>Like incense spill'd down in some sacrament rite:</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>'Tis the new-finish'd world; how silent with wonder</l>
						<l>Stand all things around you. No sweet song of bird.</l>
						<l>No beast that disputes. You wander on under</l>
						<l>The broad gnarly boughs. You breathe not a word.</l>
						<l>You inhale the sweet balsam where boughs break asunder,</l>
						<l>While, fragrant with newness, earth waits for her lord.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>The place is scarce finish'd. Yon footfall retreating,</l>
						<l>It might be the Maker disturb'd at His task.</l>
						<l>The footfall of God or the far pheasant beating,</l>
						<l>It is one and the same whatever the mask</l>
						<l>It may wear unto man. The woods keep repeating</l>
						<l>The old sacred sermons whatever you ask.</l>
					</lg>

						<note id="note_001"><ref target="ref_001" rend="super">1</ref> The mouth of the Oregon

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>Here brown-muzzled cattle come stealthy to drink,</l>
						<l>The wild forest cattle, witk high horns as trim</l>
						<l>As the elk at their side. Their sleek necks are slim</l>
						<l>And alert like the deer; they come, then they shrink</l>
						<l>As afraid of their fellows, or of shadow-beasts seen</l>
						<l>In the deeps of the dark wooded waters of green.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>The settlers are silent; the newly-built mill</l>
						<l>Has strong burly men, but a dull muffed sound</l>
						<l>Is all that you hear. The waters are still.</l>
						<l>The waggons drag sullen and dull on the ground;</l>
						<l>The iron-tooth'd mill in the moss-mantled trees</l>
						<l>Makes only a sound like the buzzing of bees.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>Lo! all things are awed; the wild is so vast,</l>
						<l>The hush is so loud through the dense gloaming land,</l>
						<l>No man dares assert. The brute comes at last</l>
						<l>To turn, to make sign with a black hairy hand</l>
						<l>And pass unrestrain'd, while man awed and mute</l>
						<l>Sees a type of his face in the face of the brute.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>The bull-dog, deep-mouth'd, sits sullen and still,</l>
						<l>He turns round and round, and he licks his loose jaws;</l>
						<l>He lies down in his bed while the black bear at will</l>
						<l>Steals forth from his fen; he lifts his black paws,</l>
						<l>He points to the white Mason mark on his breast,<ref id="ref_002" rend="super"
								target="note_002">1</ref></l>
						<l>While the awed hunter rests with his rifle at rest.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>By the sea, when the cyclone is wild in the wail;</l>
						<l>When the pine-tops are bent like the battle-borne spear;</l>
						<l>And the sea thunders in on the bright shining shale,</l>
						<l>And the sombre earth shakes as if shaken with fear;</l>
						<l>Then the brutes crouching near lift their eyes to men's eyes,</l>
						<l>And question such questions as know no replies.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg rend="i">
						<l>It is man in his garden, scarce waken'd as yet</l>
						<l>From the sleep that fell on him when woman was made.</l>
						<l>The new-finish'd garden is humid and wet</l>
						<l>From the hand that new-fashion'd its unpeopled shade;</l>
						<l>And the wonder still looks from the fair woman's eyes,</l>
						<l>Where she shines through the wood like the light from the skies.</l>
					</lg>

					<p>
						<note id="note_002"><ref target="ref_002" rend="super">1</ref> The black bears here have

						<lg>
							<l><hi rend="b">I</hi>N the beginning--ay, before</l>
							<l>The six-days' labours were well o'er,</l>
							<l>Yea, while the world lay incomplete,</l>
							<l>Or God had open'd quite the door</l>
							<l>Of this strange land for strong men's feet,</l>
							<l>There lay against the westmost sea,</l>
							<l>One weird-wild land of mystery.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-012" n="4"/>

						<lg>
							<l>A far, white wall, like fallen moon,</l>
							<l>Girt out the world. The forest lay</l>
							<l>So deep you scarcely saw the day,</l>
							<l>Save in the high held middle noon:</l>
							<l>It lay a land of sleep and dreams,</l>
							<l>And clouds drew through like shoreless streams</l>
							<l>That stretch to where no man may say.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Men reach'd it only from the sea,</l>
							<l>By black-built ships that seem'd to creep</l>
							<l>Along the shore suspiciously,</l>
							<l>Like unnamed monsters of the deep.</l>
							<l>It was the weirdest land, I ween,</l>
							<l>That mortal man has ever seen:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A dim, dark land of bird and beast,</l>
							<l>A land that scarce knew prayer or priest,</l>
							<l>Or law of man or Nature's law,</l>
							<l>Or aught that good men ever saw;</l>
							<l>Where no fix'd line drew sharp dispute</l>
							<l>'Twixt savage man and silent brute.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>It hath a history most fit</l>
							<l>For cunning hand to fashion on;</l>
							<l>No chronicler hath mention'd it--</l>
							<l>Book-buccaneer set foot upon.</l>
							<l>'Tis of a wild and outlaw'd Don;</l>
							<l>A cruel man, with pirate's gold</l>
							<l>That loaded down his deep ship's hold.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-013" n="5"/>

						<lg>
							<l>A deep ship's hold of plunder'd gold!</l>
							<l>The golden cruse, the golden cross,</l>
							<l>From many a church of Mexico,</l>
							<l>From Panama's mad overthrow,</l>
							<l>From many a ransom'd city's loss,</l>
							<l>From many a foeman stark and cold.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He fled with prices on his head;</l>
							<l>He found this wild, west land. He drew</l>
							<l>His ship to shore. His ruthless crew,</l>
							<l>Like Romulus, laid hold and wed</l>
							<l>The half-wild women that had fled,</l>
							<l>And in their bloody forays bore</l>
							<l>Red firebrands about the shore.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The red men rose at night. They came,</l>
							<l>A firm, unflinching wall of flame;</l>
							<l>They swept, as sweeps some fateful sea</l>
							<l>O'er land of sand and level shore,</l>
							<l>And howls in far fierce agony;</l>
							<l>The red men swept that deep, dark shore</l>
							<l>As threshers sweep a threshing-floor.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And yet beside the old Don's door</l>
							<l>They left his daughter as they fled.</l>
							<l>They spared her life, because she bore</l>
							<l>Their Chieftain's blood. His gory head</l>
							<l>On pike was borne away. His gold</l>
							<l>Was burrow'd from the stout ship's hold,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-014" n="6"/>

							<l>And borne in many a slim canoe,</l>
							<l>To where? The grey priest only knew.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Revenge at last came like a tide;</l>
							<l>'Twas sweeping, deep, and terrible;</l>
							<l>The Saxon found the land and came</l>
							<l>To take possession in Christ's name.</l>
							<l>Steel struck to flint, and fire flew</l>
							<l>For days; then all was dark as night.</l>
							<l>The Saxon's steel was strong and bright,</l>
							<l>The red man's flint was broken quite.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Now, ploughshares plough the fragments through;</l>
							<l>They throw a thousand flints to light,</l>
							<l>And that is all that's left to you.</l>
							<l>For every white man that had died</l>
							<l>I think a thousand red men fell;</l>
							<l>A gentle custom; and the land</l>
							<l>Lay lifeless, as some burn'd-out brand.</l>

							<l>That lifted from the wood alone.</l>
							<l>A wild, wide river dark and deep,</l>
							<l>A ship against the shore asleep.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>An Indian woman crept--a crone,</l>
							<l>Remote around the camp alone,</l>
							<l>The relic of her perish'd race.</l>
							<l>She wore rich, rudely-fashion'd bands</l>
							<l>Of gold above her bony hands:</l>
							<l>She hiss'd her curses on the place:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Go seek the red man's last retreat!</l>
							<l>A lonesome land, the haunted lands,</l>
							<l>Red mouths of beasts, red men's red hands.</l>
							<l>Did ever it occur to you</l>
							<l>While ranging unknown forests through,</l>
							<l>That this same rapt half prophet stands</l>
							<l>All nude and voiceless, nearer to</l>
							<l>The awful God than I or you?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A maiden by the river's brink,</l>
							<l>Stood fair to see as you can think,</l>
							<l>As tall as tulés at her feet,</l>
							<l>As sweet as flowers over-sweet.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How beautiful she was! How wild!</l>
							<l>How pure as water-plant, this child--</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-016" n="8"/>

							<l>This one wild child of Nature here</l>
							<l>Grown tall in shadows. And how near</l>
							<l>To God, where no man stood between</l>
							<l>Her eyes and scenes no man hath seen.</l>
							<l>Stop still, my friend, and do not stir,</l>
							<l>Shut close your page and think of her.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Ay, she was fair and very fair.</l>
							<l>The rippled rivers of her hair</l>
							<l>That ran in wondrous waves, somehow</l>
							<l>Flow'd down divided by her brow,</l>
							<l>And flooded all her breast of snow</l>
							<l>In its uncommon fold and flow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A red bird built beneath her roof,</l>
							<l>The squirrels cross'd her cabin sill</l>
							<l>And frisking came and went at will.</l>
							<l>A hermit spider wove his woof</l>
							<l>And up against the roof did spin</l>
							<l>A net to catch mosquitoes in.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The silly elk, the spotted fawn,</l>
							<l>And all dumb beasts that came to drink,</l>
							<l>That stealthy stole upon the brink,</l>
							<l>In that weird while that lies between</l>
							<l>The drowsy night and noisy dawn,</l>
							<l>On seeing her familiar face</l>
							<l>Would fearless stop and stand in place,</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-017" n="9"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Yet in her splendid strength, her eyes,</l>
							<l>There lay the lightning of the skies;</l>
							<l>-The love-rage of the lioness,</l>
							<l>To kill the instant, or caress:</l>
							<l>A pent-up soul that sometimes grew</l>
							<l>Impatient; why she hardly knew.</l>
							<l>She sometimes sigh'd, then rousing, threw</l>
							<l>Her strong arms out as if to hand</l>
							<l>Her great love, sun-born and complete</l>
							<l>At birth, to some fair high god's feet</l>
							<l>On some far, fair and unseen land.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And when the priest, her only friend,</l>
							<l>The hairy, hated Spanish priest,</l>
							<l>By Saxon shunn'd as some wild beast,</l>
							<l>Would tell of cities and intend</l>
							<l>Instruction, she would lean, would rise,</l>
							<l>And all the glory of her eyes</l>
							<l>Would fill the humble home, and she</l>
							<l>Would clasp her hands, and at his knee</l>
							<l>Compel long tales of stormy life,</l>
							<l>Of love, of hate, of social strife</l>
							<l>And conquest, till the proud girl grew</l>
							<l>Far wiser than the good priest knew.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Now all men hated him. They said</l>
							<l>His hands were red with human blood.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-018" n="10"/>

							<l>They said he ofttimes in the flood</l>
							<l>Plunged in, yet still his hands were red.</l>
							<l>He seem'd so utterly cast out</l>
							<l>That woodmen, meeting, did dispute</l>
							<l>And seem to hold in lusty doubt</l>
							<l>If he, so hairy-clad and mute,</l>
							<l>Was more than some misshapen brute.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Mostlike they hated him because</l>
							<l>Adora loved him; that she drew</l>
							<l>From him deep knowledge of the laws</l>
							<l>Of God and man, and therefore grew</l>
							<l>Beyond their tallest growth, and stood</l>
							<l>The one fair flower of the wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Brown woodmen came, brawn woodmen woo'd--</l>
							<l>Tall hunters from the solitude;</l>
							<l>They saw her face, then stood as tall</l>
							<l>And kingly as the sons of Saul.</l>
							<l>But ever prowl'd the grey priest near,</l>
							<l>And men felt more than mortal fear.</l>
							<l>None knew just where he dwelt, but--well,</l>
							<l>Black Mungo mutter'd, "Down in hell."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>One twilight, as the priest did stoop</l>
							<l>And humbly pass a laughing group</l>
							<l>Of mocking men, one pluck'd his beard,</l>
							<l>While others peer'd and, leaning, jeer'd.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-019" n="11"/>

						<lg>
							<l>He signall'd to the wood. There came,</l>
							<l>With measured and majestic tread,</l>
							<l>A great, black beast, with glossy mane,--</l>
							<l>A broad-foot beast, with eyes that shone</l>
							<l>Like sentry stars that stand alone</l>
							<l>On edge of storms where cyclones reign.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He made, men said, some fiendish sign</l>
							<l>To this huge brute, and pointing to</l>
							<l>The maid Adora, hasten'd through</l>
							<l>The dim path, dark with wood and vine,</l>
							<l>And ere they dared lay hand upon</l>
							<l>Or stir, the hairy man was gone.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They started, terrified. They knew</l>
							<l>No fear akin to this. They flew</l>
							<l>To arms, they call'd black Mungo, ran</l>
							<l>To stout-built cabins, and each man</l>
							<l>That erst, that oft, had laugh'd at death,</l>
							<l>Went crouching low with bated breath.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>This man commanded beasts, and they</l>
							<l>Came forth bright-eyed and did obey!</l>
							<l>What if the million beasts should come?</l>
							<l>The red-mouth'd monsters? You could hear</l>
							<l>Their sheath-knives shiver as with fear;</l>
							<l>And hairy lips were white and dumb.</l>

							<l>How beautiful she was! Why, she</l>
							<l>Was inspiration. She was born</l>
							<l>To walk God's summer-hills at morn,</l>
							<l>Nor waste her by a wood-dark sea.</l>
							<l>What wonder, then, her soul's white wings</l>
							<l>Beat at the bars, like living things?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She ofttime sigh'd, and wander'd through</l>
							<l>The sea-bound wood, then stopp'd and drew</l>
							<l>Her hand above her brow, and swept</l>
							<l>The lonesome sea, and ever kept</l>
							<l>Her face to sea, as if she knew</l>
							<l>Some day, some near or distant day,</l>
							<l>Her destiny should come that way.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How pure she was! How purely fair!</l>
							<l>How full of faith, of love and strength!</l>
							<l>Her great, proud eyes! Her great hair's length--</l>
							<l>Her long, strong, tumbled, careless hair,</l>
							<l>Half curl'd and knotted anywhere,</l>
							<l>From brow to breast, from cheek to chin,</l>
							<l>For love to trip and tangle in.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last a weary sail was seen.</l>
							<l>It came so slow, so wearily,</l>
							<l>Came creeping cautious up the sea,</l>
							<l>As if it crept from out between</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-021" n="13"/>

							<l>The half-closed sea and sky that lay</l>
							<l>Tight wedged together, far away.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She watch'd it, woo'd it. She did pray</l>
							<l>It might not pass her by, but bring</l>
							<l>Some love, some hate--some anything</l>
							<l>To break the awful loneliness</l>
							<l>That like a nightly nightmare lay</l>
							<l>Upon her proud and pent-up soul,</l>
							<l>Until it hardly brook'd control.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>To think of it! This hairy priest:</l>
							<l>Then men as rude as ruthless beast:</l>
							<l>And that was all this great soul knew</l>
							<l>Of empire she was born unto.</l>
							<l>O,it was pitiful to see!</l>
							<l>Here hung a ripe peach from the tree,</l>
							<l>And not one man among them all</l>
							<l>That stood up strong enough, or tall</l>
							<l>Enough to pluck it ere it fall.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The ship crept feebly up the sea,</l>
							<l>And came--You cannot understand</l>
							<l>How grand this girl; how sudden she</l>
							<l>Had shot to full-grown womanhood:</l>
							<l>How gracious, yet how tall and grand;</l>
							<l>How glorified, yet fresh and free,</l>
							<l>How human, yet how more than good.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-022" n="14"/>

						<lg>
							<l>The ship stole slowly, slowly on--</l>
							<l>If you in Californian dawn,</l>
							<l>And ample flower time, have seen</l>
							<l>The Southern rose, like Orient Queen</l>
							<l>In court extravagance, uphold</l>
							<l>Her gorgeous self, all suddenly</l>
							<l>A double handful of heap'd gold,</l>
							<l>Why you, perhaps, may understand</l>
							<l>How splendid and how sudden she</l>
							<l>Shot up beside that westmost sea.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The storm-worn ship scarce seem'd to creep</l>
							<l>From wave to wave. It scarce could keep--</l>
							<l>How grand my lady stood, how tall!</l>
							<l>How proud her presence as she stood</l>
							<l>Between the vast sea and west wood!</l>
							<l>How large and liberal her soul,</l>
							<l>How confident, how kind to all,</l>
							<l>How trusting! how untried the whole</l>
							<l>Great heart, grand faith, defying fall!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>This child was as Madonna to</l>
							<l>The tawny, brawny, lonely few</l>
							<l>Who touch'd her hand and knew her soul.</l>
							<l>She drew them, drew them as the pole</l>
							<l>Points all things to itself. She drew</l>
							<l>Men upward as a moon of spring,</l>
							<l>High wheeling, vast and bosom full,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-023" n="15"/>

							<l>Half clad in clouds and white as wool,</l>
							<l>Draws all the strong seas following.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And yet she was as sad, as lone</l>
							<l>As that same moon that leans above</l>
							<l>And seems to search all heaven through,</l>
							<l>For one brave love to be her own--</l>
							<l>For some strong, all-sufficient love</l>
							<l>To lean upon, to love, to woo--</l>
							<l>To walk her high, blue world, to seek</l>
							<l>Some place to rest her pallid cheek.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O! I did know a sad white dove</l>
							<l>That died for some sufficient love,</l>
							<l>Some high-born soul with wings to soar;</l>
							<l>That stood up equal in his place,</l>
							<l>That look'd her level in the face,</l>
							<l>Nor wearied her with leaning o'er,</l>
							<l>To lift him where she lonely trod</l>
							<l>In sad delight the hills of God.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How slow before the sultry wind</l>
							<l>That lazy ship from isles or Ind;</l>
							<l>How like to Dido by her sea,</l>
							<l>When reaching arms imploringly,</l>
							<l>This one fair lady leaning stood</l>
							<l>Above the sea by belt of wood!--</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-024" n="16"/>

						<lg>
							<l>The breeze sprang up; the batter'd ship</l>
							<l>Began to flap his weary wings;</l>
							<l>The tall, torn masts began to dip</l>
							<l>And walk the wave like living things.</l>
							<l>She rounded in, she struck the stream,</l>
							<l>She moved like tall ship in a dream.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A captain kept the deck. He stood</l>
							<l>A Hercules among his men;</l>
							<l>And now he watch'd the sea, and then</l>
							<l>He peer'd as if to pierce the wood,</l>
							<l>And then he laugh'd in merry mood,</l>
							<l>As mocking fate, half desperate,</l>
							<l>And cheer'd his men with ready wit</l>
							<l>Of reckless sort, as counting it</l>
							<l>A jolly jest to find at last</l>
							<l>The land, and all their perils past.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He now look'd back, as if pursued,</l>
							<l>Then swept the shore with glass, as though</l>
							<l>He fled or fear'd some mortal foe.</l>
							<l>And yet he jested all the whiles</l>
							<l>And wreath'd his lifted lips in smiles.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Slow sailing up the river's mouth,</l>
							<l>Slow tacking north and tacking south,</l>
							<l>He touch'd the steep shore where she stood,</l>
							<l>He touch'd the overhanging wood;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-025" n="17"/>

							<l>He tack'd his ship, his tall, black mast</l>
							<l>Touch'd tree-top mosses as he pass'd.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her hands were clasp'd as if in prayer;</l>
							<l>Sweet prayer set to silentness;</l>
							<l>Her great, white throat uplifted, bare</l>
							<l>And beautiful. Her eager face</l>
							<l>Illumed with love and tenderness,</l>
							<l>And all her presence was a grace</l>
							<l>Dark shadow'd in her cloud of hair.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He saw. He could not speak. No more</l>
							<l>With lifted glass he sought the sea;</l>
							<l>No more he laugh'd all carelessly;</l>
							<l>No more he watch'd the wild, new shore.</l>
							<l>Now foes might come or friends might flee,</l>
							<l>He could not speak, he would not stir,</l>
							<l>He saw but her, he fear'd but her.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The black ship rounded to the shore.</l>
							<l>She ground against the bank as one</l>
							<l>With long and weary journey done,</l>
							<l>That would not rise to journey more.</l>
							<l>Yet still the tall, proud captain stood</l>
							<l>And gazed against that wall of wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last he roused him, stepp'd to land,</l>
							<l>Like some Columbus, and laid hand</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-026" n="18"/>

							<l>On land and fruit, and rested there.</l>
							<l>And who was he? And who were they,</l>
							<l>The few he found that landing day?</l>
							<l>We do not know. They did not care.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Convenient custom. No man knew</l>
							<l>His neighbour's creed. Each man began</l>
							<l>A fair race with his fellow-man,</l>
							<l>As Christian-like as ancient Jew;</l>
							<l>As if 'twere some earth-fashion'd heaven</l>
							<l>Where all who came had been forgiven;</l>
							<l>Where each man's oak-ancestral stood</l>
							<l>Above his head, the native wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They met, this maiden and this man:</l>
							<l>He, laughing in the face of fate,</l>
							<l>Yet proud and resolute and bold.</l>
							<l>She, coy at first, and mute and cold,</l>
							<l>Held back and seem'd to hesitate--</l>
							<l>Half frighten'd at this love that ran</l>
							<l>Hard gallop, till her hot heart beat</l>
							<l>Like sounding of swift courser's feet.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Two strong streams of a land must run</l>
							<l>Together surely as the sun</l>
							<l>Succeeds the moon. Who shall gainsay</l>
							<l>The gods that reign? That wisely reign.</l>
							<l>Love is, love was, shall be again.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-027" n="19"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Like death, inevitable it is--</l>
							<l>Perchance like death, the dawn of bliss.</l>
							<l>Let us then love the perfect day,</l>
							<l>The twelve o'clock of life, and stop</l>
							<l>The two hands pointing to the top,</l>
							<l>And hold them tightly while we may.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How beautiful she was! The walks</l>
							<l>By wooded ways; the silent talks</l>
							<l>Beneath the broad and fragrant bough,</l>
							<l>The dark, deep wood, the dense, black dell,</l>
							<l>Where scarce a single gold beam fell</l>
							<l>From out the sun. They rested now</l>
							<l>On mossy trunk. They wander'd then</l>
							<l>By paths of beasts, through tall fern fen</l>
							<l>Where never fell the foot of men.</l>
							<l>And yet she was as pure and white</l>
							<l>As angel, and as fearless quite.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Of fear, of falsehood, or of shame--</l>
							<l>She did not even know the name</l>
							<l>Of doubt, of falsehood or deceit.</l>
							<l>How firmly set her honest feet</l>
							<l>By square and compass and the rule</l>
							<l>Of truth that needs nor creed nor school.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And looking in this stranger's eyes,</l>
							<l>This man that overtopp'd all men</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-028" n="20"/>

							<l>She heard him tell, in hush'd surprise</l>
							<l>And pity, of his battles, when</l>
							<l>He bled for others; how he fell</l>
							<l>A prisoner--the prison cell</l>
							<l>In Californian fortress, and</l>
							<l>His flight in perils from the land</l>
							<l>In stolen ship. Then at his feet</l>
							<l>She sat, all tenderness and tears;</l>
							<l>She bade him rest, put by his fears</l>
							<l>And rest for ever. This retreat</l>
							<l>Were surely safe and sweet with peace.</l>
							<l>Once, springing up, she raised her hand,</l>
							<l>And cried, "Behold this boundless land!</l>
							<l>Here God has built high freedom's wall,</l>
							<l>And drawn a line that tyranny</l>
							<l>Shall not invade. Here fat increase</l>
							<l>Awaits the gathering. Why strive</l>
							<l>And stir the thickly-peopled hive,</l>
							<l>While here all lone the honey tree</l>
							<l>Droops fragrant and for ever free?"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And as she spake, her great arms bare</l>
							<l>Save when the folds and flow of hair</l>
							<l>Blew down about them, and her face</l>
							<l>Upheld to heaven with a grace</l>
							<l>That shamed man's eloquence, this man</l>
							<l>Believed he loved her, and the zest</l>
							<l>Of enterprise and battle's plan</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-029" n="21"/>

							<l>He thought to put aside and rest,</l>
							<l>For ever rest, and deem it best.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How beautiful! How proud and free!</l>
							<l>How more than Greek or Tuscan she</l>
							<l>In full development. Her mouth</l>
							<l>Was majesty itself. Give me</l>
							<l>A mouth as warm as summer South--</l>
							<l>A great, Greek mouth, for through this gate</l>
							<l>Man first must pass to love's estate.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then you had loved her for her eyes,</l>
							<l>Their large and melancholy look.--Her mouth!</l>
							<l>'Twas roses gathered from the South,</l>
							<l>The warm south side of Paradise.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her mouth! 'twas inspiration. Pride</l>
							<l>And pity bless'd it side by side.</l>
							<l>'Twas large and generous, arch'd out</l>
							<l>By dimples and a tempting pout;</l>
							<l>Playful, proud; lips ne'er the same,</l>
							<l>Yet ever warm as wedded flame.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She scarcely spoke. All seem'd a dream</l>
							<l>She would not waken from. She lay</l>
							<l>All night but waiting for the day</l>
							<l>When she might see his face and deem</l>
							<l>This man, with all his perils pass'd,</l>
							<l>Had found his Lotus-land at last.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-030" n="22"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Then longer walks, then deeper woods,</l>
							<l>Then tender words, sufficient sweet,</l>
							<l>In denser, greener solitudes--</l>
							<l>Sweet, careless ways for careless feet,</l>
							<l>Sweet talks of Paradise for two,</l>
							<l>And only two, to watch or woo.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Betime upon the ancient moss</l>
							<l>With mighty boughs high clang'd across,</l>
							<l>The man with sweet words, over-sweet,</l>
							<l>Fell pleading plaintive at her feet.</l>
							<l>She sat upon a mossy throne,</l>
							<l>An ancient pine, long ages prone,</l>
							<l>And overgrown with brown green moss,</l>
							<l>And many a frail vine twined across.</l>
							<l>The wood was dark as cavern'd seas,</l>
							<l>Save where one gold-beam through the trees,</l>
							<l>Shot down about her throne and shed</l>
							<l>A still, soft halo round her head.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He spoke of love, of boundless love,</l>
							<l>Of love that knew no other land,</l>
							<l>Or face, or place, or anything;</l>
							<l>Of love that, like the wearied dove,</l>
							<l>Could light nowhere, but kept the wing</l>
							<l>Till she alone put forth her hand,</l>
							<l>And so received it in her ark,</l>
							<l>From outer seas and storm and dark.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-031" n="23"/>

						<lg>
							<l>He clasp'd her hands, fell to his knees,</l>
							<l>Forgot her hands, climb'd to her hair:</l>
							<l>The while her two hands clasp'd in prayer,</l>
							<l>And fair face lifted to the trees.</l>
							<l>Her proud breast heaved, her pure, white breast</l>
							<l>Rose like some sea in its unrest.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her mouth was lifted, as if she</l>
							<l>Disdain'd the cup of passion he</l>
							<l>Hard press'd her pouting lips to touch.</l>
							<l>She sprang up proudly, tall and free;</l>
							<l>She stood as some storm-stricken tree;</l>
							<l>She stood a tower, tall as when</l>
							<l>Old Roman mothers suckled men</l>
							<l>Of old-time truth and taught them such.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last she slow bent down her face,</l>
							<l>She lean'd, then push'd him back apace,</l>
							<l>Then caught his eye. Calm, silently</l>
							<l>Her eyes look'd down into his eyes,</l>
							<l>As one looks down some mossy well</l>
							<l>In hope by some sweet chance to tell</l>
							<l>By image there what fortune lies</l>
							<l>Before him, and what face shall be</l>
							<l>The pole-star of his destiny.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And you do love me, Delos?" She</l>
							<l>Was trembling as the courser when</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-032" n="24"/>

							<l>His thin flank quivers, and his feet</l>
							<l>Touch velvet on the turf, and he</l>
							<l>Is all afoam, alert, and fleet</l>
							<l>As sunlight glancing on the sea</l>
							<l>And full of triumph before men.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And you do love me, Delos?" He,</l>
							<l>From all his baser self withdrawn,</l>
							<l>Uprose like some great, gather'd sea,</l>
							<l>Some strong, third wave that thunders on</l>
							<l>In hollow hoarseness, daring all</l>
							<l>Resistance that might rise or fall:</l>
							<l>Then said, "I swear, yea, I do swear</l>
							<l>By all the peace and love that lies</l>
							<l>Through upper paths of Paradise,</l>
							<l>I love. I seem to rise or fall</l>
							<l>With you. My stormy past is gone,</l>
							<l>A tale that's told. I shall grow old</l>
							<l>And die with you. Your blown black hair</l>
							<l>Shall be my banner in the fight</l>
							<l>By day, and mantle me by night."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Nay, swear not, Delos! you do love"--</l>
							<l>Her arms were wide with welcome. She</l>
							<l>Stood tall and worthy conquest now,</l>
							<l>And sweet love sat her lifted brow</l>
							<l>A diadem. The storm-blown dove</l>
							<l>Took refuge from the deluged sea</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-033" n="25"/>

							<l>And her two hands went out for it</l>
							<l>In eager welcome, warm and fit.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her proud throat swell'd, her lips were dumb,</l>
							<l>But all her presence bade him come.</l>
							<l>Her eyes look'd level in his eyes.</l>
							<l>They flow'd with love. Her half-pent sighs</l>
							<l>Were drown'd by his strong, flowing sea</l>
							<l>Of passion, surging ceaselessly.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Pure child of nature, as she was,</l>
							<l>And lawless lover; loving him</l>
							<l>With love that made all pathways dim</l>
							<l>And difficult where he was not,</l>
							<l>And knowing only nature's laws</l>
							<l>That laid hard tribute on desire</l>
							<l>And tried her as a seven-fold fire--</l>
							<l>Then marvel not at form forgot.</l>
							<l>She sigh'd, she bended down her brow,</l>
							<l>She battled not with nature now.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Why should she? Doth the priest know aught</l>
							<l>Of sign or holy unction brought</l>
							<l>From over sea that ever can</l>
							<l>Make man love maid or maid love man</l>
							<l>One whit the more, one bit the less,</l>
							<l>For all his mummeries to bless?</l>
							<l>Yea, all his blessing or his ban?</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-034" n="26"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"I love you, Delos." And her arms</l>
							<l>Wound round his neck, and all her charms</l>
							<l>Lay like ripe fruit for gathering.</l>
							<l>He drown'd his hot face in her hair,</l>
							<l>He felt her bosom swell. The air</l>
							<l>Swoon'd sweet with essence of her form.</l>
							<l>Her breast was warm, her breath was warm,</l>
							<l>And warm her warm, submissive mouth</l>
							<l>As summer journey through the South.</l>
							<l>Her form bent down, a laden bough</l>
							<l>Of ripest, richest kisses now.</l>
							<l>And yet do what he dared or might</l>
							<l>She kept her white soul snowy white.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A bright brown nut dropp'd like a star</l>
							<l>From woody heaven overhead;</l>
							<l>A wild beast trumpeting afar</l>
							<l>Aroused her ere the light had fled.</l>
							<l>A stray, dead leaf was in her hair--</l>
							<l>Her long, strong, tumbled storm of hair;</l>
							<l>Her eyes seem'd floating anywhere.</l>
							<l>Her proud development, half bare,</l>
							<l>And beautiful as chisell'd stone</l>
							<l>Of famed far Napoli, lean'd there</l>
							<l>Like some fair Thracian overthrown.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She was not shamed. Her love was high</l>
							<l>And pure and fair as heaven's blue.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-035" n="27"/>

							<l>Her love was passionate, yet true</l>
							<l>As upward flame. A stifled sigh</l>
							<l>And then a flood of tears, and lo!</l>
							<l>A sigh that shook her being so</l>
							<l>It startled Delos where he stood,</l>
							<l>Like some bow'd monarch of the wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her proud face now fell white as wool,</l>
							<l>Her lips fell pale and pitiful.</l>
							<l>Her great, proud mouth, a splendid flower</l>
							<l>Droop'd pale and passionless. Her arms</l>
							<l>Reach'd out in suppliance. Her charms</l>
							<l>Like gather'd lilies lay. Until this hour</l>
							<l>She had been all herself. But now</l>
							<l>She trusted not herself. Somehow</l>
							<l>The sighs would come, and come, and come,</l>
							<l>Though eyes bent down, though lips kept dumb,</l>
							<l>As seas that beat upon the shore.</l>
							<l>Her soul was beaten as a shore</l>
							<l>Is beaten by a storm just o'er</l>
							<l>That will but beat and beat the more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She did essay to go. Again</l>
							<l>She droop'd, a goddess slain.</l>
							<l>She lay half lounging in a strange surprise,</l>
							<l>Scarce knowing what she wholly knew.</l>
							<l>She could not lift her face, her eyes--</l>
							<l>Her eyes were on the ground. They grew</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-036" n="28"/>

							<l>Familiar with the meek-eyed plant,</l>
							<l>Familiar with the little ant,</l>
							<l>And other insects as they ran</l>
							<l>And built their lowly world; all wise,</l>
							<l>In perfect carelessness of man.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He stood before her, sigh'd, "Alas!" </l>
							<l>Look'd down as if to catch her eyes,</l>
							<l>Recall her soul and bid her rise--</l>
							<l>Her soul that kept its snowy white,</l>
							<l>Dare what he dared, do what he might.</l>
							<l>He spoke. She could not answer him.</l>
							<l>Her small hand clutch'd a tuft of grass</l>
							<l>As if she fear'd the world might pass</l>
							<l>From out her hand, she was so weak.</l>
							<l>Then lifting, doubtfully and dim,</l>
							<l>Her brimming eyes--she could not speak</l>
							<l>For tears that flooded down her cheek.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>O it was pitiful! He fell</l>
							<l>Upon his knees. He took her hand,</l>
							<l>But not with ardour now, and well</l>
							<l>She mark'd the difference... The land</l>
							<l>Seem'd reeling still. Yet with a will</l>
							<l>She rose and stood up tall and grand.</l>
							<l>No words she spake. With drooping eyes</l>
							<l>She pass'd along the path. The pride</l>
							<l>Of yesterday was overthrown.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-037" n="29"/>

						<lg>
							<l>She would have crept along alone,</l>
							<l>But he came, clinging at her side,</l>
							<l>Half looking back... In mad surprise</l>
							<l>He saw that priest with black-beast eyes</l>
							<l>Still hovering near, with waving hand,</l>
							<l>As if to wave him from the land--</l>
							<l>As waving him from Paradise.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Her great love grew, a grandest flame;</l>
							<l>The moons roll'd by... At last he came</l>
							<l>To shorten this long, wayward walk,</l>
							<l>To careless turn and careless talk</l>
							<l>Of far-off land, of friendships rare,</l>
							<l>Of high-born men, of maidens fair,</l>
							<l>Of brave old obligations bound</l>
							<l>By circumstance to lead him round</l>
							<l>The world from her dear presence there.</l>
							<l>She heard, she spake not all the while,</l>
							<l>Not answer'd save with half-feign'd smile.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>One morn the sound of hammer fell</l>
							<l>From out the ship. And then a mast</l>
							<l>New-hewn uprose and pointed past</l>
							<l>The solid land to mobile seas.</l>
							<l>Then days and days that coffin knell</l>
							<l>Kept sounding through the silent trees</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-038" n="30"/>

							<l>And he did hint of ship and sail</l>
							<l>And lightly laugh of storm and gale.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She question'd why he would depart.</l>
							<l>He careless spoke with careless heart</l>
							<l>Of poverty, of pride, of shame,</l>
							<l>That he, high-born, with honour'd name,</l>
							<l>Should walk upon the world's wide rim</l>
							<l>And die with none to honour him.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He said he had one friend, but one,</l>
							<l>Who roam'd the world in want, alone,</l>
							<l>A fellow-prisoner, who fled</l>
							<l>With him, with prices on his head:</l>
							<l>That they together long had lain,</l>
							<l>Bound hand to hand in felons' chain</l>
							<l>For Southern cause: that to this end,</l>
							<l>To find his friend forlorn and lone,</l>
							<l>And beggar'd, ay, perchance half dead</l>
							<l>That moment, for a crust of bread,</l>
							<l>He now must rise and roam again,</l>
							<l>And range the world for that one friend.</l>
							<l>She sprang erect, let loose her hold</l>
							<l>Of his hard hand. O, ne'er till then</l>
							<l>Had she cared aught for shining gold</l>
							<l>Or lands, or power to purchase men.</l>
							<l>She sought the priest, fell at his feet,</l>
							<l>Implored, and patient did entreat</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-039" n="31"/>

							<l>If he knew aught where that great hoard</l>
							<l>Of dead father's gold was stored,</l>
							<l>To tell her true, that she might give</l>
							<l>It all, that this man's friend might live.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He shook her off. He turn'd away,</l>
							<l>He tore his long beard, blown and grey,</l>
							<l>Then glared at her. "There's blood! there's blood</l>
							<l>Upon that gold that all yon flood</l>
							<l>Might not for ages wash away!</l>
							<l>But, child, look here! For many a day,</l>
							<l>For many a month, ay, many a year,</l>
							<l>These dim eyes watch'd your growth, and now</l>
							<l>Whose hand shall gather from the bough?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"That ship, my lady, shall not pass</l>
							<l>To seaward while I live. Alas!</l>
							<l>He take your heart, your love, and he</l>
							<l>Would leave the hollow husk to me.</l>
							<l>And now, so less than buccaneer,</l>
							<l>Would beg the gold that's buried here.</l>
							<l>Your father won it with his sword.</l>
							<l>Ay, he would beg this gold, this hoard,</l>
							<l>From you, poor girl, then take the sea.</l>
							<l>He shall not go! He shall not go,</l>

							<l>One morn a new-sewn strip of sail</l>
							<l>Had blossom'd on the new-hewn mast.</l>
							<l>A chain that long had grappled fast</l>
							<l>The solid earth had loosen'd now,</l>
							<l>And dangled at her lifted prow;</l>
							<l>A screeching anchor cried in wail.</l>
							<l>My lady did not start or stir;</l>
							<l>That sturdy stroke of carpenter</l>
							<l>Struck as on coffin lid to her.</l>
							<l>And yet she never spoke one word,</l>
							<l>For all she saw, for all she heard;</l>
							<l>For all she felt, she would not lay</l>
							<l>One feather in his ruthless way.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He came to think her tame and cold,</l>
							<l>He question'd of the buried gold;</l>
							<l>Hard question'd of the hag with bands</l>
							<l>Of gold about her bony hands.</l>
							<l>He lightly laugh'd of finding prize,</l>
							<l>Of pirate's gold to glad his eyes.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She never spoke one word at all;</l>
							<l>Her breast would heave, her eyes would fall</l>
							<l>Upon the ground; her nervous foot</l>
							<l>In gold-bright, beaded moccasin</l>
							<l>Would tap the ground, or out and in</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-041" n="33"/>


							<l>Half nervously would dart and shoot,</l>
							<l>And shoot and dart, but that was all.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>His air grew careless quite and cold;</l>
							<l>Again he came to talk of gold;</l>
							<l>And, too, to hint of ship and sail,</l>
							<l>And sad regrets that Fates prevail.</l>
							<l>She heard it all! She heard it all!</l>
							<l>Ay, every hateful word did fall</l>
							<l>Like lead dropp'd in her sinking heart.</l>
							<l>She had not spoken yet. Nay, she</l>
							<l>Had only look'd her soul. Her part</l>
							<l>Had not been words, but deeds. Her all</l>
							<l>She gave so generous, so free,</l>
							<l>So lordly gave, so grand, that he</l>
							<l>Had grown love-surfeited. He thought</l>
							<l>The maiden passionless, with naught</l>
							<l>That lifts above life's common lot.</l>

						<head rend="center">VI.</head>

						<lg>
							<l>One still, soft summer afternoon</l>
							<l>In middle deep of wood, the two,</l>
							<l>Where tangled vines twined through and through,</l>
							<l>Together sat upon the tomb</l>
							<l>Of perish'd pine that once had stood</l>
							<l>The tall-plumed monarch of the wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-042" n="34"/>

						<lg>
							<l>The far-off pheasant thrumm'd a tune--</l>
							<l>The faint far billows beat a rune</l>
							<l>Like heart regrets. The sombre gloom</l>
							<l>Was ominous. Around her head</l>
							<l>There shone a halo. Men have said</l>
							<l>'Twas from the dash of Titian hue</l>
							<l>That flooded all her storm of hair</l>
							<l>In gold and glory. But they knew,</l>
							<l>Yea, all men know there ever grew</l>
							<l>A halo round about her head</l>
							<l>Like sunlight scarcely vanished.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her mouth had taken back its hue</l>
							<l>Of rosy red. Her lips had more</l>
							<l>Intense and proud expression now;</l>
							<l>And now they curved as if they knew</l>
							<l>To send the deadly arrow through</l>
							<l>And pierce the centre. Now her heart</l>
							<l>Had grown to know, to act a part.</l>
							<l>One small foot tapp'd the fallen leaves,</l>
							<l>The other, lightly to and fro</l>
							<l>Went shooting, as the shuttle weaves</l>
							<l>Through woof and warp. Her eyes bent down,</l>
							<l>Her dark brow gather'd in a frown.</l>
							<l>She mused as if she would explore</l>
							<l>Life's mysteries that lay before.</l>
							<l>Her thoughts were far away. She thought</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-043" n="35"/>

							<l>Of peopled cities, shoreless seas</l>
							<l>White sown and blown with blossom'd sail.</l>
							<l>She thought of Delos roving these</l>
							<l>In glory and alone. She caught</l>
							<l>Her breath convulsively. The while</l>
							<l>She wore a calm and careless smile--</l>
							<l>The calm that ushers in the gale.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A calm more awful is than storm.</l>
							<l>Beware of calms in any form.</l>
							<l>This life means action. Ancient earth</l>
							<l>Rests not. The agonies of birth,</l>
							<l>The brave endeavour to express</l>
							<l>Herself in beauty evermore,</l>
							<l>Evermore to bloom and bless</l>
							<l>Her weary children with her store</l>
							<l>Of luscious fruits and golden grain--</l>
							<l>The wooing winds, the driving rain</l>
							<l>Are well. But dead calm in the land,</l>
							<l>Means reeling earthquakes where you stand.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How still she was! She only knew</l>
							<l>His love. She saw no life beyond.</l>
							<l>She loved with love that only lives</l>
							<l>Outside itself and selfishness:</l>
							<l>A love that glows in its excess:</l>
							<l>A love that melts red gold, and gives</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-044" n="36"/>

							<l>Thenceforth to all who come to woo</l>
							<l>No coins but this face stamp'd thereon--</l>
							<l>Ay, that one image stamp'd upon</l>
							<l>Its face, with some dim date long gone.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She tapp'd her foot, half forced a smile,</l>
							<l>And did recall his splendid tale</l>
							<l>Of promises, that all time through</l>
							<l>They two should range the world. She knew,</l>
							<l>Her woman's instinct taught her well,</l>
							<l>He now had other tales to tell.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He, too, was far away. Yet now</l>
							<l>His eyes fell on her troubled brow</l>
							<l>And all her beauty. Well he knew</l>
							<l>That he might range God's garden through,</l>
							<l>And then not find one single flower</l>
							<l>Like this that bless'd him in that hour.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And yet he wearied. She seem'd dumb</l>
							<l>And passionless. Life lay all glow</l>
							<l>For him; for him the scroll of fame,</l>
							<l>For him a proud, high hall, a name</l>
							<l>That men should bend their heads to hear.</l>
							<l>Yea, he would sail the seas, would come</l>
							<l>Some later day, by ship draw near</l>
							<l>And touch the land, take kiss, and so</l>
							<l>Sail on to land of sun or snow.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-045" n="37"/>

						<lg>
							<l>He restless rose to leave the wood.</l>
							<l>She knew his thought. She rose and stood</l>
							<l>Before him, tall and queenly tall.</l>
							<l>Her hair in black abundant fall,</l>
							<l>And fringe of faint, dim flame fell down</l>
							<l>About her loose, ungather'd gown.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And would you leave me, Delos? You,</l>
							<l>Who swore by heaven to be true</l>
							<l>To her who fed you, famishing,</l>
							<l>And all your loud, unruly crew?</l>
							<l>Nay, that were little. Bread is due</l>
							<l>To all who hunger. But the thing</l>
							<l>That rends me, Delos, is that you</l>
							<l>Should add to falsehood coward flight,</l>
							<l>Like knave that hides him in the night.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And you would leave me in disgrace?"</l>
							<l>She scarce did whisper, and her face</l>
							<l>Was as a woman's that had died.</l>
							<l>"These men, my savage, simple friends,</l>
							<l>Frown dark and anger'd where I come.</l>
							<l>I stand abash'd, my priest is dumb</l>
							<l>With shame and anger. To these ends</l>
							<l>Did I surrender love and pride."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her low voice trembled. Like a tree,</l>
							<l>The tall and topmost tree, that feels</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-046" n="38"/>

							<l>The coming storm, and rocks and reels</l>
							<l>Ere yet the storm strikes strong and free</l>
							<l>The underwood, her form did shake</l>
							<l>With passion man should not mistake.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"You speak of your proud birth, your line</l>
							<l>Of ancient lords, your storied name;</l>
							<l>You fear that I might bring to shame</l>
							<l>This name before the priest and shrine.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Why spake you not of this before?</l>
							<l>You speak of poverty, of mine!</l>
							<l>My poverty? Ah! it is true</l>
							<l>That I am poor. Yet not so poor</l>
							<l>But you came begging to my door;</l>
							<l>A strange, half-naked, hunted thing,</l>
							<l>And when you gather'd strength once more,</l>
							<l>Why, you turn'd robber, thief, and you</l>
							<l>Did find it pleasant plundering!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He started, stung to anger. He</l>
							<l>Knew not the dark enormity</l>
							<l>Of his long purposed deed till now.</l>
							<l>He raised his broad hand to his brow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>His was the common code of men</l>
							<l>To pillage, plunder hearts, and then,</l>
							<l>Thief-like, depart before the dawn,</l>
							<l>And leave behind a haunted hall</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-047" n="39"/>

							<l>With broken statues on the floor--</l>
							<l>With household idols scatter'd o'er,</l>
							<l>And only shadows on the wall,</l>
							<l>That never, never are withdrawn.</l>
							<l>He stood abash'd, held down his head,</l>
							<l>Half turn'd, as if he would have fled.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I know not who you are. I see</l>
							<l>Now at the last you know not me.</l>
							<l>Do you suppose--come, lift your face,</l>
							<l>Act not the coward in this place:</l>
							<l>Nay, if a villain you must be,</l>
							<l>Why, be a brave one, and the curse</l>
							<l>Is half o'ercome--do you suppose</l>
							<l>That ship shall ever cross the sea?</l>
							<l>Or ever touch on other shore?</l>
							<l>No chief shall keep that deck. Nay, more</l>
							<l>Than this, my man. Your many foes</l>
							<l>That were your friends but yesterday,</l>
							<l>Have sworn that ship shall rot away</l>
							<l>Beneath these same bent, burning skies</l>
							<l>Against the black beach where she lies."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He bow'd, he held his head quite low,</l>
							<l>And thought a time deep down, as one</l>
							<l>In game of chess that is outdone.</l>
							<l>Then lifting up, he sudden said,</l>
							<l>His hot cheek mounting high with red:</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-048" n="42"/>

							<l>A woman's name and woman's fame</l>
							<l>Was chorus to the soldier's song.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She started back. She dash'd his hand</l>
							<l>Aside, as if a serpent's head</l>
							<l>Had thrust at her to strike her dead,</l>
							<l>And stood as high built statues stand.</l>
							<l>Her hair shook back, her splendid hair</l>
							<l>Roll'd back from her high lifted face;</l>
							<l>Her round, right arm rose in the air,</l>

							<l>"Nay! nay! Start not, lest you do die;</l>

							<l>And when you talk'd of honour! when</l>
							<l>You said 'twas all for others! said</l>
							<l>You freely staked for Southern land,</l>
							<l>Your life, your fortune, freedom, and</l>

							<l>To die for others! That were grand</l>
							<l>Beyond all else. Ay, even now</l>
							<l>I feel the same proud pulse as then--</l>

							<l>Poor fool, I know right well that he</l>

							<l>"My youth! My youth! 'Tis far away.</l>

							<l>Why, Delos, I this hour have grown</l>

							<l>This hour I have cross'd the zone</l>

							<l>Ay, we did talk of journeys. Much</l>
							<l>You talk'd in pretty lies, of lands</l>
							<l>Where summer sits eternally</l>
							<l>By green-girt shore, on golden sands,</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"To think of far-off lands! Of towns</l>
							<l>That stretch away like wooded downs.</l>
							<l>O, how I panted when my priest</l>
							<l>Described great cities populous</l>
							<l>And proud with consequence! The least</l>
							<l>Were great to me. I could not guess</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her voice fell low. Her great, proud lips</l>
							<l>Curl'd cold and passionless. She stood</l>
							<l>All pallid to her finger-tips</l>
							<l>And trembled like an aspen wood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He now fell down upon his knees.</l>
							<l>He loved her now. His cruel heart</l>
							<l>Had been pierced deeper than she knew.</l>
							<l>He lifted up his face. He threw</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-054" n="48"/>

							<l>His two hands wildly to the trees.</l>
							<l>He pray'd and plead she would depart</l>
							<l>At once, go forth upon the seas</l>
							<l>And sail with him for aye, and be</l>
							<l>His white dove of the deluged sea.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Adora, come. I swear to you,</l>
							<l>I love you, love you, fervid, true;</l>
							<l>I love you as the ardent sun</l>

							<l>With this dark curse upon my head,</l>
							<l>And fall before you as one dead."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She stood as obdurate as Fate.</l>
							<l>She did disdain to turn her head,</l>
							<l>Lest she might heed the love he said,</l>
							<l>And let her love outrun her hate.</l>
							<l>Her face rose like a rising morn.</l>
							<l>That proud curl'd lip of hers was scorn</l>
							<l>Enough to shame a court of kings. ...</l>
							<l>As some poor child at night outworn,</l>
							<l>Puts wearied by its worn playthings,</l>
							<l>So she, with an impatient sigh,</l>
							<l>Still scorning, reach'd and put him by.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then as he pass'd, she turn'd and said,</l>
							<l>Half hiss'd, with reaching, shaking head,</l>
							<l>"I hate you with a searching hate</l>
							<l>That shall pursue you to the gate</l>

							<l>His sex and form is that of man."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last she turn'd, all tears. But he</l>
							<l>Had gone, had sought his ship, his men.</l>
							<l>Then as she hasten'd through the wood</l>
							<l>It seem'd that every rock and tree,</l>
							<l>Or clump of undergrowth, had been</l>
							<l>The shelter for some shaggy beast</l>
							<l>That through the twilight roam'd or stood.</l>
							<l>The hairy beast or hairy priest,</l>
							<l>Or many hairy beasts, she knew</l>
							<l>Not truly whence or what they were,</l>
							<l>Or why they filled the forest there,</l>
							<l>Thick clad in shaggy coats of hair.</l>

							<l>He near'd his ship; the night came on;</l>
							<l>The night to sudden sail. And he</l>
							<l>Had set his men at post. The sea</l>
							<l>Lay calm and luminous as dawn--</l>
							<l>There lay at sea the strangest light</l>
							<l>That ever fell on mortal sight.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-056" n="50"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"You shall not set your ship to sea,"</l>
							<l>The old priest call'd forth angrily.</l>
							<l>The men came down, they caught the priest,</l>
							<l>He turn'd, to call again that beast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Witchcraft! witchcraft!" they cried, and bound</l>
							<l>The black priest--bound him foot and hand,</l>
							<l>And cast him in the deep. They said,</l>
							<l>"If innocent, why, he will drown."</l>
							<l>These Pirates were as bad, almost,</l>
							<l>As Pilgrims of that Eastern coast.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The sailors watch'd the wave. They stood</l>
							<l>Expecting he would rise again.</l>
							<l>Three bubbles and a little stain</l>
							<l>Along the black, forbidding flood,</l>
							<l>A crimson cenotaph in blood--</l>
							<l>Three bubbles as from falling rain,</l>
							<l>And all was dark and still again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then sounds were heard along the flood!</l>
							<l>Strange sounds, that seem'd to chill the blood.</l>
							<l>Men started. From the dense, dark wood</l>
							<l>A thousand beasts came peering out,</l>
							<l>And now was thrust a long, black snout,</l>
							<l>And now a tusky mouth. It was</l>
							<l>A sight that made the stoutest pause.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And now a red mouth in the air,</l>
							<l>Wide open, made most hideous moan,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-057" n="51"/>

							<l>And now a howl and now a groan,</l>
							<l>And now a wild wail of despair.</l>
							<l>Then as men look'd, behold, the beasts,</l>
							<l>They thought, had faces like that priest's.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"The land is cursed!" tall Delos cried;</l>
							<l>"Cut loose my ship! I take the sea;</l>
							<l>The roomy, lawless seas for me!</l>
							<l>Cast loose my ship! Quick! take the tide!"</l>
							<l>He turn'd his face to sea. It lay</l>
							<l>As light as ever middle day.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then tall trees blossom'd into stars,</l>
							<l>Then moonbeams fell in ghostly bars</l>
							<l>Between the mighty, mossy trees--</l>
							<l>Grand, kingly comrades of the wood,</l>
							<l>That shoulder unto shoulder stood</l>
							<l>With friendships knit through centuries.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The night came, moving in dim flame,</l>
							<l>As lighted by round autumn sun</l>
							<l>Descending through the hazy blue.</l>
							<l>It grew a gold and amber hue,</l>
							<l>And all hues blended into one.</l>
							<l>The moon spill'd fire where she came,</l>
							<l>And fill'd the yellow wood with flame.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The moon slid down, and leaning low,</l>
							<l>The far sea isles lay all aglow.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-058" n="52"/>

							<l>She fell along the amber flood</l>
							<l>An isle of flame in seas of blood.</l>
							<l>It was the strangest moon, ah me</l>
							<l>That ever settled on that sea.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Adora stood within her door:</l>
							<l>She heard the anchor clank its chain</l>
							<l>As one that moan'd in very pain.</l>
							<l>The crone crouch'd, crooning as before,</l>
							<l>She scream'd, and then was seen no more.</l>
							<l>It was the weirdest eve, I ween,</l>
							<l>That man or maid has ever seen.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Black Mungo smoked his pipe and kept</l>
							<l>His deck with pike and gun at hand.</l>
							<l>A mastiff waiting his command</l>
							<l>Coil'd up and watching, waked and slept.</l>
							<l>The very dog drew in his breath,</l>
							<l>As if he snuff'd the scent of death.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Black Mungo turn'd--a grizzly beast,</l>
							<l>With glaring eyes so like the priest,</l>
							<l>Rush'd out along the westmost wood,</l>
							<l>And snuff'd his hot breath from the flood.</l>
							<l>The water was as still as death,</l>
							<l>The very heaven held its breath.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The woodmen sat subdued and grave</l>
							<l>Beside the wide and soundless wave.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-059" n="53"/>

							<l>And then a half-blind bitch that sat</l>
							<l>All slobber-mouth'd and monkish cowl'd,</l>
							<l>With great, broad, floppy leathern ears,</l>
							<l>Amid the men, sprang up and howl'd,</l>
							<l>And doleful howl'd her plaintive fears,</l>
							<l>And all look'd mute amaze thereat--</l>
							<l>It was the dreadest eve, I think,</l>
							<l>That ever hung on Hades' brink.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then broad-wing'd bats possess'd the air,</l>

							<l>Caught in the closing gates of day,</l>
							<l>'Twixt sky and sea and far away--</l>

							<l>As if from out an under-world.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Slim snakes slid quick from out the grass,</l>
							<l>From wood, from fen, from everywhere:</l>
							<l>They slid a thousand snakes, and then,</l>
							<l>You could not step, you would not pass,</l>
							<l>And you would hesitate to stir</l>
							<l>Lest in some sudden, hurried tread,</l>
							<l>Your foot struck some unbruised head.</l>
							<l>It was so grim, it seem'd withal</l>
							<l>The very grass began to crawl.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>They slid in streams into the stream,</l>

							<l>As if in mockery of man.</l>
							<l>It seem'd like some infernal dream:</l>
							<l>It seem'd as they would fill the flood.</l>
							<l>They curved, and graceful curved across,</l>
							<l>Like deep and waving sea-green moss--</l>
							<l>There is no art of man can make</l>
							<l>A ripple like a running snake.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The wild beasts burst from out the wood;</l>

						<lg>
							<l>He started, sprang, as if to land</l>
							<l>From ship to flame. A black, hard hand</l>
							<l>Thrust out, and with a giant's strength</l>
							<l>It threw him back on deck full length.</l>
							<l>"And would you leave us here to die?"</l>

							<l>And cat-like crouch'd close at her side.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Betray'd! betray'd! and only you!</l>
							<l>My tawny, wretched creature, true."</l>
							<l>The wrinkled hag with grinning face</l>
							<l>Then drew her slim bark from its place,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-065" n="59"/>

							<l>And bade her enter in and fly</l>
							<l>With her beyond the flames, or die.</l>
							<l>She crept into the bark. She knew</l>
							<l>Now at the last, no hand so true</l>
							<l>As this last relic of her race,</l>
							<l>Who bore her fainting from the place,</l>
							<l>And laid her in her slim canoe.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Black Mungo strode his deck and swore,</l>
							<l>With pike and pistol clutch'd in hand,</l>
							<l>As seamen never swore before.</l>
							<l>He saw the hag's bark pass hard by,</l>
							<l>He heard Adora's helpless cry.</l>
							<l>He saw, but could not understand,</l>
							<l>The wrack that rent on every hand.</l>
							<l>"That horrid hag" he cursing cried,</l>
							<l>And sent a bullet in her side.</l>
							<l>Yet still she row'd against the flood,</l>
							<l>And as she lean'd a stream of blood</l>
							<l>Fell from her side into the tide.</l>
							<l>And all the while Adora lay</l>
							<l>As some dead body borne away.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>It was a sight! Her long, black hair</l>
							<l>Drawn darkly through the waters there.</l>
							<l>The while the hag struck up the stream</l>
							<l>Like some black demon in a dream.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-066" n="60"/>

							<l>Yet all the dark, descending flood</l>
							<l>Bore by a current of red blood--</l>
							<l>No sight does half so horrid seem</l>
							<l>As warm blood streaming down a stream.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The hag struck up the stream with main,</l>
							<l>The men struck down toward the sea.</l>
							<l>Black Mungo strode the deck, and he</l>
							<l>Implored the men stand fast again;</l>
							<l>Steer safe the sable ship from shore,</l>
							<l>And keep the decks with him once more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"God help! the world is all on fire!</l>
							<l>The winds come driving from the sea.</l>
							<l>The long flames leap up higher, higher--</l>
							<l>The flames are leaping angrily,</l>
							<l>From lowly leaf to lofty tree.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"The tide is full of living things,</l>
							<l>The beasts are on the deck, the wings</l>
							<l>Of birds are smiting rope and mast.</l>
							<l>The panthers keep the quarter-deck,</l>
							<l>The wood-rats climb the ropes and fleck</l>
							<l>The shrouds. God! were we free at last,</l>
							<l>This were a motley crew with me,</l>
							<l>Indeed, to sail the chartless sea!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He caught an axe, the cable fell;</l>
							<l>The winds took up an empty sail;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-067" n="61"/>

							<l>The ship swung loosely round; the swell</l>
							<l>Of ebbing current slowly bore</l>
							<l>The creaking ship from off the shore,</l>
							<l>While bird and beast clung spar and rail.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He sprang, he caught the helm, and he</l>
							<l>Stood grimly out towards the sea.</l>
							<l>He scarce could move for bird and beast,</l>
							<l>And each had eyes so like the priest.</l>
							<l>Yet seeing him you well might think</l>
							<l>He was the very missing link.</l>
							<l>The great sea-cows from out their isles,</l>
							<l>The while they mouth'd full mouths of moss,</l>
							<l>Look'd up, and as he sail'd across</l>
							<l>They call'd and call'd the weary whiles.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They sail'd below the gleaming light;</l>
							<l>The sombre waters roll'd as bright</l>
							<l>As sleeping Venice in the morn.</l>
							<l>They sail'd right slow. The flames at length</l>
							<l>On either hand had spent their strength,</l>
							<l>And lay like some ripe field of corn.</l>
							<l>Yet all night long came down the flood</l>
							<l>That horrid sinuous seam of blood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The beasts stood flooded to the eyes,</l>
							<l>And saw them pass in dumb surprise.</l>
							<l>All night they drifted down the flood--</l>
							<l>All night a long bent seam of blood.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-068" n="62"/>

							<l>All night! There was no night. Nay, nay,</l>
							<l>There was no night. The night that lay</l>
							<l>Between that awful eve and day--</l>
							<l>That nameless night was burn'd away.</l>
						</lg>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="part">
						<head rend="center">XII.</head>

						<lg>
							<l>A red hand led through reedy sedge</l>
							<l>That girt a dark, still island's edge--</l>
							<l>A red hand, red from blood, from flame,</l>
							<l>Led bow'd Adora where she came.</l>
							<l>And bleeding still, low reaching o'er,</l>
							<l>She, dying, led to wood so deep</l>
							<l>That only night and shadows keep</l>
							<l>Companionship for evermore.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The red flames from the further shore</l>
							<l>Shot brightly shining where they stood</l>
							<l>Across the lurid, flowing flood,</l>
							<l>And struck a gleaming, golden store</l>
							<l>Of heap'd-up treasures that were known</l>
							<l>To this poor, bleeding wretch alone.</l>
							<l>"Your father's gold!" the wild hag cried;</l>
							<l>Her high hand fell--and so she died.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Transfix'd Adora stood as stone.</l>
							<l>She now was lone as God, as lone</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-069" n="63"/>

							<l>As Eve, ere yet the eager hand</l>
							<l>Of man had stretch'd forth in command.</l>
							<l>And she was iron now, or stone,</l>
							<l>Or steel, or brass, or sodden lead,</l>
							<l>Or anything that you might name</l>
							<l>That heeds not love, nor pride nor shame,</l>
							<l>Nor hope of love, nor honour dead.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She laugh'd a little. Hard and cold</l>
							<l>The sounds struck as a funeral knell.</l>
							<l>She saw the woman where she fell,</l>
							<l>She saw the great, high heap of gold</l>
							<l>Gleam on her like a rising sun.</l>
							<l>She spurn'd it with her foot as one</l>
							<l>Disdaining wealth. This Nature's child,</l>
							<l>Made almost mad, yet coldly proud,</l>
							<l>Curd up her lip and laugh'd aloud,</l>
							<l>Laugh'd like a maniac, sharp and wild.</l>
							<l>And then she bow'd a time her face,</l>
							<l>Then raised it, struck her foot apace,</l>
							<l>And made resolve--that moment made</l>
							<l>Resolve of action. She betray'd</l>
							<l>No tremor, not a touch of fear,</l>
							<l>No pulse of terror, or hot tear.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She stoop'd, and in her arms she bore</l>
							<l>The stark, dead woman to the shore.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-070" n="64"/>

							<l>She laid her decent in her bark</l>
							<l>Below the bare boughs burn'd and dark,</l>
							<l>And pluck'd white lilies of the sea.</l>
							<l>Then with a daughter's sympathy,</l>
							<l>And with a sister's tender hand,</l>
							<l>She hid her face in these, and gave,</l>
							<l>In Indian custom of the land,</l>
							<l>Sad sepulture upon the wave.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then down the slow, reversing tide,</l>
							<l>She lilies strew'd on either side,</l>
							<l>And left her with her slim canoe.</l>
							<l>Then as the loosen'd boat withdrew,</l>
							<l>She reach'd her long, strong arms and cried,</l>
							<l>"Now shall I be man's scourge! For me</l>
							<l>The peopled cities now--the land</l>
							<l>Of action, conquest, and command:</l>
							<l>And who that lives shall question me,</l>
							<l>Save he that sails on yonder sea?"</l>

							<l><hi rend="b">S</hi>IR Francis had come, the fairest of men;</l>
							<l>At least the ladies pronounced him fair,</l>
							<l>But none knew whence he had come, or when;</l>
							<l>And a cautious banker had said, "Beware,"</l>
							<l>And a cunning rival had said, "Take care."</l>
							<l>"And who is this man?" an advocate cried;</l>
							<l>"Sir Francis Jain," his daughter replied.</l>
							<l>"Sir Francis Jain! Ay, that is plain,</l>
							<l>But who the devil's Sir Francis Jain?"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And no man knew him. Men only knew</l>
							<l>He strode direct, like a lion, through</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-074" n="68"/>

							<l>The little mouse-traps that society set</l>
							<l>To cage the yellow-maned lion; and yet</l>
							<l>He was careless of honours and careless of rank</l>
							<l>Quite careless of all the world was he;</l>
							<l>Careless of gold in heaps in the bank,</l>
							<l>Heedless, indeed, of the golden key</l>
							<l>That open'd all doors of the Avenue,</l>
							<l>To welcome this yellow-maned lion through.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And why so careless, and why so cold?</l>
							<l>Surely the man had love and to spare;</l>
							<l>Surely the man had titles and gold,</l>
							<l>Honour at home and everywhere!</l>
							<l>Why so heedless of all was he?</l>
							<l>Why so careless of the golden key</l>
							<l>That open'd the doors of the Avenue,</l>
							<l>And led the yellow-maned lion through,</l>
							<l>Where many a languid maiden's eyes</l>
							<l>Glanced suggestions, and hopes, and sighs?</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The man had all that a man might gain</l>
							<l>In a life's endeavour of strife and pain;</l>
							<l>Honour of women and envy of men,</l>
							<l>Grace of manner, of speech, and then,</l>
							<l>That dash of audacity in his air,</l>
							<l>That vanquishes failure anywhere,</l>
							<l>And crowns men kings. Alas! alas!</l>
							<l>Men only count what their fellow has;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-075" n="69"/>

							<l>They count his gains, but never the cost</l>
							<l>Of the jewel, love, that he may have lost.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The season pass'd and the hero pass'd;</l>
							<l>Pass'd as hundreds before had done,</l>
							<l>Melted away in the summer sun,</l>
							<l>Like fairy frost from your window slant</l>
							<l>Where palace and castle and camp are cast</l>
							<l>But a night, for the fairy inhabitant.</l>
							<l>The season came, and he came again;</l>
							<l>Again in the season he gallop'd through</l>
							<l>The populous lane of the Avenue:</l>
							<l>Tossing his head and toying the mane,</l>
							<l>Gallop'd the lion, Sir Francis Jain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He rein'd his steed. On his haunches thrown</l>
							<l>The black steed plunged on the clanging stone,</l>
							<l>And threw white foam in the air, and beat</l>
							<l>The upward air with his iron feet</l>
							<l>Where the Baroness came. Her marvellous eyes</l>
							<l>Were wide with wonder and a sweet surprise.</l>
							<l>And then they fell, and the lashes lay</l>
							<l>Like dark silk fringes to hide them away;</l>
							<l>And her face fell down to her heaving breast,</l>
							<l>And silent Sir Francis half guess'd the rest.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The man bow'd low. Then over his face</l>
							<l>There flash'd and flooded some sudden trace</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-076" n="70"/>

							<l>Of mad emotion. Quick it pass'd</l>
							<l>As lightning, threading a thunder-blast.</l>
							<l>He lifted his hat, turn'd, bow'd again,</l>
							<l>Toy'd a time with the tossing mane,</l>
							<l>Threaded his fingers quite careless through</l>
							<l>The curving, waving, black silken skein,</l>
							<l>Lean'd him forward, loosen'd the rein,</l>
							<l>Look'd leisurely up the Avenue;</l>
							<l>Then smiling on all with a cold disdain,</l>
							<l>Forward gallop'd Sir Francis Jain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I will give yon house," said the butterman's son,</l>
							<l>Jerking his thumb, as the boor was wont,</l>
							<l>Back over his shoulder, at a brown-stone front--</l>
							<l>"I will give yon house to any one</l>
							<l>That tells me who this man may be.</l>
							<l>Now come, my lawyer, old friend," said he,</l>
							<l>"Come place in my hand the thread to the rein</l>
							<l>That shall bridle this fellow, Sir Francis Jain."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Quick plucking the butterman's son aside,</l>
							<l>Then throwing his cane over shoulder and back,</l>
							<l>As the man disappear'd up the populous track:--</l>
							<l>"He rides like the devil!" the lawyer cried,</l>
							<l>"But listen to me. Hist! step this way,</l>
							<l>I am your man, sir, and who shall gainsay?</l>
							<l>Yea, I have a secret, and I hold the rein</l>
							<l>To bridle your rival, Sir Francis Jain! "</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-077" n="71"/>

						<lg>
							<l>And he pluck'd the man by the broadcloth sleeve</l>
							<l>As he led him aside in the dusk of the eve.</l>
							<l>Then standing aside from the populous place,</l>
							<l>The friend look'd friend right square in the face.</l>
							<l>And the lawyer spoke cautious and wagg'd his head,</l>
							<l>And wink'd at every slow word he said.</l>
							<l>"He rides like the devil. But this is plain,</l>
							<l>He walks as if he dragg'd a chain!</l>
							<l>And that is your cue! Sir Francis Jain</l>
							<l>Is a convict, my man, and has worn a chain!"</l>

							<l>The road of love is a tortuous road,</l>
							<l>Sudden and many the turns for all;</l>
							<l>An uphill way, with a weary load,</l>
							<l>And fatal, indeed, with many a fall;</l>
							<l>And giving, at best, but a barren kiss.</l>
							<l>How long he had loved, had follow'd her</l>
							<l>A far-off, faithfulest worshipper,</l>
							<l>Silent and earnest, as true love is,</l>
							<l>We may not know; but we find the two,</l>
							<l>The envied, and adored, of the Avenue.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Little men knew of him; still less</l>
							<l>They knew of the dark-brow'd Baroness,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-078" n="72"/>

							<l>The beautiful stranger. She that drew</l>
							<l>The veil of mystery close, and dwelt</l>
							<l>Alone in splendour at night, and knelt</l>
							<l>Each morn at the cross; and for ever kept</l>
							<l>Her fair face humbled, as one that wept,</l>
							<l>As she walk'd at eve on the Avenue.</l>
							<l>Yet busy was all the town to guess</l>
							<l>The secrets of this same Baroness.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Yea, busy was fame with her gold, her name,</l>
							<l>Her great, proud house and her retinue;</l>
							<l>Her horses in harness of gold that drew</l>
							<l>Her lonesome carriage in glory through</l>
							<l>The wondering crowd; her maids that came</l>
							<l>And spake no tongue that any man knew;</l>
							<l>Her marvellous form, her midnight of hair,</l>
							<l>That madden'd the vulgar millionaire,</l>
							<l>Who guess'd that his ladder of gold might reach</l>
							<l>To the tallest bough, or this fairest peach.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis Jain was a hero fair</l>
							<l>As the old-time heroes. But never yet</l>
							<l>Had he breathed his love. Oft had they met,</l>
							<l>And oft at morn on her way to prayer</l>
							<l>He met her, pass'd her, hat in air,</l>
							<l>Her eyes on the ground, her breast all sighs--</l>
							<l>Her soul to heaven; to earth her eyes.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>The thoroughfare flow'd like a strong, surging stream,</l>
							<l>Flow'd full as a river foam full to the shore,</l>
							<l>And the soft, autumn sun fell gorgeously o'er</l>
							<l>The long, gleaming lines where glitter and gleam</l>
							<l>The black crush of carriages, far flashing back</l>
							<l>Their wonder of wealth from the broad, endless track.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>'Twas Popper's reception, and good Mrs. P.</l>
							<l>Was gorgeous indeed, as a princess might be.</l>
							<l>'Twas a splendid affair, as all such things are,</l>
							<l>On the Murray Hill end of the Avenue.</l>
							<l>The men were most tall, the women most fair;</l>
							<l>They were grand as young Junos. Bright gold shone in bar,</l>
							<l>And diamonds flash'd thick as the meadow-born dew</l>
							<l>That mirrors the gold of the morn-minted star.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Now whether dame Popper, as some others do,</l>
							<l>When they go catching lions on the Avenue,</l>
							<l>Had written Sir Francis the belle would be there,</l>
							<l>And dying to see him;--then, with the same pen,</l>
							<l>Ere the ink was well dry on the letter just done,</l>
							<l>Had written this belle that this bravest of men</l>
							<l>Was coming to meet her, I cannot declare.</l>
							<l>I give you the facts, you can read as you run.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-080" n="74"/>

							<l>The lover was there, the lady was there;</l>
							<l>And Popper was proud, as the Lady was fair.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The Lady? Let's see! I described her before--</l>
							<l>Not so? You forget. You would have once more</l>
							<l>The chronicle; have me tell o'er and o'er</l>
							<l>Her manifold charms; to read all through</l>
							<l>The book of her excellence; to tell anew</l>
							<l>The beauty, the love, and the charities done</l>
							<l>By this saddest yet gentlest soul under the sun.</l>
							<l>You would have it all o'er again, because</l>
							<l>She was so lovely to see, and was</l>
							<l>So girt in majesty, grace; and, oh!</l>
							<l>Because sweet heaven did pity her so.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She was dark as Israel; proud and still</l>
							<l>As the Lebanon pines on Palatine hill.</l>
							<l>She stood as a lone blown palm that grew</l>
							<l>In middle desert for shelter of men</l>
							<l>From moving sand and descending flame.</l>
							<l>Her name, Adora. Her plain, simple name,</l>
							<l>Meant nothing at all until after you</l>
							<l>Had seen her face, her presence, and then</l>
							<l>From that day forth it had form, and meant</l>
							<l>The fairest thing under the firmament.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her name was as language, and when men knew</l>
							<l>No word in all tongues to give utterance to</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-081" n="75"/>

							<l>Their grandest conception of beauty, why, she</l>
							<l>Stood up in their souls, calm, silently,</l>
							<l>And fill'd the blank with her simple name.</l>
							<l>And ever at mention or thought of her</l>
							<l>Men grew in soul as a growing flame</l>
							<l>On a mountain-top when the strong winds stir,</l>
							<l>And so took heart; and all life through</l>
							<l>They lived the nobler for this love they knew.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her history! Nay, there was naught of it,</l>
							<l>So far as men knew, save that which was writ</l>
							<l>On her marvellous face. She had dwelt with woe,</l>
							<l>She had walk'd in shadows so long, so far,</l>
							<l>They lay on her breast like an iron bar.</l>
							<l>The dark of trouble hung over her hair</l>
							<l>Like a widow's veil. The touch of care</l>
							<l>Had chill'd her soul like an early snow</l>
							<l>On the Autumn heights when the brooks creep slow,</l>
							<l>And the quails pipe solemn and far and low.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A touch of tenderness lay over all</l>
							<l>Her deed or utterance. Yet hers was the strength</l>
							<l>Of desert lion that strides full length</l>
							<l>From jungle at night, with velvet foot-fall.</l>
							<l>Sir Francis adored her. This she knew,</l>
							<l>For certainly comes such knowledge to</l>
							<l>A great-soul'd woman. Yet he stood aloof,</l>
							<l>And his calm eyes lifted and follow'd through</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-082" n="76"/>

							<l>The tangle of crowds, in eternal proof</l>
							<l>Of patient devotion, where'er she drew.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>The Baroness in her boudoir lay</l>
							<l>Red flush'd with conquest of the day.</l>
							<l>"And he is mine!" She half arose</l>
							<l>From couch of gold and silken snow</l>
							<l>At thought of it. The proud repose</l>
							<l>That comes to voyagers who know</l>
							<l>The land is theirs, illumed her face.</l>
							<l>"Good Christ, it were a lusty race</l>
							<l>That I did run for name and place!</l>
							<l>To name myself the Baroness!</l>
							<l>To seek this proudest city out!</l>
							<l>To come a stranger in disdain,</l>
							<l>Proud scorning all life's littleness;</l>
							<l>To dare it all! to never doubt!</l>
							<l>To reach mine own strong, right hand out,</l>
							<l>And clutch this lion's yellow mane!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I am the Baroness du Bois!</l>
							<l>Ay, that is good! from wood and vine</l>
							<l>I drew my line. My crest should be</l>
							<l>An arrow cleaving through a tree,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-083" n="77"/>

							<l>For even all earth's wooden walls</l>
							<l>Shall not defeat. My burning brow</l>
							<l>Shall bear its crown of gold. My halls,</l>
							<l>My marble halls, shall shout with joy;</l>
							<l>My firm feet shall not falter now!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Why turn me back? My slopes of pine</l>
							<l>Henceforth shall be a land forgot.</l>
							<l>I know them not, I know them not.</l>
							<l>My face shall front the rising sun.</l>
							<l>If I must make a long, strong race,</l>
							<l>What good that I turn back my face</l>
							<l>Each day, to see the distance done?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Ay, he is mine! Sir Francis Jain,</l>
							<l>My lion with the yellow mane,</l>
							<l>Ere yet another month betide</l>
							<l>Shall take me close, his bosom'd bride. ...</l>
							<l>And Delos? God! the thought of it!"</l>
							<l>She sprang full statured in the air.</l>
							<l>She shook her mighty storm of hair,</l>
							<l>And trembled as in ague fit--</l>
							<l>"I cannot, cannot, cannot tear</l>
							<l>His memory, the love, the hate,</l>
							<l>The everlasting hate I bear</l>
							<l>This man, from out my heart, go where</l>
							<l>I may." Her two clasp'd hands fell down.</l>
							<l>Her face forgot its dark, fierce frown,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-084" n="78"/>

							<l>And sad and slow she shook her head.</l>
							<l>"O, if indeed it were but hate!</l>
							<l>But love and hate do intertwine,</l>
							<l>A serpent and a laden vine.</l>
							<l>But where is Delos? He is dead!</l>
							<l>Thank God the man is dead! and I</l>
							<l>As free as any maid to wed. ...</l>
							<l>And if he be not dead, what then?</l>
							<l>Do I not hate him with a hate</l>
							<l>That will not let me hesitate</l>
							<l>Now at the last? Above all men</l>
							<l>I hate this cursed, cold man who fled</l>
							<l>And left me in the flame to die.</l>
							<l>And he is dead, thank God, is dead. ...</l>
							<l>And if he be not dead, but rise.</l>
							<l>Some day to front me? I can say,</l>
							<l>Can look right squarely in his eyes,</l>
							<l>Before Sir Francis, any day,</l>
							<l>And say, my lord, this fellow lies!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"But then my letters! and the face</l>
							<l>I painted on that quaint gold-plate!</l>
							<l>Ah, curse that childish face! I hate</l>
							<l>That priest who taught my hand to trace</l>
							<l>Its silly lineaments. But fate</l>
							<l>Has been my friend. I still will dare</l>
							<l>And trust to fate, and leave the care</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-085" n="79"/>

							<l>To circumstance. For he is dead!</l>
							<l>Yea, Delos, Delos, he that fled,</l>
							<l>And left me in the flame, is dead,</l>
							<l>Is dead! is dead! thank God, is dead!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She sank upon her couch. She drew</l>
							<l>Her round arms up right full, and threw</l>
							<l>Them forth, and sigh'd and caught her breath</l>
							<l>As one that waked from sleep-like death.</l>
							<l>She stretch'd her long limbs in repose,</l>
							<l>Her long, strong, fearless limbs that grew</l>
							<l>To God's perfection, where they knew</l>
							<l>No bridling. Her dark lids did close</l>
							<l>In lovely languor, and she lay</l>
							<l>As one that would forget alway.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But vain she woo'd her soul's repose.</l>
							<l>She turn'd, and on her round arm rose,</l>
							<l>And touch'd a bell. "How thick this air!</l>
							<l>Pray place a pastille on the marble there,</l>
							<l>Within the alcove. Why, my wood--</l>
							<l>Nay, heed me not. Why do you stare?</l>
							<l>My mind resumes its savage mood,</l>
							<l>My soul takes on the elements</l>
							<l>Of storm and battle and events</l>
							<l>'Twas chiefest of. ... Nay, nay, my mind</l>
							<l>Went back to my ancestral land,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-086" n="80"/>

							<l>And I fell dreaming of the grand</l>
							<l>Old castles, and of hound and hind</l>
							<l>Afar. Ah! thank you. Turn that chair</l>
							<l>A shade more mellow from the light.</l>
							<l>A footstool, now. Now loose my hair</l>
							<l>And fan me leisurely. To-night</l>
							<l>I would you had some great romance,</l>
							<l>Of Sappho, Dido, or, perchance,</l>
							<l>Some later lover; one who knew</l>
							<l>The purple glory of proud blood,</l>
							<l>And lived and died for sweet love's sake ...</l>
							<l>Pray make that bird be silent! Take</l>
							<l>This mantle, girl, of silk and gold,</l>
							<l>And throw it over him, and hold</l>
							<l>His pretty song a prisoner ...</l>
							<l>Where was I? Oh, the lovers. You,</l>
							<l>I think, have read Zenobia through--</l>
							<l>You see her picture there? And there</l>
							<l>Is Sappho, Egypt. Everywhere</l>
							<l>Grand, storied faces of the great</l>
							<l>Of my own sex, who knew to hate,</l>
							<l>Or love, which is indeed the same:</l>
							<l>Yet not one shade that bears man's name.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Read me some reckless love and true;</l>
							<l>Some star-touch'd woman's soul, that drew</l>
							<l>Earth's magnets to its stormy height.</l>
							<l>Yea, give me tiger's meat to-night;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-087" n="81"/>

							<l>Some Cleopatra who disdain'd</l>
							<l>All little ways of life, and grew</l>
							<l>To top the pyramids, and reign'd,</l>
							<l>Still reigns, a wider realm than all</l>
							<l>Rome ever knew in rise or fall. ...</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Come, wheel my cushion softly, far</l>
							<l>To yon dim alcove, where the light</l>
							<l>Falls freely, and the lofty frown</l>
							<l>Of pictured Hercules in war</l>
							<l>Shall look my restless spirit down,</l>
							<l>And hush my longings for the night.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"There! let me rest. Unloose my gown.</l>
							<l>My heart, my very soul seems bound</l>
							<l>And bridled in these silken ropes</l>
							<l>And corded things. O my free woods!</l>
							<l>My raging seas! my flowing floods!</l>
							<l>My wood-built vales, my dreams, my hopes--</l>
							<l>There, there! Go, go! I bade you go</l>
							<l>Long since. Why stare you so? ...</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"O heaven! If I had but one</l>
							<l>To talk to of my battles done.</l>
							<l>But one poor mind to sympathize,</l>
							<l>Or understand my hopes or fears,</l>
							<l>Or know why tears, hot, drowning tears,</l>
							<l>Come sometimes tiding to my eyes. ...</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-088" n="82"/>

							<l>Not one to love. I cannot buy</l>
							<l>With all this wealth one soul to trust,</l>
							<l>And to the bitter end I must</l>
							<l>Live out this gilded, splendid lie.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"That mocking, flaunting moonlight falls</l>
							<l>With brazen harshness through the gold</l>
							<l>And damask of yon curtain's fold,</l>
							<l>And flaunts me in my very halls,</l>
							<l>And all this richly-figured floor</l>
							<l>That sinks like velvet to my feet</l>
							<l>Lies stiff, as if my winding-sheet. ...</l>
							<l>That moonlight lies like bright steel bar,</l>
							<l>And heavy on my heart. Afar</l>
							<l>I hear the hollow town once more</l>
							<l>Strike steel to stone. O God! to sleep!</l>
							<l>O that my weary feet could stray</l>
							<l>But once again in that vast deep</l>
							<l>And distant wild land of delight,</l>
							<l>Where men take hardly note of night,</l>
							<l>And night deals generous with day. ...</l>
							<l>I will return again--nay, nay!</l>
							<l>What queen shall rule this realm but I?</l>
							<l>Who looks back perishes! My way</l>
							<l>Lies open and inviting now.</l>
							<l>My feet are strong; upon my brow,</l>
							<l>My dark and ample brow, is set</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-089" n="83"/>

							<l>The brightest star in social sky,</l>
							<l>And it shall wear its coronet.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"My soul, stay with me, nor forget:</l>
							<l>Stay with me, nor return again</l>
							<l>To land of seas and wild, white rain;</l>
							<l>Let Delos sleep his well-earn'd sleep</l>
							<l>With beasts beneath the sundown deep.</l>
							<l>My face is front, my brow is set,</l>

							<l>Two strange ships on an unknown sea,</l>
							<l>That counter sail, to God knows where,</l>
							<l>May meet, but pass not instantly.</l>
							<l>The very fact of being there</l>
							<l>Proves them of common lot; a life</l>
							<l>Of battled elements and strife.</l>
							<l>And they will break their loneliness,</l>
							<l>These lone, blown sails upon that sea,</l>
							<l>Though they should prove, at last, to be</l>
							<l>But common in their dark distress.</l>
							<l>These two ships met on this lone main;</l>
							<l>The Baroness, Sir Francis Jain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>How these digressions do disgust</l>
							<l>And weary one! You must mistrust</l>

							<l>The man has little fruit to show</l>

							<l>To lead right up the path to where</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis and his lady fair</l>
							<l>Rode far from out the Park and town.</l>
							<l>A star was in her midnight hair,</l>
							<l>Her hand shone with a starry stone</l>
							<l>That lit their bridle path at night.</l>
							<l>Like some tall shepherd, shepherding</l>
							<l>His flock upon the soundless flood,</l>
							<l>A far ship anchor'd, tall and white.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-091" n="85"/>

							<l>The snapping bat was on the wing,</l>
							<l>A dog howl'd from the distant wood;</l>
							<l>And right and left, and white and lone,</l>
							<l>Some mighty marbles ghostly stood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>'Twas night, and yet it was not dark.</l>
							<l>They long had pass'd broad Central Park;</l>
							<l>And yet they rode on silently,</l>
							<l>Until the great, white-girdled moon,</l>
							<l>As soft as summer afternoon,</l>
							<l>Came wheeling up the sea, and lay</l>
							<l>Her broad, white shoulders bare as day;</l>
							<l>As if at some fair, festal ball</l>
							<l>Of gather'd stars at carnival.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He rein'd, he turn'd him home at last,</l>
							<l>Yet scarce a word his lips had pass'd.</l>
							<l>And at his side his lady, she</l>
							<l>Rode silent and as rapt as he;</l>
							<l>Rode still and constant, as if she</l>
							<l>Had been his guardian angel, bound</l>
							<l>To lead him through some dark profound.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>His soul was as some ship that drew</l>
							<l>All silent through the burst of seas,</l>
							<l>Pursuing some dim distant star</l>
							<l>That spun unfix'd for ever through</l>
							<l>The boundless upper seas of blue.</l>
							<l>She seem'd so near, and yet so far.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-092" n="86"/>

							<l>Just now she seem'd as near as woe;</l>
							<l>Just now she seem'd as far as though</l>
							<l>They dwelt in the antipodes.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They silent rode. She look'd away,</l>
							<l>As one that had no word to say.</l>
							<l>She had her secret, this he knew;</l>
							<l>Yet ofttime in the night alone,</l>
							<l>He waked and wonder'd if her true</l>
							<l>And heart-pent history was known--</l>
							<l>If painted in its blackest hue,</l>
							<l>'Twould make a shadow to his own.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Two strange, uncommon souls were these</l>
							<l>That silent sail'd uncompass'd seas.</l>
							<l>Far out from any ship or shore,</l>
							<l>Far out from reef or breakers' roar.</l>
							<l>Where ships of commerce never drew</l>
							<l>A keel, these two ships cross'd, and knew</l>
							<l>Each other as they sail'd alone,</l>
							<l>And on, to under worlds unknown.</l>
							<l>O golden, sacred silentness!</l>
							<l>Take thou the silver coin of speech,</l>
							<l>And bribe your way to hearts, so less</l>
							<l>Than hearts the silences shall reach.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Two strangers rode in silence down</l>
							<l>Against the sounding, teeming town;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-093" n="87"/>

							<l>Two strangers. Yet two souls that knew</l>
							<l>Heart histories far better than</l>
							<l>The wisest and profoundest man</l>
							<l>That ever read earth's archives through.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Didst ever think how souls have size</l>
							<l>And weight and measure in God's eyes,</l>
							<l>So other than the weight and span</l>
							<l>And measure given them by man?</l>
							<l>Why, there be hunchback souls that stand</l>
							<l>Beside tall souls, broad-brow'd and grand;</l>
							<l>And these bend ever, and look down</l>
							<l>Upon the great soul's rumpled gown,</l>
							<l>And see upon its trail a stain,</l>
							<l>Obtain'd, perchance, in some great fight,</l>
							<l>In silent battle for the right;</l>
							<l>And then they mock and make complain,</l>
							<l>And wagging point the world the stain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>In middle heaven moved the moon,</l>
							<l>Still slow they rode and silently,</l>
							<l>Till sudden distant thunder fell</l>
							<l>From out fair heaven. Like a knell</l>
							<l>Of some departed afternoon,</l>
							<l>That dying, leaves a heritage</l>
							<l>Of undivided memory</l>
							<l>Of most delicious love, it fell</l>
							<l>Upon the rapt Sir Francis Jain,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-094" n="88"/>

							<l>And startled him. He threw the gage</l>
							<l>To Fate, rose full, clutch'd at his rein,</l>
							<l>Struck heel to flank, threw back his hair,</l>
							<l>Spoke loud, and laugh'd with careless air</l>
							<l>Of tempest driving up the skies,</l>
							<l>And lifting unto her his eyes,</l>
							<l>At touch of large, slant drops of rain,</l>
							<l>He gather'd up his strength again,</l>
							<l>And strange, far thought, that still would roan</l>
							<l>And plunged and led right hard for home.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The desolation of the plain,</l>
							<l>The perfect solitude, the reign</l>
							<l>Of ghosts and spirits of the dark</l>
							<l>Came down. The tempest's wild complain</l>
							<l>Was monster-like. The driving rain</l>
							<l>And loud-voiced thunder rode the air.</l>
							<l>No lamp, no light, stood out that night,</l>
							<l>No star in heaven set a mark--</l>
							<l>'Twas darkness, darkness everywhere.</l>
							<l>They pierced the middle of the Park.</l>
							<l>Their road led underneath the ground;</l>
							<l>The winding paths led in and out,</l>
							<l>The tempest rode in merry rout;</l>
							<l>They rode against the slanting rain,</l>
							<l>They rode a circle round and round,</l>
							<l>And rode in circle yet again.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-095" n="89"/>

						<lg>
							<l>And still they rode, still round and round,</l>
							<l>By darkling arch, beneath the ground,</l>
							<l>The while the hoofs kept clanging sound.</l>
							<l>At last half wild and quite worn out,</l>
							<l>Sir Francis turn'd and gave a shout</l>
							<l>From underneath an arch. From out</l>
							<l>A deeper arch, a cave, hard by,</l>
							<l>There came a sharp, responding cry.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Ho! ho! A call for help. We come!</l>
							<l>Come! Up! my comrades; follow me!"</l>
							<l>Sir Francis turn'd his head, and he</l>
							<l>Stood still, and gazed as one struck dumb;</l>
							<l>For lightnings fell in sheets, and then</l>
							<l>There stood a stolid line of men.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But these Sir Francis heeded not;</l>
							<l>His flashing eyes the instant fell</l>
							<l>Upon their leader; one who stood</l>
							<l>The tallest tree of some dark wood.</l>
							<l>He stood as one that Time forgot,</l>
							<l>Or fear'd to tackle, or to lay</l>
							<l>A hand upon--he stood so well,</l>
							<l>That Time went by the other way.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And still Sir Francis silent sat</l>
							<l>His steed, and stared and stared thereat.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-096" n="90"/>

							<l>He look'd right in the robber's face,</l>
							<l>Who stood and boldly stood his place;</l>
							<l>The while the men drew circle round,</l>
							<l>And made secure their vantage-ground.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Their leader bow'd and stepp'd before</l>
							<l>Sir Francis, and laid hold the rein.</l>
							<l>He bade the lady pass; she pass'd,</l>
							<l>Then turn'd, and peering glances cast.</l>
							<l>His lifted brow was white and broad,</l>
							<l>His presence, proud as ever trod.</l>
							<l>He was all coolness, leisure now,</l>
							<l>He shook his brown locks from his brow,</l>
							<l>Half smiled, and blandly bow'd still lower,</l>
							<l>And then he turn'd, stern raised a hand</l>
							<l>Toward his men, gave some command,</l>
							<l>Half laugh'd, then smiling, bow'd again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then stepping back, with bended head</l>
							<l>And courteous bow, he gaily said,</l>
							<l>With lantern lifted high once more,</l>
							<l>He did most certainly deplore</l>
							<l>The state of weather; 'twas severe;</l>
							<l>A sort of equinox, he thought;</l>
							<l>He said to-morrow surely ought,</l>
							<l>In conscience, to be bright and clear,</l>
							<l>For sunshine surely follows rain.</l>
							<l>And here he bow'd and smiled again;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-097" n="91"/>

							<l>Then lifting up his broad, high head,</l>
							<l>He, in the Queen's best English, said:</l>
							<l>"But now this weather question, sir,</l>
							<l>The winds, the rains, the sudden rise</l>
							<l>Of choler in the anger'd skies;</l>
							<l>The fall of the barometer,</l>
							<l>The storms by land, the calms by seas,</l>
							<l>Are fix'd by Probabilities!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"You meet your neighbour now at morn,</l>
							<l>Shake hands, how-how, then hesitate.</l>
							<l>You first look flutter'd, then forlorn.</l>
							<l>You cannot speak. You know the great</l>
							<l>Eternal question now is done.</l>
							<l>Six thousand years men met together</l>
							<l>And calmly talk'd about the weather,</l>
							<l>But now the papers run the sun.</l>
							<l>A man asks, 'Will it rain to-day?'</l>
							<l>Give him two cents and go your way.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And you, my friend, if you had thought</l>
							<l>This evening as you gallop'd out</l>
							<l>And hail'd a poor newsboy and bought</l>
							<l>A first-class paper, why, no doubt</l>
							<l>The small investment, sir, had been</l>
							<l>'A big investment for your tin.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And this reminds me, by the way,</l>
							<l>That tin is what we want. I know,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-098" n="92"/>

							<l>A very common want to-day.</l>
							<l>But so extravagant, and so</l>
							<l>Exacting are the ladies, and</l>
							<l>So many are the needs of men</l>
							<l>To hold respect and have a place</l>
							<l>In woman's heart--Ah madam, I,</l>
							<l>I do assure you, I had rather die</l>
							<l>Than make offence, or so disgrace</l>
							<l>Myself and fellows, as to stand</l>
							<l>In your sweet presence here, and say</l>
							<l>One word against the sex for which</l>
							<l>We hazard all. Yet, madam! you</l>
							<l>Can hardly think what men pull through</l>
							<l>To be illustrious, grand, or rich;</l>
							<l>To please you, charm you, win the prize</l>
							<l>Of love, in love's enchanting eyes!</l>
							<l>The ships that plough the foamy track,</l>
							<l>The mines that open mouths of gold,</l>
							<l>The smoke of battle rolling back,</l>
							<l>Enshrouding thousands stark and cold,</l>
							<l>The tracking of the trackless climes,</l>
							<l>The thousand crowns, the thousand crimes</l>
							<l>Of man, the woman-worshipper,--</l>
							<l>All won or done, alone for her.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"But, lady, please pass on a pace;</l>
							<l>Pray climb that ridge above the moat:</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-099" n="93"/>

							<l>Che truth is, being gentle-born, you see,</l>
							<l>The presence of a lady's face</l>
							<l>It always did embarrass me</l>
							<l>Whenever I meant to cut a throat.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Nay, nay, pass on. I do but jest.</l>
							<l>'Tis one of my rough, playful pranks;</l>
							<l>I only have a slight request</l>
							<l>To make of this, your gallant knight;</l>
							<l>And I, in truth, am too polite</l>
							<l>To talk of business in the sight</l>
							<l>Of ladies. Ah! thanks, madam, thanks!</l>
							<l>I will not keep you long. The night</l>
							<l>Is damp. Then 'tis so very late,</l>
							<l>"Twere impolite to make you wait.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And, sir, you too would go. No doubt!</l>
							<l>Nay, stop! Stand, sir! Stand! Take out</l>
							<l>That quick right hand that you have just</l>
							<l>This moment in your bosom thrust!</l>
							<l>Take out your hand! No? Shall it be</l>
							<l>Purse? or pistol? Look at me!</l>
							<l>You see I do not flinch. My face</l>
							<l>Is lifted unto yours. My place</l>
							<l>Is peril's front. I know not fear.</l>
							<l>You have the drop. Then slay me here,</l>
							<l>And gallop into town and they</l>
							<l>Will name you hero of the day.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-100" n="94"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"Now draw! Shoot centre! deadly, true!</l>
							<l>What, sir? Your purse! By heaven, you</l>
							<l>Were born a king! Whom can you be,</l>
							<l>To bravely spare a man like me?</l>
							<l>Where drew you breath? I know but one--</l>
							<l>But one lone man beneath the sun</l>
							<l>Who thus could turn and scornfully</l>
							<l>Give back the life that clutch'd at his,</l>
							<l>And with it, purse well fill'd as this.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"And that one man, he wore a chain</l>
							<l>For many a long month at my side</l>
							<l>In California. And that name?</l>
							<l>My true chain-fellow--chain'd in shame--</l>
							<l>I speak it with a lofty pride--</l>
							<l>'Twas Francis Jain! Sir Francis Jain!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Nay, nay, my lady! Start not so!</l>
							<l>No harm shall happen him, I swear.</l>
							<l>Stand back, my men! Now may he go;</l>
							<l>There is a wildness in his air</l>
							<l>That even I would hardly dare</l>
							<l>To trifle with. Stand wide, my men,</l>
							<l>We shall not see his like again.</l>
							<l>Come! let my lantern strike his face,</l>
							<l>Now as he gallops from the place,</l>
							<l>To note him well, that after this</l>
							<l>No harm shall hap to him or his;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-101" n="95"/>

							<l>And mark--By heaven, it is Jain!</l>
							<l>Tis Jain! 'tis Jain! Sir Francis Jain!</l>
							<l>Come back! Come, take your gold; why, I--</l>
							<l>I would not touch it though I die.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"You will not turn! Then take the right</l>
							<l>Upon the rise. You see the light</l>
							<l>Above the city's centre rise</l>
							<l>Like London, dashing all the skies?</l>
							<l>Then ride for that. Ride straight, and you</l>
							<l>Will strike the lighted Avenue."</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis's face was on his hand:</l>
							<l>His eyes look'd blankly, helpless down;</l>
							<l>His brow was dark with storm and frown;</l>
							<l>His hair was tumbled wildly, and</l>
							<l>His face was flush'd as one that wept,</l>
							<l>And yet wept not, nor waked, nor slept.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>A pistol nestled close beside</l>
							<l>A nervous and outreaching hand;</l>
							<l>A thing familiar and long tried,</l>
							<l>That waited as for some command.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He rose and slowly walk'd the floor,</l>
							<l>Then sat him down and swiftly wrote</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-102" n="96"/>

							<l>With fever'd hand a hurried note.</l>
							<l>Then quick he rose, and clutch'd and tore</l>
							<l>What he had writ, and, still in frown,</l>
							<l>Strode long and thoughtful up and down.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>At last he stopp'd, as one outworn,</l>
							<l>Sat down, took up the fragments torn,</l>
							<l>And sadly smiled. And now he caught</l>
							<l>Convulsively, as rack'd with pain,</l>
							<l>The pen, spread out the page again,</l>
							<l>And wrote as one made mad with thought.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Farewell, my love, yet not farewell.</l>
							<l>I know the sullen, clanging knell</l>
							<l>Of clod on coffin-lid means all</l>
							<l>Is over. Yet the bleeding heart</l>
							<l>Is oft too wounded to depart,</l>
							<l>And so creeps in the buried pall.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Oh, let my broken heart still true,</l>
							<l>Come back with olive branch to rest</l>
							<l>From thy proud presence. This were best;</l>
							<l>Oh, this were best, indeed, for you.</l>
							<l>Mine ark is as some broken bark,</l>
							<l>That ever buffets storm. The dark</l>
							<l>Has mantled me. My flutter'd dove</l>
							<l>Went forth a fond devoted love.</l>
							<l>Now give it peace of death and rest,</l>
							<l>Oh, fair and faultless, this were best.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-103" n="97"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"I loved you, lady--love you now,</l>
							<l>With love intensified to pain;</l>
							<l>But we must never meet again.</l>
							<l>I write to give you back your vow.</l>
							<l>Oh, fair, white dove, the olive bough</l>
							<l>Lies deep submerged. My ship drives on</l>
							<l>In deluge and in darkness. Night</l>
							<l>Has compass'd me at last, and now</l>
							<l>Must you escape and live. But dawn</l>
							<l>Is yours, and days of calm delight.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Lo! here I sit forlorn to-night,</l>
							<l>And calmly write and sign for you</l>
							<l>Mine own death-warrant. The disdain</l>
							<l>Of universal earth was naught</l>
							<l>Had you but hover'd in my sight.</l>
							<l>I could have lived in you, forgot</l>
							<l>The deep indignity, the stain,</l>
							<l>The perils my young life pass'd through,</l>
							<l>The hard reproaches and heart pain.</l>
							<l>But all is over. ... It is due</l>
							<l>To your position, and to you,</l>
							<l>To tell you I am that same Jain,</l>
							<l>The convict Jain, Sir Francis Jain.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I bore that name because it was</l>
							<l>My noble, gentle father's name;</l>
							<l>I bore, I bear that name, because</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-104" n="98"/>

							<l>It was my sire's--all that he</l>
							<l>In dying could bequeath to me.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I would not palliate, nor claim</l>
							<l>One touch of tenderness, no tear</l>
							<l>From you, fair girl; from any one</l>
							<l>Beneath the broad, all-seeing sun.</l>
							<l>But I would have you know that name</l>
							<l>Is my real name; that it is dear;</l>
							<l>That I have worn it e'er, my friend,</l>
							<l>Unshamed, and so shall to the end.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"We sometimes laugh so loud that we</l>
							<l>From very joy must turn and weep.</l>
							<l>The world is round. Extremes must meet.</l>
							<l>We sometimes mourn so very deep</l>
							<l>That we do laugh hysterically,</l>
							<l>As if the bitter had been sweet.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>.... "It comes to be my strange belief,</l>
							<l>From what my life has heard and seen,</l>
							<l>That you may bend your ear, and you</l>
							<l>May whisper soft as far-off bird,</l>
							<l>Against the wall that lifts between</l>
							<l>Intensest joy, intensest grief,</l>
							<l>And so be quite distinctly heard.</l>
							<l>The world is round. Extremes must meet.</l>
							<l>The sweet is bitter; bitter sweet.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-105" n="99"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"Why, I sit smiling now. The tears</l>
							<l>That had been prison'd long, long years,</l>
							<l>Hard frozen--that refused to flow</l>
							<l>For mine or for my lost friend's woe,</l>
							<l>Have flow'd to-night in streams above</l>
							<l>The grave of this new-buried love. ...</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"'Tis pitiful, 'tis painful. Yet</l>
							<l>With all this agonized regret</l>
							<l>That all is o'er, there has come</l>
							<l>A strange, uncommon sense of rest.</l>
							<l>My feet shall rest. My lips be dumb,</l>
							<l>For earth has nothing I request.</l>
							<l>And now to life's conclusion must</l>
							<l>My lips be stopp'd as stopp'd with dust.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"As one, far traversing the West,</l>
							<l>Finds some vast sea and troubled wave,</l>
							<l>Some trackless sea of boundless shore</l>
							<l>That shuts the world he would explore,</l>
							<l>And so sits down and digs his grave,</l>
							<l>And calmly waits his final rest,</l>
							<l>So I sit waiting, sad, yet fond,</l>
							<l>Half glad that earth has naught beyond.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Not one fair foot-print marks my shore.</l>
							<l>The Sea stretch'd forth his cold, white hands,</l>
							<l>And levell'd smooth the shining sands</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-106" n="100"/>

							<l>Where your feet pass'd the day before.</l>
							<l>Now all lies blank. I, now, no more</l>
							<l>Shall look before. Let me look back</l>
							<l>Along my lone life's dubious track.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I had a friend, one friend, who stood</l>
							<l>Like some high-lifted, lighted tower,</l>
							<l>Above the stormy, sea-foam flood</l>
							<l>On peril's front, in peril's hour.</l>
							<l>Oh, lady, know you what it is</l>
							<l>To know unshaken soul like this?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"We were as one. He, nobler born</l>
							<l>Than I, did hold all rank in scorn;</l>
							<l>And, wild with love of war and fame,</l>
							<l>And all that boasted Freedom's name,</l>
							<l>Ere yet we touch'd on man's estate,</l>
							<l>We fled the Old World, and we came</l>
							<l>To blindly fight for Southern land.</l>
							<l>We fought; we bled--won fame, command;</l>
							<l>And so in secret trust at last</l>
							<l>Were sent to gain the Golden Gate,</l>
							<l>Where never yet a foe had pass'd.</l>
							<l>'Twas glory or a felon's chain.</l>
							<l>We staked--and lost. We would again.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"My fellow-captive was my friend;</l>
							<l>A braver, nobler man than I;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-107" n="101"/>


							<l>A man who ever sought to die,</l>
							<l>And so lives on unto the end.</l>
							<l>You ask me where may now abide</l>
							<l>This friend so chivalrous, so tried?</l>
							<l>This man so braver, nobler born,</l>
							<l>Who held all rank in splendid scorn?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Hold back your face. You may not care</l>
							<l>To hear his name and place, till you</l>
							<l>Have seen how faithful and how true</l>
							<l>He was, and what his soul could dare</l>
							<l>In deadly circumstance, or how</l>
							<l>He grew the knave I find him now.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Why, we were chain'd--chain'd hand to hand:</l>
							<l>And in this prisonment we grew</l>
							<l>In firmer friendship than they knew;</l>
							<l>And, spite of hard oppression, stood</l>
							<l>Like two tall poplars of the wood,</l>
							<l>Half wedded, for he was more grand</l>
							<l>Than proudest noble of the land.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"At last one night we broke this chain,</l>
							<l>In gloomy Alcatraz. Yet we</l>
							<l>Could only hear the tumbling sea</l>
							<l>Break hard against the beetling wall,</l>
							<l>And lift and fall, and that was all;</l>
							<l>We knew not where we were, no more</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-108" n="102"/>

							<l>Than midnight storm of driving rain</l>
							<l>That beat the sea and shook the shore.</l>
						</lg>


						<lg>
							<l>"We reckless climb'd the beetling wall,</l>
							<l>Down which it seem'd a ghost would fall.</l>
							<l>And when we breathed free air again,</l>
							<l>Took boat and touch'd the fields and fled,</l>
							<l>While I crept by as one nigh dead,</l>
							<l>Why, every loose link of my chain,</l>
							<l>The iron ball I dragg'd in pain,</l>
							<l>He bore upon his shoulders broad</l>
							<l>All day, as if some demigod.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"We broke the chains anew, and then</l>
							<l>Once more were free, unfetter'd men.</l>
							<l>But cursed chains leave a trail and trace</l>
							<l>Sometimes, that years shall not efface.</l>
							<l>At last, outworn and faint we stood</l>
							<l>Far off against the upland wood,</l>
							<l>Where stretch'd two dim, dividing trails.</l>
							<l>One led o'er mountains, one through vales,</l>
							<l>And all were as unknown to me</l>
							<l>As unnamed isles of middle sea.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"We knew no road, no sign, nor chart;</l>
							<l>Knew naught at all. We only knew</l>
							<l>That there would be a deadly chase</l>
							<l>O'er mountain height, by mountain base.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-109" n="103"/>

							<l>We bore full heritage of hate,</l>
							<l>For we were leaders; were the two</l>
							<l>That stood as pillars to the gate</l>
							<l>Of freedom, while the brave pass'd through.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"We knew that we must instant part,</l>
							<l>Take divers ways, in hopes that one</l>
							<l>Might grope the tangled jungle through,</l>
							<l>And with a bold unbroken heart</l>
							<l>Escape, to undertake anew</l>
							<l>The work we nobly had begun.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"He bade me take my choice of trails.</l>
							<l>I did refuse. He smiling drew</l>
							<l>A penny forth, and gaily threw</l>
							<l>Our only fortune in the air.</l>
							<l>'Come! choose, my comrade! heads or tails?</l>
							<l>How he did counterfeit the care</l>
							<l>That burrow'd deep his mighty heart!</l>
							<l>I knew his heart was breaking--knew</l>
							<l>The while that all this dash and dare</l>
							<l>Was done for me, to make me bear</l>
							<l>With fortitude my further part.</l>
							<l>I chose. And so we parted there</l>
							<l>That instant, with one last embrace,</l>
							<l>All silent, with averted face.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Through lonely vales he took his flight;</l>
							<l>My way led up the mountain height;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-110" n="104"/>

							<l>And mark what follow'd. Weak and worn,</l>
							<l>My body bent, my bare feet torn,</l>
							<l>I sought safe shelter for the night</l>
							<l>In densest copse along the height,</l>
							<l>Where great rocks rose above a cave,</l>
							<l>As if to guard some giant's grave.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I gather'd sticks, struck flint and steel,</l>
							<l>And when the flames leapt up, behold!</l>
							<l>The cave was one vast mass of gold--</l>
							<l>More gold than England's vaults conceal!</l>
							<l>To only think that all this dross</l>
							<l>Depended on a copper's toss.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I gather'd gold. In pain and fear</l>
							<l>I sought the sea with burden'd hands--</l>
							<l>I bribed my way to other lands;</l>
							<l>But secret I return'd each year,</l>
							<l>To seek my comrade far and wide,</l>
							<l>And up and down; but all in vain.</l>
							<l>Each year I gather'd heaps of gold</l>
							<l>From my great coffers hidden deep,</l>
							<l>Where spotted wild beasts house and sleep.</l>
							<l>I gave--gave generous and bold</l>
							<l>As Caesar, so to bribe, reward</l>
							<l>The miners, officers or guard,</l>
							<l>To bring me my lost friend again.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-111" n="105"/>

							<l>They told me he had surely died</l>
							<l>From beasts or flood. They lied! they lied!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Forgive me, love. Yea, pity me.</l>
							<l>Man's face is fronted to a wall.</l>
							<l>He prophesies to-morrows. All</l>
							<l>His days, he plans of days to be;</l>
							<l>And yet, poor fool, he cannot see</l>
							<l>One inch before, around, or o'er</l>
							<l>The wall that circles him. And I</l>
							<l>Am even as the blindest. Could,</l>
							<l>Could I foreknow that he should rise,</l>
							<l>Red-handed, in my road at night,</l>
							<l>Array'd in that dark robber's guise?</l>
							<l>This man who erst stood up to die</l>
							<l>For honour's sake? We two once stood</l>
							<l>On peril's bristled height alone;</l>
							<l>We two, in God's high-lifted light,</l>
							<l>Exulted but in purity.</l>
							<l>Shall I desert him overthrown?</l>
							<l>Forsake my friend because his soul</l>
							<l>Is slimed and perishing? Ah me!</l>
							<l>'Twere base to fly and leave a friend</l>
							<l>All bleeding where red battles roll.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"But that were little. Dying there</l>
							<l>On glory's front, with trumpets' blare,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-112" n="106"/>

							<l>And battle's shout blent wild about,</l>
							<l>The sense of sacrifice, the roar,--</l>
							<l>The snow-white soul might well leap out</l>
							<l>The door of wounds, and up the stair</l>
							<l>Of heaven to God's open door,</l>
							<l>While yet the hands were bent in prayer.</l>
							<l>But oh! to leave a soul o'erthrown,</l>
							<l>And doom'd to slowly die alone!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"The body is not much. 'Twere best</l>
							<l>Take up the soul and leave the rest.</l>
							<l>It seems to me the man who leaves</l>
							<l>The soul to perish, is as one</l>
							<l>Who gathers up the empty sheaves</l>
							<l>When all the golden grain is done.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Farewell! I reach this man the hand</l>
							<l>That had been yours, that he may stand.</l>
							<l>Farewell! Forget me, lest you hear</l>
							<l>The world your love insult and sneer.</l>
							<l>Farewell! This robber was my friend,</l>
							<l>Is now, and shall be to the end.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Farewell! God help me now! For such</l>
							<l>Hard conflicts tide about my heart</l>
							<l>That I do hesitate. The part</l>
							<l>Of man is in the ranks to die</l>
							<l>Hard battling for the shining right;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-113" n="107"/>

							<l>But when all things partake a touch</l>
							<l>Of darkness and a touch of light,</l>
							<l>The skein comes tangled. Then the woof</l>
							<l>And warp of life proves reason-proof.</l>
							<l>O heaven! for a sword so true</l>
							<l>Of edge that I might cleave this through!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"The years lift like a stair. Arise</l>
							<l>And climb the stairway to the skies,</l>
							<l>And look possession of the world</l>
							<l>That lies quite conquer'd at your feet.</l>
							<l>Yet range not far, I do entreat;</l>
							<l>Black clouds will cross the fairest skies,</l>
							<l>The fullest tides must ebb and flow;</l>
							<l>The proudest king that e'er unfurl'd</l>
							<l>His banners, met his overthrow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Farewell, farewell! for aye, farewell.</l>
							<l>Yet must I end as I began.</l>
							<l>I love you, love you, love but you--</l>
							<l>I love you now as never man</l>
							<l>Has loved since man and woman fell.</l>
							<l>And that is why, O love, I can,</l>
							<l>Lift up to you my burning brow</l>
							<l>To-night, and so renounce you now."</l>

							<l>The letter sent, he paced the floor</l>
							<l>Impatiently, and until morn,</l>
							<l>As one most hopeless and forlorn.</l>
							<l>What would she do? What could he more?</l>
							<l>These things he question'd o'er and o'er,</l>

							<l>And clutches quick and breaks the seal</l>

							<l>Do that which I deem fit and fair.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"As for the chains and prison's shame,</l>
							<l>Take no reproach. 'Tis nobler far</l>
							<l>To bear defeat than shine a star</l>
							<l>In circled seat of rounded fame.</l>
							<l>I reach my hand in trust to you,</l>
							<l>I give unshaken faith, the same</l>
							<l>As when you rode with shining name,</l>
							<l>The lion of the Avenue.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I give all this, Sir Francis Jain.</l>
							<l>Pray hold it not in proud disdain.</l>
							<l>And do you know what little task</l>
							<l>My love in full return shall ask?</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-116" n="110"/>

							<l>"Why, it is this. When you shall stand</l>
							<l>Beside me, and shall hold my hand,</l>
							<l>And I shall lift my happy face</l>
							<l>Full into yours, O love, then you</l>
							<l>Shall promise that if e'er disgrace</l>
							<l>Touch me, that you will prove as true.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Think thrice, Sir Francis, ere you speak,</l>
							<l>For time is strong and man is weak.</l>
							<l>Think thrice, then come; and that shall be</l>
							<l>As God's own covenant to me.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Now bear with truth, and hear me through.</l>
							<l>I am a liar, traitor. You</l>
							<l>Are truth itself compared to one</l>
							<l>Who calls, heart-broken and undone.</l>
							<l>Your truth has conquer'd me, for now</l>
							<l>I know that man may keep a vow.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I am no Baroness. Nay, I</l>
							<l>Am an impostor, and the lie</l>
							<l>Is crushing me. There, take it all!</l>
							<l>You hold the ladder. Let me fall;</l>
							<l>Or hold me to my place, and you</l>
							<l>Shall be my star the cycles through.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Ah! you despise me. That you may</l>
							<l>Despise me thoroughly, I pray</l>
							<l>Hear this. I once was wed</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-117" n="111"/>

							<l>To one I loved as never man</l>
							<l>Was loved since history began.</l>
							<l>He left me to my death. He fled.</l>
							<l>But he is dead, thank God, is dead!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I speak it earnestly. And yet</l>
							<l>I cannot, cannot all forget</l>
							<l>Of that great love. It comes to me</l>
							<l>As climbs some storm-sea o'er the beach;</l>
							<l>Yea, comes like some great tidal sea,</l>
							<l>And teems and drowns my topmost reach.</l>
							<l>You see, O love, I offer you</l>
							<l>No virgin love, yet love more true.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I do confess the world is dear,</l>
							<l>For cross'd and cruel was my youth;</l>
							<l>And now I stand low-humbled here,</l>
							<l>Divested of my crown, as one</l>
							<l>Who hath some grand reign just begun.</l>
							<l>The world is dear; but dearer truth,</l>
							<l>If 1 can find a man as true,</l>
							<l>O love, to challenge truth, as you.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"My broken heart, pierced through and through,</l>
							<l>Throbs audibly. I would reveal</l>
							<l>Its utmost chamber now to you,</l>
							<l>And not one sacred niche conceal. ...</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-118" n="112"/>

							<l>Now you have all. My weakness is</l>
							<l>A longing for a love like this</l>
							<l>God promised me, and for a name,</l>
							<l>A proud, fair name. Shall I confess</l>
							<l>That this same name, the Baroness,</l>
							<l>Was more to me, is dearer yet,</l>
							<l>Than gold or lands? A crown of shame,</l>
							<l>Alas! shall be my coronet.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Go save your friend. Give him the hand</l>
							<l>That had been mine. Then come to me,</l>
							<l>If you, through all eternity,</l>
							<l>Would save a soul. I cannot stand</l>
							<l>Alone. This well-establish'd lie</l>
							<l>Is like a millstone to my neck, and I</l>
							<l>Must reach some solid shore or die.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Yet if there lives on all this earth</l>
							<l>One man as true, yea, half as true,</l>
							<l>Yea, of one-hundredth part the worth</l>
							<l>As this same friend that waits for you,</l>
							<l>Why come, if you despise me not,</l>
							<l>And let us haste, haste, seek the spot</l>
							<l>Where he conceals, and reach this man</l>
							<l>Two hands; two hands! for surely two,</l>
							<l>Made strong with love, and reaching so,</l>
							<l>Were stronger for his poor soul than</l>
							<l>One hand made weak with pain and woe."</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-119" n="113"/>

						<lg>
							<l>As some brief-banish'd king that turns</l>
							<l>Rejoicing to resume his throne,</l>
							<l>As some bright light that leaps and burns</l>
							<l>Above the darkness when the blown</l>
							<l>Swift winds delight the leaping flame,</l>
							<l>Sir Francis, fond and eager, came.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>For he had groped with sorrow through</l>
							<l>The vale of desolation. He</l>
							<l>Had learn'd how rare the fountains are</l>
							<l>On life's long, level desert. Few</l>
							<l>Had been his friends, and these were far</l>
							<l>Away, he reck'd not where. He knew,--</l>
							<l>And strange, indeed, how few there be</l>
							<l>Who know,--how rare is love! Ah me!</l>
							<l>Who know the half way worth of it;</l>
							<l>Or even love's delightful counterfeit!</l>

						<lg>
							<l>How glad he was! He came that night</l>
							<l>As swift as love; so glad, so fleet,</l>
							<l>To find her falling at his feet,</l>
							<l>Her face all tears, her full neck bare,</l>
							<l>And all her black, abundant hair</l>
							<l>Torn down and toss'd in sorry plight.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The morning must succeed the night.</l>
							<l>All storms subside. The clouds drive by.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-120" n="114"/>

							<l>And when again the glorious light</l>
							<l>From heaven's gate comes bursting through,</l>
							<l>Behold! the rains have wash'd the sky</l>
							<l>As bright as heaven's bluest blue.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She would have, weeping, told him all,</l>
							<l>Each name, each date, each circumstance,</l>
							<l>Her father's crimes, the bloody chance</l>
							<l>That brought her fortune, wrought her fall.</l>
							<l>But he, he would not hear one word,</l>
							<l>Nor scarce believe what he had heard.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"My ships are burn'd, I break no more</l>
							<l>The hush of seas. My friend is found,</l>
							<l>And all my life shall now be bound</l>
							<l>With thee, and bounded by thy shore."</l>
							<l>He thought a time, then raised his head,</l>
							<l>And in a deep, firm voice, he said,</l>
							<l>"Now let the dead past bury its dead.</l>
							<l>I reach my hand, and over all</l>
							<l>I veil the dead past as a pall.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Be tranquil, thou. Persuade thy soul</l>
							<l>To peace. My life seems perfect now.</l>
							<l>Thy broken life shall be made whole;</l>
							<l>My friend shall lift his ample brow,</l>
							<l>In time, and climb to better things,</l>
							<l>Supported by thy angel wings."</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-121" n="115"/>

						<lg>
							<l>O they indeed were lovers now!</l>
							<l>Fast bound by many a breathless vow</l>
							<l>And promise, seal-set, o'er and o'er,</l>
							<l>On ruddy lips and lifted brow,</l>
							<l>That naught should ever part them more.</l>
							<l>The days went by one calm delight,</l>

						<head rend="center">X.</head>

						<lg>
							<l>The eve was perfect; and the air</l>
							<l>Was sweet as love. ... A famous Fair</l>
							<l>Was near at hand; and now the two</l>
							<l>Stroll'd loving forth and careless drew</l>
							<l>To dream and view the beauty there.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She lean'd reliant on his arm,</l>
							<l>As if she felt that never harm</l>
							<l>Or accident or any shame</l>
							<l>Could touch her now, whatever came.</l>
							<l>She moved beside him like a dream,</l>
							<l>And calm as some deep, sea-bound stream.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The lovers pass'd from hall to hall,</l>
							<l>And sudden, in a bright room, faced</l>
							<l>A man, with many a friend around.</l>
							<l>'Twas Delos! he whom we have traced</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-122" n="116"/>

							<l>Through flood and flame; whom we have found</l>
							<l>A robber, brigand, cursed, disgraced.</l>
							<l>He stood up comely, proud and tall;</l>
							<l>A stalwart sort of second Saul,</l>
							<l>A man that overtopt them all.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He seem'd to see, yet saw her not;</l>
							<l>His eyes ranged distant as his thought.</l>
							<l>She started, shrunk back in her place,</l>
							<l>As if a flame had struck her face.</l>
							<l>"'Tis Delos! and the man does live!</l>
							<l>The one man lives that now can give</l>
							<l>The lie to my pretentious life,</l>
							<l>Before I be Sir Francis' wife!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Now must one perish: 'tis not I,</l>
							<l>But cold, cursed Delos that shall die!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis swoon'd with love. He bent</l>
							<l>His head, his eyes with fond intent,</l>
							<l>But did not hear her, did not see</l>
							<l>Her grief, nor guess her agony.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The two pass'd on. Her face was white.</l>
							<l>Sir Francis nothing saw but light</l>
							<l>And love, bright shining like a star</l>
							<l>In his broad firmament of bliss.</l>
							<l>Men are not shrewd as women are;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-123" n="117"/>

							<l>A woman feels an atmosphere,</l>

							<l>Her instincts lead where reasons fall.</l>
							<l>Now it may be the reason is,</l>
							<l>Her little feet are set more near</l>
							<l>The light of golden gates ajar.</l>

						<head rend="center">XI.</head>

						<lg>
							<l>Poor lovely lady, from the hour</l>
							<l>She came, she felt the tempest lower,</l>
							<l>Like black storm banners in the skies,</l>
							<l>And had not lifted up her eyes.</l>
							<l>Her eyes, her splendid eyes, bent down;</l>
							<l>Her large and ever-lifting eyes,</l>
							<l>They only felt a sombre frown--</l>
							<l>They felt his eyes fix'd on her there,</l>
							<l>Like dead men's eyes in awful stare.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"O come, Sir Francis, take me hence!</l>
							<l>This air is poison. Here be men</l>
							<l>Who frown like gather'd thunder, when</l>
							<l>The lightnings sleep. My woman's sense</l>
							<l>Perceives it. See! the women stare,</l>
							<l>And gather in their garments, where,</l>
							<l>A very little time before,</l>
							<l>They crowded round me by the score. ...</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-124" n="118"/>

						<lg>
							<l>"Nay, nay, not that! nor need you fear;</l>
							<l>I cling the closer unto you,</l>
							<l>For all that men may say or do</l>
							<l>To bring you shame. But I feel here</l>
							<l>Some dark, and ghost-fill'd atmosphere."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And now they stood the centre floor,</l>
							<l>And suddenly all men stood still,</l>
							<l>And women stared with common will,</l>
							<l>And she crept closer than before.</l>
							<l>She lifted up her great black eyes</l>
							<l>To his bent eyes, then let them fall--</l>
							<l>She only lifted her black eyes</l>
							<l>To his bent eyes, and that was all.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>'Twas as some covenant of old,</l>
							<l>Renew'd with every vow resaid.</l>
							<l>He bended down his lofty head,</l>
							<l>Till her dark hair was dash'd with gold.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Above the two the great lights burn'd,</l>
							<l>It seem'd with fierce, uncommon glare.</l>
							<l>She lean'd the closer as they turn'd;</l>
							<l>She gather'd close her robes to go,</l>
							<l>When quick the stranger from his place</l>
							<l>Stepp'd forth, and glaring in her face,</l>
							<l>He cried, half hiss'd, hystericly,</l>
							<l>"My God! Sir Francis, it is she!</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-125" n="119"/>

							<l>My fair wife of the wilderness!</l>
							<l>Is this your boasted Baroness?"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her great, proud, bended eyes no more</l>
							<l>Kept sad and frighten'd to the floor.</l>
							<l>Beware of those who silent bear</l>
							<l>All things; for they all things will dare,</l>
							<l>When at the last they feel one touch</l>
							<l>Of wrong or tyranny too much.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She stood up taller than before.</l>
							<l>She look'd him firmly in the face.</l>
							<l>She did not speak, and not a trace</l>
							<l>Of terror, rage, or aught swept o'er</l>
							<l>Her calm, proud soul. She only drew</l>
							<l>Her splendid arm more firmly through</l>
							<l>Her lover's, as she raised her head,</l>
							<l>And hissing through her teeth, she said,</l>
							<l>"He lies! he lies! This stranger lies!</l>
							<l>I know him not! ... For this he dies!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis did not hesitate.</l>
							<l>He made his choice. He knew that Fate</l>
							<l>Had drawn her sword-line in the sand,</l>
							<l>And stepp'd across with tight-clutch'd hand.</l>
							<l>'Twas now much more than life or death.</l>
							<l>'Twas love, and no man drew a breath.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-126" n="120"/>

							<l>They did not stir, nor speak, nor yet</l>
							<l>The lady's presence quite forget.</l>
							<l>Sir Francis look'd, to look him through,</l>
							<l>Then said, slow whisp'ring, "Who are you?"</l>
							<l>"I am that lady's husband, sir,</l>
							<l>And will not brook your touch of her!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Her lover stagger'd back as though</l>
							<l>The man had struck an iron blow.</l>
							<l>But instant he recover'd. "I</l>
							<l>Must beg that you will see my friend.</l>
							<l>I call you liar! to the end</l>
							<l>That we may meet, for you must die!</l>
							<l>Pray let me pass! Come, Baroness--</l>
							<l>Nay, no more words. To-morrow morn,</l>
							<l>Why, you must answer scorn for scorn.</l>
							<l>But here are ladies, sir, and you--</l>
							<l>Ah! nobly done! and now adieu."</l>
							<l>Then Delos bow'd his face. As one</l>
							<l>Who feels that never more the sun</l>
							<l>Shall shine for him, he sought the night,</l>
							<l>To, homeless, roam in sorry plight</l>
							<l>The hollow streets, and wait the morn</l>
							<l>And death--less dreadful than this scorn.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"O dear Adora! I would give</l>
							<l>The round years of my life to live</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-127" n="121"/>

							<l>But one pure day with thee again.</l>
							<l>To sit again in sweet retreat,</l>
							<l>To only see thy sacred face,</l>
							<l>Uplifting in its childish grace,</l>
							<l>While I sat silent at thy feet!</l>
							<l>O I must speak--in vain, in vain!</l>
							<l>It is her curse. I feel it now,</l>
							<l>It lies like Cain's brand on my brow.</l>
							<l>I cannot lift my face, and I</l>
							<l>At morn must take my place to die."</l>

							<l>She seem'd as some poor flutter'd bird;</l>
							<l>A bird that hurries anywhere</l>
							<l>When storm is trembling in the air.</l>
							<l>And did he question her that night,</l>
							<l>Poor girl, in all her sorry plight--</l>
							<l>Ere he took hurried leave of her?</l>
							<l>Of her strange life where white storms stir?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I know not that. But I should say</l>
							<l>He spoke her gently as before,</l>
							<l>And, waiting her own time to speak,</l>
							<l>But gently press'd her pallid cheek,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-128" n="122"/>

							<l>And pass'd her through her open'd door,</l>

							<l>Without one question--ay, without</l>

							<l>"No, no! man's hand hath ever been</l>
							<l>Against me. To the bitter end</l>
							<l>Must I bear all, without one friend</l>
							<l>Or love to lean upon. Yet, when</l>
							<l>All's won; well done... My heart, what then?...</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I love poor Delos, love him true</l>

							<l>My curse it crushes him. ... and yet</l>
							<l>It was deserved. Shall I forget?</l>
							<l>No! No! Now let my mad blood stir!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis sat alone. His friend,</l>
							<l>A strong, brave and accomplish'd man,</l>
							<l>Had come with compliment and plan</l>
							<l>Of meeting in the Park at dawn;</l>
							<l>Had done his work in haste, and gone</l>
							<l>To speak his fellow; to the end</l>
							<l>That no man sighted through the night,</l>
							<l>Two dark-wing'd ships, like birds in flight.</l>
							<l>'Twas nearing dawn. Yet still alone</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-130" n="124"/>

							<l>Sir Francis sat. His brow was calm,.</l>
							<l>His face was in his lifted palm,</l>
							<l>And all things seem'd as still as stone.</l>
							<l>His thoughts were all of her. The Day,</l>
							<l>The unbox'd freightage there that lay,</l>
							<l>Just landed from the ship To Be--</l>
							<l>The ship that now had cross'd the sea,</l>
							<l>That lonesome sea that ever flows</l>

							<l>This unpack'd freightage there that lay</l>
							<l>Held unto him strange merchandise,</l>
							<l>And yet he would not lift his eyes.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>His thoughts were all of her. No care</l>
							<l>Or thought of self intruded there.</l>
							<l>His world was all in her. Her name</l>
							<l>Was on his lips; like some blown flame</l>
							<l>Her form was ever floating there,</l>
							<l>More mobile, more majestic, fair,</l>
							<l>Than she had ever been before.</l>
							<l>She fill'd all space, possess'd the air,</l>
							<l>She stood before as to implore,</l>
							<l>Yet still as silent she did seem,</l>
							<l>As star-born beings of a dream.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>"Sir Francis Jain! the night is grey</l>

							<l>The beam of light struck like a sword.</l>
							<l>He started up, thrust forth his head.</l>
							<l>"Stop! stop! I say! that light, that light!</l>
							<l>'Tis from my lady's window height.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Nay, stay, I say, one instant stay,</l>
							<l>Just where you see that lone light play.</l>
							<l>I will uplift my face once more,</l>
							<l>This last, and for his life implore.</l>
							<l>You do not understand. Yet stay,</l>
							<l>There still is time enough to slay.</l>
							<l>One instant 'neath that window sill,</l>
							<l>Then drive; drive where and as you will."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The iron feet like thunder drew</l>
							<l>The fire from the rocks and flew,</l>
							<l>Then rein'd them plunging. Instantly</l>
							<l>That window on the Avenue,</l>
							<l>That burn'd all night now upward flew,</l>
							<l>And quick a dark, dear face lean'd through.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-133" n="127"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Her face was pitiful with tears.</l>
							<l>Her hands clench'd tight. She seem'd to be</l>
							<l>All shaken with her trouble. There</l>
							<l>Were streaks of frost strewn through her hair,</l>
							<l>That had not touch'd her brow before.</l>
							<l>He reach'd his face and did implore</l>
							<l>Her mercy for the man. She threw</l>
							<l>Her hands in hatred and despair.</l>
							<l>"He lives for ever in my light,</l>
							<l>His shadow makes my life like night.</l>
							<l>He stands before me--has for years,</l>
							<l>Stood like a bar across the door</l>
							<l>Of my existence. Go! God speed</l>
							<l>Your hand in this most holy deed!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"You kill my love!" he, pleading, cried.</l>
							<l>"This boundless, high-born love, for you</l>
							<l>It shall not live this dark deed through.</l>
							<l>I tell you, if this man must die,</l>
							<l>My love shall die as well, and I</l>
							<l>Shall range earth like a frighten'd ghost,</l>
							<l>Despising her I love the most.</l>
							<l>This love this night has nearly died"--</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Then let it die quite dead this morn!"</l>
							<l>The lady cried, in deadly scorn.</l>
							<l>"Yea, I will give it sepulture</l>
							<l>In my gold thimble. Nay, a seed,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-134" n="128"/>

							<l>A hollow'd bird-seed, gallant sir,</l>
							<l>I surely think me will be all</l>
							<l>The tomb a love so frail and small</l>
							<l>As this of yours will ever need."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The window clang'd, the light was gone.</l>
							<l>The strong steeds plunged and forward flew</l>
							<l>The instant, and as if they knew</l>
							<l>The bloody mission men were on.</l>
							<l>They bent their necks--they fairly flew</l>
							<l>Far out the sounding Avenue.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And she, the wild wood lioness,</l>
							<l>With fury toss'd, and love and hate,</l>
							<l>Scarce knowing what she dared of Fate,</l>
							<l>Dash'd after them. The Baroness</l>
							<l>Was her old self. Right well she knew</l>
							<l>To track, to follow, crouch close by</l>
							<l>And hear, see all. Her child-life through</l>
							<l>Had been but this. "Now let him die!"</l>
							<l>She hiss'd as from a clump of wood,</l>
							<l>Close at their side she leaning stood.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They stood in place, face fronting face,</l>
							<l>Both careless quite of what went on,</l>
							<l>And calmly waited the full dawn.</l>
							<l>Like some tall antique chisell'd stone</l>
							<l>Tall Delos stood--stood quite alone.</l>
						</lg>

						<pb id="VAA9497-135" n="129"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Some surgeons, as if accident</l>
							<l>Had drawn them careless to the place,</l>
							<l>With ready lint and implement,</l>
							<l>Along a hill kept distant pace.</l>
							<l>No friend had Delos there. Alone</l>
							<l>He stood, as one cast out, unknown;</l>
							<l>At last he spake, and slowly said,</l>
							<l>In soft, low voice, with bended head:</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"I have this one request to make:</l>
							<l>A little one. And it is made,</l>
							<l>Not, I assure you, for my sake,</l>
							<l>But for another's. Leave the dead</l>
							<l>With muffled lips and earth-bound breast.</l>
							<l>My secret and my last request,</l>
							<l>Is of your love, the Baroness--</l>
							<l>She is a Baroness; no less."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Two dark eyes glared from out the wood.</l>
							<l>Her heart beat tempest where she stood.</l>
							<l>And Delos laid his hand upon</l>
							<l>His heart, and tender-voiced went on:</l>
							<l>"But briefly, this is my request.</l>
							<l>I know that I come here to die.</l>
							<l>I know that deadly hand, and I--</l>
							<l>No matter. Let my corse be laid</l>
							<l>With this vest button'd to my breast,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-136" n="130"/>

							<l>Just as it is. Let no man dare</l>
							<l>Invade the secret hidden there;</l>
							<l>But let me 'neath this same sod rest,</l>
							<l>With her dear image on my breast."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis and his second bent</l>
							<l>Their heads in quiet, cold consent,</l>
							<l>Then lifted hands in firm conclave,</l>
							<l>That what he ask'd they freely gave.</l>
							<l>And then he bow'd, and only spake--</l>
							<l>"Ah, thank you, thank you, for her sake."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Sir Francis' aching brow was wet</l>
							<l>With agony. Could he retrace</l>
							<l>Now at the last one little pace?</l>
							<l>He saw his friend before him stand--</l>
							<l>His one true friend of all the land,</l>
							<l>The noblest man that ever yet</l>
							<l>Had fronted him stand up to die!</l>
							<l>Stand up to die at his own hand,</l>
							<l>All mantled in dark mystery.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Could he forgive him? But the world?</l>
							<l>>Sir Francis smiled. His proud lip curl'd</l>
							<l>To think that he could stop to care</l>
							<l>Whether it reck'd him false or fair.</l>
							<l>But she! He started at the thought;</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-137" n="131"/>

							<l>He bit his lip and tasted blood.</l>
							<l>He shook like sere leaf where he stood.</l>
							<l>He caught his breath, for had she not</l>
							<l>Cried "Kill him! kill!" No word he said.</l>
							<l>He clutch'd his hand, threw up his head,</l>
							<l>Look'd at the man, drew hurried breath,</l>
							<l>And doom'd him in his heart to death.</l>
							<l>He pitied him. He pray'd; did ask</l>
							<l>His God's forgiveness with bent head. ...</l>
							<l>And then his love for her lay dead,</l>
							<l>And Duty took his hand and led</l>
							<l>The sad man's soul to do his task.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Time! One!" Two hands rose high in air;</l>
							<l>"And Two!" Two hands fell sloping down,</l>
							<l>"And Three!" They level fell, and there</l>
							<l>Was graveyard silence everywhere</l>
							<l>That touch'd the far-off waking town.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Advance! and fire as you will!"</l>
							<l>The surgeons stop upon the hill!</l>
							<l>And she, her two hands clutch and reach,</l>
							<l>She stands, too paralyzed for speech.</l>
							<l>Step! step! a puff of smoke! a clear</l>
							<l>And sharp shot ringing in the ear,</l>
							<l>A left breast lifts as from a ball,</l>
							<l>And Delos totters as to fall:</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-138" n="132"/>

							<l>Falls half-way down, comes up again,</l>
							<l>Still fronting stern Sir Francis Jain,</l>
							<l>And now he towers strong and tall</l>
							<l>As if he never more could fall;</l>
							<l>And does Sir Francis now not fear?</l>
							<l>His foeman draws uncommon near!</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Grand Delos now is stern and grim</l>
							<l>With fury that devours him.</l>
							<l>"Sir Francis, 'tis your time to die.</l>
							<l>I have reserved my shot, and I</l>
							<l>Shall take my time to curse or slay.--</l>
							<l>You cannot turn, you cannot go,</l>
							<l>But you must stand, and fronting so</l>
							<l>Hear all that I may choose to say--</l>
							<l>Nay, do not fear reproaches. I</l>
							<l>Have none to give; I wonder why</l>
							<l>This shot you sent straight at my heart,</l>
							<l>Still lets me live to bear this part.</l>
							<l>But we will die together now.</l>
							<l>Bow down your head; I pray you bow,</l>
							<l>And I will give you time to pray;</l>
							<l>I beg you, pray. Bow down your head,</l>
							<l>And as you pray shall you fall dead.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Why, I grow stronger now, and I</l>
							<l>Recover from the shock and shot.</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-139" n="133"/>

							<l>Have you request on earth, or aught</l>
							<l>Of grace or charity forgot?</l>
							<l>I pray you trust them all to me,</l>
							<l>For now I feel I shall not die,</l>
							<l>My blood comes tiding like a sea.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Yea, trust me. It was my request,</l>
							<l>That my wife's letters on my breast,</l>
							<l>The picture of her splendid face,</l>
							<l>This package nestled in its place,</l>
							<l>Should with my dust for ever rest,</l>
							<l>And keep her secret sacred. You,</l>
							<l>You know what honour is! how true</l>
							<l>A true vow is unto the end,</l>
							<l>To her who has been more than friend.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"This package from my breast--why, what?</l>
							<l>My God, Sir Francis, what is this?</l>
							<l>By all the saints, it is your ball,</l>
							<l>That you sent searching for my heart.</l>
							<l>I beg your pardon. 'Tis my fault.</l>
							<l>This package still will play its part.</l>
							<l>I pray your pardon, sir. I had forgot;</l>
							<l>You aim at hearts, and never miss.</l>
							<l>Sir Francis, you've another shot."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"My letters? O my life! My love!"</l>
							<l>There came a cloud and storm of hair,</l>

							<pb id="VAA9497-140" n="134"/>

							<l>Two round arms reaching through the air.</l>
							<l>"And have you loved me? Is it true,</l>
							<l>That still through flood and fire, you</l>
							<l>Have borne these constantly above</l>
							<l>Your brave heart, roaming anywhere?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Sir Francis, friend, O pity me!</l>
							<l>I love this man, have loved him through</l>
							<l>All time, and for eternity.</l>
							<l>Shall love him faithfully and true."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Two pistols drop upon the ground.</l>
							<l>Brave hand to hand each swift extends:</l>
							<l>"I lose a bride, I win two friends;</l>
							<l>But O such friends! The wide world round</l>
							<l>Knows not their peers," Sir Francis cries.</l>
							<l>"And lady, Baroness, and heir</l>
							<l>To titles you will not despise,</l>
							<l>Embrace your husband, Baron Clare."</l>
						</lg>

						<p>N<hi rend="sc">OTE.</hi>--In a reckless attempt to fit out cruisers in the Golden
							Gate unite California to the Southern Confederacy, two daring young noblemen, who had
							left the Old World to cast their fortunes with the South, were taken, and condemned to
							die. They had much sympathy, however, and escaped to lead the most romantic lives;
							indeed, not widely unlike what I have written. The Englishman fell in a duel; the
							other died fighting for Cuba.</p>
						<p>The Baroness, poor child, was from my own wild West. Of course, her part in the
							story, beyond that fact, is largely fictitious. Yet less than a year before her death,
							this romantic and strangely beautiful woman, who had won the hearts of both
							hemispheres, as it were, sat before me for this picture of herself as I have drawn
							it.</p>

						<pb id="VAA9497-141" n="135"/>

						<p>And let me here say to those who may profess to be outraged, that she iked it; and
							even if she had not, she was too noble and sublime a nature to find fault with even a
							savage for devotion. Ay, I knew her better than any of you. I loved her better than
							all of you together. I raise this rough stone to her memory. Unworthy it is, I know,
							but please let it stand till you raise a better one.</p>

						<l><hi rend="b">S</hi>HE was damn'd with the dower of beauty. She</l>
						<l>Had gold in shower about her brow.</l>
						<l>Her feet!--why, her two blessed feet were so small</l>
						<l>They could nest in this hand. Then she stood up so tall,</l>
						<l>So gracious, so grand! She was all to me,--</l>
						<l>My present, my past, my eternity! ...</l>
						<l>She but lives in my dreams. I behold her now</l>
						<l>On that shoreless white river that flow'd like a sea</l>
						<l>At her feet where I sat... How her lips push'd out</l>
						<l>In their brave, warm welcome of dimple and pout!</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-144" n="138"/>

					<lg>
						<l>'Twas eons agone. By a river that ran</l>
						<l>All fathomless, echoless, limitless, on,</l>
						<l>And shoreless, and peopled with never a man,</l>
						<l>We met, soul to soul. ... No land; yet I think</l>
						<l>There were willows and lilies that lean'd to drink.</l>
						<l>The stars were all seal'd and the moons were gone.</l>
						<l>The wide shining circles that girdled that world,</l>
						<l>They were distant and dim. And an incense curl'd</l>
						<l>In vapoury folds from that river that ran</l>
						<l>All shoreless, with never the presence of man.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How sensuous the night! how soft was the sound</l>
						<l>Of her voice on the night! How warm was her breath</l>
						<l>In that world that had never yet tasted of death</l>
						<l>Or forbidden sweet fruit! ... In that far profound</l>
						<l>We were camp'd on the edges of god-land. We</l>
						<l>Were the people of Saturn. The watery fields,</l>
						<l>The wide-wing'd, dolorous birds of the sea,</l>
						<l>They acknowledged but us. Our bare battle shields</l>
						<l>Were my naked white palms; our food it was love.</l>
						<l>Our roof was the fresco of far stars above.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How tender she was, and how timid she was!</l>
						<l>How turn'd she to me where that wide river ran,</l>
						<l>With its lilies and willows and watery reeds,</l>
						<l>And heeded as only your true love heeds! ...</l>
						<l>But a black-hoofed beast, with the head of a man,</l>
						<l>Stole down where she sat at my side, and began</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-145" n="139"/>

						<l>To puff his tan cheeks, then to play, then to pause,</l>
						<l>With his double-reed pipe; then to play and to play</l>
						<l>As never play'd man since the world began,</l>
						<l>And never shall play till the judgment day.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How he puff'd! how he play'd! Then adown the dim shore,</l>
						<l>This half-devil man, all hairy and black,</l>
						<l>Did dance with his hoofs in the sand, looking back</l>
						<l>As his song died away. ... She turn'd never more</l>
						<l>Unto me after that. She arose, and she pass'd</l>
						<l>Right on from my sight. Then I follow'd as fast</l>
						<l>As a true love could follow. But ever before</l>
						<l>Like a spirit she fled. How vain and how far</l>
						<l>Did I follow my beauty from star to white star!</l>
						<l>From foamy white sea, and from storm-stricken shore!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How long I did seek her! My pent soul of fire</l>
						<l>It did feed on itself. I fasted, I cried;</l>
						<l>Was tempted by many. Yet still I denied</l>
						<l>The touch of all things, and kept my desire. ...</l>
						<l>I stood by the lion of St. Mark in that hour</l>
						<l>Of Venice when gold of the sunset is roll'd</l>
						<l>From cloud to cathedral, from turret to tower,</l>
						<l>In matchless, magnificent garments of gold;</l>
						<l>Then I knew she was near; yet I had not known</l>
						<l>Her form or her face since the stars were sown.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-146" n="140"/>

					<lg>
						<l>We two had been parted--God pity us!--when</l>
						<l>The stars were unnamed and all heaven was dim;</l>
						<l>We two had been parted far back on the rim</l>
						<l>And the outermost border of heaven's red bars;</l>
						<l>We two had been parted ere the meeting of men,</l>
						<l>Or God had set compass on spaces as yet;</l>
						<l>We two had been parted ere God had set</l>
						<l>His finger to spinning the purple with stars,--</l>
						<l>And now, at the last in the golden fret</l>
						<l>Of the sun of Venice, we two had met.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Where the lion of Venice, with brows a-frown,</l>
						<l>With toss'd mane tumbled, and teeth in air,</l>
						<l>Looks out in his watch o'er the watery town,</l>
						<l>With a paw half lifted, with claws half bare,</l>
						<l>By the blue Adriatic, on the edge of the sea,--</l>
						<l>I saw her. I knew her, but she knew not me.</l>
						<l>I had found her at last! Why I, I had sail'd</l>
						<l>The antipodes through, had sought, had hail'd</l>
						<l>All flags; I had climb'd where the storm-clouds curl'd,</l>
						<l>And call'd through the awful arch'd domes of the world.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I saw her one moment, then fell back abash'd,</l>
						<l>And fill'd full to the throat. ... Then I turn'd me once more,</l>
						<l>So glad, to the sea, while the level sun flash'd</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-147" n="141"/>

						<l>On the far snowy Alps. ... Her breast!--why, her breast</l>
						<l>Was white as twin pillows that lure you to rest.</l>
						<l>Her sloping limbs moved like to melodies told,</l>
						<l>As she rose from the sea, and threw back the gold</l>
						<l>Of her glorious hair, and set face to the shore. ...</l>
						<l>I knew her! I knew her, though we had not met</l>
						<l>Since the far stars sang to the sun's first set.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How long I had sought her! I had hunger'd, nor ate</l>
						<l>Of any sweet fruits. I had tasted not one</l>
						<l>Of all the fair glories grown under the sun.</l>
						<l>I had sought only her. Yea, I knew well that she</l>
						<l>Had come upon earth, and stood waiting for me</l>
						<l>Somewhere by my way. But the pathways of Fate</l>
						<l>They had led otherwhere; the round world round,</l>
						<l>The far North seas and the near profound</l>
						<l>Had fail'd me for aye. Now I stood by that sea</l>
						<l>Where she bathed in her beauty, all dreamily.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I spake not, but caught at my breath; I did raise</l>
						<l>My face to fair heaven to give God praise</l>
						<l>That at last, ere the ending of Time, we two</l>
						<l>Had touch'd upon earth at the same sweet place. ...</l>
						<l>Yea, we never had met upon earth at all;</l>
						<l>Never, since ages ere Adam's fall,</l>
						<l>Had we two met in the fulness of soul,</l>
						<l>Where two are as one, but had wander'd on through</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-148" n="142"/>

						<l>The spheres, divided, where planets roll</l>
						<l>Unnamed and in darkness through limitless space.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Was it well with my love? Was she true? Was she brave</l>
						<l>With virtue's own valour? Was she waiting for me?</l>
						<l>Oh, how fared my love? Had she home? Had she bread?</l>
						<l>Had she known but the touch of the warm-temper'd wave?</l>
						<l>Was she born upon earth with a crown on her head,</l>
						<l>Or born, like myself, but a dreamer instead? ...</l>
						<l>So long it had been! So long! Why, the sea--</l>
						<l>That wrinkled and surly, old, time-temper'd slave--</l>
						<l>Had been born, had his revels, grown wrinkled and hoar</l>
						<l>Since I last saw my love on that uttermost shore.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Oh, how fared my love? Once I lifted my face,</l>
						<l>And I shook back my hair and look'd out on the sea;</l>
						<l>I press'd my hot palms as I stood in my place,</l>
						<l>And cried "Oh, I come like a king to your side</l>
						<l>Though all hell intervene!"... "Hist! she may be a bride,</l>
						<l>A mother at peace, with sweet babes on her knee!</l>
						<l>A babe at her breast and a spouse at her side!--</l>
						<l>Have I wander'd too long, and has Destiny</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-149" n="143"/>

						<l>Set mortal between us?" I buried my face</l>
						<l>In my hands, and I moan'd as I stood in my place.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Twas her year to be young. She was tall, she was fair--</l>
						<l>Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there?</l>
						<l>Twas her year to be young. She was queenly and tall;</l>
						<l>And I felt she was true, as I lifted my face</l>
						<l>And saw her press down her rich robe to its place,</l>
						<l>With a hand white and small as a babe's with a doll.</l>
						<l>And her feet!--why, her feet in the white shining sand</l>
						<l>Were so small, 'twas a wonder the maiden could stand.</l>
						<l>Then she push'd back her hair with a round hand that shone</l>
						<l>And flash'd in the light with a white starry stone.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then my love she is rich! My love she is fair!</l>
						<l>Is she pure as the snow on the Alps over there?</l>
						<l>She is gorgeous with wealth! "Thank God, she has bread,"</l>
						<l>I.said to myself. Then I humbled my head</l>
						<l>In gratitude deep. Then I question'd me where</l>
						<l>Was her palace, her parents? What name did she bear?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-150" n="144"/>

						<l>What mortal on earth came nearest her heart? i</l>
						<l>Who touch'd the small hand till it thrill'd to a smart?</l>
						<l>'Twas her year to be young. She was proud, she was fair--</l>
						<l>Was she pure as the snow on the Alps over there?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>She loosen'd her robe that was blue like the sea,</l>
						<l>And silken and soft as a baby's new born.</l>
						<l>And my heart it leap'd light as the sunlight at morn</l>
						<l>At the sight of my love in her proud purity,</l>
						<l>As she rose like a Naiad half-robed from the sea.</l>
						<l>As careless, as calm as a queen can be,</l>
						<l>She loosed and let fall all the raiment of blue,</l>
						<l>As she drew a white robe in a melody</l>
						<l>Of her moving white limbs, while between the two,</l>
						<l>Like a rift in a cloud, shone her fair form through.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then she turn'd, reach'd a hand; then a tall gondolier</l>
						<l>Who had lean'd on his oar, like a long lifted spear,</l>
						<l>Shot sudden and swift and all silently,</l>
						<l>And drew to her side as she turn'd from the tide.</l>
						<l>It was odd, such a thing, and I counted it queer</l>
						<l>That a princess like this, whether virgin or bride,</l>
						<l>Should abide thus apart as she bathed in that sea;</l>
						<l>And I shook back my hair, and so unsatisfied!</l>
						<l>Then I flutter'd the doves that were perch'd close about,</l>
						<l>As I strode up and down in dismay and in doubt.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-151" n="145"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Then she stood in the boat on the borders of night</l>
						<l>As a goddess might stand on that far wonder-land</l>
						<l>Of eternal sweet life, which men misname Death.</l>
						<l>I turn'd to the sea, and I caught at my breath</l>
						<l>As she crouch'd in the boat, and her white baby hand</l>
						<l>Held her vestment of purple, imperial and white.</l>
						<l>Then the gondola shot,--swift, sharp from the shore:</l>
						<l>There was never the sound of a song or of oar,</l>
						<l>But the doves hurried home in white clouds to Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>Where the brass horses plunged their high manes in the dark.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then I cried: "Quick! Follow her! Follow her! Fast!</l>
						<l>Come, thrice double fare, if you follow her true</l>
						<l>To her own palace door!" There was plashing of oar</l>
						<l>And rattle of rowlock. ... I sat leaning low,</l>
						<l>Looking far in the dark, looking out as we sped</l>
						<l>With my soul all alert, bending down, leaning so ...</l>
						<l>But only the oaths of the men as we pass'd,</l>
						<l>When we jostled them sharp as we sudden shot through</l>
						<l>The watery town. Then a deep, distant roar--</l>
						<l>The rattle of rowlock, the rush of the oar.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>We rock'd and we rode: then the oars keeping pace</l>
						<l>Gave stroke for short stroke in the swift stormy chase.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-152" n="146"/>


						<l>I lifted my face, and lo! far, fitfully</l>
						<l>The heavens breathed lightning: it did lift and fall</l>
						<l>As if angels were parting God's curtains. Then deep</l>
						<l>And indolent-like, and as if half asleep,</l>
						<l>As if half made angry to move at all,</l>
						<l>The thunder moved. It confronted me.</l>
						<l>It stood like an avalanche poised on a hill:</l>
						<l>I saw its black brows. I heard it stand still.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The pent sea throbb'd as if rack'd with pain.</l>
						<l>Then the black clouds rose and suddenly rode,</l>
						<l>As a fiery rider that knows no rein,</l>
						<l>Right into the town. Then the thunder strode</l>
						<l>As a giant striding from star unto star,</l>
						<l>Then turn'd upon earth and frantically came,</l>
						<l>Shaking the hollow heaven. And far</l>
						<l>And near red lightning in ribbon and skein</l>
						<l>Did seam and furrow the cloud with flame,</l>
						<l>And write upon heaven Jehovah's name.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then lightnings came weaving like shuttle-cocks</l>
						<l>Weaving black raiment of clouds for death.</l>
						<l>The mute doves flew to Saint Mark in flocks,</l>
						<l>And men stood leaning with gather'd breath.</l>
						<l>Black gondolas flew then as never before,</l>
						<l>And drew like crocodiles up on the shore;</l>
						<l>And vessels at sea stood further at sea,</l>
						<l>And seamen haul'd down with a bended knee,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-153" n="147"/>

						<l>And canvas came down to left and to right,</l>
						<l>And ships stood stripp'd as if stripp'd for fight!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then we flew by a great house hurriedly,</l>
						<l>With its four walls wash'd by the foamy sea;</l>
						<l>'Twas the place where Shelley was wont to be.</l>
						<l>I heard in the heavens the howlings of men;</l>
						<l>High up in the dark I did hear men shout;</l>
						<l>And I lifted my eyes as the lightnings fell,</l>
						<l>And I saw hands thrust through the bars; and then</l>
						<l>I knew 'twas the madhouse howling at me:</l>
						<l>So doleful, so lone! Like a land cast out,</l>
						<l>And awful as Lucifer throned in hell.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then an oath. Then a prayer. Then a gust that made rents</l>
						<l>Through the yellow-sail'd fishers. Then suddenly</l>
						<l>Came sharp-fork'd fire! Then again thunder fell</l>
						<l>Like the great first gun! Ah, then there was rout</l>
						<l>Of ships like the breaking of regiments,</l>
						<l>And shouts as if hurl'd from an upper hell.</l>
						<l>Then tempest! It lifted, it spun us about,</l>
						<l>Then shot us ahead through the hills of the sea</l>
						<l>As if a great arrow shot shoreward in wars--</l>
						<l>Then the storm split open till I saw the blown stars.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>On! on! through the foam, through the storm, through the town.</l>
						<l>She was gone! She was lost in the wilderness</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-154" n="148"/>

						<l>Of palaces, lifting their marbles of snow.</l>
						<l>I stood in my gondola. Up and all down</l>
						<l>I push'd through the surge of the salt-flood street</l>
						<l>Above me, below. ... 'Twas only the beat</l>
						<l>Of the sea's sad heart. ... Then I heard below</l>
						<l>The water-rat building, and nothing but that;</l>
						<l>Not even the sea-bird screaming distress,</l>
						<l>As she lost her way in that wilderness.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I listen'd all night. I caught at each sound;</l>
						<l>I clutch'd and I caught as a man that drown'd--</l>
						<l>Only the sullen, low growl of the sea</l>
						<l>Far out the flood-street at the edge of the ships:</l>
						<l>Only the billow slow licking his lips,</l>
						<l>Like a dog that lay crouching there watching for me--</l>
						<l>Growling and showing white teeth all the night,</l>
						<l>Reaching his neck and as ready to bite:</l>
						<l>Only the waves with their salt-flood tears</l>
						<l>Sad fawning white stones of a thousand years:</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Only the birds in the loftiness</l>
						<l>Of column and dome and of glittering spire</l>
						<l>That thrust to heaven and held the fire</l>
						<l>Of the thunder still; the bird's distress</l>
						<l>As he struck his wings in that wilderness,</l>
						<l>On marbles that speak, and thrill, and inspire.--</l>
						<l>The night below and the night above;</l>
						<l>The water-rat building, the startled white dove;</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-155" n="149"/>

						<l>That wide-wing'd, dolorous sea-bird's call,</l>
						<l>The water-rat building,--but that was all.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Silent and slowly, all up and all down,</l>
						<l>I row'd and I row'd me for many an hour,</l>
						<l>By beetling palace and toppling tower,</l>
						<l>In the dark and the deep of the watery town.</l>
						<l>Only the water-rat building by stealth,</l>
						<l>Only the sea-bird astray in his flight</l>
						<l>As he struck his wings in the clouds of night,</l>
						<l>On spires that sprang from old Adria's wealth;</l>
						<l>On marbles that move with their eloquence,</l>
						<l>On statues all sweeter than utterance.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Lo! pushing the darkness from pillar to post,</l>
						<l>The morning came silent and grey like a ghost</l>
						<l>Slow up the canal. I lean'd from the prow</l>
						<l>And listen'd. Not even the bird in distress</l>
						<l>Screaming above through the wilderness;</l>
						<l>Not even the stealthy old water-rat now.</l>
						<l>Only the bell in the fisherman's tower,</l>
						<l>Slow tolling at sea and telling the hour</l>
						<l>To kneel to their sweet Santa Barbara</l>
						<l>For tawny fishers at sea, and pray.</l>

					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">H</hi>IGH over my head, carved cornice, quaint spire,</l>
						<l>And ancient-built palaces knock'd their grey brows</l>
						<l>Together and frown'd. The slow-creeping scows</l>
						<l>Scraped the wall on each side. High over, the fire</l>
						<l>Of sudden-born morning came flaming in bars;</l>
						<l>While up through the chasm I could count the stars.</l>
						<l>My God! Such damp ruin! The dank smell of death</l>
						<l>Crept up the canal: I could scarce take my breath!</l>
						<l>'Twas the fit place for pirates, for women who keep</l>
						<l>Contagion of body and soul where they sleep. ...</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Great heavens! A white hand then beckon'd to me</l>
						<l>From an old mouldy door, and almost in my reach.</l>
						<l>I sprang to the sill as one wreck'd to a beach;</l>
						<l>I sprang with wide arms: it was she! it was she! ...</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-157" n="151"/>

						<l>In such a damn'd place! And what was her trade?</l>
						<l>To think I had follow'd, so faithful, so far</l>
						<l>From eternity's brink, from star to white star,</l>
						<l>To find her, to find her, nor wife nor sweet maid!</l>
						<l>To find her a shameless poor creature of shame,</l>
						<l>A nameless, lost body, men hardly dare name.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>All alone in her pride, on that damp dismal floor</l>
						<l>She stood to entice me. ... I bow'd me before</l>
						<l>All-conquering beauty. I call'd her my queen.</l>
						<l>I told her my love as I proudly had told</l>
						<l>My love had I found her as pure as pure gold.</l>
						<l>I reach'd her my hand, as fearless a man</l>
						<l>As man fronting cannon. I cried, "Come you forth</l>
						<l>To the sun! There are lands to the south, to the north,</l>
						<l>Anywhere where you will. Dash the shame from your brow;</l>
						<l>Come with me, for ever; and come with me now!"</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Why, I had turn'd pirate for her! I had seen</l>
						<l>Ships burn'd from the seas, like to stubble from field.</l>
						<l>Would I now forsake her? Why should I now yield,</l>
						<l>When she needed me most? Had I found her a queen,</l>
						<l>And beloved by the world,--why, what had I done?</l>
						<l>I had woo'd her, and woo'd her, and woo'd till I won!</l>
						<l>Then, if I had loved her with gold and fair fame,</l>
						<l>Would not I now love her, and love her the same?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-158" n="152"/>

						<l>My soul hath a pride. I would tear out my heart</l>
						<l>And cast it to dogs, could it play such a part.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I told her all things. Her brow took a frown;</l>
						<l>Her grand Titan beauty, so tall, so serene,</l>
						<l>The one perfect woman, mine own idol queen--</l>
						<l>Her proud swelling bosom, it broke up and down:</l>
						<l>Then she spake, and she shook in her soul as she said,</l>
						<l>With her small hands held to her bent, aching head:</l>
						<l>"Go back to the world! go back and alone!</l>
						<l>Thou strange, stormy soul, as intense as mine own!</l>
						<l>I said: "I will wait! I will wait in the pass</l>
						<l>Of death, until Time he shall break his glass!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Don't you know me, my bride of the white world before?</l>
						<l>Why, don't you remember the white milky-way</l>
						<l>Of stars, that we traversed the eons through? ...</l>
						<l>We were counting the colours, we were naming the seas</l>
						<l>Of the vaster ones. You remember the trees</l>
						<l>That sway'd in the cloudy white heavens, and bore</l>
						<l>Bright crystals of sweets, and the sweet manna-dew?</l>
						<l>Why, you smile as you weep, and you blush once more,</l>
						<l>And your bright eyes speak, and you know me! Yea,</l>
						<l>You know me as if 'twere but yesterday!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Now, here in the lands where the gods did love,</l>
						<l>Where the white Europa was won,--she rode</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-159" n="153"/>

						<l>Her milk-white bull through these same warm seas,--</l>
						<l>Yea, here in the lands where the Hercules,</l>
						<l>With the lion's heart and the heart of the dove,</l>
						<l>Did walk in his naked great strength, and strode</l>
						<l>In the sensuous air with his lion's skin</l>
						<l>Flapping and fretting his knotted thews;</l>
						<l>Where Theseus did wander, and Jason cruise,--</l>
						<l>Lo! here let the life of all lives begin.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Yea! here where the Orient balms blow in,</l>
						<l>Where heaven is kindest, where all God's blue</l>
						<l>Seems a great gate open'd to welcome you,--</l>
						<l>Come, rise and go forth, and forget your sin!"...</l>
						<l>Then rose her great heart, so grander far</l>
						<l>Than I had believed on that outermost star;</l>
						<l>And she put by her tears, and calmly she said,</l>
						<l>With hands held low and with bended head:</l>
						<l>"Go thou through the doors of death, and wait</l>
						<l>For me on the innermost side of the gate.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"It is breaking my heart; but 'tis best," she said.</l>
						<l>"Thank God that this life is but a day's span,</l>
						<l>But a wayside inn for weary, worn man--</l>
						<l>A night and a day; and, to-morrow, the spell</l>
						<l>Of darkness is broken. Now, darling, farewell! ...</l>
						<l>Nay, touch not the hem of my robe!--it is red</l>
						<l>With sins that your own sex heap'd on my head!</l>
						<l>Now go, love, go! But remember this plan,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-160" n="154"/>

						<l>That whoever dies first is to sit down and wait</l>
						<l>Inside Death's door, and watch at the gate."</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Then I grew nobler. Yea, I grew so tall</l>
						<l>I could almost reach to the golden hair</l>
						<l>Of that poor, pitiful outcast there.</l>
						<l>I did let my mantle of self-love fall,</l>
						<l>And I stood all naked, so weak, so small,</l>
						<l>I wonder'd that I could ever now dare</l>
						<l>Lift up my prayer to Heaven at all. ...</l>
						<l>And I accepted her lesson. I said,</l>
						<l>With hands clasp'd down and declining head,</l>
						<l>"I will go, I will wait by the gates of the dead.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"And you, O woman! go patient on through</l>
						<l>The course that man hath compell'd you to;</l>
						<l>Then back to your mother, the earth, my love;</l>
						<l>Go, press to her bosom your beautiful brow,</l>
						<l>Till it blends with her clay, and so purifies</l>
						<l>Your flesh of the stains that so sully it now:</l>
						<l>Lie down in the loam, the populous loam,</l>
						<l>Yea, sleep but a day with death; then rise</l>
						<l>As white, as light as the wings of a dove,--</l>
						<l>And so made holy, oh love, come home!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Farewell for all time! And now," I said,</l>
						<l>"What thing upon earth have I left to do?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-161" n="155"/>

						<l>"Why, I shall go down through the gates of the dead,</l>
						<l>And wait for your coming your brief life through--</l>
						<l>As you have commanded, lo! I will obey.</l>
						<l>I shall sit, I shall wait for you, love, alway;</l>
						<l>I shall wait by the side of the gate for you,</l>
						<l>Waiting, and counting the days as I wait;</l>
						<l>Yea, wait as that beggar that sat by the gate</l>
						<l>Of Jerusalem, waiting the Judgment Day."</l>

							<l>And kept his course with head held high,</l>
							<l>As if he strode his deck and drew</l>

						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l rend="ti-1">Within the island's heart 'tis said,</l>

						<p><hi rend="sc">NOTE</hi>.--This story, if story it is, I learned from the lips of
							Mountain Joe, of Utah. The desert is certainly the bed of a dried-up sea, of which
							Great Salt Lake is a northern remnant. Indeed, as you look across Salt Lake to the
							west, you can see on the mountain side, fifty feet above the present water level, a
							well-defined sea shore.</p>
						<p>The Ship in the Desert is counted a veritable fact by many good men. I have been on
							the borders of this desert, but further than some old bits of battered copper, I am
							bound to say that I found no evidence of its existence. But the late Colonel Evans, of
							California, a man much respected, and author of a work on this subject, told me that
							by the aid of a powerful field-glass, and under a peculiarly favourable light, he had
							seen the ship. My honest opinion is that it was but the mirage.</p>

					<head rend="center">A DOVE OF ST. MARK.</head>
					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">T</hi>HE high-born, beautiful snow came down,</l>
						<l>Silent and soft as the terrible feet</l>
						<l>Of Time on the mosses of ruins. Sweet</l>
						<l>Was the Christmas time in the watery town.</l>
						<l>'Twas a kind of carnival swell'd the sea</l>
						<l>Of Venice that night, and canal and quay</l>
						<l>Were alive with humanity. Man and maid,</l>
						<l>Glad in their revel and masquerade,</l>
						<l>Moved through the feathery snow in the night,</l>
						<l>And shook black locks as they laugh'd outright.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>From Santa Maggiore, and to and fro,</l>
						<l>And ugly and black as if devils cast out,</l>
						<l>Black streaks through the night in the soft, white snow,</l>
						<l>The steel-prow'd gondolas paddled about:</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-238" n="232"/>

						<l>There was only the sound of the long oars' dip,</l>
						<l>As the low moon sail'd up the sea like a ship</l>
						<l>In a misty morn. Then the low moon rose</l>
						<l>Veil'd and vast, through the feathery snows,</l>
						<l>As a minstrel stept silent and sad from his boat,</l>
						<l>His mantle held tight in his hand to his throat.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Grim lion," said he, "of grand St. Mark,</l>
						<l>Down under your wings on the edge of the sea</l>
						<l>In the dim of the lamps, on the rim of the dark,</l>
						<l>Alone I shall sit in your salt-flood town.</l>
						<l>O King on your column, so sullenly,</l>
						<l>Wrinkle your brows and tumble your mane!</l>
						<l>But the spouse turns not to his bride again."</l>
						<l>Like a signal light through the night let down,</l>
						<l>Then a far star fell through the dim profound,</l>
						<l>As a jewel that slipp'd God's hand to the ground.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Heavens! how beautiful! Up and down,</l>
						<l>Alone and in couples, girls glide and pass,</l>
						<l>Silent and dreamy, as if seen in a glass,</l>
						<l>And mask'd to the eyes, in their Adrian town.</l>
						<l>Such women! It breaks one's heart to think.</l>
						<l>Water! and never a drop to drink!</l>
						<l>What types of Titian! What glory of hair!</l>
						<l>How tall as the sisters of Saul! How fair!</l>
						<l>Sweet flowers of flesh all blossoming,</l>
						<l>As if 'twere Eden and Eden's spring.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-239" n="233"/>

					<lg>
						<l>"They are talking aloud with all their eyes,</l>
						<l>Yet passing me by with never one word.</l>
						<l>O pouting sweet lips, do you know there are lies</l>
						<l>That are told with the eyes, and never once heard</l>
						<l>Above a heart's beat when the soul is stirr'd?</l>
						<l>It is time to fly home, O dove of St. Mark!</l>
						<l>Take boughs of the olive; bear these to your ark,</l>
						<l>And rest and be glad, for the seas and the skies</l>
						<l>Of Venice are fair. ... What! never a home?</l>
						<l>What! stained and despised as the soil'd sea-foam?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"And who then are you? You look so fair!</l>
						<l>Your sweet child-face, as a rose half-blown,</l>
						<l>From under your black and abundant hair? ...</l>
						<l>A child of the street, and unloved and alone!</l>
						<l>Unloved and alone? ... There is something then</l>
						<l>Between us two that is not unlike! ...</l>
						<l>The strength and the purposes of men</l>
						<l>Fall broken idols. We aim and strike</l>
						<l>With high-born zeal and with proud intent,</l>
						<l>Yet all things turn on an accident. ...</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Nay, I'll not preach. Time's lessons pass</l>
						<l>Like twilight's swallows. They chirp in their flight,</l>
						<l>And who takes heed of the wasting glass?</l>
						<l>Night follows day, and day follows night,</l>
						<l>And no thing rises on earth but to fall</l>
						<l>Like leaves, with their lessons most sad and fit.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-240" n="234"/>

						<l>They are spread like a volume each year to all:</l>
						<l>Yet men nor women learn aught of it,</l>
						<l>Or after it all, but a weariness</l>
						<l>Of soul and body and untold distress.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Yea, sit, sweet child, by my side, and we,</l>
						<l>We will talk of the world. Nay, let my hand</l>
						<l>Run round your waist, and, so, let your face</l>
						<l>Fall down on my shoulder, and you shall be</l>
						<l>My dream of sweet Italy. Here in this place,</l>
						<l>Alone in the crowds of this old careless land,</l>
						<l>I will mantle your form till the morn, and then--</l>
						<l>Why, I shall return to the world and to men,</l>
						<l>And no whit stain'd for the one kind word</l>
						<l>Which only you and the night may have heard.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Fear nothing for me, for I shall not fear.</l>
						<l>The day, my darling, comes after the night.</l>
						<l>The nights? they were made to show the light</l>
						<l>Of the stars in heaven, though the storms be near. ..</l>
						<l>Do you see that figure of Fortune up there,</l>
						<l>That tops the Dogana with toe a-tip</l>
						<l>Of the great gold ball? Her scroll is a-trip</l>
						<l>To the turning winds. She is light as the air.</l>
						<l>Well, trust to Fortune. ... Bread on the wave</l>
						<l>Turns ever ashore to the hand that gave.</l>

					<pb id="VAA9497-241" n="235"/>

					<lg>
						<l>What am I? A poet--a lover of all</l>
						<l>That is lovely to see. Nay, naught shall befall. ...</l>
						<l>Yes, I am a failure. I plot and I plan,</l>
						<l>Give splendid advice to my fellow-man,</l>
						<l>Yet ever fall short of achievement. ... Ah me!</l>
						<l>In my life's early, sad afternoon,</l>
						<l>Say, what have I left but a love, or a rune,</l>
						<l>A hand reach'd out to a soul at sea,</l>
						<l>Or fair, forbidden, sweet fruit to choose,</l>
						<l>That 'twere sin to touch, and--sin to refuse?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"What! I to go home with you, girl, to-night?</l>
						<l>To nestle you down and to call you love?</l>
						<l>Well, that were a fancy! To feed a dove,</l>
						<l>A poor, soil'd dove of this dear Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>Too frighten'd for rest and too weary for flight.</l>
						<l>Nay, nay, my sister; in spite of you,</l>
						<l>Sister and tempter, I will be true. ...</l>
						<l>Now here 'neath the lion, alone in the dark,</l>
						<l>Side by side we will sit, my dear,</l>
						<l>Breathing the beauty as an atmosphere. ...</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"We will talk of your poets, of their tales of love. ...</l>
						<l>What! cannot read? Why, you never heard then</l>
						<l>Of your Desdemona, nor the daring men</l>
						<l>Who died for her love? My poor white dove!</l>
						<l>There's a story of Shylock would drive you wild.</l>
						<l>What! never heard aught of your poets, my child?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-242" n="236"/>

						<l>Of Tasso, of Petrarch? Not the Bridge of Sighs?</l>
						<l>Not the tale of Ferrara? Nor the thousand whys</l>
						<l>That your Venice was ever adored above</l>
						<l>All other fair lands for her songs of love?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"What then about Shylock? 'Twas gold. Yes-- dead.</l>
						<l>The lady? 'Twas love. .. Why, yes; she too</l>
						<l>Is dead. And Byron? 'Twas fame. Ah, true. ..</l>
						<l>Tasso and Petrarch? They perish'd the same. ..</l>
						<l>Yes, so endeth all, as you well have said. ..</l>
						<l>Now you, poor girl, are too wise, and you,</l>
						<l>Too sudden, sad child, in your hard, ugly youth,</l>
						<l>Have stumbled face fronting an obstinate truth.</l>
						<l>For whether for love, for gold, or for fame,</l>
						<l>They but lived their day, and they died the same.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"But talk not of death: of death, or the life</l>
						<l>That comes after death. 'Tis beyond your reach,</l>
						<l>And this too much thought has a sense of strife ...</l>
						<l>Ay, true; I promised you not to preach ...</l>
						<l>My maid of Venice, or maid unmade,</l>
						<l>Lie still on my bosom. Be not afraid.</l>
						<l>What! Say you are hungry? Well, let us dine</l>
						<l>Till the near morn comes on the silver shine</l>
						<l>Of the lamp-lit sea. At dawn of day,</l>
						<l>Child of the street, you can go your way.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-243" n="237"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Your mother's palace? I know your town;</l>
						<l>Know every nook of it, left and right,</l>
						<l>As well as yourself. For up and down</l>
						<l>Your salt-flood streets, for many a night,</l>
						<l>I have row'd and roved with a lady fair,</l>
						<l>As the face of heaven. Nay, I know there</l>
						<l>Is no such a palace. What! you dare</l>
						<l>To look in my face, to lie outright,</l>
						<l>To bend your brows, and to frown me down?</l>
						<l>There is no such place in that part of the town! ...</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"What! woo me away to your rickety boat,</l>
						<l>To pick my pockets, to cut my throat,</l>
						<l>With help of your pirates? Then throw me out,</l>
						<l>Loaded with stones to sink me down,</l>
						<l>Down into the filth and the dregs of your town?</l>
						<l>Why, that is your damnable aim, no doubt!</l>
						<l>And, beautiful child, you seem too fair,</l>
						<l>Too young, for even a thought like that;</l>
						<l>Too young for even the soul to dare--</l>
						<l>Ay, even the serpent to whisper at.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Now, there is such a thing as being true</l>
						<l>Even in villany. Listen to me:</l>
						<l>Black-skinn'd women and low-brow'd men,</l>
						<l>And desperate robbers and thieves; and then,</l>
						<l>Why, there are the pirates! .. Ay, pirates reform'd--</l>

						<l>Well, pardon me, girl,--but I know you lie.</l>
					</lg>
					
					<lg>
						<l>"Tut, tut, my beauty! What trickery now?</l>
						<l>Why, tears through your hair on my hand like rain!</l>
						<l>Come! look in my face: laugh, lie again</l>
						<l>With your wonderful eyes. Lift up your brow;</l>
						<l>Laugh in the face of the world, and defy. ...</l>
						<l>Now, come! This lying is no new thing.</l>
						<l>The wearers of laces know well how to lie;</l>
						<l>As well, ay, better, than you or I. ...</l>
						<l>They lie for fortune, for fame: instead,</l>
						<l>You, child of the street, only lie for your bread.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>... "Some sounds blow in from the distant land.</l>
						<l>The bells strike sharp, and as out of tune,</l>
						<l>Some sudden, short notes. To the east and afar,</l>
						<l>And up from the sea, there is lifting a star</l>
						<l>As large, my beautiful child, and as white</l>
						<l>And as lovely to see as your still little hand.</l>

						<l>And not one gondola frets the lagoon.</l>
						<l>See! Away to the east--'tis the face of morn.</l>
						<l>Hear! Away to the west--'tis the fisherman's horn.</l>

						<l>For each must barter for bread to eat</l>
						<l>In a world of trade and an age of gain;</l>
						<l>With just this difference, child of the street:</l>
						<l>You sell your body, I sell my brain.</l>

						<l>"Poor child, what a wreck! Lo, here you reel,</l>

						<l>Nay, I shall be purer and better then;</l>
						<l>For, child of the street, you, living or dead,</l>

						<l>Ten thousand times than the world of men,</l>
						<l>Who but reach you a hand to lead you astray.--</l>
						<l>But the dawn is upon us! Rise, go your way.</l>

						<l>I have lights, and a leg--short a leg, as you see;</l>

					<pb id="VAA9497-255" n="249"/>

					<lg>
						<l>"Look you there! Do you see where the blue bended floors</l>
						<l>Of the heavens are fresco'd with stars? See the heights,</l>
						<l>Then the bent hills beneath, where the grape-growers' doors</l>
						<l>Open out and look down in a crescent of lights?</l>
						<l>Well, there I was born; grew tall. Then the call</l>
						<l>For bold men for Sicily. I rose from the vines,</l>
						<l>Shook back my long hair, look'd forth, then let fall</l>
						<l>My dull pruning-hook, and stood up in the lines.</l>
						<l>Then my young promised bride held her head to her breast</l>
						<l>As a sword trail'd the stones, and I strode with a zest.</l>
						<l>But a sable-cowl'd monk girt his gown, and look'd down</l>
						<l>With a leer in her face, as I turn'd from the town.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>"Then from yonder green hills bending down to the seas,</l>
						<l>Grouping here, grouping there, in the grey olive trees,</l>
						<l>We watch'd the slow sun; slow saw him retire</l>
						<l>At last in the sea, like a vast isle of fire.</l>
						<l>Then the Chief drew his sword: there was that in his air,</l>
						<l>As the care on his face came and went and still came,</l>
						<l>As he gazed out at sea, and yet gazed anywhere,</l>
						<l>That meant more, signor, more than a peasant can say.</l>

						<l>Glow'd red and grew large, as if fann'd to a flame,</l>

						<l>Lo! something shot up from a black-muffled ship</l>
						<l>Deep asleep in the bay, like a star gone astray:</l>

						<l>Came the troop with a zest, and--that stone tells the rest.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>"Hot times at Marsala! and then under Rome</l>
						<l>It was hell, sure enough, and a whole column fell</l>
						<l>Like new vines in a frost. Then year follow'd year,</l>
						<l>Until, stricken and sere, at last I came home--</l>
						<l>As the strife lull'd a spell, came limping back here--</l>
						<l>Stealing back to my home, limping up out of hell.</l>
						<l>But we won, did we not? Won, I scarcely know what--</l>
						<l>Yet the whole land is free from the Alps to the sea--</l>
						<l>Ah! my young promised bride? Christ! that cuts!</l>

						<l>When the guard led me forth, and the judge sat to scan</l>
						<l>My hands and my strength, and to question me sore:</l>
						<l>'Why, what has the match-man to do with all this,--</l>

						<l>Saw rainbows that compass'd a world in their reach;</l>
						<l>I saw my beloved go down on the beach;</l>

						<l>I can but dream of thee to-day.</l>
						<l>But dream? Oh! I could kneel and pray</l>

						<l>Leads ever on my lonesome way,</l>
						<l>And will not pass--yet will not stay.</l>
					</lg>

						<l>I dream'd we roam'd in elden land;</l>
						<l>I saw you walk in splendid state,</l>
						<l>With lifted head and heart elate,</l>
						<l>And lilies in your white right hand,</l>
						<l>Beneath the proud Saint Peter's dome</l>
						<l>That, silent, lords almighty Rome.</l>

						<l>A diamond star was in your hair,</l>
						<l>Your garments were of gold and snow;</l>
						<l>And men did turn and marvel so,</l>
						<l>And men did say, How matchless fair!</l>
						<l>And all men follow'd as you pass'd;</l>
						<l>But I came silent, lone, and last.</l>

						<l>And holy men in sable gown,</l>

						<l>Did look to thee, and then to God.</l>
						<l>They cross'd themselves, with heads held down;</l>
						<l>They chid themselves, for fear that they</l>
						<l>Should, seeing thee, forget to pray.</l>

						<l>Men pass'd, men spake in wooing words;</l>
						<l>Men pass'd, ten thousand in a line.</l>
						<l>You stood before the sacred shrine,</l>
						<l>You stood as if you had not heard.</l>
						<l>And then you turn'd in calm command,</l>
						<l>And laid two lilies in my hand.</l>

					<lg>
						<l>O Lady, if by sea or land</l>
						<l>You yet might weary of all men,</l>
						<l>And turn unto your singer then,</l>
						<l>And lay one lily in his hand,</l>
						<l>Lo! I would follow true and far</l>
						<l>As seamen track the polar star.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>My soul is young, my heart is strong;</l>
						<l>O Lady, reach a hand to day,</l>

						<l>Yea, I am of the kings of thought,</l>

						<l>With high-held wings and tailwhipp'd back,</l>
						<l>Foot on the Bible as if thy track</l>
						<l>Led thee the lord of the desert again,--</l>
						<l>Say, what of thy watch o'er the watery town?</l>
						<l>Say, what of the worlds walking up and down?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>O silent old monarch that tops Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>That sat thy throne for a thousand years,</l>
						<l>That lorded the deep, that defied all men,--</l>
						<l>Lo! I see visions at sea in the dark;</l>
						<l>And I see something that shines like tears,</l>
						<l>And I hear something that sounds like sighs,</l>
						<l>And I hear something that sounds as when</l>
						<l>A great soul suffers and sinks and dies.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Say, where is my beauty? Oh, where is my bride</l>
						<l>Of the old, dear days, ere the gleaming snows</l>
						<l>Sat tent on the Alps, and the poppies red</l>
						<l>In the golden days were my bridal bed?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-268" n="262"/>

						<l>Oh, bring me my bride where the white sea flows,</l>
						<l>And the yellow sails blow to the Lido's side.</l>
						<l>I lift you my hands and I pray to you;</l>
						<l>I name you my saint for this whole year through.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Sphinx-like lion, art prophet, or what?</l>
						<l>But, king of the desert or slave of the sea,</l>
						<l>What thou hast been or what shalt be,</l>
						<l>What thou art now or what art not,</l>
						<l>Lead me and land me on some sweet shore,</l>
						<l>Some new-wash'd summit where olives are green,</l>
						<l>And never the visage of sorrow is seen</l>
						<l>For ever and ever and evermore.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>To the Isles of the Blest, or the Isles of Greece,</l>
						<l>And on and beyond, where the great moon's face</l>
						<l>Bends low and large to the golden grain</l>
						<l>The whole year through; where death nor pain,</l>
						<l>Nor any hard thought has name or place,--</l>
						<l>To the land of olives, to the land of peace.</l>
						<l>Lead me and land me, oh, that were best,</l>
						<l>To the land of love and the land of rest.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Is there rest upon earth? Ah, brazen king,</l>
						<l>Say! King of Assyria, set king of the sea,</l>
						<l>Set a-top of the town with glittering wing,</l>
						<l>Now what do you read from the prophecy?</l>
						<l>And what says thy book? And what were best?</l>
						<l>Oh say, from thy pulpit set high in the air,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-269" n="263"/>

						<l>When is the harvest of love, and where?</l>
						<l>And where is my love, and when is the rest?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Floating in flood of salt sea-foam,</l>
						<l>And seeking for what? For the golden fleece?</l>
						<l>For the land of giants? For the sea-lost moon?</l>
						<l>For the land of eternal afternoon?</l>
						<l>O! wrinkled old lion that tops Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>A home on the seas were never a home.</l>
						<l>Lo! here are the doves, let this be the ark:</l>
						<l>Now where is the olive, and when is the peace?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>There are sobs of the sea, there is blown black rain.</l>
						<l>Here under the lion and alone in the dark,</l>
						<l>O say, shall I stand by this sea again?</l>
						<l>Yet, trait'rous old lion that lords Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>I curse you and hate you as ever I can;</l>
						<l>Your Bible, your book with its Rights of Man:</l>
						<l>For I named you my saint, and I pray'd to you,</l>
						<l>And where is my love, and who has been true?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>O vain old lion of lonesome Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>With cornice in fashion of blown sea-foam,</l>
						<l>High-lifted and light as white clouds in the dark,--</l>
						<l>When is the rest, and oh, where is my home?</l>
						<l>Thy brass steeds plunge through the night in stud,</l>
						<l>There are seas to the left and seas to the right,</l>
						<l>Front and aback there is nothing but flood,</l>
						<l>Nothing but billows and nothing but night.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-270" n="264"/>

					<lg>
						<l>City at sea, thou art surely an ark,</l>
						<l>Sea-blown and a-wreck in the rain and dark,</l>
						<l>Where the white sea-caps are toss'd and curl'd.</l>
						<l>Thy sins they were many--and behold the flood!</l>
						<l>And here and about us are beasts in stud.</l>
						<l>Creatures and beasts that creep and go,</l>
						<l>Enough, ay, and wicked enough I know,</l>
						<l>To populate, or devour, a world.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>O wrinkled old lion, looking down</l>
						<l>With brazen frown upon mine and me,</l>
						<l>From tower a-top of your watery town,</l>
						<l>Old king of the desert, once king of the sea:</l>
						<l>List! here is a lesson for thee to-day.</l>
						<l>Proud and immovable monarch, I say,</l>
						<l>Lo! here is a lesson to-day for thee,</l>
						<l>Of the things that were and the things to be.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Dank palaces held by the populous sea</l>
						<l>For the good dead men, all cover'd with shell,--</l>
						<l>We will pay them a visit some day; and we,</l>
						<l>We may come to love their old palaces well.</l>
						<l>Bah! toppled old columns all tumbled across,</l>
						<l>Toss'd in the waters that lift and fall,</l>
						<l>Waving in waves long masses of moss,</l>
						<l>Toppled old columns,--and that will be all.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I know you, lion of grey Saint Mark;</l>
						<l>You flutter'd all seas beneath your wing.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-271" n="265"/>

						<l>Now, over the deep, and up in the dark,</l>
						<l>High over the girdles of bright gaslight,</l>
						<l>With wings in the air as if for flight,</l>
						<l>And crouching as if about to spring</l>
						<l>From top of your granite of Africa,--</l>
						<l>Say, what shall be said of you some day?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>What shall be said, O grim Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>Savage old beast so cross'd and churl'd,</l>
						<l>By the after men from the under-world?</l>
						<l>What shall be said as they search along</l>
						<l>And sail these seas for some sign or spark</l>
						<l>Of the old dead fires of the dear old days,</l>
						<l>When men and story have gone their ways,</l>
						<l>Or even your city and name from song?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Why, sullen old monarch of still'd Saint Mark,</l>
						<l>Strange men of my West, wise-mouth'd and strong,</l>
						<l>Will come some day and, gazing long</l>
						<l>And mute with wonder, will say of thee:</l>
						<l>"This is the Saint! High over the dark,</l>
						<l>Foot on the Bible and great teeth bare,</l>
						<l>Tail whipp'd back and teeth in the air--</l>
						<l>Lo! this is the Saint, and none but he!"</l>

					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">I</hi> AM as lone as lost winds on the height;</l>
						<l>As lone as yonder leaning moon at night,</l>
						<l>That climbs, like some sad, noiseless-footed nun,</l>
						<l>Far up against the steep and starry height,</l>
						<l>As if on holy mission. Yea, as one</l>
						<l>That knows no ark, or isle, or resting-place,</l>
						<l>Or chronicle of time, or wheeling sun,</l>
						<l>I drive for ever on through endless space.</l>
						<l>Like some lone bird in everlasting flight,</l>
						<l>My lonesome soul sails on through seas of night.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Alone in sounding hollows of the sea;</l>
						<l>Alone on lifted, heaving hills of foam:</l>
						<l>To never rest; to ever rise and roam</l>
						<l>Where never kind or kindred soul may be;</l>
						<l>To roam where ships of commerce never ride,</l>
						<l>Sail on, and so forget the rest of shore;</l>
						<l>To hear the waves complain, as if they died;</l>
						<l>To see the vast waves heave for evermore;</l>
						<l>To know that no ships cross or measure these,</l>
						<l>My shoreless, strange, and most uncommon seas.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-273" n="267"/>

					<lg>
						<l>Oh! who art thou, veil'd shape? My soul cries out</l>
						<l>Through mist and storm. Lean thou to me!</l>
						<l>Come nearer, thou, that I may feel and see</l>
						<l>Thy wounded side, and so forget all doubt!</l>
						<l>How terrible the night! I kneel to thee;</l>
						<l>I clasp thy knees: would clamber to thy hair.</l>
						<l>As one shipwreck'd on some broad, broken sea,</l>
						<l>Through intermingled oaths and awful shout,</l>
						<l>Uplifts white hands and prays in his despair,--</l>
						<l>So now my curses break into a prayer.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The long days through I sit and sigh, alas!</l>
						<l>For love! Lone, beggar-like, beside the way</l>
						<l>I sit forlorn in lanes where Day must pass.</l>
						<l>I stretch imploring palms towards the Day,</l>
						<l>And cry, "O Day! but give me love! I die</l>
						<l>For love! I let all other gifts go by.</l>
						<l>Yea, bring me but one love that runs to waste,</l>
						<l>One love that men pass by in heedless haste,</l>
						<l>And I will kiss thy feet and ask no more</l>
						<l>From all To-morrow's rich, mysterious store."</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>The drear days mock me in my mute request;</l>
						<l>The dark years roll like breakers on the shore,</l>
						<l>And die in futile thunder. As in jest,</l>
						<l>They bring bright, empty shells,--bring nothing more.</l>
						<l>Oh, say! is sweet Love dead and hid from all</l>
						<l>Who would disdain a colder touch than his?</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-274" n="268"/>

						<l>Then show me where Love lies. Put back the pall.</l>
						<l>Lo! I will fall upon his face and kiss</l>
						<l>Sweet Love to life again; or I will lie,</l>
						<l>Lamenting, prone beside his dust, and die.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Behold! my love has brought but rue and rime!</l>
						<l>I loved the blushing, bounding, singing Spring:</l>
						<l>She scarce would pause a day to hear me sing.</l>
						<l>I loved her sister, golden Summer-time:</l>
						<l>She gather'd close her robes and rustled past,</l>
						<l>Through yellow fields of corn. She scorn'd to cast</l>
						<l>One tender look of love or hope behind;</l>
						<l>But, sighing, died upon the Autumn wind.</l>
						<l>Oh, then I loved the vast, the lonesome Night:</l>
						<l>She, too, pass'd on, and perish'd from my sight.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Oh! lives there naught on all the girdled world,</l>
						<l>That may survive one day its sorry birth?</l>
						<l>The very Moon grows thin and hunger-curl'd;</l>
						<l>The ardent Sun forgets his love of Earth,</l>
						<l>And turns, dark-brow'd, and draws his reach'd arms back,</l>
						<l>The while she, mourning, moves on clad in black.</l>
						<l>But list! I once did hear the good priest tell</l>
						<l>That hell is everlasting. Oh, my friend,</l>
						<l>To think that there is aught that will not end!</l>
						<l>Now let us kneel and give God thanks that hell is hell.</l>

						<l>'Tis the wind through the woods of the Oregon.</l>
						<l>Sit down, sit down, for the world goes on</l>
						<l>Precisely the same; and the rainbow bubbles</l>
						<l>Of love, they gather, or break, or blow,</l>
						<l>Whether you bother your brain or no;</l>
						<l>And for all your troubles and all your tears,</l>
						<l>'Twere just the same in a hundred years.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>By the populous land, on the lonesome sea,</l>
						<l>Lo! these were the gifts of the gods to men,--</l>
						<l>Three miserable gifts, and only three:</l>
						<l>To love, to forget, and to die--and then?</l>
						<l>To love in peril, and bitter-sweet pain,</l>
						<l>And then, forgotten, lie down and die:</l>
						<l>One moment of sun, whole seasons of rain,</l>
						<l>Then night is roll'd to the door of the sky.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>To love? To sit at her feet and to weep;</l>
						<l>To climb to her face, hide your face in her hair;</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-276" n="270"/>

						<l>To nestle you there like a babe in its sleep,</l>
						<l>And, too, like a babe, to believe--it stings there!</l>
						<l>To love! 'Tis to suffer. "Lie close to my breast,</l>
						<l>Like a fair ship in haven, O darling" I cried.</l>
						<l>"Your round arms outreaching to heaven for rest</l>
						<l>Make signal to death." ... Death came, and love died.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>To forget? To forget, mount horse and clutch sword;</l>
						<l>Take ship and make sail to the ice-prison'd seas.</l>
						<l>Write books and preach lies; range lands; or go hoard</l>
						<l>A grave full of gold, and buy wines--and drink lees:</l>
						<l>Then die; and die cursing, and call it a prayer!</l>
						<l>Is earth but a top--a boy-god's delight,</l>
						<l>To be spun for his pleasure, while man's despair</l>
						<l>Breaks out like a wail of the damn'd through the night?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Sit down in the darkness and weep with me</l>
						<l>On the edge of the world. Lo, love lies dead!</l>
						<l>And the earth and the sky, and the sky and the sea,</l>
						<l>Seem shutting together as a book that is read.</l>
						<l>Yet what have we learn'd? We laugh'd with delight</l>
						<l>In the morning at school, and kept toying with all</l>
						<l>Time's silly playthings. Now, wearied ere night,</l>
						<l>We must cry for dark-mother, her cradle the pall.</l>

						<l>Take physic, consult with your doctor, as you</l>
						<l>Would fight a contagion; carry all through</l>
						<l>The populous day some drug that smells loud,</l>
						<l>As you pass on your way, or make way through the crowd.</l>
						<l>Talk war, or carouse: only keep off the day</l>
						<l>Of his coming, with every hard means in your way.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Blow smoke in the eyes of the world, and laugh</l>
						<l>With the broad-chested men, as you loaf at your inn,</l>
						<l>As you crowd to your inn from your saddle and quaff</l>
						<l>The red wine from a horn; while your dogs at your feet,</l>
						<l>Your slim spotted dogs, like the fawn, and as fleet,</l>
						<l>Crouch patiently by and look up at your face,</l>
						<l>As they wait for the call of the horn to the chase:</l>
						<l>For you shall not suffer, and you shall not sin,</l>
						<l>Until peace goes out and till love comes in.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Love horses and hounds, meet many good men--</l>
						<l>Yea, men are most proper, and keep you from care.</l>
						<l>There is strength in a horse. There is pride in his will:</l>
						<l>It is sweet to look back as you climb the steep hill.</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-278" n="272"/>

						<l>There is room. You have movement of limb; you have air,</l>
						<l>Have the smell of the wood, of the grasses: and then</l>
						<l>What comfort to rest, as you lie thrown at length</l>
						<l>All night and alone, with your fists full of strength!</l>
						<l>Go away, go away with your bitter-sweet pain</l>
						<l>Of love; for love is the story of troubles,</l>
						<l>Of troubles and love, that travel together</l>
						<l>The round world round. Behold the bubbles</l>

						<l>On trees that reach from ruin'd wall</l>

						<l>A bent old beggar, white as one</l>

						<l>Came on. And as he came he talk'd</l>
						<l>Unto himself; for there were none</l>
						<l>In all his island, old and dim,</l>
						<l>To answer back or question him.</l>

					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Yet here stood Adria once, and here</l>
						<l>Came Attila with sword and flame,</l>
						<l>And set his throne of hollow'd stone</l>
						<l>In her high mart. And it remains</l>
						<l>Still lord o'er all. Where once the tears</l>

						<l>Of heaven fall. Lo! all alone</l>
						<l>There lifts this massive empty throne.</l>

						<l>Before me as I sat alone</l>
						<l>In all my kingdom. There were kine</l>
						<l>That browsed along the reedy brine,</l>

						<l>Would shake the high reeds of the shore,</l>
						<l>A bird blow by,--but that was all.</l>
					</lg>

						<l>Ay, girdle deep in long, strong grass,</l>
						<l>And green alfalfa. Very fair</l>
						<l>The heavens were, and still and blue,</l>
						<l>For Nature knows no changes there.</l>
						<l>The Alps of Venice, far away,</l>
						<l>Like some half-risen large moon lay.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>How sweet the grasses at my feet!</l>
						<l>The smell of clover over-sweet.</l>
						<l>I heard the hum of bees. The bloom</l>
						<l>Of clover-tops and cherry-trees</l>
						<l>Was being rifled by the bees,</l>
						<l>And these were building in a tomb.</l>
						<l>The fair alfalfa--such as has</l>

						<l>With all the sweetness of the rose</l>
						<l>On Sacramento's sundown hills--</l>
						<l>Is there, and that dead island fills</l>
						<l>With fragrance. Yet the smell of death</l>
						<l>Comes riding in on every breath.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>That sad, sweet fragrance. It had sense,</l>
						<l>And sound, and voice. It was a part</l>
						<l>Of that which had possess'd my heart,</l>
						<l>And would not of my will go hence.</l>

						<l>I dream'd until the day was gone;</l>
						<l>I blew again my pearly shell,--</l>
						<l>Blew long and strong, and loud and well;</l>
						<l>I puff'd my cheeks, I blew as when</l>
						<l>Horn'd satyrs danced the delight of men.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Some mouse-brown cows that fed within</l>
						<l>Look'd up. A cowherd rose hard by,</l>

						<l>He frighten'd fled, and as he ran,</l>

						<l>Back o'er his shoulder threw his head.</l>
						<l>He stopp'd, and then this subject true,</l>

						<l>How more than all alone can be</l>
						<l>A man in crowds. Across the Isle</l>
						<l>My Hannibal strode on. The while</l>
						<l>Diminish'd Rousseau sat his throne</l>
						<l>Of books, unnoticed and unknown.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>This strange, strong man, with face austere,</l>
						<l>At last drew near. He bow'd; he spake</l>
						<l>In unknown tongue. I could but shake</l>
						<l>My head. Then, half a-chill with fear,,</l>
						<l>I rose and sought another place.</l>
						<l>Again I mused. The kings of thought</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-299" n="293"/>

						<l>Came by, and on that storied spot</l>
						<l>I lifted up a tearful face.</l>
						<l>The star-set Alps they sang a tune</l>
						<l>Unheard by any soul save mine.</l>
						<l>Mont Blanc, as lone as I--divine</l>
						<l>And white--seem'd mated to the moon.</l>
						<l>The Past was mine, strong-voiced and vast:</l>
						<l>Stern Calvin, strange Voltaire, and Tell,</l>
						<l>And two whose names are known too well</l>
						<l>To name, in grand possession passed.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>And yet again came Hannibal,</l>
						<l>King-like he came, and drawing near,</l>
						<l>I saw his brow was now severe</l>
						<l>And resolute. In tongues unknown</l>
						<l>gain he spake. I was alone,</l>
						<l>Was all unarm'd, was worn and sad;</l>
						<l>But now, at last, my spirit had</l>
						<l>Its old assertion. I arose,</l>
						<l>Wild, anger'd, from my dream's repose.</l>
						<l>With gather'd strength I raised a hand,</l>
						<l>And cried, "I do not understand."</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>His black face brighten'd as I spake:</l>
						<l>He bow'd; he wagg'd his woolly head;</l>
						<l>He show'd his shining teeth and said,</l>
						<l>"Sah, if you please, dose tables here</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-300" n="294"/>

						<l>Am consecrate to lager-beer;</l>
						<l>And, sah, what will you have to take? "</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Not that I loved that colour'd, cuss--</l>
						<l>Nay! he had awed me all too much--</l>
						<l>But I sprang forth, and with a clutch</l>
						<l>I grasp'd his hand, and holding thus,</l>
						<l>Cried, "Bring my country's drink for two!"</l>
						<l>For oh! that speech of Saxon sound</l>
						<l>To me was as a fountain found</l>
						<l>In wastes, and thrill'd me through and through.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>On Rousseau's Isle, in Rousseau's shade,</l>
						<l>Two pink and spicy drinks were made;</l>
						<l>In classic shade, on classic ground,</l>
						<l>We stirr'd two cocktails round and round.</l>

					<head rend="center">VALE! LION OF ST. MARK.</head>

					<lg>
						<l><hi rend="b">L</hi>ET me rise and go forth. A far, dim spark</l>
						<l>Illumes my path. The light of my day</l>
						<l>Hath fled, and yet am I far away.</l>
						<l>The old, bent moon has dipp'd her horn</l>
						<l>In the darkling sea. High up in the dark</l>
						<l>The wrinkled old lion, he looks away</l>
						<l>To the east, and impatient as if for morn. ...</l>
						<l>I have gone the girdle of earth, and say,</l>
						<l>What have I gain'd but a temple grey,</l>
						<l>Two crow's feet, and a heart forlorn?</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>A star starts yonder like a soul afraid!</l>
						<l>It falls like a thought through the great profound.</l>
						<l>Fearfully swift and with never a sound,</l>
						<l>It fades into nothing, as all things fade;</l>
						<l>Yea, as all things fail. And where is the leaven</l>
						<l>In the pride of a name or a proud man's nod?</l>
						<l>Oh, tiresome, tiresome stairs to heaven!</l>
						<l>Weary, oh, wearisome ways to God!</l>
						<l>'Twere better to sit with the chin on the palm,</l>
						<l>Slow tapping the sand, come storm, come calm.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-302" n="296"/>

					<lg>
						<l>I have lived from within and not from without;</l>
						<l>I have drunk from a fount, have fed from a hand</l>
						<l>That no man knows who lives upon land;</l>
						<l>And yet my soul it is crying out.</l>
						<l>I care not a pin for the praise of men;</l>
						<l>But I hunger for love. I starve, I die,</l>
						<l>Each day of my life. Ye pass me by</l>
						<l>Each day, and laugh as ye pass; and when</l>
						<l>Ye come, I start in my place as ye come,</l>
						<l>And lean, and would speak,--but my lips are dumb.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Yon sliding stars and the changeful moon ...</l>
						<l>Let me rest on the plains of Lombardy for aye,</l>
						<l>Or sit down by this Adrian Sea and die.</l>
						<l>The days that do seem as some afternoon,</l>
						<l>They all are here. I am strong and true</l>
						<l>To myself; can pluck and could plant anew</l>
						<l>My heart, and grow tall; could come to be</l>
						<l>Another being; lift bolder hand</l>
						<l>And conquer. Yet ever will come to me</l>
						<l>The thought that Italia is not my land.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Could I but return to my woods once more,</l>
						<l>And dwell in their depths as I have dwelt,</l>
						<l>Kneel in their mosses as I have knelt,</l>
						<l>Sit where the cool white rivers run,</l>
						<l>Away from the world and half hid from the sun,</l>
						<l>Hear winds in the wood of my storm-torn shore,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-303" n="297"/>

						<l>To tread where only the red man trod,</l>
						<l>To say no word, but listen to God!</l>
						<l>Glad to the heart with listening,--</l>
						<l>It seems to me that I then could sing,</l>
						<l>And sing as never sung man before.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>But deep-tangled woodland and wild waterfall,</l>
						<l>O farewell for aye, till the Judgment Day!</l>
						<l>I shall see you no more, O land of mine,</l>
						<l>O half-aware land, like a child at play!</l>
						<l>O voiceless and vast as the push'd-back skies!</l>
						<l>No more, blue seas in the blest sunshine,</l>
						<l>No more, black woods where the white peaks rise,</l>
						<l>No more, bleak plains where the high winds fall,</l>
						<l>Or the red man cries or the shrill birds call!</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>I must find diversion with another kind:</l>
						<l>There are roads on the land and roads on the sea;</l>
						<l>Take ship and sail, and sail till I find</l>
						<l>The love that I sought from eternity;</l>
						<l>Run away from oneself, take ship and sail</l>
						<l>The middle white seas; see turban'd men,--</l>
						<l>Throw thought to the dogs for aye. And when</l>
						<l>All seas are travell'd and all scenes fail,</l>
						<l>Why, then this doubtful, cursed gift of verse</l>
						<l>May save me from death--or something worse.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>My hand it is weary, and my harp unstrung;</l>
						<l>And where is the good that I pipe or sing,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-304" n="298"/>

						<l>Fashion new notes, or shape any thing?</l>
						<l>The songs of my rivers remain unsung</l>
						<l>Henceforward for me. ... But a man shall arise</l>
						<l>From the far, vast valleys of the Occident,</l>
						<l>With hand on a harp of gold, and with eyes</l>
						<l>That lift with glory and a proud intent;</l>
						<l>Yet so gentle indeed, that his sad heart-strings</l>
						<l>Shall thrill to the heart of your heart as he sings.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Let the wind sing songs in the lake-side reeds,</l>
						<l>Lo, I shall be less than the indolent wind!</l>
						<l>Why should I sow, when I reap and bind</l>
						<l>And gather in nothing but the thistle weeds?</l>
						<l>It is best I abide, let what will befall;</l>
						<l>To rest if I can, let time roll by:</l>
						<l>Let others endeavour to learn, while I,</l>
						<l>With naught to conceal, with much to regret,</l>
						<l>Shall sit and endeavour, alone, to forget.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Shall I shape pipes from these seaside reeds,</l>
						<l>And play for the children, and shout and call?</l>
						<l>Lo! men they have mock'd me the whole year through!</l>
						<l>I shall sing no more ... I find in old creeds,</l>
						<l>And in quaint old tongues, a world that is new;</l>
						<l>And these, I will gather the sweets of them all.</l>
						<l>And the old-time doctrines and the old-time signs,</l>
						<l>I will taste of them all, as tasting old wines.</l>
					</lg>

					<pb id="VAA9497-305" n="299"/>
					
					<lg>
						<l>I will find new thought, as a new-found vein</l>
						<l>Of rock-lock'd gold in my far, fair West.</l>
						<l>I will rest and forget, will entreat to be blest;</l>
						<l>Take up new thought and again grow young;</l>
						<l>Yea, take a new world as one born again,</l>
						<l>And never hear more mine own mother tongue;</l>
						<l>Nor miss it. Why should I? I never once heard,</l>
						<l>In my land's language, love's one sweet word.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Did I court fame, or the favour of man?</l>
						<l>Make war upon creed, or strike hand with clan?</l>
						<l>I sang my songs of the sounding trees,</l>
						<l>As careless of name or of fame as the sea;</l>
						<l>And these I sang for the love of these,</l>
						<l>And the sad sweet solace they brought to me.</l>
						<l>I but sang for myself, touch'd here, touch'd there,</l>
						<l>As a strong-wing'd bird that flies anywhere.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>... How I do wander! And yet why not?</l>
						<l>I once had a song, told a tale in rhyme;</l>
						<l>Wrote books indeed in my proud young prime:</l>
						<l>I aim'd at the heart like a musket ball;</l>
						<l>I struck cursed folly like a cannon shot,--</l>
						<l>And where is the glory or good of it all?</l>
						<l>Yet these did I write for my love, but this</l>
						<l>I write for myself,--and it is as it is.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Yea, storms have blown counter and shaken me.</l>
						<l>And yet was I fashion'd for strife, and strong</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-306" n="300"/>

						<l>And daring of heart, and born to endure:</l>
						<l>My soul sprang upward, my feet felt sure;</l>
						<l>My faith was as wide as a wide-bough'd tree.</l>
						<l>But there be limits; and a sense of wrong</l>
						<l>For ever before you will make you less</l>
						<l>A man, than a man at the first would guess.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Good men can forgive--and, they say, forget. ...</l>
						<l>Far less of the angel than Indian is set</l>
						<l>In my fierce nature. And I look away</l>
						<l>To a land that is dearer than this, and say,</l>
						<l>"I shall remember, though you may forget.</l>
						<l>Yea, I shall remember for aye and a day</l>
						<l>The keen taunts thrown in a boy face, when</l>
						<l>He cried unto God for the love of men."</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>Enough, ay and more than enough, of this!</l>
						<l>I know that the sunshine must follow the rain;</l>
						<l>And if this be the winter, why spring again</l>
						<l>Must come in its season, full blossom'd with bliss.</l>
						<l>I will lean to the storm, though the winds blow strong. ...</l>
						<l>Yea, the winds they have blown and have shaken me--</l>
						<l>As the winds blow songs through a shatter'd tree,</l>
						<l>They have blown this broken and careless-set song.</l>
					</lg>

					<lg>
						<l>They have sung this song, be it never so bad;</l>
						<l>Have blown upon me and play'd upon me,</l>

						<pb id="VAA9497-307" n="301"/>

						<l>Have broken the notes,--blown sad, blown glad;</l>
						<l>Just as the winds blow fierce and free</l>
						<l>A barren, a blighted, and a cursed fig tree.</l>
						<l>And if I grow careless and heed no whit</l>
						<l>Whether it please or what comes of it,</l>
						<l>Why, talk to the winds then, and not to me!</l>
