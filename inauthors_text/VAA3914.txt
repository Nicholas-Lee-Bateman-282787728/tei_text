                                   SCENE: The Kitchen in JOHN SHAKESPEARE'S house, Henley
                                          Street, Stratford-on-Avon, on New Year's Eve. In
                                          center rear, a door. At right of door, an oblong
                                          small-paned window, its sill, about three feet from the
                                          floor, bearing a prim row of potted plants. Right wall,
                                          center, a large open fireplace in which is a black pot
                                          over a low fire. A high-backed settle is at right and left
                                          of fireplace. A seat extends beneath the window from the
                                          settle at right rear corner of room. The seat of settle at
                                          right of fireplace raises. At right of door a clock
                                          stands; at left of door, a table. A basket of apples is on
                                          the table and above are shelves holding copper utensils.
                                          At rear left, a large churn. At center left, a door. At
                                          center front, a small table covered with an unbleached
                                          linen strip and bearing a bowl of milk, a spoon, a plate
                                          of bread and a dish containing small cakes. A lighted
                                          candle is on this able and another on the table at rear.
                                          At right front is a table prepared for ironing, with a
                                          basket near containing dampened clothes. The ironed
                                          garments are on the settle at left of fireplace. A medium
                                          sized basket hangs on the wall. A few chairs complete the
                                          furnishings.
                                   MISTRESS SHAKESPEARE
                                          is ironing. She listens, puts down her iron and going to
                                          the door looks anxiously without. Se closes the door. The
                                          clock strikes seven. She glances at the clock, then goes
                                          to the window. Seeing someone approach, she opens the door and admits BETSY carrying her baby brother, DICKUMS.

                                                 "Why a hare?" asked the Queen.
                                                 "I should try to poach a hair from your

                            NOTES
                            Titania, Oberon and Robin Goodfellow were re-created in A
                                          Midsummer Night's Dream.
                            "Titania" (taken from Ovid,
                                   Metamorphoses iv., 346, or (id.) iii., 173, where the name is
                                   applied to Diana), evidences the belief current at the time that
                                   the fairies were identical with the classical nymphs, and that
                                   Diana was their queen. Titania's more popular title was
                                          Queen Mab. (Vide
                                   Collancz' Preface to the play in the Temple Edition;

                            "Oberon" may be traced to the
                                   dwarf of that name in the Charlemagne romance, Huon
                                          of Bordeaux, translated from the French by Lord
                                   Berners about 1534 to 1540.
                            "Robin Goodfellow" is an English
                                   name for the mischief loving "Puck;" the latter
                                   probably of Celtic origin, but found in English prior to the
                                   Conquest, and early in Scandinavian and other dialects. The
                                   German equivalent of "Robin Goodfellow" is
                                   "Knecht Ruprecht." (Vide
                                   Collanz, supra.)
                            The little Indian boy is the cause of dispute
                                   between Titania and Oberon in the Shakespeare play.

                                   During the reign of Elizabeth, out of compliment to the Queen,
                                   many houses, including Charlecote, were built in the shape of an
                                   E. The plan derives its name from three projecting entrances in
                                   the facade, each provided with a porch. These gave the ground
                                   plan the shape of an E, with stubby arms.
                            Page 9. There's fell need for the pefumer:
                                   In Elizabetban times rushes were strewn upon the floors. When it
                                   was necessary to re-rush a room, fresh ones were deposited upon
                                   the old. "And a room was not always purged of its rushes
                                          more than once year. The
                                   result was filth, more or less absent to the eye, but present to
                                   the nose. The latter condition gave rise to whole profession, as
                                   necessary and as distinctive as that of the chimney sweep;
                                   namely, the perfumer. It was his business to come, when a room
                                   had grown too foul to live in, in order to remove the stench by
                                   burning juniper wood and other sweet smelling herbs. Vermin
                                   flourished under such conditions, and many are the allusions that
                                   could be cited referring even to royal visits, from which persons
                                   returned bitten from head to foot." (From Henry Thew
                                   Stephenson's The Elizabethan

                                   ffteen miles from Stratford, the Earl of Leicester, in July of
                                   1575, entertained Queen Elizabeth and devised pageantry and
                                   splendid ceremonies in her honor. Scott has recorded its
                                   brilliancies in his novel, Kenilworth.

                                   Shakespeare's master at Grammar School from 1572 to
                                   1577, and, if so, he doubtless contributed greatly to the
                                   development of the poet's mind. He was a man of
                                   erudition. His title was given him in accordance with the custom
                                   of the times to bestow titles upon schoolmasters of note.

                                   held that witches, though able at will to assume the form of any
                                   animal, had to dispense with the tail. The lack of it was
                                   frequently the cause of detection of witches in their disguised
                                   forms.

                            Page 51. May-day dew was used as a beautifier of
                                   the complexion. The young people went a-Maying, rubbing their cheeks with early dew to secure
                                   fresh coloring for the ensuing year. Samuel Pepys, in his Diary,
                                   says:
                            "My wife away to Woolwich in order to little ayre, and to
                                   lie there tonight, and so to gather May-dew tomorrow morning,
                                   which Mrs. Turner hath taught her is the only thing in the world
                                   to wash her face with."

                                   strings, etc.: Lutes were the favored instruments to
                                   accompany singing. Every barber shop had lutes and zitterns for
                                   the entertainment of those patrons who were obliged to wait.
                                   Barbers of those times were usually minor surgeons, their most
                                   important and frequent operation being the drawing of teeth. They
                                   tied the extracted teeth on lute strings and displayed them in
                                   front of their shops as signs. To this day, in somewhat changed
                                   form, the custom survives in London.

                            Page 6,. The following descrption of the old morris-dance is
                                   paraphrased from that of Strutt, the antiquarian, found in his
                                   romance, Queenhoo-Hall (vol. I., p. 13, et seq.):
                            First enter Friar Tuck (as indicated in the text of
                                   this play), then enter:
                            Six young men, as woodmen, clothed in brown, axes
                                   upon their shoulders, and garlands of ivy leaves about their
                                   heads;
                            Six girls, as milk maidens, in blue kirtles,
                                   bearing shining pails;
                            Six foresters, in green, each carrying a bugle-horn
                                   which he sounds as he enters;
                            Robin Hood, in a bright green tunic, gold-fringed,
                                   with blue and white hose and hood, a buglehom, a sword and
                                   dagger, a bent bow in his hand, arrows at his girdle and a
                                   garland of rose-buds on his head;
                            Little John at Robin Hood's right
                                   hand;
                            Will Sukely at Robin Hod's left;
                            Ten other attendants of Robin Hood, who, together
                                   with Little John and Will Stukely, are clad in green with bows in
                                   their hands and arrows in their girdles;
                            
                            Two maidens in orange-colored kirtles with white
                                   courtpies (short vests), strewing flowers;
                            Maid Marian in a watchet-colored (light blue) tunic
                                   reaching to the ground, over which is a white roche, (a linen
                                   outer garment), loose-sleeved, with silver fringes, a cloth of
                                   silver girdle having a double bow at the left, her fair long hair
                                   flowing, topped by a net of gold upon which is a garland of
                                   silver and violets. She is supported by
                            Two brides-maidens in light blue rochets with
                                   crimson girdles, garlands of blue and white violets upon their
                                   heads;
                            Four maidens in white costumes, with green
                                   courtpies, and garlands of violets and cowslips;
                            The Fool bearing a pole with an inflated bladder on
                                   one end;
                            The May-pole borne by eight
                                          youths;
                            The Hobby-Horse and The Dragon
                                   bringing up the rear.
                            Attached to the wrists, elbows and ankles of the dancers are bells of
                                   varying sizes and tones.
                            With the appearance of the May-pole the foresters sound their horns
                                   and the spectators cheer while the pole is being elevated. The
                                   woodmen and the milk maidens dance around it in rustic fashion to
                                   the music of pipe and tabour. At the conclusion of the dance, the
                                   one who undertakes to play the Hobby-horse comes forward with his
                                   appropriate equipment, frisking back and forth, galloping,
                                   curvetting, ambling, trotting, to the delight of the spectators.
                                   He is followed by the Dragon, hissing, roaring and shaking his
                                   wings with astonishing in genuity. To round out the mirth, the
                                   Fool capers here and there between the two monsters, now and then
                                   slyly casting handfuls of meal into the faces of the gaping
                                   rustics, or rapping them upon their heads with the bladder. The
                                   Hobby-horse at last begins to falter in his paces, and his rider
                                   orders the Dragon to fall back; the well-nurtured beast, being
                                   out of breath, readily obeys, which concludes this part of the
                                   pastime.
                            Concerning the Hobby-horse and the Dragon, Stephenson gives Drake as
                                   authority for saying that the Hobby-horse consists of the head
                                   and tail of a horse made of paste-board and attached to a person
                                   whose business it is. while seeming to ride gracefully on the back of the
                                   animal, to imitate its curvettings and prancings, the
                                   horse's supposed feet being concealed by a footcloth
                                   reaching to the ground. The Dragon, constructed of the same
                                   materials as the horse, is made to hiss and vibrate its wings,
                                   and is subject to frequent attacks by the man on the Hobby-horse,
                                   who then personates the character of St. George.
                            The dance above outlined is but one of many morris-dances. One of the
                                   simpler forms may be substituted for that described above, or the
                                   number of performers may be reduced as circumstances require. One
                                   of the old morris-dance tunes should be used.

                                   Witch was a kind of novice, indulging in insignifiant witcheries.
                                   These witches were regarded as harmless, often living among their
                                   neighbors in the friendliest relations. "They told
                                   fortunes, exercised the arts and practices of palmistry and
                                   elementary astrology, dealt out simples for a substantial
                                   consideration, cast waters and furnished love potions to
                                   distressed and disappointed youths and maidens. We learn from The Wise Woman of Hogsden a list of the

                            This play for children, selected from hundreds of manuscripts
                                   submitted in the contest, won the prize offered by the Drama
                                   League of America. The story is of a princess who remains true to
                                   her ideals despite the temptations of circumstances and the
                                   obstacles which seek to prevent her from fulfilling her duty to
                                   the people over whom she rules. In the end she is happily
                                   rewarded, as is natural for so steadfast a heroine. The play is
                                   of the sort which children enjoy giving as well as seeing.

                                   which were published in the spring of 1915, has now established

                                   years in the juvenile book world. The volumes have all been well
                                   planned. The authors have, without exception, known how to
                                   secure, and hold the attention of the average boy and girl. They
                                   have written entertainingly, without sacrifice of facts. Each
                                   book gives a full length picture of the particular great man with
                                   whom it is concerned.
