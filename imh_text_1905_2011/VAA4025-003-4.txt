            INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS IN INDIANA.
            No. IVâ€“RAILROADS.
            THE railroad in Indiana and the part it has played in the development of the
                    commonwealth might well afford material for a volume. Here we can not pretend to
                    more than a brief outline sketch, but in that sketch we shall attempt to touch
                    upon the various phases of development in their due relations and make obvious
                    the vast importance of this factor in transportation.
            MOVEMENTS PRELIMINARY TO THE RAILROAD ERA.
            The steam railroad in the 
                        United States
                    , in its first crude, experimental status, was about five years old
                    when the spreading interest becomes traceable in Indiana. The startling
                    proposition that the ancient difficulties of transportation by land could be
                    vastly lightened by a mechanical force, born of simple fire and water, that
                    should convey great loads at an unheard-of speed, did not convince the
                    conservatives as to its practicability, and it required something like courage
                    to exploit it. One of our first men publicly to advocate it was Governor James
                    B. Ray, who, along with his many curious aberrations, seems to have been gifted
                    with real insight and prevision. As early as 1827 he advanced an argument for
                    railways as against canals, and even advocated a line from 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                     up the Whitewater valley to connect with the
                    National Road. In his legislative message of 1830 he suggested the union of the
                    lakes with the Ohio river by the grand scheme of a railroad
                    from Detroit river across 
                        Michigan
                     to Lake Michigan, thence, by way of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , to the 
                        Ohio
                    ; and he further pointed out that the terminus at 
                        Louisville
                     of the 
                        Lexington
                     & 
                        Ohio
                     railro ad, which was then proposed, would seem to mark out that
                    point as the proper southern terminus of an Indiana road. In this he revealed
                         a sagacity decidedly in advance of that
                    of the Indiana legislature which, six years later, established such terminus at 
                        Madison
                    . The falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    , with its three cities of Jeffer-sonville, 
                        New Albany
                     and the 
                        Kentucky
                     metropolis, and not the city of 
                        Madison
                    , was undoubtedly the logical stopping-place for our first road, as
                    is proved by the fact that the 
                        Madison
                     road was ultimately swallowed up by- the line between 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Governor Ray's opulence of imagination led him into
                    schemes and predictions that in his day passed for the rankest whimsicality.
                    According to one of his biographers, he dreamed of a "grand scheme of
                    railroad concentration at 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Here was to be the head of a score of radiating lines. At
                    intervals of five miles were to be villages, of ten miles towns and of twenty
                    miles respectable cities." Subsequent history shows that the vagaries
                    of a "crazy" man sometimes outrun the wisdom of his
                    generation.
            By 1831 the railroad idea was beginning to ferment. Ray in his message of that
                    year speaks of lines that "are contemplated from 
                        Cincinnati
                     and from 
                        Louisville
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                    ," and a legislative report from a committee on canals and
                    internal improvements discusses the practicability of railroads as compared with
                    canals. Public interest was promoted at this period, doubtless, by the
                    exhibitions of a 
                        Kentucky
                     genius, one Joseph Bruen, who traveled about with a miniature
                    locomotive and coach and a portable track with which he demonstrated to the
                    curious the wonderful possibilities of the steam engine by drawing his little
                    coach full of people around his runway. This was the first locomotive to turn
                    wheels in Indiana.
            In 1832, for some reason not quite clear, there was a sudden, not to say
                    spasmodic, impulse toward this form of internal improvement, as is indicated by
                    the fact that this year eight different railroads were chartered by the Indiana
                    legislature. This preliminary craze grew. In such history as we have upon the
                    subject it is customarily represented that the construction of the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     road under the State's aid marks the very beginning of our
                    railroad era; but it is an interesting though now quite forgotten fact, that
                    before the State essayed that task at all the legislature was deluged with
                    applications and something like thirty charters were granted to would-be  railroad corporations. These corporations
                    were composed of the enterprising and public-spirited citizens of many
                    communities all over the State, and the roads, had they all materialized, would
                    have pretty well provided the various sections of the State with transportation
                    routes. Even at that day the future importance of the capital as a railway town
                    was, in a sense, foreshadowed, as eight of the proposed roads were to connect
                    with 
                        Indianapolis
                    . These incipient ventures may be mentioned more specifically. The
                    first six charters were granted simultaneously by an act of February 2, 1832,
                    and these were the Law-renceburgh & 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; the 
                  Madison,
                            Indianapolis
                & 
                        Lafayette
                    ; the 
                        Ohio
                     & 
                        Lafayette
                     (from falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     via 
                        Salem
                     to 
                        Lafayette
                    ); the 
                        Wabash
                     & 
                        Michigan
                     (from 
                        Lafayette
                     to the site of 
                        Michigan City
                    ); the Harrison & 
                        Indianapolis
                     (via Brook-ville and 
                        Rushville
                    ), and the 
                  New
                        Albany, Salem, Indianapolis
                & 
                        Wabash
                    . Immediately on the heels of these came the 
                  Richmond, Eaton
                & 
                        Miami
                     and the 
                        Ohio
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     (
                        Jeffersonville
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                     via 
                        Columbus
                    ). The legislature following seems to have done nothing in this
                    line, but that of 1833-'34 chartered the 
                        Evansville
                     & 
                        Lafayette
                     (to follow the Wabash valley); the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Lafayette
                     (via 
                        Crawfordsville
                    ); the 
                        Leavenworth
                     & 
                        Bloomington
                    ; the Indiana Northwest Railroad Company (from 
                        Michigan City
                     to the National Road on the west side of the 
                        Wabash
                     at 
                        Terre Haute
                    ), and a short road connecting 
                        New Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . In 1835 
                        Charlestown
                     thought to relieve the handicap of its inland situation by a little
                    steam road to the Ohio river, and the list was further
                    swelled by the Buffalo & 
                        Mississippi
                     (to cross the northern part of the State); the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Montezuma, and the 
                        Michigan City
                     & Kankakee (to connect Lake Michigan
                    with the navigable waters of the Kankakee). A year later followed the
                            
                  Crawfordsville,
                            Covington
                & 
                        Illinois
                    ; the 
                        Princeton
                     & 
                        Wabash
                    ; the Perrysville & 
                        Danville
                     (111.); the 
                        Lafayette
                     & 
                        Danville
                    ; the 
                        Bethlehem
                     & 
                        Rockford
                     (from 
                        Bethlehem
                    , in 
                        Clark county
                    , to 
                        Rockford
                    , in 
                        Jackson county
                    ); the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     & 
                        Vernon
                    , and the 
                        Madison
                     & Brownstown. In 1837 came the 
                        Michigan City
                     & 
                        St. Joseph
                     (
                        Mich.
                    ); the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Michigan City
                    ; the Hudson (Laporte county) & New Buffalo (Mich.); the 
                        Ft. Wayne
                     & Piqua (O.), and the Mount Carmel & 
                        New Albany
                    .
            
            These incorporations, extending over a period of five years, mark the railroad
                    movement preliminary to any real construction. While the number of them and
                    corresponding number of promoters drawn into the ventures would seem to indicate
                    a strong tide of sentiment in favor of this innovation in transportation, there
                    are further indications that capital generally and public confidence were slow
                    to respond. With all the rush for charters little was done beyond an occasional
                    sporadic stirring of the question by some local paper and, perhaps, an uncertain
                    amount of surveying. The "little" referred to was to the
                    credit of the 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     company, which, as appears by the records, was the most energetic
                    of the various companies and which, in 1854, actually got down to work. To this
                    company belongs the honor of introducing the railroad in Indiana. The 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     line is credited with the distinction of being the pioneer road,
                    but as a matter of fact, before the 
                        Madison
                     road was taken up by the State, and while the old 
                        Madison
                     company was practically sacrificing its charter, the Li. & I. company was surveying, constructing and establishing
                    data for future roads. The construction was on an experimental strip of road,
                    one and one-fourth miles in length, in the neighborhood of 
                        Shelbyville
                    . The first railroad report in the State was, we believe, the one
                    transmitted to the legislature by this company under date of December 5, 1834.
                    It is a document of some interest. The implication is that the locality at 
                        Shelbyville
                     was chosen because the cuts, embankments and other problems for the
                    engineer at that point represented a fair average for experimental data. There
                    was "one cut of five feet, one embankment of five feet and of one of
                    ten, two curves and two bridges." The cost was $1500 per
                    mile. Of course there was no locomotive for the road, and in lieu thereof a
                    horse-car was built and the great advantages of a track in facilitating traction
                    was effectively demonstrated, if we can believe the statement that "one
                    horse was found able to draw forty to fifty persons at the rate of nineteen
                    miles per hour." This road was "opened" on the Fourth
                    of July, 1834, at an expense of $222.12^ for the car and
                    $12.62 for horses and drivers, $60 of which was returned
                    to the promoters in fares from those who treated themselves to a ride over the
                    new road. Local tradition says that the occasion  was additionally celebrated by an old-time
                    barbecue. This report, which is over the signature of James Blake,
                    "President pro tern.," argues vigorously for the advantages of
                    railroads and presents figures that purport to show that railroad transportation
                    as compared with rates by wagon, etc., would save in one year nearly a quarter
                    of a million dollars to ten specified counties, the estimates being based upon
                    current tonnage and rates. The new values that would be given to stone, timber
                    and firewood for steam mills is also dwelt upon, as are the prospects for
                    liberal dividends to stockholders.
            These arguments but reinforced others, equally ardent, advanced two years before
                    by John Test, then president of the L. & I., who contributed to the Indiana Palladium, beginning March 17, 1832, a series of
                    articles on railroads which are among the first if not the first elaborate
                    discussions of the subject in the Indiana press. As presented by him, the L.
                    & I. was to be a "link in a great chain," that was to
                    be extended from 
                        Cincinnati
                     to 
                        St. Louis
                     by way of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            With all the zeal and enterprise of its promoters, however, the L. & I.
                    company was doomed to delays many and vexatious ere it accomplished its dream of
                    a connection with 
                        Indianapolis
                     and the interior of the State. The difficulties of financing
                    railroads at this stage of progress was probably the fatal obstacle to all these
                    early ventures.* Public sentiment as expressed in
                        the* confidence of capitalists was not yet
                    ripe, but the ripening process was slowly going on. Everybody realized that
                    better transportation facilities were an ever-pressing need, but the cost of
                    building and maintaining railroads seemed something prodigious. The problem took
                    the form of a choice between improved wagon roads, canals and railroads, and
                    there was frequent discussion of the respective merits of these. The macadam
                    turnpike, which was much considered, was, of course, by far the cheapest of
                    these improvements in localities where the material for it was to be found, but
                    in other localities it was prohibitive. In the discussions the respective
                    advantages of canals and railroads seemed to be about balanced. As to first
                    cost, the argument was, perhaps, in favor of the railroad, as railroads were
                        
                  
                     * It may be added here that the
                            development of the State at this period could not have supported these
                            railroads had they been built
               
                     then constructed, but in the building of
                    the latter the cost was far more hypothetical than that of canals, with which
                    engineers were more familiar. The expensive machinery for locomotion and the
                    vehicles for carriage, together with the frequent repairs on these and on the
                    roadbed, made the cost of maintenance of the railroad formidable and
                    problematical, but the canals, from floods and other causes, were also subject
                    to expensive repairs. The enormous tonnage that could be moved with small and
                    cheap motor power was vastly in favor of the canal, but off-setting this the
                    railroad offered the no small advantage of time saved by swift conveyance.
                    Again, canals in our northern latitude would be put wholly out of service during
                    the more severe winter months, while railroad service, comparatively independent
                    of weather contingencies, would be continuous. Another consideration was that
                    railroad machinery and much of the material for construction, being imported,
                    took money out of the country, while money expended on canals remained here;
                    and, finally, the water-power afforded by canals as a
                    "by-product" built up mills and other industries along their
                    lines.
            These were the arguments, in brief, that were put before capitalists and the
                    people during that uncertain period when the transportation problem was pressing
                    for solution and the financial and social conditions counseled conservatism and
                    prudence. That the practically untried railroad won but slowly over the
                    better-known canal is evidenced by the fact that when the State finally took up
                    a system of public works there were included in it four canals and only one
                    railroadâ€“the famous "

                    least in this State. It was one of the first roads incorporated, its charter
                    bearing the same date as that of the 
                        Lawrenceburgh

                    so far as actual performance was concerned. Just why the

                            thorough history of the road that has appeared in print. The sketch we
                            here present deals with this special history only so far as it is
                            essential to our more general subject.
               
                     State took 
                        Madison
                     under its wing is a story lost to history now, unless it might be
                    dug up from contemporary newspaper files. As a matter of fact the Ohio
                        river towns, notably 
                  Lawrenceburgh, Madison, Jeffersonville
                and 
                        New Albany
                    , were lively and jealous rivals in all that pertained to their
                    prosperity from the interior, and they were probably rivals for the State
                    railroad as they had been for the 
                        Michigan
                     road some years before. 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                    , from its nearer approach to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and the markets of the East, and the cities at the falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    , that much nearer the Southern markets, were more logical points
                    than 
                        Madison
                     for railroad connection with the interior. But 
                        Madison
                     got the 
                        Michigan
                     road and she got the railroad, and the most reasonable inference
                    seems to be that in the strenuous legislative "log-rolling" of
                    that day her representatives were the most expert. However that may be, the
                    chief factor in 
                        Madison
                    's future prosperity (as it proved) was thus introduced,
                    and the timid people who lacked the faith to build their own railroad hailed
                    with enthusiasm the paternal undertaking, as if the big State in its might could
                    do with impunity what private enterprise could not. The State took up the work
                    on a broad-guage plan, and at once. In 1836 the route was surveyed from 
                        Madison
                     to 
                        Vernon
                    , a distance of twenty-two miles, and ground was broken. The
                    builders proceeded on the theory that the best was none too good, and instead of
                    using the plain strap rail, then and for some years after in common use, a T
                    rail was imported from 
                        England
                     at an expense of $80 per ton. In November, 1838, eight
                    or nine miles of track having been completed, the road was formally
                    "opened," the event being signalized by the presence of the
                    Governor and other State officials, and distinguished citizens from far and
                    near. A locomotive had been ordered of the Baldwin shops, at 
                        Philadelphia
                    , and shipped via the gulf and rivers, but this was lost at sea, and
                    in lieu of it a little engine named the "Elkhorn," owned by
                    the 
                        Lexington
                     & 
                        Ohio
                     railroad, in 
                        Kentucky
                    , was secured, brought from 
                        Louisville
                     on a barge, hauled up the 
                        Michigan
                     road hill by oxen, and put on the track at 
                        North Madison
                    . An excursion was made over the new track and the affair wound up
                    with a banquet and speeches. Railroad progress in the State being continuous
                    from that day, this may be considered the real inauguration of the railroad age
                         in Indiana. The road was opened for
                    traffic as far as Graham creek, about eighteen miles out, in April of 1839. At
                    that time there were two roads in the West in operationâ€“one from 
                        Lexington
                    , Ky., to "the Ohio river at 
                        Louisville
                     (from which the "Elkhorn" had been secured), and
                    another from 
                  Toledo, O.
               , to Adrian, Mich., which
                    was opened in 1836.* The Mad
                    River & Lake Erie, running southward
                    from Sandusky, O., was put in operation the same year as the M. & I.
            The State built twenty-eight miles of this road at the enormous cost of
                    $1,624,603, or something over fifty-eight thousand dollars per mile,
                    then, the penalty for the statesmanship of 1836 being about due, it, along with
                    the other public works, was suspended. The railroad was leased to private
                    firmsâ€“first Bran-hams & Co., then Sering &
                    Burtâ€“who ran it for a percentage of the earnings. Then the State took
                    hold of its business again only to find itself burdened more that ever with a
                    "white elephant," and following that a transfer of the road
                    was made to a private company with the argeement that the latter should take up
                    anew the work of construction and complete it to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . By way of aid this company was permitted to receive land in
                    payment for shares of stock, and to issue scrip redeemable in this land. Land to
                    the amount of 26,795 acres was subscribed, and $96,200 in scrip
                    issued. The work was pushed to completion, and on October 1, 1847, the first
                    train steamed into 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the midst of a jubilation as enthusiastic as that at 
                        Madison
                    , in 1838, when the little "Elkhorn" was
                    introduced to the curious public. It should be noted that the company
                    constructed its part of the work at something less than $11,000 per
                    mile as against the $58,000 of the State's expenditures. The
                    engineering difficulties of the southern end were much greater than those
                    further north, but by no means such as to account for the vast discrepancy.
            The proprietorship of the M. & I. was now dual, the State and the company
                    owning respectively the portions they had built, and the earnings were divided
                    according to mileage. The story of this copartnership is one of protected
                    monopoly and presents an interesting phase of the subject. It is dealt with at
                    length in Miss Cravens's chapter above referred to, and need not 
                  
                     * Howe's Collections of 
                                Ohio

                     be dwelt upon here. Suffice to say that
                    under it the State gained nothing, railroad construction elsewhere was unfairly
                    retarded, and the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad Company, within a few years, waxed fat off its advantages.
                    The relationship lasted until 1852. Then the State sold out its interests to the
                    company at a sacrifice, withdrew its protection, and at once proceeded to the
                    passage of a general railroad law that opened the way to those rival lines that
                    had been previously handicapped by the denial of fair charters. The result was
                    fatal to the M. & I. The most formidable of those rivals, the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and the Lawenceburgh roads, pushed forward their work and soon
                    intercepted the trade of the 
                        Madison
                    , carrying it to more advantageous points on the 
                        Ohio
                    ; simultaneously, the Belle-fontaine, which had been building for
                    three or four years, made a direct connection with the East by way of 
                        Ohio
                     roads, and soon thereafter the Indiana Central did the same.
                    Meanwhile the M. & I. steadily declined,*
                    finally (in 1862) was sold out by the

                        Jeffersonville
                     road. Since then the 
                        Madison
                     end of the line is but a branch of the main road.
            OTHER EARLY RAILROADS.
            After four or five years of vicissitudes the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     railroad began to justify its existence as a business venture.
                    Between the years 1843 and 1849, according to Cham-berlin's Indiana
                    Gazetteer, its annual receipts steadily increased from $22,110 to
                    $235,000, and the daily travel from 25 to 200 passengers. After its
                    completion to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , in 1847, its real prosperity set in and until 1852 its volume of
                    business increased phenomenally, its financial success being indicated by the
                    fact that in the year last mentioned its stock sold for $1.60.f This
                    practical object lesson had its effect as a stimulus, and the "railroad
                    fever" of the early fifties is a well-known chapter of

                            Ellis for 1854 (see Documentary Journal for that year) as a piece of naive literature is unique among official reports. The
                            burden of the president's wail is that the State, in passing a
                            law which "opened the door for the construction of other
                            railroads," was instrumental in inflicting serious damage on
                            the M, & I., through competition that at once
                            sprang up. The long-protected M. & I. seemed to regard this as a
                            breach of faith on the part of its erstwhile protector

                    section of the State caught the disease and proceeded to build railroads at an
                    astonishing rate. Prior to 1850 the only railroad in operation in Indiana was
                    the 
                        Madison

                    Governor Wright, in his message of December 31, 1850, says: "We have
                    212 miles of railroad in successful operation, of which 124 were completed the
                    past year. There are more than 1000 miles of railroad surveyed and in a state of
                    progress. There are now," he says, "$1,000,000 of
                    corporate stock taken in the State, in railroads, by cities and counties, and
                    from the present excitement in different parts of the State the amount will be
                    largely increased the coming season."*
                    On the maps of Indiana for 1852 and 1853 we find almost a score of roads
                    traversjngthe country in all directions, most of them being then in operation.

                        private enterprises.

            BEGINNINGS OF A SYSTEM.
            It may be noted that the combined mileage of these roads and the areas they
                    served were much in excess of that contemplated in the famous internal
                    improvement system which the State had hoped to establish fifteen years before.
                    An examination of the routes shows that not only were the various sections and
                    principal cities of the State put into communication with each other, but
                    systems of trunk lines were beginning to be knit that reached
                    out to remoter points and to the great markets that were so necessary to the
                    State's prosperity. The 
                  Terre
                        Haute, Cincinnati
               , Indiana Central and Bellefontaine roads,
                    connecting with roads in other States, were or were soon to become links in
                    continuous lines binding the Mississippi river to the
                    Atlantic seaboard; the 
                        New Albany
                     & 
                        Salem
                     connected the Ohio river and the great lakes,
                    while the 
                  Madison, Jeffersonville
                and Peru roads, with
                    extensions northward soon to follow, did the same. Two other lines built a
                    little later, one being completed in 1856 and the other in 1857, were the
                            
                  Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne
                & 
                        Chicago
                     and the 
                  Toledo,
                            Wabash
                & Western,
                    which were important additions to the new transportation system. The latter,
                    having its eastern terminus at Lake Erie, threaded the
                        Wabash valley to 
                        Williamsport
                    , in 
                        Warren county
                    , thence passed to the Mississippi river. In
                    its route through this State it paralleled the 
                        Wabash
                     & Erie canal, and demonstrated directly and strikingly the
                    relative values of the two great methods of transportation. The railroad ruined
                    the canal. After the year 1856 the rents and tolls from the latter fell steadily
                    off till, from $113,-423.47 in the last-named year the returns in
                    1874 were but $7,179.61. Back of this, of course, lay the decreasing
                    traffic by boat. Not only passenger travel but the greater part of the imports
                    and much of the export trade was shifted to the more expeditious mode of
                    conveyance, and only the bulkier goods, such as grain and lumber, which were the
                    least profitable, were left to the canal boats. As this kind of tonnage was
                    mostly exports, the boats that carried it out frequently had to return
                    emptyâ€“a condition that was fatal to profits and the life of the canal
                    trade. In a word, the canal, as opposed to the railroad, was a failure, and was
                    passing into desuetude.
            
            INFLUENCES OF THE RAILROAD.
            The influence of the railroad throughout the State was marked, not to say
                    phenomenal. A striking illustration of it was afforded by the rise and decline
                    of 
                        Madison
                    . Between 1840 and 1850 the population of this city increased from
                    3798 to 7000. In the early fifties, in point of commerce, wealth, culture and
                    general status, she was easily the leading city of Indiana, and the chief factor
                    in creating such preeminence was the old 
                        Madison
                     railroad draining down to that point, as it did for a dozen years,
                    all the trade of the interior. For one thing, it became a pork market, second
                    only to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , the "Porkopolis" of the West. Practically all
                    the travel into the interior from the East and South was by way' of 
                        Madison
                     and her railway, and she became known as the "gateway to
                    the State." The decline of her road after 1852, by the deflection of
                    trade to other roads, marks the beginning of her decline, and, outstripped as
                    she has been by other towns of the State, she now stands in history as an object
                    lesson, proving how the railroads can make and unmake cities. 
                        Richmond
                    , between 1850 and 1860, gained over 5000 in population, advancing,
                    meanwhile, to a manufacturing city of quite respectable proportions. A like
                    stimulus can be traced in 
                  Ft.
                        Wayne, Lafayette,
                            Terre Haute
                and other
                    towns that were on important lines. Not the least notable of the many effects
                    was the rearrangement, so to speak, of the centers of population. Under the old
                    order, navigable waters, good mill seats and topographical considerations were
                    important factors in determining settlements, but now the centers that sprang up
                    were strung along the new overland routes of travel and many of the river towns
                    that had aspired to ascendancy were left to dwindle in isolation. As, in the
                    first instance, the leading towns already in existence determined the location
                    of the railroad routes, so to a greater degree did these routes determine the
                    location and multiply the number of the smaller towns. The early roads, when
                    surveyed, passed through comparatively few towns other than county seats, yet
                    Governor Ray's dream of a town or village every five miles has long
                    since been practically fulfilled. Along with the growth of urban populations and
                    transportation advantages went an industrial development, and from a purely
                    agricultural  State Indiana began to make a
                    showing in the manufactures,* and her natural
                    resources, many of which had lain in primeval uselessness because of the
                    transportation difficulties, now began to engage the attention of capitalists.
                    Real estate took on new values. The advantages to the State generally were set
                    forth by the president of the M. & I. road at the time Indiana was
                    trying to get out of the entanglement with her railroad. Even if she had paid
                    enormously for her road and had sold out for a pittance, it was plausibly
                    argued, the vast enhancement in property values and the corresponding returns
                    from taxation, due directly to this railroad, far outweighed the seeming
                        loss.â€  This was doubtless true, and it
                    indicates, in part, the immeasurable effect upon the commonwealth of the
                    railroads collectively.
            THE RAILROADS AND INDIANAPOLIS.
            But the most notable, perhaps, of the stimulating effects of the railroads within
                    the State was the part they played in the development of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Prom the first charters of the early thirties, as has been shown,
                    the capital, located as it was, was recognized as a logical railroad center, and
                    among those 
                  
                     * A. reference to statistics shows the
                            effect of the railroads upon manufactures. The Indiana Gazetteer for
                            1850 gives the manufactured products of the year as aggregating in value
                            $19,199,681, while these values for the next ten years,
                            according to the census of 1860, averaged $41,840,434. with a
                            total of 20,755 hands employed in manufacturing industries. Taken by
                            counties, those that show the heavy investments are, almost without
                            exception, those that have the railroad advantages, Jefferson and 
                                Wayne
                             lead all the others, the former with $1,117,699
                            of invested capital.
                  The important relation of the railroad to commercial prosperity is
                            illustrated by what was known as the "Erie war," which
                            occurred in 1853. At that time the railroads had not established a
                            uniform guage (width between the rails), and a break of guage at
                                    
                        Erie, Pa.
                     , which was in the
                            line of travel between the East and the West, necessitated not only a
                            transfer of all through passengers at that point, but of all freight
                            traffic as well. The profit in this to the town of Erie and the
                            corresponding inconvenience and expense to travelers and shippers
                            resulted in serious friction. Erie seemed to think that her transferring
                            industry was a vested right, and that the rest of the world could go
                            hang, and when an attempt was made to unify the guage her
                            citizen's forcibly interfered with the laying of rails in the
                            streets. The wrath in the West at Erie's hoggishness and the
                            execrations heaped upon the town by the press and in indignation
                            meetings were loud and universal. The 
                        
                                    Indianapolis
                                 Journal for December 17, 24, 25 and 28, 1853,
                            gives glimpses of the public feeling.
                  
                     â€¡ In justly estimating what seems the
                            State's signal failure at railroad building, the above results
                            should be considered, and also the fact that, but for its taking up the
                            task, railroad construction in the State would probably have been
                            delayed several years. The lack of public confidence and the
                            difficulties of capitalizing were amply proved in the thirties. An
                            actual experimentâ€“an object lessonâ€“was needed to
                            establish faith. This the State supplied, and the result was the impulse
                            of the fifties.
               
                     built in the early fifties not less than
                    eight focussed there. In the history of the place a distinct period begins with
                    1847, when the M. & I. road established a connection with the
                        Ohio river. From that date it proceeded to evolve from
                    the status of an ordinary country town to that of a city with multiplied and
                    growing activities. The particulars of this transition was graphically set forth
                    by the author of "Holloway's 
                        Indianapolis
                    ." The business of the town, he says, was purely local.
                    "It produced little and it distributed little. A small amount of
                    'jobbing-' was done in an irregular way among the small
                    dealers and manufacturers of the neighboring towns, but it was neither large
                    enough or certain enough to be considered a branch of trade. The manufacturing,
                    except for home demand, was even more trifling than the mercantile business.
                    Occasional attempts had been made at iron, wool, oil, tobacco, hemp, and even
                    ginseng manufacture, but none of them amounted to much or lasted long* " With the opening of the 
                        Madison
                     road, "there was a change of features, of form, a
                    suggestion of manhood, a trace of the beard and voice of virility. Manufactures
                    appeared; 'stores' that had formerly mixed up dry goods,
                    groceries, grain, hardware, earthenware and even books in their stock, began to
                    select and confine themselves to one or two classes of their former
                        assortment.* * *
                    Business showed its growth in its divisions; the price of property advanced; a
                    city form of government was adopted; a school system was inaugurated. Everybody
                    felt the impulse, without exactly feeling its direction, of prosperity. * * * New hotels,
                    manufactories and business houses also appeared. The Bates House and Sherman
                    House were built; 
                        Osgood
                     & Smith's peg and last factory,
                    Geisendorff's woollen mill, Drew's carriage establishment,
                    Shel-lenbarger' s planing-mill and Macy's pork-house swelled
                    our industries, and various blocks, schoolhouses, railroad shops and other
                    buildings were added to our improvements." A glance at the local press
                    of the fifties confirms this description of prosperity and bustle. Three-fourths
                    of the space, seemingly, was taken up by advertisements; the columns were dotted
                    with little cuts of engines and cars, with accompanying time-tables; pictures of
                    trains were incorporated in the newspaper heads, and a  semi-literary weekly, the first of its kind in the
                    city, saw fit to take the name The Locomotive.
            
            This sudden quickening proved to be no passing phase, for before two decades of
                    the railroad era had passed 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the railroad center, had become the chief city of the State,
                    "hopelessly ahead of all rivalry, the seat of the most numerous, varied
                    and productive manufactories, and the distributing center of a trade probably
                    unequaled by any city in the Union of the same population." The
                    continuation of this process of growth, the establishment of a still wider
                    circle of connections and the addition of the interurban transportation system
                    with the wonderful changes it is now effecting is a matter of common knowledge
                    which passes chronologically beyond the scope of this study.
            THE UNION DEPOT.
            With the first centering of railroads at 
                        Indianapolis
                     the desirability of a plan whereby, for the convenience of through
                    passenger traffic, these roads could be made continuous in their connections,
                    presented itself, and an account of the inception and development of this plan,
                    which seems to have been original with the parties mentioned, is thus given by
                    Mr. W. N. Jackson in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Journal for July 29, 1900:
            "Chauncy Rose, of the 
                        Terre Haute
                     &

                    ; John Brough, of the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and Oliver H. Smith, of the Bellefontaine line, met in their
                    office in the middle of the Circle in 1850, and planned and carried into
                    execution soon after, a Union Station at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and erected the first one that was ever built. For this a union
                    track was needed from the middle of 
                        Tennessee
                     street northeasterly to the middle of 
                        Washington
                     street at Noble street, and the right of way for which was taken by
                    the 
                        Terre Haute
                     & 
                        Richmond
                     to 
                        Pennsylvania
                     street, and from there onward northeasterly to the center of 
                        Washington
                     street by the Bellefontaine and Peru roads. A few miles of each
                    road had been made previous to this. The right of way from the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     depot on South street to Meridian street was given by Austin W.
                    Morris. The right of way from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     street to 
                        New Jersey
                     street was purchased from Mrs. McCarty. The Union Station was
                    opened September  20, 1853, the building
                    being finished at that period. Mr. Chauncy Rose was president of the company and
                    Mr. W. N. Jackson, secretary, treasurer and ticket ag-ent.
            "The 
                        Lawrenceburgh

                     railroad entered this station in the spring of 1854 as the

                        Lafayette

                     roads."
            The Union Company owned all the tracks in the city and the Union Depot
                    independently of the various roads as such. The old building, *which
                    was planned by General T. A. Morris, was originally 420 feet long by 120 wide,
                    but afterward (in 1866) was made 200 feet wide. It was replaced by the present
                    building in 1887-'08.
            THE BELT RAILROAD.
            The centering of twelve or thirteen railroads at 
                        Indianapolis
                     caused, by the seventh decade, a congestion of traffic at that
                    point that embarrassed the city and called for a remedy. The remedy developed in
                    the shape of a separate road located beyond the outskirts of the city and that
                    encircled it sufficiently to connect with all the lines that entered, and by
                    this "Belt Road," as it was called, freight was and is
                    transferred from one road to another without entering the city. The idea is said
                    to have been a new one and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Belt Road the first one of the kind ever built. The real originator
                    and earliest promoter of the plan has received very little credit for the part
                    he played as the "first cause" of this important work. The
                    written history of it begins with the organization of the company in 1873, but
                    at least three years before that time the scheme was fermenting in the mind of
                    Joel F. Richardson, a practical railroad man, who for more than fifteen years
                    had been identified with construction in Indiana. This is revealed by diaries
                    and other documents left by Mr. Richardson, and now in possession of his
                    daughters in 
                  Irvington,
                            Indianapolis
               . One
                    statement of Mr. Richardson's as written down by his daughter at the
                    time it was made is as follows:
            
            "Coming up from 
                        Cincinnati
                     one day in 1870, there was a car off the track at Walter's
                    mill. While waiting there I had a talk with John H. Lozier about the Fletcher
                    property in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , he being one of the trustees. He said that as the property was in
                    the south part of the city it would not amount to much on account of having to
                    cross the railroads to get to or from it. I took from my pocket my drawing of
                    the Circle Railroad and explained its necessity and my idea about it. Mr. Lozier
                    was favorably impressed with it, and I asked him to write a piece about it for
                    the paper to place it before the public."
            Reverting back to that period the Misses Richardson remember as children this, to
                    them, mysterious drawing of the "Circle" road and the
                    explanations of the same as made by their father. Mr. Lozier, the daughters
                    think, published an article in one of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     papers about 1871 or 1872. The matter then seems to have rested
                    until 1873, when it was taken up anew and briskly pushed. In one of the diaries
                    above referred to the first entry is:
            
                    
                  
                     
                        
                           ''Friday, Jan. 10, 1873.

                                    and showed him my plan for a railroad around the
                                city."
                     
                  
               
                
            On subsequent dates, as shown by the diary, he was busy presenting his plan to
                    other capitalists and railroad men, from one of whom, Dillard Ricketts, he
                    received especial encouragement. Ricketts told him to "go on and work
                    the matter up and he would furnish money for the enterprise." Other
                    entries show that in February he walked over the ground bordering the city,
                    prospecting for a route. By August a company was formed and incorporated, and
                    from that date Richardson's dream began to materialize.
            The following sketch of the road was written by Charles Test Dal ton as a
                    contribution to the "Indiana Centennial Association" which
                    celebrated July 4, 1900, by a historical meeting at the State House.* It was published in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Journal
                    
                  
                     * This "Centennial
                            Association," which has been mentioned before in this magazine,
                            never held any meetings other than the one here referred to. A number of
                            valuable historical papers were prepared for the occasion by competent
                            persons. These were local in their character, and most or all of them
                            were subsequently published in the Journal. The
                            meeting was under the auspicies of the Indiana Historical Society, but
                            its chief if not sole promoter was Gen. John Coburn, who urgently
                            solicited the preparation of the papers.
               
                     for August 26, 1900. Mr. Dalton took the
                    pains carefully to interview men who had been intimately connected with the Belt
                    Railroad enterprise, and his sketch is the fullest and most reliable of which we
                    have knowledge:
            "A corporation was formed in August, 1873, of which Henry C. Lord was
                    president, to construct a Belt road and stockyards on the present lines. On
                    September 10, 1873, the McCarty heirs conveyed to this corporation a strip of
                    ground one hundred feet in width, running from the Vandalia Railroad through to
                    the river on the present line, containing more than twenty acres, as shown in
                    deed recorded in Land Record 20, page 294, according to the conditions therein
                    named. Articles of association incorporating the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Belt Railway Company were filed April 9,1873, in the office of the
                    Secretary of State, to construct a railroad connecting the different railroads
                    leading into the city. The then over-crowded tracks of the Union Railroad
                    Company, over which all freight, as well as passenger cars, were brought to the
                    city, suggested the importance of the same. The directors for the first year
                    named therein were Addison L. Roach, Thomas D. Kingan, John H. Farquhar, Elijah
                    B. Martindale, Joel F. Richardson, Milton M. Landis, Henry C. Lord, John Thomas
                    and William Coughlen. H. C. Lord was elected president of the company and Joel
                    F. Richardson, superintendent. The latter, it was said, was the first to suggest
                    building the railroad.
            "Early in September Mr. Henry C. Lord, as president of the company,
                    proposed to Nicholas McCarty that if he and the other McCarty heirs, owners of
                    the real estate lying between Oliver avenue and the 
                        Vincennes
                     railroad and that between the Vin-cennes railroad and the river,
                    would give the right of way through all such real estate, McCarty might select
                    one of the three routes named by Mr. Lord on which the right of way should be
                    located. Negotiations relative to the matter resulted in the conveyance by deed
                    September 10, 1873, to this company of a strip of ground one hundred feet in
                    width, running through all the said reai estate on the present line of the Belt
                    Railroad proper, containing about twenty acres, and being 8,800 feet long, as
                    shown in deed recorded in Land Record 20, page 294, according to the conditions
                    named therein. The company proceeded  to
                    make the roadbed through the strip, first working on it between the 
                        Vincennes
                     railroad and Oliver avenue. Soon afterward the panic came, all work
                    was discontinued and was not resumed until some time thereafter, when money, it
                    was said, was furnished by Mr. Thomas D. Kingan, and the company continued the
                    work on the roadbed east of the 
                        Vincennes
                     railroad, Some little time thereafter all operations were again
                    discontinued, and, the company failing to meet the conditions of the deed, the
                    whole strip reverted to the grantors, a decree in the 
                        Marion
                     Superior Court, cause No. 14676, against the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Belt Railway Company, Thomas D. Kingan and others, quieted the
                    title in the McCarty heirs. This strip of ground is all the company ever secured
                    for a right of way. Nothing further as to work on the embankment or any of the
                    right of way was ever done under the direction of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Belt Railway Company.
            "At that time 
                        Indianapolis
                     was a city of barely over 50,000 people, a prosperous overgrown
                    country town, of conservative people and plain dwellings, separated in a measure
                    from the bustle of the outside world and caring nothing whether this or that
                    city outgrew it; consequently there was little waste of nervous energy, no booms
                    and few local strikes. This feeling of security had built up a residence city
                    and one of solid wealth, and the fact that homes were built here by hard labor
                    instilled in all classes a feeling of proprietorship. And this is why the great
                    financial panic of 1873 did not reach 
                        Indianapolis
                     until several years later, but the inevitable day dawned at last.
                    It was a serious hour, and had to be handled in a firm manner and by a strong
                    hand. The man arose to the occasion; he successfully averted a labor war and
                    incidentally gave to this city a gift the value of which he could hardly hope
                    would prove the greatest industry of this city. But the test of twenty-three
                    years has proved his judgment. The enterprise was the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company, and the man who thought out
                    this project was the Hon. John Caven. He was mayor of the city, and endeavored
                    to devise some plan whereby he might give labor to the unemployed and at the
                    same time build something which would not merely be an ornament to the city, but
                    which would bring in revenue to repay itself and  in the future increase in value. This would be
                    accomplished in building a great belt road around the city in connection with
                    the various railroads entering from all directions and connecting it with a
                    large stockyard from which immense shipments could be received and sent to other
                    parts of the country. This plan, therefore, furnished labor to the unemployed,
                    brought a great cattle market to 
                        Indianapolis
                     and a large amount of taxable property; and all of this was not the
                    act of a speculator or a promoter, but of a man who cared for his city and his
                    people so much that he would accept no stock in the concern when he could have
                    done so justly and have acquired a fortune.
            "When the details of the enterprise had been thoroughly gone over Mayor
                    Caven drew up the Belt road message and read it before the Council on July 17,
                    1876. It was published in the papers, where it caused considerable comment.
                    Articles of association of the Union Railroad and Stockyards Company, dated
                    August 29, 1876, were filed in the Secretary of State's office. The
                    directors for the first year named therein were J. C. Ferguson, John Thomas, W.
                    C. Holmes, W. N. Jackson, E- F. Claypool, John F. Miller, M. A. Downing, Horace
                    Scott and W. R. Mc-Keen. The purpose of the same, as stated in these articles,
                    was to 'provide convenient methods for the transportation and transfer
                    of freight and stock cars through, into and around the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and to effect the speedy, economical exchange of cars between all
                    the railroads entering therein, or passing through; and for the erection and
                    maintenance of ample stockyards for the accommodation of all the live stock that
                    may be brought into or pass through said city.' An ordinance contract
                    was passed by the Council of 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the petition of a majority of the citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , to be found in the volume of 
                        Indianapolis City
                     ordinances, published in 1895, sections 1315 to 1324, both
                    inclusive. The city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     agreed to lend its credit to the company to the extent of
                    $500,000 in its bonds. After the passage of this ordinance, attorneys
                    gave their opinion that bonds issued under the same would be invalid unless
                    validated by an act of the Legislature, which act was passed by the Legislature,
                    approved March 2, 1877. (See acts of 1877, page 116.) Many of our best citizens
                    opposed the city lending its credit to the road, but a majority favored it.  The petition, signed by a majority of the
                    citizens, was secured only after a faithful and energetic canvassing for two or
                    three weeks of the whole city by committees from the various wards, and the
                    validating act of the Legislature was secured after quite a struggle before the
                    members and committees of the Legislature, by those in favor and those against
                    the project. But it was finally passed by a large majority of both houses. Mr.
                    Justus C. Adams, with other legislators from our county, was active in the
                    support of the project, and perhaps more credit is due Mr. Adams than any one
                    person in the Legislature that year for having secured the passage of the act.
            "Under the ordinance contract the agreement between the Union Railroad
                    Transfer and Stockyards Company and the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     (recorded in the recorder's office October 20, 1877, in
                    Mortgage Record 305, page 514), the city agreed to lend its credit in the way of
                    issuing the city bonds to the amount of $500,000. The Council passed
                    the ordinance October 16,1876, for the issuance of the city bonds, payable in
                    twenty years, to be dated January 1, 1877, the Belt Railroad bonds to be given
                    to the city to secure it against the payment of the bonds so issued by the city,
                    dated December 1, 1876. The exchange of these bonds was to be made in accordance
                    with said agreement. The mortgage securing the bonds so executed by the railroad
                    company to the city was recorded in Mortgage Record 97, page 34. The Belt
                    Railroad Company having paid off the bonds so issued by the city, the mortgage
                    executed by the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company to the city was released
                    July 22, 1898. By a warranty deed of June 5, 1877, the McCarty heirs conveyed to
                    the Union Railroad, Transfer and Stockyards Company a strip of ground 100 feet
                    in width, running through their land from a point near the Vandalia Railroad to
                        White river, and about 105 acres for the site of the
                    stockyards. The track was very soon laid, and the buildings of the stockyards
                    erected and inclosed, and business began at once. Afterward the name of the
                    Union Railway and Stockyards Company was changed to that of the Belt Railroad
                    and Stockyards Company, and on the 17th day of October the Belt Railroad proper
                    was leased from the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company by the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Union Railway Company for a term of 999 years, beginning on the 1st
                    day of May, 1884.
            
            "August 10, 1895, the McCarty heirs sold and conveyed to James Cunning
                    29Â½ acres adjoining the old stockyards by deed recorded in Land
                    Record 30, page 17. Afterward, by successive conveyances, this same land was
                    conveyed to the Farmers' and Drovers' Stockyard Company, a
                    corporation organized under the laws of Indiana. This corporation was formed in
                    opposition, it was supposed, to the Belt Railroad and Stockyards Company, and,
                    after proceeding to make some little improvements, it and Kingan & Co.,
                    who were supposed to be at the back of it, effected a settlement with the Belt
                    Railroad and Stockyards Company, and conveyed to it the above 29Â½
                    acres October 16, 1895, (recorded in Land Record 30, page 109). So the two
                    companies were consolidated, and by the settlement Kingan & Co. leased
                    the porkhouse belonging to the old company and made a contract with the old
                    company to continue to do their business with it, where they (Kingan &
                    Co.) have contributed so largely to its success. This 29Â½ acres, so
                    conveyed, added to the 105 acres, and the 20-acre strip of land above mentioned,
                    make 154Â½ acres altogether which the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company now owns. In the organization of the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company, W. Riley McKeen, Horace Scott, E. F. Claypool, W. C. Holmes, M. A.
                    Downing and others were prominent, and after the organization of the same, W. R.
                    McKeen, Horace Scott, M. A. Downing and E. F. Claypool were the active managers
                    of the company. Mr. Claypool, as secretary and treasurer of the company, managed
                    the financial operations of the company with great skill, and perhaps no one is
                    more entitled to credit for carrying the company through and placing it upon a
                    solid foundation than he.
            "The struggle of the company began with the city credit of
                    $500,000. A petition was signed by a majority of all the citizens
                    requesting that the loan be made, and even then the ordinance was duly passed by
                    the Council by a bare majority of one. This shows how strong was the opposition
                    against the measure. And, after this it was declared that the bonds issued by
                    the Council were invalid, and that it was necessary to procure an act of
                    Legislature to secure their validity; which was done by an act approved March 2,
                    1877 (acts of 1877, p. 116). Despite the opposition the measure passed both
                    houses of the Legislature  by a large
                    majority. The greatest difficulties seemed to have been surmounted, and the work
                    of construction was begun. The company continued the work until June 1, when it
                    was interrupted, at a most inopportune time, in the midst of serious labor
                    troubles and when work was almost impossible to be found; and when men were
                    depressed and desperate. It seems that certain land-owners were not satisfied
                    with the amount of money awarded them for the right of way, and a contest in
                    court ensued. This threw many men out of employment, and a decision of the
                    courts would probably delay the work for months. In the meantime people might
                    starve and serious trouble result. Then it was that Mayor Caven worked night and
                    day. Trouble had been brewing for a long time, and it culminated on the evening
                    of June 6, 1877, when a large meeting of the unemployed was called at the
                    Statehouse grounds. In the afternoon a compromise was effected by the mayor, and
                    he gained permission to continue the work irrespective of the pending lawsuit.
                    As soon as this point had been gained he sought Mr. Claypool, who was secretary
                    of the company at the time; Mr. Reed, the engineer, and Mr. Richardson, who had
                    charge of the men. They agreed to go on with the work in the morning if they
                    were furnished with sufficient men, and Mr. Caven promised to meet this
                    deficiency. When the labor meeting gathered that evening there were nearly five
                    hundred desperate men assembled, needing but the tongue of an anarchist to drive
                    them to any act of folly. It was a critical period, more serious than the
                    citizens imagined. The township trustee could give no more aid, and municipal
                    funds were at a low ebb. In the stormy speeches which followed the crowd was
                    urged to commit bloodshed, if necessary, for they must have food. Finally, they
                    decided to march to the Governor the next morning and make a last appeal; if
                    this was useless they would loot the stores. In the midst of the scene Mayor
                    Caven entered the room alone. It was an act of bravery, and with difficulty
                    could he gain a hearing. When the uproar had ceased he told the people they
                    could go to work tomorrow morning, and requested order and obedience. It was a
                    scene to be remembered, this sudden transition from hopelessness to surety. Men
                    laughed and cried, they shouted and sang, and it was a glorious moment to the
                    man who stood among  them, alone, the man
                    who had been true to his office and had saved the people. Then the mayor said no
                    one should go to bed hungry that night, and asked the people to follow him and
                    he would look after them. Out in the darkness and down the street the crowd
                    followed their leader. Several bakeries were visited and each man was given
                    several loaves of bread. Then they disappeared silently down the street and
                    everything was quiet. It was the passing of a crisis.
            "This is the story of the formation of the Belt Railroad and Stockyards
                    Company and it is evident that Mayor Caven is the man who deserves very great
                    credit for this work, which is an honor to himself and to the city. As to the
                    results which arose from this undertaking, there is only one word which seems to
                    fit the purposeâ€“stupendous. Nothing has paid so well or been of so
                    great value as a single enterprise. Starting with a stock of 30 cents on a
                    dollar, each year saw a rise in the percentage. In 1879 and 1880 the cash
                    dividends were 10 per cent, on the face of the stock and in 1881 stock sold for
                    $1.50. One of the earliest stockholders paid $15,000 for
                    $50,000 stock and by 1899 had received $10,000 in
                    dividends; two years later he sold his stock for $75,000
                    cash." * * *
            
            BRIEF SKETCHES AND NOTES.
            From various sources, among them a series of sketches of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     railroads written by Mr. John H. Holliday and published in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Sentinel in 1869 (see dates May 22, July 24, August 2,
                    August 5 and August 25), we gather these additional items of information:
            
               The 
                            Indianapolis
                         and Laiarenceburgh.â€“This road (afterward known
                    as the I., C. & L.), as has been stated, antedated in its actual
                    beginnings every other Indiana road, but it was not completed to 
                        Indianapolis
                     until 1853. Its. difficulties and the character and effects of the
                    opposition to it on the part of the M. & I. road would make an
                    interesting chapter of our early railroad history, but the data for it seem to
                    be lost now. We find just enough evidence to show that there was much
                    illegitimate opposition, which was made effective by the aid of the State. By
                    the Ivawrenceburgh newspaper files of 1835 we find that the L. & I.
                    Company, that had secured the charter for the road in 1832,*
                    
                  
                     * Holloway's 
                                Indianapolis
                             gives the date of the first railroad charters as February,
                            1831. A reference to the statutes would have shown the writer that it
                            was 1832.
               
                     was still alive and active. On July 23 of
                    that year ground was broken at 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                     with the accompaniment of a barbecue and public demonstration (see
                        Palladium for July 25). There were letters from Henry
                    Clay, O. H. Smith and others, and many toasts. Major J. P. Dunn was prominent in
                    the festivities. It is worthy of note that the Rising Sun
                    Times of contemporary date and correspondents to its columns were hostile
                    to the whole scheme of the road, their animosity, seemingly, arising from the
                    idea that the State was going to subsidize it at the expense of other sections.
                    Its final completion, affording a connection with 
                        Cincinnati
                    , was a most important commercial benefit, and no other road,
                    perhaps, conduced more to the decadence of the 
                        Madison
                     route. The 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Journal for December 19,1853, says: "The
                    freighting business on this new route is exceeding the most sanguine predictions
                    of its projectors. The receipts for freight alone have been more than one
                    thousand dollars per day for some time past. One day this week ninety-five cars
                    arrived at 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                     full of freight. More cars are being built and every care taken to
                    push forward freight without delay." The receipts of the road the first
                    year were $299,433.66, and the second year this was nearly doubled.
                    In the tables of tonnage we find corn, wheat, oats, rye and barley, iron, coal,
                    lumber, staves, hooppoles, stone, stock, flour, whisky, salt and pork
            
               The Jeftersonville Road.â€“If the 
                        Lawrenceburgh
                     road swallowed up a large part of the business previously enjoyed
                    by the M. & I., the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     line took another part and did still worse, for it finally
                    swallowed up the M. & I. itself. Before it accomplished that anaconda
                    feat, however, it had to wage a long and determined fight. Its original charter,
                    wherein it was designated as the 
                        Ohio
                     & Indiana Railroad Company, dates back to 1832. In common
                    with the other roads then chartered, this project lay dormant for a long time.
                    In 1837 it was saved from total extinction by a renewal of its charter with
                    certain amendments, and again in 1846 by another renewal. This last charter
                    authorized a capital of $1,000,000, divided into shares of
                    $100 each, $100,000 of which must be subscribed before the
                    company could be organized. The time limit was thirteen months. Nothing was
                    consummated. In 1848 the projectors again got together  and secured a more liberal charter, extending the
                    time limit to five years and giving authority to extend the line not merely to 
                        Columbus
                    , as had been previously granted, but to any other point in the
                    State that might be desiredâ€“which was a very important concession, as 
                        Indianapolis
                     was the desired terminus. At this period the potential energy that
                    had kept the thing breathing through these years showed signs of real life. The
                    $100,000 was raised, the company organized, with William C.
                    Armstrong-, of 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , as president, and in October of 1848 twenty-two miles of the road
                    was put under contract.* By August of 1852 the
                    fifty-two miles between 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and 
                        Rockford
                     was completed and put in operation, and soon after it reached 
                        Columbus
                    , where it met the M. & I., and the real conflict between
                    the two roads beg-an. Mr. John W. Ray, in a contribution to the Indiana
                    Centennial Association, thus speaks of the relations between them at this point:
            "John Brough was the president of the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     railroad. He was brainy and strong-willed, and equally so was
                    Armstrong-. When the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     road was nearing 
                        Columbus
                    , Armstrong was anxious to form connection with the other road, and
                    arranged the time-tables to this end. Brough changed his, and when the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     train hove in sight it was only to see the other
                    departing."
            The sequel was that Armstrong simply headed for 
                        Indianapolis
                    , building his road parallel with the M. & I., and only a
                    few yards away. By the time he reached 
                        Edinburg
                     the M. & I., presumably, concluded that a control of the
                    rest of the route was better than a division of the same. At any rate a
                    compromise was effected by the, laying of a switch between the two tracks and
                    the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     traffic passed over it. By this time the M. & I. had passed
                    its heyday, its stock was depreciating-, and the astute rival road was quietly
                    buying up the same. To quote Mr. Ray again: "When the next election of
                    the board of directors was held, the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Railroad Company elected a majority of the board, and the 
                        Madison
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     railroad was shortly after consolidated into the
                            
                  Jeffersonville,
                            Madison
                & 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad Company, and William G. Armstrong became president
                    thereof." This consolidation took place in 
                  
                     * In 1849 the name was changed to the 
                                Jeffersonville
                             Railroad Company.
               
                     1866. The J., M. & I. was a
                    particularly important road during the Civil War, it being the route for
                    conveyance of troops and supplies to the South. During that period its carrying
                    capacity was taxed to the utmost.
            
               The Beliefontaine & 
                            Indianapolis
                        .â€“This road, afterward known as the C, C, C.
                    & I., and now as the Big Four, was among the most important of the early
                    lines, particularly as it was the first to give 
                        Indianapolis
                     an outlet to the East and to deflect trade in that direction. Says
                    Mr. Holliday, in the Sentinel articles we have cited:
                    "It is impossible to estimate the advantage this road has been to 
                        Indianapolis
                    . For several years a great deal of the stock of the Bellefontaine
                    company was owned here, and the road was run directly in the interest of the
                    city. * * * But the great
                    benefit conferred by the road has been in the large amount of travel and
                    business brought through here, and which has, in one way and another, done much
                    to build up the city." Its chief projector was Oliver H. Smith, who was
                    its first president. Begun in 1848, it was by 1850 in operation as far as
                    Pendleton, and was the second road running out of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Two years later it reached Union City, there making connection
                    with an 
                        Ohio
                     road and with points eastward. Prior to that it was a feeder to the 
                        Madison
                     road, but afterward a formidable commercial rival.
            
               The Peru & 
                            Indianapolis
                        .â€“This road, the third that reached out from 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was running to 
                        Noblesville
                     by the spring of 1851 and reached Peru in 1854. Of it Mr. Holliday
                    says: "Traversing, at first, a stretch of wilderness, and though a
                    poorly constructed road with a history of repeated reverses, it yet helped
                    materially to build up the country through which it ran. In its earlier days it
                    brought into 
                        Indianapolis
                     immense quantities of lumber, and, at a later day, much grain and
                    produce." The 
                        Madison
                     road, in its various attempts at self-preservation, effected a
                    consolidation with the Peru soon after the completion of the latter, on the
                    theory that a through route from the Ohio river to the 
                        Wabash
                     & Erie canal, and thence by water to Lake
                    Erie and the East would put it on a footing with its victorious
                    rivals; but the merger did not work smoothly, and dissolved before long.

                        Indianapolis
                     road to go into operation, was intended, as the name implies, to
                    cross the State and connect the two cities mentioned. The original idea, as said
                    on a previous page, was to establish a link in a through route that should,
                    without break, reach from 
                        St. Louis
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . On May 12, 1847, a railroad convention was held at 
                        Indianapolis
                     attended by delegates from various counties in this State and from 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Illinois
                    , the object being to stir up this scheme for a trunk line. In
                    addition to the consideration of the road from 
                        Terre Haute
                     to 
                        Richmond
                    , steps were taken to urge action on the part of 
                        Ohio
                    , and a committee was appointed to memoralize the 
                        Illinois
                     legislature for the passage of an act granting right of way through
                    that State. One fatal obstacle to the consummation of the plan at this time, it
                    is claimed, was the indifference and lack of support over the route between 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Richmond
                    . At any rate, the actual project, so far as Indiana was concerned,
                    settled down to the 
                        Terre Haute
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     road, a brief sketch of which has been furnished us by Mr. W. H.
                    Ragan, now of 
                        Washington City
                    . Says Mr. Ragan:
            "The people of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , headed by the late Chauncy Rose, desiring to be put in easier
                    communication with the State capital, agitated the question of a railroad to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and a company was formed, with Chauncy Rose as its president, to
                    construct this road. With this beginning, some 
                        Indianapolis
                     men were approached, including the late E. J. Peck. The latter
                    became deeply interested in the undertaking, and soon after was elected
                    president of the company, which position he held for a number of years. These
                    preliminaries occupied several years. The first officers of the company, as I
                    recall them, were: President, Chauncy Rose; vice-president, E. J. Peck; chief
                    engineer, Thomas A. Morris. The country lying between 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     was an almost unbroken wilderness, the settlements were separated
                    by extensive and gloomy forests, and only a few villages were scattered along
                    the line of the National Road. The railroad left this latter highway at 
                        Plainfield
                    , from which point to 
                        Greencastle
                     but a few settlements were to be found, and beyond that place for a
                    number of miles conditions were even worse. The locating of the road was a slow
                    and tedious process,  several surveys being
                    made before the present line was finally established.
            "Vice-President Peck, always faithful, never abandoned the corps of
                    engineers. He accompanied them through their task, and when it was completed no
                    one understood better than he just what obstacles were yet to be encountered and
                    overcome. He had made the acquaintance of many residents along the line, fully
                    understood each one's attitude toward the undertaking and knew whether
                    he would grant the right of way through his possessions or obstruct to the
                    bitter end, as many did, the building of the road. In this way he prepared
                    himself for the troubles and litigation to follow. Then railroads could not make
                    terms with property owners, as they can now, for right of way by condemnation
                    proceedings. Concessions must be through compromise or by litigation. The latter
                    was often resorted to and not infrequently an obstreperous land-owner forced the
                    engineer, in order to avoid further difficulties, to deviate from his chosen
                    line, by making a detour around the contested premises. In this way a road that
                    should have been built as an air line, at least from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        Greencastle
                    , now has many annoying and dangerous curves in it. It was but
                    natural for at least some of the farmers of that day to doubt the sincerity of
                    the company in carrying out its undertaking. Some seemed to think the project
                    too stupendous ever to be accomplished; others that the resources of the country
                    were too limited to support such an undertaking."
            The 
                        Terre Haute
                     & 
                        Indianapolis
                     was opened for through business in February of 1852. Its receipts
                    for the first year were $105,943.87, and within sixteen years its
                    business multiplied ten times, its agricultural tonnage being swelled by an
                    increasing carriage of coal. It is said to have been the first railroad in the
                    State to issue bonds.
            
               The Indiana Central.â€“The
                    "Panhandle," as this road was subsequently called, now the P.,
                    C, C. & St., L., was the fulfilment of the old 
                        Terre Haute
                     & 
                        Richmond
                     idea, and followed it in such short time after the failure of the
                    first company to push it through that the charge of indifference on the part of
                    residents along the route could hardly have been true. It was begun in 1851 and
                    completed in 1853, being the second to establish  (through 
                        Cincinnati
                    ) a connection with the East. It traversed one of the best sections
                    of the State and was no small factor in developing that section, as well as 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            
               Other Roads.â€“The 
                        Lafayette
                     road, finished in 1852, was of especial service to 
                        Indianapolis
                     as a connecting link between the Ohio river
                    and 
                        Chicago
                    . It was consolidated with the 
                        Cincinnati
                     road in 1866. The "Junction" road, orC, H.
                    &D., though begun in 1850, did not connect with 
                        Indianapolis
                     till the latter sixties. The 
                        Vincennes
                     road reached here about the same time, after a nominal existence of
                    many years. This concludes the group of 
                        Indianapolis
                     roads up to that date.
            
               Names and Nicknames of Railroads.â€“Forty to sixty
                    years ago there was something of a tendency to saddle railroads with sounding
                    names that were grandiose, often, in proportion to the insignificance of the
                    road. A writer in the Indianapolis Press for July 30, 1900,
                    gives some of these samples of imposing verbiage. Some of the roads never
                    existed except on paper. Such was the "Atlantic & Great
                    Western," which was to run "all the way from 
                        Vincennes
                     to 
                        Indianapolis
                    ," and the "American Central," which had
                    a terminus in 
                        Ft. Wayne
                    , and then, according to its articles of association,
                    "wandered through the woods across the State and lost itself someplace
                    on the prairies of 
                        Illinois
                    ." The "
                  Brazil, Bowling
                    Green
                & 
                        Bloomfield
                    , Northern & Southern Central Railway" was to be
                    forty-six miles long, and the "
                        Auburn
                     & Eel River Valley" was to be
                    twenty-four miles. A reversion to this verbal bolstering may be traced in the
                    present "
                        Chicago
                     & Southeastern," which "does not go near 
                        Chicago
                     and runs southwest." It was formerly known as the
                    "Midland," and was famous among all the
                    "jerk-water" roads of the State for its equipment and its
                    ridiculous attempts to be a sure-enough railroad. In more recent times there has
                    been a quite contrary tendency to brief nicknames, having usually some
                    appropriate significance, and we have the "Big Four" (from the
                    four big cities connected, 
                  Cleveland, Cincinnati,
                            Chicago
                and 
                        St. Louis
                    ), the "Panhandle," the "Air
                    Line," the "Clover Leaf," the "Nickel
                    Plate," etc. The "Bee Line" of a generation ago, at
                    first the Bellefontaine, was perhaps the first instance of this  kind of nomenclature. As an instance of facetious
                    nicknaming-, it is said that the 
                        Cambridge City
                     branch of the J., M. & I., was once called the
                    "Calico Road," because the workmen on it were paid in dry
                    goods.
            
               Early Railroad Equipment.â€“The first railroads in
                    Indiana (except the first twenty-eight miles of the M. & L, which had
                    imported "T" rails) were laid with "strap
                    rails," which were simply bars of iron, about two and a half inches
                    wide by five-eighths thick. These were spiked down to the wooden rails, as they
                    were sometimes called, or continuous lines of oak stringers perhaps six inches
                    square. Being secured near the inner edge of the stringers and the corner of the
                    timber being chamfered off, the flanges of the wheels could not groove the wood.
                    The stringers rested on cross-ties three or four feet apart, to which they were
                    secured by strong wooden pins driven through auger-holes, and the ties, in turn,
                    were supported by heavy timbers, or "mud-sills" which, laid
                    end to end and bedded in the earth, afforded a foundation for the whole
                        structure.* Other forms of construction were
                    employed in some parts of the country, but, so far as we have been able to
                    learn, the mode described was the only one in Indiana prior to the changes that
                    came with improvements. The rolling stock was equally primitive. A locomotive,
                    having at first neither cow-catcher nor cab,â€ 
                    weighed perhaps from ten to thirteen tons, as against the seventy-five or one
                    hundred tons of to-day, and was capable of hauling twelve or fifteen cars
                    holding three tons each. Twenty miles an hour for passenger trains was a high
                    rate of speed. There is record, in 1840, of an engine drawing 221 tons forty
                    miles in three hours and forty-one minutes. The development of the locomotive
                    was retarded by the frail character of the tracks, as their weight crushed the
                    yielding flat bar into the wood and loosened the spikes. The strain, moreover,
                    very frequently caused the loosened rails to curl upward at the ends,
                    threatening punctures and derailment, and these "snake-heads,"
                    as they were called, had to be constantly guarded against. A 
                  
                     * Query: Did the general use of
                            "mud-sills" in railroad construction give rise to the
                            colloquial term as applied to the man who belongs to the sub-stratum of
                            society?
                  
                     â€  The innovation of a protecting cab
                            was at first objected to by the enginemen, as a dangerous trap in case
                            of accident
               
                     not uncommon occurrence was the stopping of
                    trains till the trainmen went ahead with a sledge-hammer to spike down rails.
                    There were other causes of delay not down on the schedules, among them being the
                    stoppage at some wayside stream or pool to replenish the water supply by dipping
                    up with leathern buckets that were carried on hooks at the side of the tender.
                    It is a plausible guess that from this job of the trainmen originated the
                    humoristic appellation of "jerk-water," so commonly applied.
                    to cheap and out-of-date roads. It may be added that locomotives were once
                    universally named as steamboats are to-day, the "General
                    Morris," "Reuben Wells," "Dillard
                    Rickets," etc., but illustrating the old custom of doing honor to men
                    of note in the railroad world.
            
               Railroad Mileage.â€“The railroad mileage in Indiana at
                    various periods, according to the census reports of 1890, was: 1860, 2,163;
                    1870, 3,177; 1880, 4,373; 1886, 5,711.96; 1887, 5,798.94; 1888, 5,890.26; 1889,
                    6,003.76; 1890, 6,090.66. The census abstract for 1900 gives no statistics of
                    steam railways.
            In closing this we may add the following from a work on railways
                    (Tuck's) issued in 1847: "In 1824 the first locomotive
                    traveled at the rate of six miles per hour; in 1829 the
                    'Rocket' traveled at the rate of fifteen miles per hour; in
                    1834 the 'Firefly' attained the speed of twenty miles per
                    hour; in 1839 the 'North Star' moved with a velocity of
                    thirty-seven miles per hour, and at the present moment locomotives have attained
                    the speed of seventy miles per hour." We have elsewhere seen it
                    recorded that as early as 1850 trains had attained a speed of sixty miles an
                    hourâ€“a somewhat astonishing fact considering the crude form of the
                    locomotive' at that period. We have nowhere seen any statement as to
                    such speed on Indiana roads, and, as said above, twenty miles per hour seems to
                    have been regarded as a high rate of speed.
            
               Errata and Omissions.â€“The date of the first work on
                    the L,. & I. railroad, given on page 153 should read 1834 instead of
                    1854. To the list of important lines mentioned on page 159 should be added the 
                        Ohio
                     & 
                        Mississippi
                    , which in 1857 became a completed  link in a continuous line that reached from 
                        Baltimore
                     to 
                        St. Louis
                    , "then the longest stretch of railroad track in the
                    world." The completion of the three lines making this
                    routeâ€“the 
                        Baltimore
                     & 
                        Ohio
                    , the Marietta & 
                        Cincinnati
                     and the 
                        Ohio
                     & 
                        Mississippi
                    â€“was the occasion of a great railroad celebration. The
                    first train over the road was a "Celebration Train," which was
                    filled with railroad and government dignitaries and was greeted with much
                    bunting and noise at all the towns along the way. The event was so notable as to
                    call forth a good-sized illustrated book descriptive of the trip, which volume
                    can be found in the State Library. Among the immediate influences of the
                    railroads should be mentioned the first State fair, held at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1852. The convenience of transportation afforded by them made
                    possible something larger than the local fairs that had previously existed. The
                    1,365 entries in this fair came from all over the State, and some of them from
                    other States, and they presented an industrial exhibit such as the westerners
                    had never seen before and such as was hardly' possible under the old
                    systems of transportation.

            FIRST CANAL SURVEYS.
            SINCE our article on early canals (published in September issue), we have learned
                    from a gazetteer of 1826 that at that early date a letter of instruction had
                    been issued from the 
                        United States
                     Engineering Department for the survey of four canal routes in the
                    State of Indiana, as follows: 1. To unite the waters of Lake
                    Michigan with the Wabash river, by the way of
                    the St. Joseph river valley. 2. The uniting of the
                        Wabash and White rivers by way of
                    the Mississinewa or the "Pouceanpi-cheax"
                    valley. 3. The uniting of the rivers at 
                        Ft. Wayne
                     with the Ohio river by way of the
                        Whitewater valley. 4. A canal "to turn the
                    Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     near 
                        Jeffersonville
                    ." In accordance with these instructions, the engineers,
                    says the gazetteer, "commenced their examinations on the Whitewater
                    route on the 8th of July, 1826." Whether anything was ever done on
                    surveys 1 and 2 we have not learned. The letter, as indicating a canal movement
                    at that date, adds an item to the history of the subject.

            DEERSKIN, tanned either with or without the hair, was much in use among the early
                    settlers of 
                        Henry county
                     for pantaloons, hunting shirts and moccasins, as well as for
                    g-loves and mittens. It is possible that the old rollicking song of 
                        "Leather breeches, full of stitches, Leather breeches, buttons
                            on," etc.
                     was inspired by the old backwoods article of clothing wrought from
                    "the red deer's tawny skin."
            A well-tanned and well-made suit of buckskin gave the wearer a rather neat and
                    jaunty appearance that had a very evident touch of aboriginal taste and
                    elegance. The hunting shirt, which could be worn as an outer garment, either
                    with or without a vest, was often made to fit closely and fasten about the waist
                    with a belt, though sometimes it was worn without a belt. It was made more
                    picturesque by heavy fringing around the edges made by cutting the buckskin into
                    thin strings, and occasionally a lover of primitive finery had his shirt and
                    moccasins ornamented with beads and brightly colored porcupine quills
                    bj' Indian women. The average deerskin uniform was tanned and made by
                    some man in the neighborhood who had some skill in that line of work. They were
                    sewed with thongs of leather or sinews, and would, with ordinary care, last for
                    years. Such a suit was very warm if thoroughly dry, but when wet was
                    distressingly uncomfortable and cold. After wetting, these buckskins had a way
                    of shrinking that was the reverse of pleasant  to the wearer as the nether garment crept upward toward his knees and the
                    shirt contracted about his middle.* This
                    liability to shrinkage made the washing of such a suit a difficult undertaking,
                    but it was effected by a method of manipulation, pounding and stretching applied
                    to the drying leather. In dry, cold weather the deerskin moccasins with warm
                    woollen socks inside made excellent footwear for out-of-doors service, but in
                    soft snow or wet weather they were worse than useless.
            Suits similar to those of deerskin in cut and make were wrought from the brown or
                    blue jeans, or linseys, the hunting-shirt being similarly ornamented with
                    fringes. The dye-stuffs most used by the pioneers were from the hulls of the
                    black or white walnuts and the inner barks of certain trees. In some parts of
                    the State the darker browns of the black walnut prevailed, in other parts the
                    tawny tints of the white walnut or butternut. 
                        Henry county
                     was a black walnut province. The more aristocratic
                    colorâ€“the color for Sunday and special occasion suitsâ€“was
                    indigo-blue, and the woman who knew how to manage the indigo in solution so as
                    to produce the best results was in great demand among those who aspired to
                    handsome clothes. Prepared indigo was an article of commerce, and for sale at
                    the village stores, but some of the settlers' wives raised their own
                    plants and manufactured the dyes for home use. Other dyes were made from madder
                    and copperas, maple bark and copperas, etc. These were made to alternate with
                    the blues and browns in striping and checking the linseys. Cloths and stockings
                    of a single color were often dyed after the weaving, but the better and surer
                    way was to dye them in the yarn.
            The early wearing apparel was, mostly, rough and coarse, and not very tastefully
                    made. The principal requirement was to be warm in winter and as cool as possible
                    in summer without much regard to appearance. All the boys and girls and many of
                    the men and women went barefooted from early spring to late autumn, while the
                    small child who was provided with a tow shirt that hung straight from the
                    shoulders to the heels was thought to be sufficiently clad for the warmer
                    seasons. The boys, when they 
                  
                     * An old-time story is to the effect
                            that one of the early school teachers seated himself behind his desk in
                            wet buckskins and did not rise or straighten himself out until they had
                            dried upon him. He then found himself encased as in a suit of tin, with
                            no provisions for jointsâ€“Editor.
               
                     were put into pantaloons, had them full
                    length, like their fathers, except that they were made several sizes too large,
                    for the wearer was expected to grow up to them and even outgrow them before they
                    would be worn out. But the drollest effect was produced when the boy of larger
                    growth donned his first real "Sunday-go-to-meeting" and
                    visiting suit. It was also of brown or blue jeans, better woven and more
                    carefully made than his earlier pants and roundabout had been, but like them
                    overlarge in all its parts. The trousers dragged and folded over his cowhide
                    shoes, bagged at the knees and in the seat, and, in common with the vest, had
                    sufficient girth for two boys, while the coat hung loose at the shoulders and
                    elbows and was turned up at the wrists. A round-crowned, stiff-rimmed wool hat
                    completed a picture of discomfort, self-consciousness, awkwardness and
                    greenness. When trying to be on his best behavior for the gratification of his
                    proud parents he was at his worst in the matter of appearance, and the joy
                    connected with the display was when he was allowed to slip out of his fine
                    raiment and back into his well-worn every-day togs, where he felt easy and at
                    home. The girls suffered much in the same way, and were made old in appearance
                    by the long skirts of their striped linsey or red flannel frocks.
            The roundabout or tailless coat was to the backwoods small boy what the
                    "warmus" or, as it was usually called,
                    "waumus," was to the men, except that it was a much neater
                    article of apparel. Not infrequently it was worn by men. The waumus was made
                    with or without a belt for the waist. Usually it was made like a shirt, and it
                    could be worn as such or over the vest and pants as a coat. The material for it
                    was either red flannel or linsey, plain or striped. It was the lineal successor
                    of the hunting-shirt, as the "sweater" of to-day is of the
                    waumus, and was admirably suited to the needs of the pioneer.
            The frock and habit were the chief outer garments of the women. In both, skirt
                    and body were attached to each other, making one garment. The fastenings were
                    hooks and eyes or ordinary brass pins for the habits and buttons for the frocks,
                    which latter fastened at the backs. For a good while silks, worsteds, and even
                    the better linens and cotton cloths, were scarce and high priced, but yet women
                    of the more prosperous neighborhoods were seldom without one or more gowns of
                    better  material than their own skill could
                    provide. Such dresses were reserved for great occasions and were treasured with
                    care. The home-made materials for women's wear were usually reinforced
                    by purchases of calicoes, muslins, bobinets, and the like. All the elderly women
                    wore caps. These were of various materials, from gaily decorated calico to
                    bobinets and fine book muslins and cambrics. Babies also wore caps of similar
                    material, but not all of them could afford the regulation long skirts that even
                    then seemed almost a necessity to early juvenile existence. In the linseys and
                    flannels of home manufacture there was much display of color, particularly of
                    red, gray, brown and blue, and even in underwear these colors were woven in
                    according to the fancy of the wearer. The tuck and ruffle were much in evidence
                    for relieving the monotony of a plain raiment, and there was more or less
                    evidence of a "fancy" taste, not only in feminine but in
                    masculine circles. The "dude" or dandy was not unknown, and
                    such a one arrayed in summer coat, pants and vest made of prettily figured
                    fabrics, occasionally flashed upon backwoods society. It used to be charged,
                    even, that the dandies of a neighboring county wore calico pantaloons with the
                    legs profusely ruffled, but this, doubtless, was the satire of envy or
                    disapproval.
            Turning from the typical backwoodsman to the professional and the well-to-do
                    classes that became more numerous as the country grew, we find a costuming more
                    picturesque than that which has followed it. With this class the swallow-tail
                    coat was as common as the straight-breasted "shad-belly" among
                    the Quakers. This garment, made of blue fuller's cloth or broadcloth
                    (though sometimes made of blue jeans), with trousers and vest of the same, was
                    double-breasted and radiant with a glittering array of brass buttons, and
                    imparted grandeur and dignity to the "gentleman of the old
                    school." Its accompaniment was a majestic
                    "bell-crowned" beaver hat, and a black silk stock or
                    "choker" over stiff buckram swathed his neck, holding up his
                    chin with painful stateliness. This "glass of fashion" was a
                    familiar figure to our fathers.
            The women of this class wore capes, mantles and shawls of various patterns and
                    materials. The long cloak of ample folds and the large shawls were mostly in
                    favor for the colder season.  These were, in
                    the earlier day, made from the softer parts of the fleeces by the local spinners
                    and weavers upon warps of flax or cotton to give the fabric greater strength.
                    Within a few years, however, the merchants began to carry stocks of shawls of
                    many colors, subdued or gay, that took the place of the home-made articles.
                    These ranged in size from the neat little shoulder shawl to those that a woman
                    could wrap herself in and defy the storm and cold. The Quaker women preferred
                    soft, fleecy grays or browns, and a distinguishing feature of their attire was a
                    neat shawl or cape of these colors supplemented by a neatly-folded white cambric
                    handkerchief at the throat. There were no ruffles or flounces upon their skirts,
                    and the figures as well as the hues were delicate and in good taste. They
                    eschewed jewelry except, perhaps, a modest throat pin. Their bonnets for public
                    wear were made of silk wrought upon buckram frames in the quaint fashion of the
                    mothers of the sect in 
                        England
                    , and in colors were soft grays for the younger women, darker grays
                    and browns for the middle-aged and shiny black for the old. As the fashions did
                    not change, two or three silk bonnets lasted through a lifetime. A familiar
                    dress bonnet among women (other than Friends) was one of Leghorn straw with a
                    flaring front-piece and a curiously-placed crown, the whole resembling an
                    inverted coal-scuttle, decked out with brightly-colored ribbons and artificial
                    flowers. Fashions did not change much in 
                        Henry county
                     from year to year during the first two decades of its history, but
                    by 1845 variations in styles and cuts began to be more frequent, and since 1850
                    they have kept pace with the changes in other things. The introduction of
                    factory goods relieved not a little the absorbing tasks of the women. Before
                    1840 denims came in to take the place of tow and home-woven linen, and
                    "brown Holland," a kind of finer linen, came into vogue for
                    men's better summer suits. The boot for men and boys was introduced
                    after the opening of the country, when muddy roads and fields made them a
                    necessity, and they were worn almost universally for many years, or until
                    drainage and a drier surface caused a partial reversion to shoes.
            One article of apparel that seemed to belong especially to the old-time gentleman
                    was the blue or black cloth cloak, made with or with a cane and with collars
                    collars of silk velvet. They were  fastened
                    at the throat with a large, ornamental hook and eye of bronze or silver, or with
                    a cord, button and tassel. The body of the garment was of French broadcloth or a
                    cloth of French weave made exclusively for cloaks. For bad or stormy weather the
                    "surtout," or over-all-coat, was used, but for all occasions
                    when a light, stylish upper garment was desirable the cloak was the thing. At a
                    later date the shawl had its day as a gentleman's upper garment, but
                    its fitness as such was never so obvious as that of the cloak or topcoat, and
                    ere long it made its final exit.
            
               Old-Time Travelers and Taverns.â€“When the old-time
                    traveler prepared for a journey, he tallowed up his shoes until they shone, and
                    protected his legs between the shoe-tops and the knees by wrapping green baize
                    leggings about them, tying the same with green strings. He donned his
                    "surtout," or cloak, or made it into a roll to be strapped
                    tightly behind the saddle, and, if the weather demanded, substituted a coonskin
                    cap for the customary "plug." Indispensable adjuncts to the
                    outfit were the bulging leather saddle-bags, equivalent to the
                    "grip" of the modern traveler. This double pouch, which lay
                    across the saddle, could be made to hold almost anything, from a change of
                    apparel to a box of Moffett's anti-bilious pills; from a bottle of
                    whisky or tansy bitters for warding off ague to' an extra set of
                    horseshoes. Gentlemen always shaved themselves in those days, and the inevitable
                    part of the outfit was a wooden shaving box with a mirror about the size of a
                    Spanish silver dollar in the lid, and a brush of hog's bristles,
                    together with a mottled cake of sassafras soap.
            One class of early settlers always avoided the public houses, and, relying upon
                    Hoosier hospitality, inquired by the way for the houses of members of their
                    church or for people of repute for open-handedness known to have spare beds.
                    Such folks would ride to the farthest corner of the State and back again with
                    less expense than they could stay at home. Others, however, among whom were most
                    of the lawyers, doctors, business men and the more prosperous farmers, stopped
                    at the old-time taverns. He who entered one of these generous hostleries from
                    the discomforts of a hard ride through mud and rain, experienced to the fullest
                    the pleasures of tavern hospitality. He was made welcome  to a seat beside the cheery open fire. A boy
                    stripped off his leggings, took his great-coat and hat and bore them off to be
                    dried. His shoes were also taken off to be brushed and blacked up, and in lieu
                    of them a pair of "pomps" supplied, along with a glass of
                    something warm to "take off the chill." The
                    "pomp" was a slipper minus the counter which encases the heel,
                    into which the foot could be easily thrust, and though the heel of the pomp
                    flapped loosely on the floor with every step of the wearer, it served very well
                    as a protection and was a comfortable substitute for the wet shoe. Every
                    well-patronized tavern had a closetful of this cheap but convenient footwear.
            
               Superstitions.â€“If a horse tangled its mane and
                    twisted it into loops by rubbing against the stall, it was said to have been
                    ridden by witches. Eggs that would not hatch, cream that would not churn and
                    children that had fits were thought of as "bewitched," and
                    some person in the neigborhood, usually an old woman, was sure to be brought
                    under suspicion as the cause. Belief in spells and power with the evil one also
                    prevailed with many. Negroes were often regarded as possessing mysterious
                    powers, such as the ability to foretell the weather, tell fortunes and effect
                    wonderful cures. The charm doctor existed, and was consulted by sufferers from
                    all sorts of ills, both mental and physical, despite frequent and flagrant
                    dupings. The people themselves practiced a great many spells and charms. They
                    sold their warts or drove them away by rubbing over them notched sticks and
                    hiding or burning the sticks. Some carried buckeyes in their pockets to keep off
                    rheumatism, while others carried potatoes for the same purpose. If a teamster
                    cut himself he smeared the ax or knife with tar from the spindle of his wagon.
                    Asafetida, catnip, southernwood, chamomile and certain other herbs were supposed
                    to ward off contagious diseases if worn about the person. A cure for epilepsy or
                    falling sickness was to split the body of a standing shellbark hickory tree,
                    wedging it far apart, and passing the body of the patient three times through
                    the opening. The wedges were then knocked out, and if the parts grew together
                    the cure was assured. Cows that were poisoned by eating buckeye leaves were
                    jolted on the forehead with the square end of a fence rail or pole. These
                    superstitions were common among the more ignorant in early days.
         
         
         
            INDIANAPOLIS IN 1843 â€” A HENRY WARD BEECHER LETTER.
            WE ARE indebted to Mr. W. H. Ragan, of 
                        Washington, D. C
                    , for a copy of this interesting letter, which was originally
                    published in Hovey's Magazine of Horticulture, of
                            
                  Boston, Mass.
                It contains
                    information not to be found elsewhere, both as to horticulture in Indiana and
                    conditions in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at an early day. We have omitted an unimportant preliminary
                    paragraph.
            
                    
                  
                     
                        "In this State we have an area a little more than four
                                    times greater than 
                                        Massachusetts
                                    . There are eighteen nurseries, whose proprietors
                                    are chiefly supported by their sales. Apple trees sell for ten,
                                    and pear for twenty cents. An orchard is to be found upon almost
                                    every farm, and lately the pear has been more than ever sought
                                    after. At our October fair [county fair] was exhibited the
                                    greatest variety of fruits and flowers ever exhibited in this
                                    Stateâ€“perhaps I may say in the West. From fifty-five
                                    to sixty varieties of apples were shown, and forty-three new
                                    seedling apples competed for a premium. A branch of the R. I.
                                    Greening was exhibited, two feet in length, bearing fifteen
                                    apples, weighing 12 lbs. 9 oz. I send you a brief account of the
                                    fair, enclosed in some other papers. You will see a beet
                                    mentioned, weighing thirty-two lbs. You will also see three
                                    seedling apples named and recommended for
                                    cultivationâ€“Tariff, Red Jacket, and
                                    Osceolaâ€“the first two, capital fall apples, the last
                                    supposed to be a first-rate late winter apple. Those which we
                                    have are not yet ripe (January 24), nor at all fit for eating.
                                    The number of seedling apples in this State is very great, and
                                    some of them, in the neighborhood in which they grow, are
                                    esteemed more highly by the settlers than the old standard
                                    fruits. The soil and climate so modify the flavor and other
                                    qualities of the apple that there is some reason for believing
                                    that an apple originated on any given soil, will be better than
                                    many which are introduced into it; for though the apple is
                                    raised with great facility in almost every soil, yet it is
                                    probable that each variety affects a particular one and will
                                    refuse its most perfect qualities  to all except that one. Thus, I
                                    perceive, the most popular apples of 
                                        New England
                                     are nativesâ€“the R. I. Greening,
                                    Hubbardston Nonsuch, Roxbury Russett, Baldwin, Minster, etc. The
                                    choice apples of the middle States are natives of them, and to a
                                    very considerable extent this is becoming true of the West.
                        "The annual meeting of our society is held during the
                                    winter, that the greater number of citizens from abroad during
                                    the sessions of our courts and legislatures may be reached and
                                    interested in this subject. I shall send you the reports,
                                    address and proceedings of our winter meeting as soon as they
                                    are published. I omitted to mention that on selling the fruit
                                    last October, great competition arose for the pears, and they
                                    sold at 12Â½, 25 and 50 cents apiece, many of them. I
                                    obtained the only specimen of the Duchesse d'Angouleme
                                    (the first I believe which has ripened in the State) for the
                                    moderate price of 62Â½ cents. I am afraid I should
                                    have doubled the bid rather than have lost her ladyship; and if
                                    all duchesses are of equal worth commend me to their society. I
                                    need not say I was 'somewhat filled' with her
                                    company. It was not a dear bargain in the sequel, for the
                                    gentleman who raised it was so much pleased with my enthusiasm
                                    for his favorite that he presented me a tree of the same kind,
                                    and one of the Beurre d'Aremberg.
                        "You will perceive, when you obtain the report of our
                                    winter meeting, that a premium of fifty dollars is offered for
                                    seedling apples, other premiums to encourage gardens, the
                                    obtaining of choice fruit trees, introduction of hardy shrubs
                                    and flowers, etc. Our great design is to awaken in the body of
                                    the peopleâ€”among farmers, artizans and men of small
                                    meansâ€“a taste for fruit and flowers, and to fill the
                                    State, from the beginning, with the most select varieties. The
                                    peach, plum, cherry, apple, pear, quince, apricot, and small
                                    fruits might search through our land and find no better soil and
                                    climate for their perfection than that of Indiana. Our variable
                                    springs are almost the only obstacle. Long summers, brilliantly
                                    clear atmosphere, great warmth, and dryness during the fall
                                    ripening months, give our fruit great size, color, and flavor.
                                    If the mass of the community take hold earnestly, amateur
                                    cultivators will spring up of themselves. A.s it is I remember
                                    very few gardens in 
                                        Massachusetts
                                    , except near large cities, which could compare with
                                    ten or twenty in this town (
                                        Indianapolis
                                     is a town of about the size of 
                                        Northampton
                                    ).
                        
                        "In going to 
                                        Terre Haute
                                     last summer I stopped at a small, poverty-stricken
                                    little town called Mt. Meridian; shackly houses, huts and
                                    hovels, pale faces and ragged children gave no great expectation
                                    of refinements. Putting up at the best tavern (at the West, no
                                    matter how small the town, there are always from two to five or
                                    even eight taverns to choose among), I soon retired to bed as
                                    the easiest way of reaching next morning. On rising and going
                                    into the rear of the building for washing water (we are always
                                    allowed to help ourselves in such trifles), I found the well
                                    standing in the middle of a very beautiful little flower
                                    gardenâ€“neat beds full of flowers, cleaned walks,
                                    trimmed borders. I could hardly trust my eyes. From the rear of
                                    the grounds I could almost throw a stone into the primeval
                                    forests, whose fragments yet lingered in parts of the garden;
                                    and the house was itself poorer than many a barn which I have
                                    seen in 
                                        Pennsylvania
                                     and 
                                        Massachusetts
                                    . Opening a rude wicket gate, I entered a spot of
                                    nearly an acre, well laid out and filled with the choicest
                                    vegetables, growing with the most vigorous health. Currants,
                                    raspberries (white and red Antwerp), strawberries, gooseberries,
                                    were thriving, and many select varieties of pear and apple. The
                                    whole garden bore evidence of careful cultivation and good
                                    taste. Such a spot, in such a town, and behind such a house,
                                    surrounded and almost overshadowed by the forest, and produced,
                                    not by wealth, but by the personal labor of one man, poor and
                                    advanced in life, delighted me more, I do believe, than would
                                    the grounds of the 
                                        London
                                     Horticultural Society. If every county in our State
                                    had one such citizen I should not fear for horticultural
                                    interests in our State. The best assortment of seeds and plants
                                    which our town will afford shall be at the service of such a
                                    cultivator the coming spring.
                        "You will be pleased to learn that many of the pears
                                    which have given out in 
                                        New England
                                     do well as yet with us. The St. Michael (or fall
                                    butter, as it is called here), thrives and bears excellently
                                    well, though Kenrick, following Fessenden, says that in 
                                        New England
                                     it is 'an outcast, intolerable even to the
                                    sight.' The specimens at our fall fair could hardly be
                                    surpassed.
                        "A number of public-spirited gentlemen have associated,
                                    to plant all the private streets in this town with shade trees.
                                    We shall select from the ample stock of our own forests, mostly.
                                         But it is proposed to
                                    put in a number of pear and plum treesâ€“ the first
                                    being a beautiful shaped tree as well as fruitful, and the plum,
                                    it is thought, will be free from the curculio, planted upon a
                                    highway. In the three squares upon which stand the State House,
                                    Court House, and Governor's House, it is proposed to
                                    gather and plant a specimen of all our forest trees.
                        "This reminds me of an incident in our early town
                                    history related to me by one of the first settlers. A large
                                    circle of nearly four acres was reserved in the center of the
                                    town and the native trees, sugar maples, left standing upon it.
                                    Under these trees, before churches were built, religious
                                    meetings were held in summer, and the prospect was that our town
                                    would have an adornment of this little grove which no
                                    architecture can bestow. One morning, however, he was attracted
                                    thither by the sound of an axe, and found one of the leading
                                    lawyers of the place exercising himself, as a preparation for
                                    breakfast, in felling one of the largest trees. It was too far
                                    cut to be saved. And so good an example could not be lost upon
                                    others. One by one these magnificent trees disappeared. Now we
                                    have a huge yellow brick building in the center of this circle;
                                    about a dozen locusts, with stems half as large as
                                    one's wrist, have for the three last years been
                                    struggling for life until they seem weary and faint, and so
                                    stand still.
                        "The Court House Square, something larger than the
                                    former piece of ground, was covered with a noble growth of
                                    stately trees, and it was determined to save them. A man was
                                    set, however, to thin out the plat, and being left to his own
                                    discretion, he felled all the younger trees and left the very
                                    old and tall ones standing. As might have been expected, the
                                    first wind, finding an easy passage through, uprooted a
                                    multitude of trees, and the citizens, to save the rest from a
                                    like fate, chopped them down instantly, and happily relieved
                                    this square, too, from unpleasant shade. All is not yet told. At
                                    a later day a number of gentlemen procured an order (if I
                                    mistake not) from the county commissioners to plant out the
                                    ground with shade trees, and a large number of the locust was
                                    set. However, that nothing might break in upon the practice of
                                    the county, the jailer's cow was permitted to pasture
                                    upon the plat, and in sight of the citizens she proceeded
                                    patiently to bark the trees or break  them down, until not a single one
                                    was left. A gentleman not without a taste for horticulture, from
                                    day to day, saw, from his office door, this destruction, as he
                                    informed me with great naivete, as though it
                                    were a sin to interfere and save the trees. Thus, in all our
                                    towns, comes first, extermination; then come scorching summer
                                    suns, and too late the wish that the trees had been spared; and
                                    at last planting begins, and we who live amid the immense
                                    forests of a new countryâ€“on whose town plat, not
                                    fifteen years ago, grew immense oaks, maples, sycamores,
                                    beeches, tulip trees and elmsâ€“are planting the short
                                    lived locusts {Robi-nia pseudo-acacia) to
                                    obtain a speedy shade! I can think of but three forest trees now
                                    standing in this town within a space one mile
                                    squareâ€“two elms and one buckeye. The same scenes are
                                    enacting in every town which springs up at the West. We are
                                    gaining meadows, and corn bottoms, and green hillsides, and town
                                    plats, by an utter extermination of the forest. Here and there
                                    an Indian may be found lingering around the old possessions of
                                    his nation, as if to mourn their loss, and to remind us of his
                                    ancestors; but of the forest, it is almost true that not a
                                    single tree is left to recall to our minds the glory of its
                                    fellows. Indeed, I have thought that those who were obliged to
                                    clear farms or timber land, imbibe the same feelings toward
                                    trees which the pioneers have toward the Indiansâ€“as
                                    things to be destroyed, of course. This devastation of our
                                    forests the political economist regards as a blunder, and says
                                    it is an unthrifty practice, but one who looks upon trees almost
                                    as if they had souls, witnesses this needless extermination with
                                    some feelings which can not be expressed in the pound and penny
                                    language of the mere economist. I think it is Michaux who
                                    pronounces the full-grown elm to be the most magnificent
                                    production of the vegetable kingdom. Is not an old, and tall,
                                    and broad, and healthy tree nobler to the eye than any temple or
                                    cathedral? The wonder of a century's growth ends in an
                                    hour by some man who never for one single moment thinks of the
                                    majesty or beauty of his victimâ€“who only thinks how
                                    soonest to get it down, and burned up, and out of the way of the
                                    plough.

                                     and myself have just returned from an excursion
                                    made into the

                                     lands, and should you consider the following sketch
                                    worth an insertion in your paper for the amusement of your
                                    readers, and the information of emigrants and persons wishing to

                        We travelled the new cut road from this place to 
                                        Geneva
                                     (on Sandy), a new town laid out on the old Indian
                                    boundary line, about eight miles from this place in a N. W.
                                    direction. We then took a new cut road (opened to Flat Rock
                                    sufficient for waggons), which bears nearly N 45 W. The first
                                    stream we crossed after leaving Person's mill on Sandy,
                                    is called little Sandy; the second, Leatherwood; the third,
                                    Fallen Timber Creek (all appropriate names). We next passed a
                                    remarkable beaver dam, in which the ingenuity of these animals
                                    is wonderfully exhibited. The 4th stream is Flat creek, the 5th
                                    Deer creek, the 6th Crooked creek; all of which streams will
                                    answer for light machinery, and run to the S. W., the bottoms
                                    generally gravelly and water very clear. We next came to a
                                    stream by the name of Clifty, sufficient for any kind of water
                                    works, and about ten miles distant in the new purchase. I think,
                                    without exaggeration, that every quarter section that may be
                                    laid out in this ten miles, will be fit for cultivation and will
                                    be settled. The lands are of a black, sandy quality, timbered
                                    with black ash and beech principally. The general face of the
                                    country is rather inclined to a plain, with the hollows rather
                                    wet. The lands on Clifty are very rich and well timbered on both
                                    sides of the stream with blue ash, walnut, sugar tree, honey
                                    locust, beech, &c.
                        After crossing this stream we came to a most beautiful walnut
                                    ridge, about one and a half'miles north of Clifty. We
                                    next  crossed Middle creek,
                                    then Grassy creek, then Tough creek, Stillwater and Pleasant
                                    Run, all of which are small mill streams running to the S. W.,
                                    some of which have very muddy bottoms, and lie between Cliffy
                                    and Flat Rock at the distance of seven miles. In this seven
                                    miles the lands are principally very rich and level, the valleys
                                    rather wet, and timbered principally with oak, black ash,
                                    walnut, sugar tree, poplar, hickory, &c, until we came
                                    to the lands immediately on Flat Rock. These lands exhibit a
                                    scenery I never expected to see in Indiana. They resemble the
                                    rich lands on the two Elkhorns in 
                                        Kentucky
                                    , for richness and timber, and to appearance, abound
                                    on both sides of the stream, which has a gravel bottom and is
                                    about 80 yards wide. On the north side of this creek we found
                                    only one stream (Sugar creek) until we arrived at Driftwood
                                        [Blue river], about eight miles in a S.
                                    W. direction from where we crossed Flat Rock. The lands between
                                    these two streams are level and very dry, timbered with white
                                    oak, black oak, walnut, honey locust, underbrush, spice wood,
                                    dog wood and hazel. We found beautiful rich and level lands on
                                    both sides of Driftwood, and well timbered. The river (by
                                    counting our horses' steps) was 180 yards wide where we
                                    crossed it. I think there are very few springs in this country,
                                    but believe water may be had with very little labor. To sum up
                                    my views on the subject, I am of the opinion that if 
                                        Jefferson County
                                     would make a good highway in the direction to this
                                    place, that 
                                        Madison
                                     would be the key on the Ohio
                                    river to one of the best tracts of country I have
                                    seen in this State; and a delay will speedily bring forward some
                                    other point as the country is now settling. We met two families
                                    and teams on the road to this Eden.

            OHIO VALLEY HISTORY CONFERENCE.
            Of the Central Ohio Valley History Conference, which held
                    its first meeting at 
                        Cincinnati
                    , November 29 and 30, Mr. Frank P. Goodwin, the secretary, writes:
                    "We had a very profitable meeting-, and I feel sure that the cause of
                    local history in the Ohio valley has been materially
                    advanced. A committee will prepare a program for the second meeting to be held
                    at some place to be selected a year from now, and at that time they will report
                    a plan of permanent organization. The committee consists of I. J. Cox,

            INDIANA UNIVERSITY HISTORY CLUBâ€“A NEW STATE BUILDING.
            Indiana University has a history club that is, we believe, more actively
                    interested in the question of local history than any other college club or class
                    in the State. Under its stimulus considerable research work has been done, some
                    of the students having written themes along this line. Through the newspaper
                    columns we occasionaly hear of the club's alertness in local matters.
                    At a recent meeting it took time by the forelock and began the agitation of two
                    live questions that will probably require considerable stirring before there are
                    material results. These are, an Indiana Centennial celebration in 1916, and the
                    erection of a building at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in which "all the historical documents obtainable relating
                    to the State should be placed." This latter question, in our opinion,
                    is one of special importance. It is only a question of time till the State must
                         have a building of the kind suggested,
                    and the need, indeed, is already pressing for new quarters, such as
                            
                  Wisconsin, Iowa
                and some other States
                    have provided themselves with. The State House is now overcrowded; the State
                    Library is growing beyond its present space; the State Museum presents and for
                    some time has presented a case of arrested growth, and Mr. Blatchley has
                    repeatedly been obliged to decline articles for the collection for lack of space
                    for them; the Indiana Historical Society, which long had its room in the
                    capitol, is now turned out of house and home, without a place other than private
                    offices for its meetings, and with its collection partly boxed and partly in
                    charge of the State Library. The need is for a building that shall house these,
                    along with the Library Commission, the Academy of Science, and kindred
                    interests, and it behooves all those who think so to get together and give what
                    aid they can to Librarian D. C. Brown, who has already entered on the campaign.
            THE HARRISON FARM NEAR CORYDON.
            What is known as the Harrison place, six miles northwest of Corydon, was once,
                    according to local tradition, the holding of William Henry Harrison. Mr. Hubbard
                    M. Smith, the historian of 
                        Vincennes
                    , writes to us upon that point. He thinks that General Harrison has
                    probably been confused with Christopher Harrison. General Harrison, he points
                    out, had his residence at 
                        Vincennes
                     from 1801 till 1812, when he was appointed commander of the
                    Northwest Territory, with headquarters in 
                        Ohio
                    , and never again resided in Indiana. Christopher Harrison, on the
                    other hand, who was elected Lieutenant-Governor in 1816, resided, presumably, at
                    or near Corydon, and his ownership of the farm in question was quite probable.
                    This seems plausible, but it illustrates the dangers of reasoning from
                    probabilities on obscure historical points. D. P. Lemon, in his little pamphlet
                    on Corydon, states that General William Henry Harrison "bought of the
                    general government, in an early day, all of section 19, township 3, south of
                    range 3 east; also a part of section 30, township 3, south of range 3 east. This
                    land is all in one body and contains 829.20 acres." Mr. Lemon further
                    says: "The records in the recorder's office of 
                        Harrison county
                     show that William Henry Harrison and his wife Anna, on the 6th day
                    of July,  1817, deeded the land mentioned to
                    Joshua Wilson and Abijah Bay less for the consideration often thousand
                    dollars." It is not improbable, indeed, that General Harrison may have
                    owned and improved land near Corydon and yet never have resided there.
            REVOLUTIONARY GRAVES.
            Names of Revolutionary soldiers buried in Indiana that have come to our knowledge
                    since our last issue are as follow:
            Rev. Jesse Vawter, of 
                        Jefferson county
                    . Buried in the graveyard at Wirt, a few miles northwest of Madison.
                    Died March 20, 1838, aged 82 years. Alexander C. Chambers. Ebenezer churchyard,
                    one mile south of 
                  Kent, Jefferson county
               . Joel Bishop, of 
                        New Jersey
                    . Graveyard at Canaan, 
                        Jefferson county
                    . Died 1847. George Blake, Pisgah graveyard, Graham township, 
                        Jefferson county
                    . Samuel Walch. Accidentally killed in the forties. Buried at 
                        Madison
                    . James George, died near Southport, 
                        Marion county
                    , perhaps sixty years ago. Buried at Round Hill
                    graveyard on "Three-notch" road, about five miles south of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Authority, Harley Richardson, of Southport. Suel Gilbert, died
                    November, 1843. Buried at 
                        Muncie
                    . Authority, the 
                  
                            Delaware County
                         Democrat. Charles DePauw, died August 31, 1814. Buried in
                    cemetery at 
                  Salem, Washington county
               . Stone gives his
                    Revolutionary record.
            Authority for the first five is material in possession of Miss Drusilla L.
                    Cravens, of 
                        Madison
                    . From this source, also, we get this interesting scrap concerning
                    pensioners. It is from a journal of George Fitzhugh, covering the period
                    1838-1843:
            
                    
                  
                     
                        "Have had several Revolutioners here [at 
                                        Madison
                                    ] for their pensions. One named Johnson, 82 years
                                    old, fought under 
                                        Greene
                                     in 
                                        North Carolina
                                    . A recent reform(?) has made it necessary for these
                                    poor creatures to assemble at one point in the State. Some get
                                    $80 a year, paid semi-annually; some $20.
                                    One poor cripple came 100 miles and received but
                                    $10."
