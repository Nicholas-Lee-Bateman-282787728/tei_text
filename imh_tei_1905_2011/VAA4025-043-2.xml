            <p>When Indiana became the nineteenth state in the Union in 1816, the country was approaching a
                    financial crisis. Inflation continued until the latter part of 1818, to be followed by a real
                    collapse in 1819. The early history of the new state was therefore marked by a boom, a panic and a
                    depression. There was much hardship and discouragement as recovery was a slow process. How the
                    pioneers who lived in the settled areas of the frontier commonwealth of Indiana passed through the
                    years that centered around 1820 makes an interesting story.</p>
            <p>It is helpful to realize that Indiana was once a colony of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as truly as the old thirteen states had been colonies of Great Britain. Though the
                    colonial status of an American territory ended politically when statehood was attained, economically
                    and socially, a colonial condition usually continued for some years. Indiana remained a colony
                    almost to the Civil War in several respects. The white population of Indiana, at the time of
                    admission to the Union, occupied a comparatively narrow belt along the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> extending up the Whitewater Valley at the southeast and up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at the southwest. In 1816 by far the greater portion of the state was unsettled except
                    by Indians. This meant that most of the state was yet to be colonized by settlers from the older
                    states and from Europe. As late as 1840, there remained in Indiana well above four million acres of
                    unsold lands.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Thus a quarter of a century after statehood was conferred, less
                    than four-fifths of the state had been colonized.</p>

                    territories in a similar stage of development. These diverse elements brought in a variety of
                    ideals, traits of character and customs and built a civilization where none had existed before. It
                    was a fact of deep importance for any family to be a part of such a movement and process.</p>
            <p>When the Teutonic peoples overran the provinces of the Roman Empire, they occupied a country long
                    inhabited by civilized people. They found highly developed language, literature, laws, institutions,
                    and economic systems. The invaders were in time absorbed by the civilization in the midst of which
                    they found themselves, and, at best, did no more than modify it. In America, in the vast interior
                    more than along the Atlantic seaboard, there was seemingly a grand opportunity to build a new regime
                    such as the world had never seen. To many Americans, it has seemed that such a process was actually
                    carried through, but such a notion will bear examination.</p>
            <p>Partly from choice, but more from necessity, the builders of civilization in what is now the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> did modify accustomed ways of living and institutions. Daring, inventive, and ingenious
                    minds were stimulated by the conditions that pioneers faced as long as frontier communities
                    prevailed. Frontier forces did tend to be leveling and iconoclastic. On the other hand, it is
                    characteristic of most people who are free to develop their own institutions that they are averse to
                    any large amount of experimentation. That this truth has been widely exemplified is attested by the
                    fact that whenever and wherever special groups attempted to establish communities unlike the
                    familiar type in frontier regions, their members were regarded as cranks and their establishments as
                    unique but impossible. Even colonies planted to be the homes of new religious faiths or new types of
                    governments, were usually quite orthodox in regard to about everything else.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    bread to conducting weddings and funerals. In most instances, pioneers who did not know frontier
                    life until they had reached maturity changed their ways not from choice but because it was
                    necessary. Those who were born on the frontier or were carried thither as young children, never
                    having known an older society, more easily accepted pioneer habits and conditions as normal. It was
                    this indigenous element, not those who came to the fringes of civilization from well-established
                    communities, that included the real pioneers. In every frontier state, county, or neighborhood,
                    there were, of course, both types, and leaders came from each.</p>
            <p>There is something fascinating about this classification of pioneers and the fact that living on the
                    frontier affected the two groups differently. Mature men and women who came to the Indiana frontier

                    in some older area, were obliged to adjust themselves to crude living conditions. Their children
                    started life on the frontier and knew nothing different until conditions in the new area were
                    transformed with the passing of years. It should be remembered that these children of the frontier
                    missed opportunities to which their parents had enjoyed comparatively easy access during childhood
                    and youth. This was a trial to earnest and thoughtful fathers and mothers, and it caused them to
                    long for and work for the time when advantages left behind in old communities could be furnished to
                    their children.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The movement of colonists to the Old Northwest was slow in the early years of the nineteenth century,
                    because of poor transportation facilities and the hostility of Indians to the transformation of
                    their hunting grounds into farms. The natives were naturally hostile to the colonists who killed off
                    and drove away their game and rendered impossible their accustomed manner of living. This the French
                    and British furtraders had not done, but had instead enhanced the well-being of the Indians. It was
                    the War of 1812 that largely solved the Indian problems of the Old Northwest, especially in relation
                    to <placeName>

                    Territory began. It was this onset of colonists that enabled the territorial leaders to speed up the
                    movement for statehood, which, as everyone knows, came to fruition in 1816.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was necessary for a territory of the Old Northwest to show a population of sixty thousand free
                    inhabitants, under the terms of the Ordinance of 1787, before statehood could be granted. A
                    territorial census was taken in 1815, and the count revealed 63,897 persons in the thirteen counties
                    that had been formed. Among these were 12,112 males over twenty-one years of age. Indians and unfree
                    residents were not included.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> It was indeed a generous government that permitted
                    a province with such a meager population to become a state equal to the existing eighteen states in
                    the Union. The great colonizing peoples of history–Greeks, Romans, Spaniards, French,
                    Dutch, English–had none of them ever evolved anything comparable in the way of government
                    for a colony to that embodied in the Ordinance of 1787.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>After the framing of their first state constitution in 1816, the enthusiasts among the citizens of
                    Indiana who yearned for statehood worked feverishly to finish their project.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> In
                    fact, they exceeded the speed limit as the new state government was a going concern more than a
                    month before Congress passed the resolution admitting Indiana to the Union on December 11, 1816. The
                    members of the General Assembly met in Corydon and organized on the fourth of November, the state
                    officials were sworn in three days later, and Jonathan Jennings delivered his first message as
                    governor on that day. It seems a bit strange, but it is true, that Congress sitting in the distant
                    federal capital, acted readily in the matter of conferring statehood on Indiana, disregarding the
                    fact that, out on the raw edge of the frontier in a crude village, a state government was already
                    functioning. Since nothing ever came of it, there was no cause for worry over the premature
                    launching of that government in the western wilderness.</p>
            <p>On the theory that Indiana was already a state because a convention authorized by an enabling act of
                    Congress had framed a constitution, the General Assembly participated in the presidential election
                    of 1816–1817. Three presidential electors were chosen by the Assembly three weeks before
                    the passage of the statehood resolution by Congress on December 11. The sealed votes of these three
                    electors were sent to <placeName>

                    </placeName> to be opened on the first Wednesday in February of 1817, when the electoral votes of
                    the country were to be counted. The two Senators from Indiana were seated on December 12, the day
                    following the passage of the statehood resolution, but the lone Representative from the new state
                    had been given the oath of office and allowed to take his seat on December 2, nine days before
                    Congress acted on the matter of statehood.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Was Indiana a state before December
                    11, 1816? This question was raised when Congress met in joint session to convass the

                            advocates of immediate statehood. The opposition argued that the population of the territory
                            were not yet ready for statehood, stressing especially the financial burden that would be
                            incurred. The opponents of statehood did not exert much influence. See Donald F. Carmony,

                    returned to their chamber. The House then debated the question warmly and two conflicting
                    resolutions were offered, but both were indefinitely postponed leaving the question unsettled. The
                    two houses again met in joint session, and Indiana's three votes were counted last. Had the
                    election been very close, her votes could have been extremely important. As it was, the total vote
                    stood 183 for James <placeName>

            <p>The energy and haste displayed by the promoters of statehood for Indiana were in tune with the spirit
                    that prevailed among the aggressive elements to be found in the scattered communities of the new
                    commonwealth. The population of the territory, already reduced to approximately the present limits
                    of Indiana, was only 23,890 when the federal census of 1810 was taken. Progress was extremely slow
                    from 1800 to 1813. With the disappearance of the Indian menace in the latter year, settlers began to
                    pour into Indiana so rapidly that the population trebled from 1813 to the end of 1816.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The incoming tide continued to increase until it was sharply checked by the financial
                    collapse of 1819. The population of the new state increased but little during the first half of
                    1820, and the census figure of that year, which was 147,178, means that the population practically
                    doubled during the years 1817, 1818, and 1819.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

            <p>Nothing produced more excitement and restless activity in a frontier state with few people and a vast
                    amount of unoccupied land than a great inrush of colonists. To Indiana, in the boom period that
                    ended in 1819, there came hordes of homeseekers and people seeking business opportunities, among
                    whom were many speculators. At the time, the zeal of the speculators was greatly enhanced by the
                    prevailing inflation and by the credit system under which lands were purchased at the government
                    land offices. Farmers already established <list type="footnotes">

                            movement was below normal. Hard times had come with a vengeance by the spring of 1820 and
                            there were few arrivals. The assumption that the population of Indiana when the census was
                            taken in 1820 was practically the same as a year earlier is a fair one.</item>

                    grain, horses, cows, and hogs, since all newcomers had some money and nearly all of them were
                    anxious to make some purchases. Even the poorest of those, who came in with the object of acquiring
                    land to be converted into farms, were tempted to buy as much as possible. If they succeeded in
                    purchasing at the minimum price of two dollars per acre, it was only necessary to pay one-fourth
                    down, and to most buyers, it seemed good policy to buy four times as much as it would be possible to
                    purchase with the resources in hand should full payment be made in cash. Men who came to the
                    frontier to speculate, of course, took advantage of the opportunity to buy as heavily as possible in
                    order to hold the lands purchased for sale later at a profit.</p>
            <p>Everyone who had land for sale was very happy to see colonists swarm into the developing counties of
                    Indiana. Then as now, men were stimulated by rapidly increasing population to expand businesses or
                    engage in new ventures and were pleased to see prices go up. The same conditions that encouraged
                    heavy land sales, the expansion of mercantile business and transportation also favored an undue
                    development of banking. Aside from the general boom that spread over the country, there would have
                    been a period of exciting prosperity in frontier Indiana from 1813 to 1819. With the added stimulus
                    of widespread inflation, reckless speculation and overexpansion of trade, the boom in Indiana
                    reached a much more dangerous height than would otherwise have been possible.</p>
            <p>The system of selling public lands on credit was passing through its last stages during the years of
                    the first great rush of settlers to Indiana. In that period, which extended from 1813 to 1819, it
                    was possible to acquire title to 160 acres of land for a cash outlay of $294.40, after
                    the deduction of a discount of eight per cent.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> In 1817 the Land Act of 1800
                    was amended so that as small an amount as eighty acres could be purchased,<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
                    minus the discount, a patent could be obtained for a tract of this size for $147.20. The
                    opportunity to obtain a farm so cheaply by paying for it entirely at the time of purchase with no
                    future payments to be made was <list type="footnotes">

                    being for the acquisition of four times as much land as could be paid for in full with the cash in
                    hand, making only the required first payment of one-fourth at the time of purchase. In many
                    instances, buyers of government land, in the years under consideration, made no payments whatever
                    after the first, held the land for five years and then forfeited it.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> In many
                    cases, the buyer even borrowed the money with which to make the first payment of one-fourth. Such

            <p>Land debts were the most common in frontier Indiana in the hectic period that ended in 1819, but
                    there was also much borrowing for other purposes–to construct business buildings, to set
                    up sawmills, to erect gristmills, to build boats, to finance shipping operations, and to use in
                    various other ways. While the period of swelling prosperity was on, it was easy to obtain loans. In
                    fact, money was easy to create. Banks of the West and South had little specie and the legislation
                    and rules governing banking operations were lenient. Banks could be organized without difficulty,
                    and, once started, they could print bank notes and begin to loan money. Entirely too much money was
                    loaned on real estate security, especially on town lots, and on other assets of pioneers. Some
                    thrifty farmers used their income to meet deferred payments on their lands and had little use for
                    banks. The income of less careful and more ambitious landowners and many businessmen was used in new
                    speculative ventures.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two banks of Indiana Territory were the Bank of <placeName>

                    incorporated banks and provided that either might be adopted as the state bank of Indiana. Should
                    either become the state bank, the other could be made a branch bank. When a state bank should be
                    established, the number of branches was not to exceed one for any group of three counties. A

                        children.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Since a great percentage of the families of the infant state
                    made no use of banks, the plan of the promoters was certainly not unduly conservative. The

                    population would continue to increase at an advancing rate was somewhat justified by the prevailing
                    influx of colonists. There was, however, small need for any new banks at the time, but legislators
                    were thinking, or rather dreaming, in large terms. It turned out to be impossible to find towns able

                        approaching.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> There was no incentive for farmers to produce a surplus of
                    hogs or grain, or for anyone to expand a business or start a new enterprise. The depression of the
                    early eighteen-twenties was an added and general misfortune which pioneers had to bear along with
                    the hardships that were so common to frontier communities.</p>
            <p>There was, to be sure, another side to the picture. The population of Indiana had increased from
                    63,897 in 1815 to 147,178 in 1820. This population was widely scattered. There we're now
                    (1820) thirty-five counties, but only three had a population above ten thousand. The most populous
                    was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> , with 12,119. Certainly, Indiana society was not very complex at the time. Food was
                    easy to produce. Building materials, fencing materials, and fuel were everywhere close at hand and
                    abundant. Game was plentiful in the forests and fish in the streams. Even in towns, most families
                    could supply themselves with food and shelter in the midst of hard times. Cows, hogs, and poultry
                    could be kept by townspeople, and a family in need of milk or eggs was poor indeed. Clothing was
                    more of a problem, but not really serious for most families. It cannot be denied that thdre was far
                    less danger that the poor would go cold, hungry, or shelterless in the midst of abundance in that
                    simple period than in our streamlined age.</p>
            <p>The panic of 1819 and the succeeding depression could not eliminate the cleared fields, the forests,
                    the cabins and other homes, nor the stables and barns. No matter what the total or per capita debt,
                    and each was high, the tangible assets we're right at hand. Though not worth much in
                    dollars as compared with the expanded values of the very recent years, they could be employed to the
                    extent that necessaries were obtained by nearly everyone. Under the conditions that prevailed in
                    Indiana in 1820, when such a large percentage of the families were practically self-sustaining
                    economic units, the suffering could not be overwhelming. <list type="footnotes">

                    urban dr rural areas would not find it easy to state the differences between the prosperity of 1818
                    and the stagnation of 1820, if they could be given a glimpse of the everyday life in the two stages.
                    Besides the saving factors mentioned as present in 1820, there was, of course, the necessity, then
                    as in our day, to carry on somehow in spite of the calamities that had come, but the truth is that
                    it was much less difficult, in that simple age, to face the problems of a period of depression than
                    it is in the twentieth century. People who were alive and healthful reacted to adverse conditions
                    and found ways to carry on necessary activities as normal conditions slowly returned.</p>
            <p>In 1820 and as long as pioneer life continued in considerable areas, the populations of states in the
                    process of being colonized included a larger proportion of stoics and pre-destinarians than can be
                    found in American communities of our day. We have now more arrogance and misunderstanding among the
                    "haves" and more bitterness and lack of hope among the
                    "have-nots," and it is a question whether we produce the high percentage of sturdy
                    men and women that were developed in pioneer times. Calamities and hardships were such common
                    features of their everyday life that pioneers steeled themselves to meet the worst. Disasters, so
                    many of them due to forces and conditions not understood, were apt to be regarded as inevitable and
                    accepted with fortitude. The best was made of every situation, since the belief was common that what
                    is to be will be. It is not to be wondered at that so many pioneers schooled themselves to meet
                    troubles stoically.</p>
            <p>There were rough characters in many pioneer communities. There was a rampaging side to frontier life

                    community life about them.</p>
            <p>There is the story of the man who was healthy but too lazy to work, whom we may call
                    "Sam." Frequently this pioneer was found to be in dire need of food; and he was
                    helped by his neighbors time after time. Finally, a group of men who had just aided him tried to
                    cure him of his shift-lessness. They warned him that if he ever let himself get into such a
                    predicament again with no reason, they would bury him alive. For a brief period he did better, then
                    relapsed. The neighbor men assembled, grim and determined, made a litter, placed Sam upon it and
                    carried him up a byroad towards a small burying ground. When the solemn march was about half over,
                    one of Sam's neighbors relented and requested his comrades to halt, after which he
                    addressed them, saying——"Men, we are about to do a very serious
                    thing. I don't want to <hi rend="i">go</hi> through with it. If you will join with me and
                    each give something, I will contribute a bushel of corn and Sam can have one more chance."</p>
            <p>At this juncture, Sam aroused himself a bit, raised himself on his right elbow a little way, and
                    inquired with a nasal drawl–"Is the corn shelled?"</p>
            <p>"It is not," replied the kindly neighbor.</p>
            <p>At this, Sam settled back on the litter, closed his eyes and murmured–"Carry me
                    on."</p>
            <p>A second story relates to a well-meaning, industrious frontier farmer, who was unfortunate enough to
                    experience one calamity after another, until he was so nearly down and out that he had only one
                    shirt left. Having worn it too long to suit his thrifty wife, she persuaded him to <hi rend="i">go</hi> to bed one day so that she could wash the shirt. After the garment had been hanging on the
                    line for about an hour to dry, the wife went out in the back yard to get it, but ran back at once,
                    calling out in great excitement–"John, oh John, the calf has chewed up your
                    shirt."</p>
            <p>Having learned through numerous hard experiences to take each new misfortune calmly, John responded
                    with perfect control–"Thank the Lord, I have little more to lose."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>

                    families held some tangible assets. There were fine possibilities ahead, though the picture seemed
                    dark at the moment. Business and political leaders had not performed with caution during the boom
                    years, finding it simpler and easier to swim with the current. Following the crash, some of them,
                    having learned from hard experiences, acted with sanity for a period at least. Living in a region
                    with an abundance of unoccupied land and almost untouched natural resources other than land, the
                    economic possibilities were too great for most of the people to be despondent very long. America was
                    young and recovery was certain to come to the pioneer population of Indiana within a reasonable
                    time. Like the other states in the Union, the nineteenth state had an excellent constitution. One of
                    the new states in a democratic nation, Indiana was truly one of the favored provinces of the earth.
                    Though temporarily in a bad way, not too many tears should be shed over her plight in 1820.</p>
            <p>While in the midst of a period of very low prices for local products and high prices for commodities
                    obtained from the outside, the problem of improving transportation facilities became one of great
                    concern. Profits from pork products would be greater even with low prices if the cost of getting
                    hams, shoulders, bacon, and lard to malrkets could be cut down. Finished goods brought in from the
                    outside could be purchased at much lower prices and greater quantities would be bought and used if
                    transportation charges could be lowered. It was hard to build good roads and construct bridges
                    without increasing taxes which there was little chance to do. The people of each neighborhood were
                    accustomed to solve labor problems by co-operating with each other in raising cabins and stables,
                    harvesting and threshing grain, rolling logs, cutting wood, and butchering-hogs.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Taking a lesson from this, legislators provided that labor in lieu of money should be
                    contributed in the matter of public works. Voters were required to donate time in the building and
                    'repairing of roads and smaller bridges. Larger bridges were constructed with funds <list type="footnotes">
                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">27</hi> There were various other occasions where a pioneer gave help to get
                            help in return. Log-rollings were neighborhood affairs and are best remembered, but there
                            were many others. Often only two families were involved, in activities like cutting wood,
                            splitting rails, building fences, planting corn, etc. Women co-operated too and held sewing
                            bees, apple parings, quilting parties and the like.</item>

                    charges on such bonds and with which to retire them eventually was often raised by collecting tolls
                    from those who used the bridges.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the most interesting experiments was the attempt to apply the system of calling out voters to
                    work on the roads to the improvement of stream navigation as well. In 1820 the General Assembly
                    declared most of the streams, little and big, that were found within the settled part of Indiana to
                    be navigable, but did nothing to implement the measure. The main purpose of the bill seems to have
                    been to prevent anyone from doing anything to obstruct the creeks and rivers involved. In 1826
                    several brief laws were passed relating to specific streams–<geogName>Blue
                    River</geogName>, Sugar Creek, Busseron Creek, Laughery Creek, Log Lick Creek, Plumb Creek, Big
                    Indian Creek, Lost Creek, the Muscatituck rivers, Patoka River, and the East and West Forks of
                        <geogName>White River</geogName>–declaring each of them to be "public
                    highways" and making it legal to "warn" out men of legal age living near
                    such streams to work together towards improving them. Persons refusing to contribute labor were to
                    be fined "fifty cents" each. The improvement of the creeks and rivers designated
                    consisted in "clearing away the timber and other obstructions lying therein and to do and
                    perform any other work which may tend to improve the navigation thereof. …"<hi rend="sup">29</hi> Tree trunks lodged in creeks or rivers were usually referred to as
                    "snags." These were dangerous to boats, as they were often lodged in such a manner
                    that an end would stick up slightly above the water or be barely hidden by it and be very difficult
                    to see. Sandbars often formed during floods and had to be removed.</p>
            <p>Not much ever came of this rosy scheme to make small streams navigable. In fact, there was mainly
                    disappointment in store for hopeful pioneers in regard to every Indiana river save the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, which washed the southern border of the state. One can understand, though, how men,
                    despairing of building good roads for a long time, should hopefully look on the creeks and rivers as
                    possible substitutes. The beds of many of them <list type="footnotes">

                    nature furnishing the water. Years passed before the dream, that by building boats that would draw
                    but little water and keeping the streams free of snags and sandbars, the transportation problem
                    could be largely solved with creeks and rivers constituting many of the highways, was
                        surrendered.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The necessity to provide a transportation system continued to demand a solution and finally led the
                    state to launch her great system of internal improvements. The act, known as the '"Mammoth
                    Bill," was passed in 1836 in the midst of another boom period that overshadowed the one
                    which had collapsed in 1819.<hi rend="sup">31</hi> The panic of 1837 well nigh wrecked the scheme
                    embodied in the internal improvements measure of 1836. The near failure of this ambitious attempt to
                    create an interlocking system of roads and canals left the state burdened with a vast debt which
                    vexed the people and their leaders for a number of years. It is interesting that the extensive
                    system projected in 1836 included but one railroad, the line from <placeName>

                    railway line, and that one comparatively short, is a testimony to the difficulty of foreseeing what
                    is to happen even in the nealr future. Indiana was to have her transportation problem largely solved
                    by the construction, within a few years of railways, and the little capital city at the mouth of <placeName>

                    in 1818. The land surveyors of the federal government began to run lines in the New Purchase in
                    1819. It was in 1820 that Congress abolished the credit feature of the system of selling public

                    minimum price per acre was fixed at one dollar and twenty-five cents, the land purchased to be paid
                    for in full at the time of purchase. This meant a salutary reform, and speculators were much opposed
                    to it. A purchaser could now acquire a homestead of eighty acres for one hundred dollars, if no one
                    should bid against him at the auction sale.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> Following the modifications of
                    1820 in the land legislation, Congress passed several supplementary measures for the relief of those
                    who had earlier purchased land on credit at two dollars per acre, paying one-fourth at the time of
                    purchase. Where forfeiture was necessary, credit was given to those forced to give up land, to the
                    extent of what they had paid, which they could apply on new purchases. The policy of the federal
                    government aided farmers caught by the crash of 1819, and made it easier for them to make another
                    start. The new policy of selling lands and the aid given to discouraged farmers and others in debt
                    for lands purchased in the boom period that closed in 1819, relieved somewhat the gloom caused by
                    the panic and depression. It should be added that much the greater part of the land of Indiana was
                    reduced to private ownership between 1820 and 1860.</p>
            <p>It was in the year 1820, when the economic conditions in the settlements of Indiana were so serious,
                    that the General Assembly appointed a commission to select a site for a permanent state capital, for
                    which Congress had voted to grant a free tract of four square miles. This commission selected the

                    commissioners who helped to decide where the capital of Indiana should stand had even a dream that
                    the point selected would become the "Cross-Roads of America." The government
                    records and office furniture were moved from Corydon to the "village in the
                    woods," late in the fall of 1824. The history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> since that transfer of the state government makes it necessary to say that the leaders
                    of the new state deserve high praise for performing so well when they selected a site for the
                    permanent capital of Indiana in 1820, a year of unrest and discouragement.</p>
            <p>Much time was required for the development of a banking system in Indiana, and the final outcome has
                    been in reality more the work of the federal government than that of the state. This was more or
                    less inevitable. As to business cycles, they have been nation-wide or world-wide. Certain it is that
                    Indiana since 1820 has passed through the cycles centered around the panics of 1837, 1857, 1873,
                    1893, and 1929. In each instance, as in the case of the cycle of 1813 to 1825, there was a boom
                    period, a crash, a depression, and then a slow recovery. The story is composed of a number of sad
                    chapters, and it must be admitted that our business cycles grow bigger and worse, as the generations
                    go by, not bigger and better according to the boasted American pattern.</p>
            <p>Recovery has followed in the wake of each of the later depressions as was true following the hard
                    times of the early eighteen twenties. What has been pointed out relative to the certainty of a
                    return of prosperity following the dark year of 1820, is not to be taken as a defense of the long
                    and persistently held American belief that no matter what happens to our country, the people will
                    always work their way out. It is true that they have always done.so, after a fashion, but this does
                    not prove that such devastating economic experiences are beneficial to any people nor that they must
                    be endured. Acceptance of booms, crashes, and depressions as inevitable is worthy only of a
                    sluggish, unthinking people, unwilling to discipline themselves. It is not a sane policy <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-043-2-023"/> merely to permit nature to take her course. In truth the fundamental
                    barrier in the way of conquering business cycles is that nearly everyone involved in business loves
                    periods of rising prices, increasing production, expanding trade and greater profits. However,
                    unless booms can be eliminated, panics and depressions are certainties. In other words, the only way
                    to banish panics and depressions is to banish booms or regulate them rigidly.</p>
            <p>It is easy to contend that business cycles run according to the natural laws of economics, hence
                    nothing can be done about them. The truth seems to be that booms grow to dangerous proportions
                    because of a false psychology that seizes the people, the greatest offenders being powerful economic
                    elements who value great, present returns more highly than the economic safety of the general
                    public. It is not necessary that self-interest shall be replaced by altruism, but that men shall be
                    keen enough to recognize that even self-interest demands that prices, production, trade and profits
                    shall be kept as steady as possible. Further, even greedy interests should realize that gigantic
                    economic dislocations are a menace to the political and social order.</p>
            <p>In a period of panic and depression there are some who seem to sustain great losses who really lose
                    little, since what they are obliged to surrender is mostly paper wealth that has come easy and goes
                    easy. There are many others whose misfortunes are real, but who after making adjustments, can again
                    go ahead with a promise of reasonable success. There are other groups who lose much dr all of what
                    they have accumulated and are barred by advancing age or declining health from ever staging a
                    comeback. Finally, there are hosts of people who lose their jobs or their businesses and have little
                    or nothing to go on for longer or shorter periods. These classes have small responsibility for
                    bringing on the calamities that overwhelm them and few opportunities to extricate themselves from
                    the forces that grip them. Such conditions are destructive of the physical well-being, the morale
                    and the civic pride of a large part of the population.</p>
            <p>The sound old adage that an "ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" needs to
                    be invoked and become a controlling factor at the beginning of every business boom, especially under
                    the complex economic and social regime of today. When it does become the guiding principle, a vast
                        <pb n="124" id="VAA4025-043-2-024"/> majority of American citizens will be willing and anxious
                    to forego business booms in order to avoid panics and depressions. Deadly diseases such as smallpox,
                    diphtheria, and tuberculosis have been brought under control, and we are proud of what has been
                    accomplished. Unless we can do as much to control the forces that cause economic crashes and
                    likewise wars, we cannot rate human intelligence very highly. Those of us who voice this contention
                    are just sane, open-minded men and women, not alarmists.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I must add that I would feel guilty of being untrue to the American people were I not
                    to say what the experiences of my life and the study of history have taught me–that
                    democracy and capitalism are both in grave danger of destruction in this splendid country of ours,
                    unless our captains of industry and our financial giants shall acquire the wisdom to join with other
                    responsible citizens to control booms and thereby eliminate panics and depressions. So gigantic and
                    paralyzing have periodic dislocations in our economic system become that it is perilous to risk
                    another. It need not be pointed out that fundamental disturbances in our economic system are sure to
                    be speedily reflected in our social and political life. It surely cannot be possible that Americans
                    will permit the noblest and best results of new world history to be lost by speeding along a smooth,
                    broad road towards a precipice when the stop-signs are all in plain view.</p>

            <p>The War of 1812 placed a definite check upon immigration into the Whitewater Valley, although some
                    settlers braved the Indian dangers and proceeded to their new sites. As far as actual battles were
                    concerned, there were none in this region. Alarms, a few instances of scalping, and several murders
                    disturbed the peace. Hunt speaks of the Indian menace: "When the Indians commenced stealing
                    horses, the people became much alarmed—some left for the settlements from whence they
                    came and others moved into block houses."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> There was enough of a state
                    of apprehension, however, to keep the settlers on the alert and in forts and blockhouses built for
                    their protection. The typical fort was constructed of two rows of timbers, twelve to fourteen feet
                    long, planted two and one-half to three feet deep. Timbers of the second row covered the cracks of
                    the first. Small cabins were erected inside the fort to accommodate the families, and there was at
                    least one blockhouse inside each fort. The blockhouses were two stories high, the upper story
                    projecting about two feet over the lower. There were port holes <list type="footnotes">

                    hostilities. For their own defense the settlers built blockhouses. George Manlove, who was the

            <p>The Quakers encountered difficulties other than those arising from the Indian menace. Their
                    opposition to bearing arms caused a conflict with the authorities. David Hoover relates some of the

                    Elliot who had said something against the war and tryed him for treason, found him guilty and
                    sentenced him to be shot, but gave him a chance to run away in the dark, they firing off their guns
                    to scare him off." Hoover speaks of four young men who received less humane treatment:

            <p>Although the Whitewater Valley was disturbed during the war by troubles with the Indians, fears of
                    possible events more serious than those which occurred, and persecutions of the pacific Friends, the
                    Indian menace was removed and migration was resumed. The movement of people into this valley was
                    common to most of the West. Along the roads through the Appalachians, came persons from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, traveling in wagons, on horseback or afoot. This migration, in contrast to later
                    movements, was composed of a large percentage of persons from the Middle Atlantic and Southern
                    states and was so large that it is called the Great Migration. Many came to the Old Northwest and
                    the Whitewater Valley was the destination of several thousand.</p>

            <p>Emigration from Europe to the Whitewater Valley was small in this decade. The Napoleonic wars had
                    checked the coming of most Europeans to this country, but it was resumed in 1816. Most of the
                    persons emigrating from <placeName>

                    required a small fortune for a man to leave the British dominions with his family. Ships were
                    limited in passenger capacity, and the cost of a passage was proportionately dear. This virtually
                    prohibited emigration to the poor and denied it absolutely to mechanics and manufacturers.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

                    formed, motivated by private interests or by the influence of religious or political considerations.

            <p>William Cobbett, in <hi rend="i">Cobbett's Register</hi> in 1815, said that there was no
                    doubt about the happiness of America, where the population and resources were increasing so rapidly

                    and quacks in every department would do better to remain at home. Of the three professions, lawyers,
                    clergy, and doctors, the latter would find migration the more advantageous. The life of a farmer,
                    said Cobbett, was a hard and rugged one:</p>

            <p>Methodism, too, expanded during this period, yet it was apparently somewhat slower in forming
                    congregations in the Twelve Mile Purchase than the Baptists. There were no actual Methodist
                    congregations before the early twenties, but classes had been formed previous to this time. It is
                    known that David Sharpe preached occasionally at a Mr. Tharpe's, near <placeName>

            <p>During this decade, Presbyterianism came to the Whitewater Valley. The first Presbyterian minister

            <p>There does not appear to have been any significant changes in education during this period, but the
                    good intentions of the leaders are quite evident in the provisions of the new state constitution of
                    1816. The authors of the document made it incumbent upon the General Assembly to provide for the
                    improvement of school lands and to apply any funds which might be raised from them, or from any
                    other source, to the "grand object for which they are or may be tended." Monies
                    received from the sale of school lands were to constitute a school fund to be used to promote
                    "the interest of Literature, and the sciences, and for the support of seminaries and public
                    schools." In addition, it was their duty, as soon as circumstances permitted, to provide by
                    law for a general educational system—from township schools to a state university, wherein
                    tuition was to be free to all. Militia exemption duties were to be used for the support of
                    seminaries in the counties where they were assessed.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>By comparing the approximate figure of 5,500 as the population of the Whitewater Valley in 1810 with
                    the figure given by the census of 1820 which had expanded to 28,832, it will be seen that the Valley
                    increased in population by more than four hundred per cent, indeed a considerable increase. This
                    large addition may be attributed to the Great Migration, which took place between the end of the War
                    of 1812 and the panic of 1819.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

            <p>A study of the age groups listed in the 1820 census indicates that it was still chiefly the young
                    people who were migrating. Forty-one per cent of the free whites were under ten years of age,
                    fifty-six per cent were under sixteen, seventy-three per cent were under twenty-six, ninety-two per
                    cent were under forty-five, and eight per cent were forty-five years of age and over.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    rudely shattered. Migration apparently continued, probably at a falling rate during 1819, but the
                    Great Migration was over.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The decade from 1810 to 1820, therefore, saw the War of 1812 check the earlier migration to the
                    Whitewater Valley and cause considerable confusion to the settlers, especially the Friends, although
                    there were no major military events within the Valley. When Harrison's campaign of 1813
                    relieved the pressure on the Northwest, the movement of immigration was resumed and the number of
                    settlers was so large as to be called the Great Migration, Settlements increased, new towns and
                    counties were established, churches and schools were founded, more land was purchased from the
                    Indians, and the entire Valley area became at least thinly settled. This migration occurred in a
                    period of inflation which came to an end in 1819, and this economic disturbance checked for a time
                    the further rapid settlement of Indiana. It is interesting to note how young were the people who
                    participated in this occupation of the lands of the Whitewater. The Valley was essentially a young
                    people's frontier.</p>

                    shiftless and improvident; a vagrant at heart, whose 'roving spirit held him to the wilderness and
                    to abject poverty all his life. Of Nancy Hanks <placeName>

                    poverty and hardships, from which his shiftless father refused to be released.</p>
            <p>In 1816, stirred by the gossip of better land, the vagrant, Thomas, moved his family to the abysmal
                    wilderness of the Pigeon Creek district, in what is now <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> County, Indiana. They arrived at their gloomy abode in December with nothing but the
                    sky for shelter. They threw up a three-sided pole camp, covered with brush, leaves, and dirt, which
                    they occupied for a year, sleeping on the ground, covered by blankets, or skins. The next year,

                    his rigorous existence.</p>
            <p>Abe went to the log house, ABC schools less than a total of twelve months. He learned to read, write
                    and "cipher to the rule of three." He became a voracious reader, searching the
                    surrounding country for books. Neither titles nor contents made any difference. Books were sought
                    more for the printed word, than otherwise. He would say, "The things I want to know are in
                    books; my best friend is the man who'll git me a book I ain't read."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a holograph statement, written in the third person, he said of his life at Pigeon Creek:
                    "He settled in an unbroken forest, and the clearing away of surplus wood was the great task
                    ahead. Abraham, though very young, was large of his age, and had an ax put into his hands at once;
                    and from that till within his twenty-third year, he was almost constantly handling that most useful
                        instrument."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At seventeen, he had attained the height of almost six feet and four inches. His physical powers were
                    prodigious. He was said to possess the strength of three men. A neighbor said, "He can sink
                    an ax deeper into wood than any man I ever saw." Another said, "If you heard him
                    fellin' trees in a clearin', you would say there was three men at work by the way the trees
                    fell."⋆ He excelled at most of the local sports and acquired an inexhaustible
                    repertory of funny stories. He was champion with the hand stick at the Log rollings and leading
                    lifter at the house raisings. He was sometimes hired out to supplement the hard life at home. He
                    would husk corn, clear new ground, split rails, kill hogs, and do any odd jobs that came to hand.
                    For a short time, he tended a ferry boat on the nearby <placeName>

                    </placeName> when he was nineteen. This was his first glimpse of life, outside the dark forest.</p>
            <p>Abe came by degrees to envisage a new world far different from dismal Pigeon Creek. His imagination
                    could produce for it no more than a vague outline. It was a nebulous <list type="footnotes">

                    complete its long apprenticeship to greatness. He already had a few friends in his new home, which
                    he had acquired in the legislature. Moreover, he had achieved large popularity there by his able

                    fortunate association with the able, well-established attorney, John T. Stuart, who induced him to
                    study law, which continued for four years; next, a partnership with another leading member of the
                    bar, for three and one-half years, and, lastly, his association with his protege, William Herndon,
                    all of which advanced him steadily in the <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s integrity. He 'related that <placeName>

                    rude habits and mannerisms of his wilderness life. Despite his crudeness, he had a rich culture all
                    his own. The fundamentals, so amply stored by Nature in him, as they responded to the pressures of
                    life gave forth in their own way his many distinguishing attributes. His mental development,
                    inspired by his abundant spirit, was pressed without limit by his singularly versatile mind. Both
                    the extent and profundity of his reading were extraordinary. Almost any subject engaged his
                    cavernous mind and memory. The multitudinous sources from which he drew his information are almost
                    beyond belief.</p>

                    complete the circuit often required three months. Strangely, the lawyers carried few lawbooks with
                    them in that day. But studies of many other subjects including algebra, geometry, astronomy,
                    treatises on the sciences, and even a copy of Shakespeare from time to time found a place in <placeName>

                    that he was impoverishing his bar, with his insignificant charges. His conduct as a lawyer was
                    characterized by the quintessence of honor and ethics. The sanctity of the law and the courts was
                    almost an obsession with him. He invariably declined and did not hesitate to throw up in open court

                    as disappointing. His service there so offended his district that he did not offer for re-election.
                    Deeply humiliated by this serious repudiation, he determined to quit politics and surrender himself
                    to the pursuit of the law. This he did most assiduously for five years during which he reached the
                    head of the bar of his state, and achieved large reputation far beyond its borders. In 1856, the
                    sources of dissension between the North and South, unwittingly left in the constitution and so long
                    subdued by compromise and concession, were fast reaching a crisis. <placeName>

                    rights of man. With his infinite reverence for human personality, he believed, from the depth of his
                    soul, that God's plan for all humanity was the greatest liberty, compatible with the
                    happiness of mankind; that the genius of all government was to assure to the individual the largest
                    freedom and opportunity accordant with the exigencies of democratic society and that such should be
                    the goal of civilization.</p>

                    </placeName> on trial, we must first accord him full freedom of opinion. Then, we must critically
                    and fairly examine the sources and the sincerity of his conduct, and the spirit which animated him.
                    If we be satisfied with these considerations, then we shall find him face to face with the
                    determinations of high conscience, which, we shall agree, called forth from him the best that was in
                    him, when he conceived the destiny of his country to be involved. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s abhorrence of slavery followed as an immediate corollary from his fidelity
                    to the essence of his being. To him human bondage was a moral, social, and political evil, strangely
                        <pb n="149" id="VAA4025-043-2-049"/> brought forward from .barbarism, which had not the capacity
                    to conceive the attribute of mercy or pity.</p>
            <p>Again, any examination of the indubitable record will show <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s views on slavery were consistent throughout with the provisions of the
                    constitution, as he and a multitude of others interpreted the Magna Carta. The record will show that
                    until he abolished the institution as the inexorable exigency of war, he resolutely declined to
                    attack or disturb the rights vouchsafed to slavery by the organic law as he honestly understood it.</p>
            <p>He stood for slavery, as it existed, not only out of his reverence for the constitution, but because
                    he well understood that it was the cornerstone of the South's economy. He knew that violent
                    and sudden termination of the institution would destroy the whole fabric of Southern life. This was
                    revolting to him. In view of it, he stated that such an eventuation might do more harm to liberty
                    than even the presence of slavery.</p>
            <p>His broad and sympathetic understanding of the South was often evidenced in his public utterances. In
                    his reply to Douglas at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Peoria</settlement>
                    </placeName> on October 16, 1854, he said, <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their

                            exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. This I believe of the masses, North and

                            very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the

                    disunion was a fair means of satisfying both slavery and antislavery sentiment since the act limited
                    the bounds of the institution to the sat- isfaction of all important views on the embattled subject.
                    The Great Compromise, through its thirty-five years of operation, had very well accomplished its

                    </placeName> Compromise, and the subsequent declaration of its unconstitutionality were in for all
                    out attack.</p>
            <p>You will recall that Senator Stephen A. Douglas, of 11- linois, then the real head of the Democratic
                    party, and the most powerful politician and political drator in the co,untry, authored the <placeName>

                    </placeName> bill and steered it to enact- ment. The legislation pleased the South. The Senator
                    would try for the presidency in 1860 and probably was seeking Southern support for his nomination.
                    When Douglas hurried home to defend this act before an irate constituency, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> fiercely attacked both measure and author. Thus began the famous <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>-Douglas debates, which had their merciless culmination four years later, when these two
                    intellectual giants opposed each other for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senate.</p>
            <p>There is scarcely anything in the annals of politics com- parable to these debates. Their influence
                    on American his- <pb n="151" id="VAA4025-043-2-051"/> tory is incalculable. They had the effect of
                    bringing to focus the red-hot issues of the time. They virtually revolutionized the political life
                    of the country, and prepared the stage for a new America. In that great battle of wits, Douglas was
                    badly beaten, even though he was elected to the Senate. In his efforts to recover the ground he lost
                    to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Douglas caused the disruption of the Democratic party, which, in turn, resulted in his
                    own- defeat and in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s election in the presidential campaign of 1860.</p>
            <p>Long agitated by highly controversial debate and legislation in Congress on slavery, and by constant
                    fulminations on that deadly subject from press and platform, the public mind both North and South,
                    in the middle 1850's, was approaching the explosive point. The sources of cool judgment and
                    patriotic restraint were well nigh everywhere overwhelmed by the crazed excitement of the day.</p>
            <p>By 1852 the sectional allegiance was so pronounced that the Whig party began to disintegrate. The
                    remaining anti-slavery organizations were too radical and too feeble to attract a coalition of the
                    larger and more conservative antislavery bodies of opinion, which now had only to be organized to
                    obtain control of the federal government. As you know, this situation led, in 1854, to the formation
                    of the Republican party. This party, you will remember, was brought into being to consolidate all
                    antislavery sentiment, regardless of party affiliations, and to amalgamate, under broad leadership,
                    the variant antislavery organizations in the North and West.</p>
            <p>The new party held its first national convention in 1856. Its platform in 1860 was with a few minor
                    additions a reaffirmation of its first pronouncement in 1856–adherence to the principles
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Jefferson; denial of the constitutional right of Congress or any territory to
                    establish slavery with a ‘ringing declaration that it was both the right and duty of
                    Congress to prohibit slavery in the territories. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, over several national figures, was the party's nominee for the presidency.
                    Meantime, Douglas’ quarrel with the administration and the South, over the <placeName>

                    </placeName> became chief executive of the nation on the platform of a new party, that set out, in
                    forthright terms, the irreconcilable issues, which, since the adoption of the constitution, had been
                    slowly, but surely evolving from the fundamental differences between the North and South. His
                    election wrought immediate pandemonium in the South, and, before his inauguration, on the fourth of
                    the following March, as you know, seven of the Southern states had formed a confederacy of their
                    own, and withdrawn their representatives from the National Congress.</p>
            <p>Secession, first threatened by Federalists, during John Marshall's early days, often again
                    to cast its shadow over the Union, had now come to pass, and was soon to be referred by the logic of
                    passion to the arbitrament of arms. There was no word in the constitution which, however tortured,
                    could be interpreted to permit or prohibit the withdrawal of any state from the compact of Union.
                    Therefore, that matter was left entirely to individual conclusion. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> held that, under the organic law, there could be no such thing as secession. To him,
                    the Union was more than life. He never had a passion that did not enter into his devotion for it.
                    His convictions concerning the inviolability of the organic law were cast in the fires of his soul.
                    He not only loved the Union for its own sake, but he felt and said that American democracy, under
                    its constitution, was an experiment in government, upon which he thought depended the success of the
                    Liberal party all over the world, and, therefore, the hope of attaining the ultimate goal of
                    individual freedom for mankind which was to him as a religion.</p>
            <p>It cannot be fairly denied that the spirit of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first inaugural address was that of a great, earnest soul behind a cause for
                    which he was willing to wage war, if necessary, but sought with all his powers still to avert it. In
                    that address, he quoted himself from a former speech. "I have no purpose, directly or
                    indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I
                    have no lawful right to do so, and. I have no inclination to do so."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    affection in which he was held by his people. He now saw the beginning of the end of the conflict.
                    With his characteristic wisdom and magnanimity, he began to prepare the way for the unobstructed
                    return of the seceded states to the Union. This from the beginning, he had proposed in his heart to
                    accomplish, apart from terms of reprisal or humiliation. Asked once what would be done with these

            <p>There is an effort being made to revolutionize the story of the age of Andrew Jackson. Criticism is
                    directed from many sides against the old familiar account, which explained the politics of that
                    generation in terms of sectional forces. The great geographical divisions of East, South, and West,

            <p>In their place a new version is being developed, employing a class analysis, and emphasizing
                    especially the role of the industrial labor movement of the 1830's and 1840's.
                    Major topics all the way from banking to philosophy have béen re-studied from this
                    approach, often with good results. The question of the public lands, which has always been
                    considered one of the chief political issues of the Jacksonian years, has drawn particular
                        attention.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>But there is a crucial unsolved problem in the reinterpretation of Jacksonian public land policy.
                    Research during the past fifty years, and -especially the past fifteen, has brought to light a great
                    deal of new evidence, and a fairly complete picture of labor's position on public lands is

                    achieving a more liberal land policy.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Such a policy was adopted, and some
                    historians now suggest that its adoption was a result of labor's demand. Yet no direct
                    relation has been shown between the Jacksonian labor movement and national legislation concerning
                    the public domain.</p>
            <p>Industrial labor leaders who were interested in land reform, one writer recently has observed,
                    we're insignificant at the polls.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Since no direct relationship between
                    national land legislation and labor parties, labor candidates, or labor votes has been established,
                    interest has turned to two other possible connections.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, it has been suggested, the ideas about land reform that were advanced by labor
                    leaders may have been sufficiently persuasive, especially when backed by the existence of an
                    industrial labor problem, to compel changes in land policy. One of the favorite land reform ideas
                    among Jacksonian labor leaders was the safety-valve thesis, the view that westward emigration of
                    labor was an outlet for social pressure and unrest and a means of attaining high industrial wages.
                    The idea was advanced in Congress at the same time, and the revisionist historians have suggested
                    that this was the vital contribuition made by the labor movement to the formation of public land
                    policy. If it was, the use made of it by congressmen should be examined to see whether it was
                    decisive or important in the action they took to change the land laws.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it has been noted that the existence side by side of unoccupied western lands and
                    an industrial labor class implied some relationship between the two, and a number of studies in the
                    past dozen yeairs have explored the possibility that Eastern workingmen emigrated westward. The
                    studies remain inconclusive for lack of adequate statistics <hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                    domain may not have been a safety valve for labor through emigration, the belief that it offered a
                    solution to the labor problem may have compelled legislative changes in national land policy.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From either approach, one arrives at the same questions. What was the safety valve idea?
                    How was it expressed in congressional speeches in relation to land questions? Did
                    statements of belief lead to corresponding action? How significant was this idea in the
                    logic of those who held it, and how significant was it in the enactment of national land reform
                    legislation? The answers to those questions will indicate whether this crucial idea may
                    provide the bridge to connect the Jacksonian labor movement with national land policy.</p>
            <p>The classic definition of the safety valve was offered by Caleb Cushing, the <placeName>

                    accusations against their opponents. Through land legislation, they said, Eastern interests wanted
                    to compel the poor, or city dwellers, or the population in general, to remain in Eastern states for
                    work in factories, or to tenant great fa'rms, or to supply the labor market.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> And, second, Easterners wanted to maintain a large labor market through restrictive

            <p>As alternatives to those conditions western Democrats offered four counter-objectives to be achieved

                    necessity of working for low wages. Those four proposals were stated negatively, as matters of
                    escape from the East and from oppression.</p>
            <p>Finally, the congressional land 'reformers added two other related propositions that brought a
                    positive eastern bearing to their plans. Cheap land in the West would, if made available (or did,
                    since it was available, some said) raise wages in Eastern factories, or keep wages high, and
                    westward migration would eliminate the evils of agrarianism, social unrest, and threats of
                    revolution engendered in Eastern industrial centers.</p>
            <p>The argument is an impressive one that congressmen we're concerned with the problems of
                    Eastern industrialism and the labor unrest of the times. Whether they borrowed their arguments from
                    labor leaders or not, if those considerations were decisive in bringing about changes in the land
                    laws, then the existence of industrial labor problems was more significant in the formation of land
                    policy than the old view has recognized.</p>
            <p>If the statements of opinion are significant, there should appear, in the first place, some relation
                    between the way land reform exponents of the safety-valve idea spoke and the way they voted. What

                    development and peopling of the West. That much is indicated by the great number of speeches they
                    made extolling the beauties of Western rural life and by their splendid tributes to the democratic
                    existence in the West. Only occasionally did they 'refer to the possible reactions of their policies
                    on the East. Their personal political motivation was further shown in a desire to obtain local or
                    sectional advantage for themselves and their rural constituents. There is no reason to doubt that
                    Western congressmen were sincere believers that good consequences would come to the East following
                    the enactment of their land policies, or that they were genuinely interested in the welfare of
                    Eastern workingmen. But the place that those arguments held in their speeches was distinctly
                    subordinate to aims of more immediate significance for Western politics, and their tone was that of
                    aiding the West (and themselves) rather than of concern for labor welfare.</p>
            <p>The basic arguments about the oppression of the poor in the old Eastern states, the opportunities of
                    escape from oppression and dependence, and the moral and natural rights of the people to the land
                    were advanced on innumerable occasions by a great number of congressmen. The columns of the <hi rend="i">Register of Debates in Congress</hi> and the <hi rend="i">Congressional Globe</hi> are

            <p>When the arguments specifically concerning wage earners were brought forward in Congress, however,
                    they were used by men whose political fortunes and interests were most remote from the labor
                    movement. The view that workers would escape being driven into factories if western land were made
                    cheap was advanced by eighteen congressmen, all Democrats, on twenty-four occasions in twenty-five
                        years.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    in the East who already formed part of a wage-earning class and an organized-labor movement. They
                    spoke of men who might be saved from that fate. But their primary object in each case was directed
                    toward obtaining specific action on public land bills, and the arguments referring to labor were
                    incidental.</p>
            <p>The proposition that land 'reform would save the Easterner from having to work for low wages was also
                    more closely associated with the West than with the labor movement. That aspect of the safety-valve

                    provide the most direct evidence that labor influence had an effective bearing on land policies in
                    Congress. But in thirty years it was suggested four times in debates on land that westward migration
                    would raise wages in the East,<hi rend="sup">22</hi> and three times that it would avert social
                        unrest.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> Considering the millions of words spoken in Congress during those
                    decades, it is not an impressive showing.</p>
            <p>A few conclusions may be drawn from this analysis. The land-labor thesis was never advanced as a
                    primary argument either for land reform or against it by congressmen in the Jacksonian period. When
                    it was used, it was nearly always incidental to more emphatically western objectives with which it
                    appeared to coincide. It seems reasonable to suppose that Western congressmen put the interests of
                    their own constituents above the welfare of a numerically small group such as organized labor in
                    remote parts of the country, but there is no need to raise the question, since a formula was at hand
                    that reconciled those interests. Hundreds of congressmen supported and enacted land laws. Only a
                    handful mentioned labor, and they did so only casually. Except Caleb Cushing, an Easterner and a
                    Whig, who believed that the West was a safety valve and who supported land reform. No evidence has
                    been found that any congressman in the quarter century from 1824 to 1849 was significantly
                    influenced either by the safety-valve idea or by labor problems in acting to liberalize the land
                    policy.</p>

                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, for many years, during December, at the Indiana History Conference
                                    sponsored by the Indiana Historical Society, Society of Indiana Pioneers, and the
                                    Indiana Historical Bureau. The date has been the Friday and Saturday nearest
                                    December 12. The history teachers' program consists of a morning and a luncheon
                                    session on Saturday. But all other meetings are open to the teachers.</p>
                        <p>Those teachers who have attended have found the programs interesting, challenging,
                                    and helpful. Fellowship with other teachers has been stimulating, also.</p>
                        <p>But those who have been in charge of the program have found it embarrassing to beg
                                    busy people to journey to <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and present papers that have taken hours of research, without being
                                    able, often, to even pay their expenses. You see, our organization has existed on
                                    good will instead of adequate dues.</p>
                        <p>Other organizations of prestige, civic and professional, are supported by state dues.
                                    Won't you teachers of the college, high school, and elementary history
                                    departments please make our professional organization one of which you can be
                                    increasingly proud!</p>
                        <p>Teachers in high school and elementary departments depend upon teachers in the
                                    college departments for their training. They, in turn, depend upon an interested,
                                    efficient core in high school and grades to make history, civics, and economics
                                    function in the lives of our future citizens. Without an intelligent, informed
                                    citizenry democracy cannot last. Is it not vital, especially in this critical
                                    period, that we work together toward creating such a public?</p>
                        <p>With this object in mind the teachers attending the December, 1946, meeting adopted
                                    the following motion:</p>
                        <p>"The Indiana History Teachers Association shall have an annual fee of three
                                    dollars which shall include a yearly subscription to the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                                        Magazine of History.</hi> This in turn will include membership in the Indiana
                                    Historical Society, entitling each member of the History Teachers Association to one
                                    copy each of the <hi rend="i">Publications</hi> of the Historical Society."</p>
                        <p>Such material will prove invaluable to the teacher of history, civics, or economics.
                                    You have only to go through some of the recent magazines and publications to be sure
                                    of that.</p>

                        <p>To make the December, 1947 meeting outstanding, the program committee needs to know
                                    now what finances it can count on. So I am asking you to please send your dues

                        <p>I sincerely hope that your response to this appeal will be 100%, and I
                                    trust that I shall see all of you at the meeting in December.</p>

                    </hi> These letters, while in part personal, nevertheless, throw much light on the early life in our
                    state.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kothe was kind enough to furnish background for the material. He writes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The earliest letter [actually it is the second letter], dated January 15, 1854, was by my
                            great grandfather, Justus Meyer, to my grandfather, William Kothe, who then lived in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                            </placeName>. Justus Meyer had been a teacher in the schools of Melsungen, a town of about
                            7,000, on the Fulda River, near [about twenty miles south of] Kassel. He had likewise been a
                            teacher of music and, as player of the organ in the Lutheran Church, was known as Cantor.
                            During the revolution in 1848 he was elected as a representative to the Assembly in Kassel.
                            When the reaction set in he became more dissatisfied with conditions in Hessen [the
                            Grand-duchy of Hesse or Hesse-Kassel] and decided in 1853 to migrate to America with his
                            family. He was then 57 years of age. Two sons had migrated in prior years.</p>
                        <p>William Kothe, my grandfather, had also been a native of Melsungen and in 1849 migrated to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                            </placeName>. He completed the school training of the town creditably and had had some
                            experience as Clerk in the administrative divisions of the government, but had,
                            unfortunately, not perfected himelf in any trade. In consequence, his first years in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                            </placeName> were very difficult. He was twenty-seven years of age, and in desperation
                            finally took employment as an apprentice in a bakery. Upon the death of his grandfather in
                            Melsungen, from whom he inherited a small estate, he returned to <placeName>
                                <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                            </placeName> in 1853 to receive his share, and in view of the small progress he had made in
                            America he looked about hoping to find economic opportunities there. After traveling about
                            and reviewing the situation, he fully recognized the serious economic plight of the country
                            and determined once more to attempt to make a go of it in America.</p>
                        <p>Aboard the sailboat on which he made his return trip were Cantor Meyer and his family. It was
                            during that trip that Christine Meyer and William Kothe were engaged. William Kothe stayed

                            planned to use his estate in the purchase of a grocery store. Christine and her father,
                            mother, and her brother Jean, proceeded to Indiana, where they finally established
                            themselves in the virgin forest there, building a log house immediately after arrival.</p>

            <p>The earliest letter, which is torn in places, undated, with no signature, was probably written by

                        <p>Learn self-denial in order to be happy. This maxim should be deeply, deeply impressed
                                    on one, before one enters upon the very difficult journey to America. After a trip
                                    of ten days we, to be sure, arrived safely at George's, but almost too much
                                    had to be endured during this trip as we made it. It was cheap, 'tis true, but also
                                    heartily wretched. As far as <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Harrisburg</settlement>
                                    </placeName> we got along quite rapidly; at eleven o'clock we were already
                                    there. From then on, however, it was bad. We had to wait there until 10
                                    o'clock for the emigrant train. That is a miserable trip, for they proceed
                                    entirely at their volition; they have no definite schedule for arrival. Having run a
                                    few hours, the cars again came to a standstill for half a day and later for half of
                                    the night. It was not until Tuesday night that we arrived in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>; there we had to spend the night, and on the next day we boarded the
                                    steamship. I believed that I had already borne all the inconveniences which we
                                    should have during the trip, for you told me that on board the ship it would be very
                                    nice, but here, dear William, the misery really began. We were quartered in the
                                    lower deck. The large passenger ships, due to the low water stage, are not
                                    operating, therefore our ship was a small one. The space, which should have been
                                    given over to the passengers, was so crammed with crates and barrels, that one could
                                    hardly find a small space on the floor to make our humble bed. Since we had no
                                    bedding with us, what we endured was really something. I much preferred not to lie
                                    down at all, for when one got up one actually felt .broken apart. Yet, despite all,
                                    I slept, at times on the crates. Then there was the terrible heat from the boilers
                                    and from the sun on the outside. I must confess, dearest William, I was once again
                                    truly unhappy, though I believe if you had been with me, I should have borne it more
                                    easily.</p>
                        <p>Saturday evening we arrived at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                                    </placeName> [spelled Mathesen]. The train from there had already left and so, due
                                    to the fact that no train may run on Sundays, we were compelled to remain until
                                    Monday morning. Father, impelled by boredom and curiosity, went to the church of a
                                    free evangelical congregation. The pastor had just finished Sunday school with his
                                    children. He gave father a book to enable him to follow the service and later they
                                    conversed, in the course <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-043-2-073"/> of which he
                                    ascertained that father was a teacher, and also urged him to play the organ. He then
                                    requested him to stay with him, offering to pay him 24 dollars a month for assisting
                                    him a little in the school. Father naturally did not accept, but also did not
                                    entirely reject the offer. If the buying of a farm does not proceed rapidly, he may
                                    undertake it.</p>
                        <p>Monday noon we arrived here [<placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName>?]. George was at the depot. He looks very well and was in
                                    the best humor. But he had hardly expected us so soon, for he had received our
                                    letter on Sunday, and in consequence he had nothing in order. We went again to a
                                    hotel. Then in rapid succession a lodging was rented and chairs and a stove were
                                    bought. George made a table the next day. So far good neighbors have helped us out,
                                    whom we are every day obliged to impose upon. They are tailors, also Germans. At
                                    their house we cooked our first coffee. We live like those uncivilized, at least
                                    half-civilized. Beds we do not have as yet, for our things have not arrived. Every
                                    night the miserable bedding, consisting of straw sacks and woolen blankets, which we
                                    fortunately had with us, is laid upon the floor. We had difficulty in obtaining
                                    straw. Furthermore, everything here is very expensive; old potatoes 30 cents a peck
                                    and new ones way over a dollar. It will be expensive to live here. One fortunate
                                    thing is that here at the house there is a good well and we can get wood near it.
                                    [At this point the left side of the page has a hole about two inches square.] We
                                    live in a neat little frame house. Here things are generally so primitive, that I
                                    must admit that it hasn't pleased me a bit so far. After I have been here a
                                    while, I hope that I shall like it better. If you could only be here; that, to be
                                    sure, is not yet possible, for only today father is at Karl's to look about
                                    and get his advice. George is on the look-out for a sawmill. He would have written
                                    you, but we do not yet know what we shall do. We'll have to await
                                    father's return. [The trip of her father, who had set out to purchase a
                                    farm, is described in the second letter.] Oh, dear William, the thought of how we
                                    shall start really frightens me at times. It will no doubt be quite difficult, but
                                    we'll place our faith in God; He will quite certainly help us. Now fare
                                    thee well, and send me word real soon. Is your cough better?</p>
                        <p>One thing more, yesterday I was, out for the first time. I was at
                                    Hilgenberg's. He and his wife came with their wagon and called for me. They
                                    had been here once before, on ... . Tuesday [the missing words may be "the
                                    first"], also with the wagon to call for us, but the weather was so bad
                                    that I could not go along. Yesterday, therefore, I saw his establishment and wished

                        <p>In order to be able to do more than merely inform you of my address, I have delayed
                                    answering so long. I beg to be excused for waiting until after the receipt of your
                                    second letter of December 28 of last year to answer the one of the third of that
                                    month. That I have now come into the wild (Christian calls it Walachei) [To the
                                    Germans Wallachia represented a forlorn wilderness] is known to you, but probably
                                    not the reason. I have been traveling around with Karl for many days looking at
                                    farms. I also made a bid on a farm here and there, among others one near Cicero
                                    [Indiana], consisting of 160 acres, which except for the house was quite an
                                    attractive and productive farm. I bid $3,000. Then, just as we were
                                    passing through <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName>, we learned of the public auction of the last state-land, the
                                    school-section of 620 acres. Although we barely had time to view the land, we
                                    purchased 320 acres for $2142.00, and in so doing have provided labor for
                                    my life as well as that of my descendants. I hope we shall in consequence of this
                                    effort find our deserts. All beginning is difficult, a thing which I previously
                                    pointed out to Karl. With Karl's help along with that of the others, if God
                                    grants us health, we shall make it go. I like to work in the open; I enjoy planting
                                    as well as gathering the harvest. I hope you will convince yourself with your own
                                    eyes that we in our situation could not do better. My experience has already cost me
                                    something here and there, and it will cost still more; that is to be expected.</p>

                                    the ship recalls truly pleasant memories despite its monotony. The seasickness, the
                                    eternal swaying, the horn sounding weirdly in the dense fog–all these
                                    incidents recede into the background. It is an admirable thing that the unpleasant
                                    is so quickly blotted out from our memory. Europeans ought not to be so terrified by
                                    an ocean journey. Our friend Nohl [?], according to his letter of
                                    September 5 of last year hopes to be able to relate his stormy past experiences at a
                                    cozy fireside [in Melsungen], to tell of his unsuccessful hopes and his
                                    disappointments. I hope he will encourage our friends who have been left behind to
                                    follow us. For a great many Melsunger, says my kinsman J. Worst, will follow us. It
                                    will indeed be a good thing for them, if they come. Work and food can be found here

                        <p>Although the region and the woods are wild and the temperature at present raw (since
                                    Christmas we have had two weeks of continued cold, 6 to 8 degrees, then three days
                                    12 to 14, the last three days again cold, on the 14th of this month 10 degrees), I
                                    like it withal because of the friendly and helpful attitude of the neighbors. Every
                                    week I have visits from neighbors, though, sorry as I am, I am unable to return them
                                    all. One evening five came, bringing with them their church hymns in four voice
                                    arrangements; we had hardly sung for half an hour when there were twelve strangers
                                    in my room. They came with lanterns and mostly on horse-back. An exceptionally good
                                    tenor was among them. It is too bad that we could not sing our beautiful <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                                    </placeName> hymns. Not a one of them understands a word of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, and I as yet little English. We have always understood that the
                                    American is not sociable, but my neighbors are a pleasant exception. A few days ago
                                    our friendly neighbor King, with whom we lived five weeks, arrived at 6
                                    o'clock in the morning to discuss some matter with Karl, and in the
                                    eveliing he came with his well-educated wife to visit with us. Twelve days ago he
                                    took Christina in his hunting-sledge to the Sunday services at the
                                    "Meading" church [meeting; probably refers to Quakers] and today
                                    again he sent an invitation. They are devout, and indeed the fundamental
                                    characteristic of the American is religiosity, based on his supreme principle: No
                                    happiness without liberty, no liberty without morality, no morality without
                                    religion. They practice their religion through a life of brotherly love. They often
                                    go to church, but pay for no preacher. They are their own preachers, not trained,
                                    but nevertheless preach in an engaging manner; they exhort one to a kindly
                                    disposition, to brotherly love; at times they exhibit a certain narrowness in
                                    matters of faith, but yet they are very tolerant, do not ask about their
                                    neighbor's creed, do not baptize their children, but leave that to the
                                    children themselves whether they want to join a sect and then be baptized. Thus you
                                    will find here persons twenty years old and older who have not been baptized. <placeName>

                                    good-natured and obedient, does help mother with the washing some, but for himself
                                    as farm helper and for the farmer, it is a poor deal. A farm laborer from abroad
                                    would be delighted to come here for the 60 dollars which he gets for a
                                    year's wages, and with such a person I could really accomplish something.
                                    Plowing, mowing, fence building, all expensive essentials, "which every <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                                    </placeName> laborer knows, Martin will never learn. In his accomplishments he is
                                    not much better than Jean [John], and has neither the zeal nor the endurance of
                                    Jean, which doesn't mean that he may not be a very good tanner. For
                                    $60 Werner Gernhard, a capable laborer, would have come [from Melsungen].
                                    If they were only disabused of the idea that 60 dollars here requires only light
                                    work. If I were able to pay these 60 dollars for work performed, then these persons
                                    would have earned the right thereto, but not when I pay in advance and carry the
                                    risk. For if one dies or becomes unfit for work, the 60 dollars are gone. Sixty
                                    dollars in advance are the equivalent of $120 if the payment were made
                                    after the work has been performed. Every one should be on his guard against
                                    employing a person trained in a trade if he is to lay hold of an ax or a hoe. They
                                    perform such labor reluctantly, look longingly forward to the conclusion of the work
                                    period and do not want to learn the knack of this work. For me such a worker is an
                                    additional loss because Henry by his disobedience and his other <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-043-2-077"/> faults spoils every worker who is not already trained.
                                    From the outset Karl and Henry acted unfriendly toward August. [An unfriendly act of
                                    Karl's toward August is next described. Henry left and hired himself out to
                                    a nearby farmer for two months.] He gets ten dollars monthly and comes to visit us
                                    every Sunday. When he related that they work there two hours before breakfast and
                                    two hours after supper, I expressed the wish that here too Karl, Henry, and Martin
                                    each cut down before breakfast a small tree in front of our garden, where we have
                                    cleared, only a quarter of a half an hour's work and none in the evening;
                                    but Karl answered: "I will not work before breakfast" and Henry
                                    said: "I don't care to cripple myself by working." So I
                                    went out with Martin the next morning–Jean was still
                                    asleep–and each of us cut down three small trees, and we did the same the
                                    following morning. Martin now goes out regularly to tackle a tree and if he strikes
                                    a tough bird with a diameter of one and a half to two feet, he must have help. Henry
                                    and Karl in recent days have also come along, but they do as they desire, not as I
                                    wish. I can't keep them.</p>
                        <p>August is so anxious to learn English; for us, mother, Martin and me, it is just as
                                    necessary. Henry had received $60 from me in Kas-sel for English
                                    instruction, in order that we might learn from him. He was to write one sentence
                                    each day upon the blackboard, which I had set up for that purpose [probably in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName>], but he failed to do it. I myself on several occasions copied passages
                                    from the grammar, but then Henry was too tired [to help; Henry apparently had
                                    learned a little English in Kassel, but failed to help the others in <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                                    </placeName>.] "In short," August said, "I see they are
                                    both [probably Henry and Karl] blowing in the same horn to get rid of me. I shall
                                    have to learn English from an Englishman," and went off to Schenk. I shall
                                    have to engage a teacher during the coming winter.</p>
                        <p>And so I fare. Karl will probably soon establish his own household and leave us. In
                                    that case August intends to return to us for a time. But I would like to have either
                                    Karl or August, to have both costs me too much. I cannot pay August less than he
                                    receives elsewhere, and Karl wants $150 a year. In eight years he would
                                    be in possession of the farm. Under these conditions I must secure a reliable worker
                                    from our homeland, and even if I had to pay him 60, 80, or 100 dollars a year. After
                                    two or three more years Jean will be able, if God so wills it, to plow and to mow;
                                    then we shall get along. Under these unhappy conditions my small sum of cash
                                    resources will soon be exhausted. To maintain my necessary reserves I shall have to
                                    have the 100 dollars returned after two years [probably a loan]. To get ahead is out
                                    of the question, and [the possibility of having] to toil for others in my advanced
                                    years, to be racked with such work as clearing and fence building, which should be
                                    the lot of a young, sturdy man, no humane person would expect of me. We borrowed
                                    $20 from George four weeks ago. Now there is no meat, no rice, and also
                                    no money; we had to take things on credit.</p>
                        <p>I got corn a week ago two miles distant, 12 bushels @ 30 cents. Karl has
                                    80 bushels in his crib, and I offered him 30 cents, but he refused to sell me 12
                                    bushels, either all or none, so I had to fetch it <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-043-2-078"/> two miles. Our wheat crop has developed very meagerly. We had the poorest wheat
                                    in this vicinity, because Karl had failed to plow drainage furrows, and thus it was
                                    damaged by the cold and the dampness. August said: "Rather than raise such
                                    poor wheat, I'd grow none." Egler, our neighbor, has fine wheat,
                                    also the others. The oats are fair, and we have twelve loads of hay. Karl and August
                                    mowed hay at Egler's, he receiving three-fifths, we two-fifths. Martin and
                                    Henry made it [put it in the barn?]. We shall get few potatoes, because
                                    Karl planted them too late; he did not want to hitch up just for the potatoes alone,
                                    and I did not have a laborer to carry out my orders. August was not yet here. Henry
                                    and Jean have been hewing brambles in the uncleared area, which is full of roots. In
                                    the last two months it has rained only twice, thunder showers, each time accompanied
                                    by storm; the last time, on the third of the month, so severe, that nine trees
                                    crushed the corn in the large field near the house. At Wolschase's farm the
                                    damage was greater; there the storm broke down one-fourth of the stalks, and hurled
                                    many trees into the cornfield. This recent storm did not produce as much rain as the
                                    first, and the ground is again very dry. It is a marvel that things continue to
                                    remain green despite the drought. We hope and implore daily for rain.</p>

                                    earlier.] The shipment would, of course, have to be insured. In <placeName>

                        <p>This fall we, mother, Jean, the godchild, and I, plan to call on Ingels in October,
                                    if we by then have acquired some English. We are to get a load of apples there. Last

                                    Christine should write to King's, but in English. Mrs. King has written to
                                    us, wants to know how things are going. King's letter I still have not
                                    answered. It will be hard work for me [to write in English].</p>
                        <p>If only the Baeder girl were here to help mother. I don't know, should I pay
                                    her passage money and agree to an annual payment of $10 to the elderly
                                    Baeder as long as she is in our service. She has repeatedly written us and pleaded
                                    that we pay the passage for her and her aged brother; she would be glad to work at
                                    anything she could do. Both would be useful to us, if they kept their promise and
                                    worked for us several years.</p>

            <p>The last letter was written about twenty years later, in 1874. Christine Meyer Kothe had returned to
                    Melsungen for a visit, and in this letter describes her trip and her reception in the old home. The
                    frugality of this pioneer family is evinced by the fact that she traveled in steerage. The letter
                        <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-043-2-079"/> reveals a high degree of nostalgic longing for the old home

                                    strenuous and that followed by steerage, for that indeed is a horrible abode. Our
                                    cellar would be a salon in comparison. [After some comment on the trip, she avers
                                    that nothing would ever induce her to travel in steerage again.] What my emotions
                                    were when I saw the red tile roofs of Bremerhafen is beyond description; that is a

                                    Feed them well and don't forget to water them, dear Henry. I hope you will
                                    succeed with the soap, dear Gustav.</p>

            <p>A translation of a letter of September 3, 1885, was also among the material placed at our disposal.
                    The original manuscript, however, was not included, which made it impossible to check the
                    transcription and the translation. The letter was written by William Kothe, who, as the contents

                        <p>Last Saturday I received a letter from G. Koch, from <placeName>

                                    now, after many complications, has arranged their trip to America. They will be

                                    August. Furthermore, Koch writes that he was unable to engage one or two laborers,
                                    for you. However, on the trip to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bremen</settlement>
                                    </placeName> he had induced an emigrant to America and his son to go to you. Despite
                                    every effort the machinist will find it difficult to find work here, for many of the
                                    same trade, who are locally well known, are still unemployed, due to the fact that
                                    the factories are operating only in part. Several from Melsungen, who had even been
                                    employed as mechanics in such factories, have already experienced ½ <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-043-2-080"/> to ¾ of a year of unemployment, and
                                    there are yet no prospects for betterment. F. Schreiber (brother of William) also
                                    has no job, though every effort has been made in his behalf. In consequence he is
                                    obviously displeased and longs to return home. Arnold, who married the daughter of
                                    your neighbor Conradi, arrived 6 weeks ago and is also without employment. Widow
                                    Kruhn from Millstreet in Mel-sungen, will sail in a few days on the next sailboat,

                                    probably already landed there. What will the people of Melsungen say when those
                                    persons return?</p>
                        <p>In our vicinity–Norfolk and <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Portsmouth</settlement>
                                    </placeName>–a yellow fever epidemic is raging in a terrible manner and
                                    is still on the increase. The cases are mainly fatal. Many physicians from here and
                                    other places have gone there and by such efforts the situation has been much
                                    clarified. The appeals from there are touching and even though substantial
                                    assistance (in money already over $50,000) has been sent, follow up calls
                                    are coming here constantly. During the last few days an appeal has come from the
                                    Germans there, stating that in addition to the pestilence they were now confronted
                                    with the danger of hunger.</p>
                        <p>For some time it had been our intention to dispose of our effects here and to move
                                    closer to you, but this has been consistently delayed from time to time. My wife has
                                    ever had a longing for such a place as would afford her some opportunity of
                                    associating with her parents and brothers, that if we can convert our property
                                    satisfactorily, I am for it. The conditions are still very depressed and it is not
                                    yet possible to determine when they will be better. In consequence stores are
                                    subjected to substantial losses. In addition, the demands of my family up to now, as
                                    well as those of others, are too substantial to enable me to meet all of them.</p>
                        <p>For more than a year my brother-in-law, Ohrenschall has boarded and roomed with us
                                    and in addition, in that time, has received from us quite a sum of money. It would
                                    amount to more than $100 in ready money. I have been unable to obtain
                                    reimbursement and in consequence my sister has been required to secure it with her
                                    estate. My brother comes along without a cent and pawns his musical instrument for
                                    $25.00. After chasing about endlessly, I procured its release, for who
                                    was expected to pay: no one but I. For the past 8 days he is instructing in a newly
                                    built school, for the assurance of which position I have made considerable
                                    sacrifice. Because of the depression and the sacrifices named, our stay here has
                                    been spoiled and as I see it, our removal would be for the best. My wife is of the
                                    opinion that in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> there would be various opportunities for our livelihood. In what manner
                                    we shall again become occupied we shall leave [to the future], for on the site one
                                    may come to a conclusion and find a position, which one has not thought of. We have
                                    related to you conditions here for the purpose of obtaining your judgment as to the
                                    advisability of our settling in your vicinity, prior to entering upon an arrangement
                                    to sell. Write to us at your early opportunity.</p>

            <p>Archbishop Whately once undertook to establish by strict application of the canons of historical
                    criticism that Bonaparte Napoleon was nothing but some kind of allegorical symbol instead of a real
                    flesh-and-blood person. The Archbishop succeeded in making a very good case albeit Napoleon was
                    still very much alive on the island of St. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Lewis has undertaken to prove that Tom Paine, not Thomas Jefferson, was the real
                    author of the "Declaration of Independence." He, too, has succeeded in building up
                    a very strong case.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lewis has reconstructed the relevant course of events somewhat as follows: Some time after
                    Richard Henry Lee's resolution had been introduced and after a committee had been appointed
                    to draw up a formal declaration, Tom Paine wrote the original draft and submitted it either to John
                    Adams or Thomas Jefferson, members of the committee. Both Adams and Jefferson, fearing that the
                    precious original draft might be lost, made copies of it in their own hands. Jefferson's
                    copy was styled by him the Rough Draft. Jefferson changed the wording of the Rough Draft by striking
                    out and interlining. Later he submitted this amended Rough Draft to the members of the committee who
                    made further changes. This amended draft was then submitted to Congress that made still further
                    changes by striking out and interlining before it was adopted on July 4.</p>
            <p>The author submits many opinions and bits of evidence. The reviewer can summarize only a selected
                    few.</p>
            <list type="ordered">
               <item>The substance and the style of the "Declaration of Independence" and Tom
                        Paine's <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi> have such striking similarity that they could
                        only have been produced by the same man.</item>
               <item>John Adams' copy is replete with capital letters. Tom Paine was in the habit of emphasizing
                        words by the use of capitals. Adams must have copied Paine's original, including the
                        capitals.</item>
               <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-043-2-082"/>
               <item>Jefferson in his Rough Draft wrote the same phrase twice in succession, then struck out one of
                        them, evidence that the Rough Draft was not an original draft but a copy.</item>
               <item>The Rough Draft of the Declaration condemns the institution of slavery and proposes its
                        abolition. When in the Continental Congress, opposition developed to this section, Jefferson
                        made no attempt to defend it, evidence that Jefferson did not really have convictions on this
                        subject and could not have been the real author of that provision.</item>
               <item>Activities and writings of Jefferson prior to June, 1776, indicate that the thought of
                        independence was so new to him that his thinking had not yet matured to the level of the
                        "Declaration of Independence."</item>
            </list>
            <p>The reviewer submits that it is possible to reconstruct the course of events somewhat differently
                    without doing violence to the evidence. One may assume that Jefferson himself drew an original
                    Declaration of Independence, revised it by striking out and interlining until the document became
                    almost unreadable to anyone other than himself; that he then made a clean copy of this which he
                    styled the Rough Draft; that it was this draft that he passed to John Adams and that John Adams
                    copied it, capitalizing important words, primarily nouns, on his own accord since he, like Paine,
                    had the habit of using capitals freely. At any rate, Jefferson, if he copied from Paine, did not
                    feel obliged to reproduce the capitals as Adams did. After submitting his Rough Draft to Adams,
                    Jefferson continued to correct and to polish it by striking out and interlining before submitting
                    the amended draft to the committee. If one assumes this sequence of events, one has a perfectly
                    natural explanation of how in Jefferson's Rough Draft one phrase came to be repeated. The
                    Rough Draft was a copy, but a copy of Jefferson's original.</p>
            <p>The author makes the sweeping statement that he has examined the writings of Jefferson and that among
                    them there is no evidence that Jefferson was in favor of the abolition of slavery prior to the
                    drafting of the "Declaration of Independence." The simple fact is that in
                    Jefferson's Instructions to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Delegates to the First Continental Congress, written by him about two years before
                    this, he does emphatically express himself as committed to the abolition of slavery and condemns the
                    King for having fastened this institution upon the colonies through his encouragement <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-043-2-083"/> of the slave trade. In this document also Jefferson states that the
                    people have received their rights from the law of nature and not from the King, that if the King
                    dissolves their colonial assemblies, all powers revert to the people. He condemns almost all acts of
                    Parliament condemned in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lewis takes an entirely different attitude with respect to the nature of the Declaration of
                    Independence than does the reviewer. Apparently Mr. Lewis assumes that the document embodies an
                    effort at the clear expression of absolute political truth and is horrified at the statement that
                    Adams and Jefferson made concerning the casual way in which they decided who was to try his hand at
                    drafting the document. He is inclined to believe they did not remember correctly. The reviewer
                    believes that their memory was probably accurate enough. It was not the task of the draftsman to say
                    anything new. If he did, it would defeat the purpose of the document. He must restate the
                    revolutionary philosophy that had been accepted by the colonists from the days of John Locke, repeat
                    the indictments against Parliament and King, using phrases to which they were accustomed. Jefferson
                    no doubt unconsciously borrowed from Paine. He probably was more indebted to Locke. The reviewer
                    looks upon the "Declaration of Independence" as a document of practical politics,
                    nothing less than a platform for a political party–the Whigs. The virtue of the document
                    would then lie in the fact that it was so drawn that it would receive the acceptance of the greatest
                    possible number of people and alienate as few as possible. Differences of view and of interest must
                    either be omitted from such a document or must be phrased as to permit different people to read
                    different meanings into it. Jefferson was only playing the part of the practical politician when,
                    after having performed the task of drafting such a document, he did not stubbornly insist upon the
                    retention of the antislavery clause but was willing to stand by and see the document so modified
                    that it would not drive some of the slavery states out of the budding Union. Without union the
                    resolution for independence could not have become effective and the formal Declaration of
                    Independence would have become an expression of academic idealism, of idealistic but blasted hopes
                    and intentions.</p>
            <p>The reviewer, along with some other historians, has long <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-043-2-084"/> assumed
                    that Jefferson was one of the most unscrupulous men that ever occupied the presidential chair, but
                    he cannot bring himself to believe that he was morally as low as the acceptance of Mr. Lewis' thesis
                    would compel one to believe. Think of the moral depravity of a man who would ask to have placed on
                    his tombstone the statement that he was the author of something or other that was really written by
                    someone else! Neither can the reviewer believe that Jefferson was fool enough to take such a risk.
                    Just think of the foolhardiness of a man claiming such authorship and accepting without hesitation
                    the credit universally ascribed to him, when old John Adams, his political enemy, and Ton Paine were
                    still living and, by revealing the truth, could have blown him and his reputation sky high!</p>
            <p>Mr. Lewis has produced a remarkable book. It is marred somewhat by the author's categorical
                    statement of personal opinions about matters that can be neither proved or disproved. For example,
                    the author states that the production of <hi rend="i">Common Sense</hi> "was the the
                    greatest single literary achievement in the history of the printed word." It may have been,
                    but it can't be proved. He has, however, made a strong case in his main contention. Men
                    have been hung before now when the prosecution had a much weaker case. An array of selected facts,
                    even though they have stood the test of the canons of historical criticism, do not always add up to
                    the truth.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was Britain's ambassador at large to the Middle West. That he found time to
                    learn so much about us, and to write this book in the midst of other duties is certainly a testimony
                    to his energies. In <hi rend="i">Midwest at Noon</hi> he has done, in many respects, a more
                    difficult thing than his compatriots of an earlier day–Basil Hall, Mrs. Trollope, even
                    James Bryce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Midwest at Noon</hi> is not a history; it is a survey and an interpretation. The climate
                    and the environment are treated <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-043-2-085"/> in relation to the frontier
                    influence. The early population, based on the "Unconsidered Earth," was modified
                    by industrialization, different foreign immigration, business, science. "The Cities
                    Rise" and profusely affect the "Folk and Ways." The chapters on
                    "The Cult of the Average," "Ideas Incorporated," and
                    "We the People" contain some of the best observations in the book.</p>
            <p>One might question the somewhat arbitrary delineation of the Midwest–just why the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> should be a dividing line and not the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> is not clear. The author saves himself, however, in referring to his
                    area–the Old Northwest plus <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>–as the "core" of the Midwest. There are historical
                    errors–for instance, p. 62, a great overemphasis on the contributions of the Yankees to
                    civilization in the area; the statement, p.115, that the Midwest "farmers were frozen
                    completely out" of politics during the period of industrialization; "the old
                    uniform equality of the settlers," p. 127; "the best black earth could be had
                    … at $1.25 per acre"; etc.–but one is amazed at their
                    fewness and insignificance. Errors of interpretation and analysis are also at a minimum. Perhaps
                    there is an overemphasis on business as god (basketball at times seems equally important) ;
                    "To the businessmen and bankers who dominated the Republican party, security meant
                    … rendering the costs of industry rigid" would hardly stand the test of facts;
                    the statement that "foreign trade was thought to be immoral" by the Midwest would
                    be hard to document–perhaps, forgetting their own early derelictions along that line, it
                    was the foreigners who did not pay their bills whom Midwesterners considered immoral;
                    "there is no folklore or family background" to the Midwesterner's
                    history. But here again the strikes are few and the hits many.</p>
            <p>Though the author is at his best on the big cities and the effects of industrial urbanization, the
                    small towns, rural areas, and byways are not neglected. Though naturally he is not acquainted with
                    the latter as well, he understands their basic importance. "Those fundamental and
                    remarkably searching political discussions in the stores, taverns, farms, and courthouses of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName> before the Civil War do not seem so long ago when you go among Midwest farmers today.
                    This may seem very near to romantic idealism; but it goes on. It simply is not heard of by the <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-043-2-086"/> three-fifths of the population who are city dwellers in the
                    Midwest. And that seems to me a pity for both of the great divisions of the Midwest people. 'There
                    is a great gulf fixed. … " And again when he points out that American newspapers
                    are likely to fool outsiders more than the natives he is but recognizing the old pioneer use of
                    humor as a critical prop.</p>
            <p>So frequent are the shrewd and illuminating observations and bits of inspired writing that it would
                    be impossible to spoil the book for the reader even though the reviewer quoted dozens of them. He
                    cannot resist the temptation to quote one: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There is more politeness in thanking than in asking. That is probably because midwesterners
                            like to be asked to do things or to help and are the most approachable (and approaching)
                            people. One is struck by the extent to which kindliness and considerateness form the basis
                            and justification of Midwest manners. It is as if the mutual aid and comfort of pioneers and
                            alien immigrants had been turned into sympathetic consideration for all men. But it is a
                            realistic sympathy and consideration. For instance, self-help must be exhausted before
                            consideration will be forthcoming. There is more help for someone who has suffered by an act
                            of God than for someone who has only himself to blame or can look after himself. A man will
                            take off his hat before a young stenographer in the office elevator; he will not give up his
                            seat to her in the streetcar; but he will get up for an elderly woman or an obviously
                            expectant mother. When he does get up, there is an awkwardness in his approach because he is
                            doing something good in public: "Here, take this seat," or "You
                            sit right here," he will say. In this there is some evidence of the midwesterners'
                            deep distrust of gallantry and "the gentleman."</p>
                        <p>This is strange because, between 1870 and 1910, in every big Midwest city there was what is
                            now called the "old school" of courtesy, manners, and elegance: a society
                            which could, on its home ground, compare with its counterparts anywhere in the world. These
                            were ‘the old men with beautiful manners.’ Some of them remain. Their
                            world has vanished. Instead, a new school of free-and-easy, familiar, natural <hi rend="i">bonhomie</hi> has sprung up. Its members, now in their forties, think the old school
                            "stuffy." They emancipated themselves from the old school of manners
                            during and after the first World War. Meanwhile, however, their children have been in the
                            second World War, and there are evidences of a return to more formal manners in this
                            informally brought-up younger generation. So does the wheel come full circle, and so are
                            parents surprised–and grandparents often delighted.</p>

                    combination of talents and experiences of a man such as Graham Hutton: a fine scholarship in
                    languages, literature and history, wide travel, a curious mind, a traveling man's
                    disposition, a businessman's experience, a facil pen, and the artist's intuition.</p>
            <p>The author draws upon his firsthand acquaintance with much of the world for many comparisons,
                    contrasts, and allusions; he gives the Midwest a kind of valuation which a Midwesterner could not
                    give it. There is no malice or prejudice in the book; nor is there the slightest striving for the
                    spectacular or an attempt to flatter us. Of the author's sincere liking for the region
                    there can be no question. In fact, the Midwest being, as it is, a state of mind, Hutton must have
                    been a Midwesterner long before he came here; his ancestors, by some quirk of fate, just happened to
                    have stayed in <placeName>

            <p>Preparing a biography of Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a difficult and involved task. The literature is extensive and the varied career of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> requires a writer to know much about the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from 1809 to 1865. A greater difficulty is found in the traditions and reminiscences
                    that have grown around the great man. In an effort to glorify him, his humble origins have been
                    exaggerated and his parents and wife subjected to very questionable treatment. Writers seeking to
                    make the man human have succeeded in picturing him as more eccentric, romantic, and melancholy than
                    he probably was. A true biographer needs to be a hardboiled scholar who will not hesitate to declare
                    that reminiscences <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-043-2-088"/> written twenty and thirty years after the
                    fact are scarcely reliable, that myths based upon such evidence hardly deserve to be dignified by
                    the attention they have received, and that there is a body of authentic <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> material from which an adequate biography can be written.</p>
            <p>The present work is not such a biography, but it is a highly interesting and very useful substitute
                    for a new life. It is <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s career pieced together from the writings of many authors. Contemporaries of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>, modern writers, prominent officials, relatively unknown authors, historians, literary
                    figures and even <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s writings are drawn upon for these selections. At the beginning of each of
                    the twenty-four chapters is an introduction by the editor, and before each selection is a brief
                    comment about the event to be described or the author whose description is reproduced. These
                    introductions and comments are excellently done. They give evidence of the ability and knowledge of
                    the editor. Like his <hi rend="i">Shelf of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                        </placeName> Books</hi> (reviewed in this magazine in volume XLII, 413–414), they
                    establish his familiarity with the literature about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Sometimes they are more critical than the writing which follows. Generally, the
                    selections are well chosen. Almost any reader who is interested in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> will find several hours of instructive and fascinating reading in the volume. Because
                    of its brevity, its arrangement, and its low cost, its readers will probably be quite numerous. It
                    represents a very creditable performance.</p>
            <p>In evaluating its place in historical literature, it is necessary to note that its chief value will
                    probably be as a popular, but satisfactory brief account of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s life. From its nature it cannot contain anything new. In bringing together
                    accounts of so many authors there could not help but be some inconsistency in approach and
                    treatment. This the author has skillfully kept at a minimum. The most glaring instance, perhaps, is
                    the editor's introduction to the chapter "Romance and Marriage," which is
                    scholarly and unemotional, but followed by a selection from Carl Sandburg which is an emotional
                    acceptance of the Ann Rutledge story with all its romantic details. The servant's view, pp.
                    190–192, is probably unfortunate for it gives evidence of a servant's prejudice
                    against any one who attempted to rise in the world. The picture of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s visit to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> has a mythical ring about it and was probably written several years after the <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-043-2-089"/> event. In the final chapter, too much attention seems to be
                    devoted to dreams. In general, the readers might have been given more information upon which to base
                    an evaluation of each selection.</p>
            <p>One might also ask whether or not the editor has met the standards which an adequate biography should
                    meet. He is well informed and scholarly, and obviously well-prepared for the task he has undertaken.
                    This volume is generally quite excellent, but it contains a small amount of material of questionable
                    worth, and some of the myths that surround <placeName>

                    the stage of life long before I came on, and the other, when I was too young to realize what a
                    grandfather meant. I have a vague recollection of a white-haired kindly old man, that might have
                    been Santa Claus for all I know, bending above my cradle. But he has always been a cherished
                    tradition with me. I have always regretted that I was not permitted to know him. From the county
                    history, old family letters, scrapbooks, and what I've heard my father and others say of
                    him, I know he was a fine, kindly gentleman, a good citizen, loved and respected by his family and
                    friends.</p>
            <p>Among some old papers yellow and tattered with age, I found a poem he had written entitled
                    "The Christian's Spring" which shows his love of nature and religious
                    convictions, and more culture than is usually found in nonprofessionals of that early time. Letters
                    from and to his children indicate that they depended on his judgment and advice. The relationship
                    which usually exists between children and their mother was assumed by him. I have an idea that
                    grandmother who was of the Poindexter family, that traced its lineage back to the thirteenth century
                    and to the counts de <placeName>

                    and of a colder nature. I have pictured her as somewhat remote and dignified in stiff, black silk
                    and lace mitts, leaving much of the mothering of her family to her husband and unmarried sister,
                    Louisa. In those days the only place in the universe for spinsters was that of the patient drudge in
                    the home of her married sisters. My father always spoke of his Aunt Louisa as an angel of mercy. She

            <p>According to my father, grandfather believed, as did most people in those good, old days, that
                    children should obey their parents and took no foolishness from his progeny, although kind and fair
                    in meting out justice. He was fond of children and was wont to plane off curly shavings at his
                    carpenter shop for them to play with, as I've been told by the descendants of some of those
                    village children.</p>

                    as now, it was not popular. He was prominent in the Masonic and I.O.O.F. lodges and served as county

                    forty dollars from a peddler. It seems grandfather had saved up that money for some fixed purpose,
                    and when he heard of her purchase he exclaimed, "Why, you have ruined me!" But he
                    did not scold, which illustrates his mildness or just the opposite characteristic of her for the
                    Poindexters were considered rather "highly strung." Everybody, however, came to
                    see the carpet.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Wilcox told the reporter that she had put the first clothes on Robert, the first child of my
                    grandparents, and that every year on the thirteenth of February, his birthday, he sent her a silver

                    purchased from Congress by his oldest brother, Jean Jacques. Dufour sold 108 to Jacob Evertson in

                    an object of great reverence. There were horsehair sofas and chairs and marble-topped tables. Family
                    portraits and engravings in heavy gilt frames and a brass-framed pier glass kept each other company.
                    The elegant, dignified apartment was held sacred for special occasions.</p>
            <p>The other front room, large and attractive, had massive oak cupboards built in on each side of the
                    marble-manteled fireplace. In one of these auntie kept the cookie jar, which was never empty and was
                    the most exciting feature of the whole house to us children. There was a lovely, old bureau, <list type="footnotes">

                    accompanying slop jar at the side. In the large front window, potted blooming geraniums occupied a
                    series of stands, like an audience at a ball game.</p>
            <p>Back of the room just described is the dining room with its mantel piece. All the rooms except two
                    small, upper bedrooms had fireplaces. In those days a house was valued by the number of chimneys it
                    had. The furnishings in the dining 'room consisted of a large sideboard with quaint, old silver and
                    dainty fragile china with gold bands. A step down, one entered the large, cozy kitchen with built-in
                    cupboards opposite the stove. We often ate informally at the table here, after my uncle's
                    death, of the delicious food—hams, chicken, pickles, preserves, jellies, biscuits,
                    salt-rising bread, etc., prepared by auntie and the faithful handmaids, a succession of Sallies.
                    Those were the days when a good hired girl stayed on for years in a substantial, prosperous family.</p>
            <p>In one corner of the latticed side porch, leading into the garden, stood a large earthen ice cold
                    water jar, carefully swathed. There was a picturesque old well, now robbed of its sweep and
                    windlass, which we children loved to operate. "The Old Oaken Bucket" might have
                    been inspired by it. Old-fashioned flowers flourish in the large ga'rdens, wide fern beds
                    border the house, and rock roses used to peep between the rocks that formed the walk to the bam.
                    Gooseberries and currants offered refreshment on the way, and we were always ready to take a chance
                    on the persimmons, although the unpredictable fruit frequently left our mouth all a pucker.</p>
            <p>There are four bedrooms, two narrow crisscrossing halls upstairs with queer, little closets under the
                    roof. The two front bedrooms are dignified in size and content, with lovely, antique
                    furniture—old settees, four posters, wardrobes, etc. The other two bedrooms are smaller
                    and cozier with low ceilings and small-paned windows, casements swinging out doorlike.</p>
            <p>The stairway is narrow and crooked as a corkscrew, with the perilous, triangular steps of ye olden
                    time, as picturesque as an old fairy story book.</p>
            <p>There was a gentle restraint in the atmosphere of the place, that we did not race through the
                    dignified rooms as at my maternal grandmother's. We, however, always felt <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-043-2-096"/> welcome, but put on our best behavior and never found the cookie jar
                    empty.</p>
            <p>Uncle Bob was the oldest of the family and my father the youngest. There was so much difference in
                    their ages, that Uncle Bob was generally thought of as my grandfather. He was plump and short of
                    leg, addicted to a corncob pipe and high silk hat, then popularly called a "stove
                    pipe" or "plug" hat. He had made his "pile" farming and
                    flatboating, and at one time or another had done some work as clerk in the offices of the county
                    treasurer and recorder, but from my earliest recollections, he was retired and jokingly referred to
                    himself as "the most retired man" in the community. He was one of the founders of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> Deposit Bank and its first president. His picture hangs there today. He was regarded as
                    one of the most solid financial citizens of the community. He loved to play the violin and spin
                    yarns and make jokes and spent much time chatting with his pals, the courthouse officials. He was a
                    picturesque pioneer figure.</p>
            <p>Uncle Bob's wife, Louisa Kern, was a member of a well-known family of the early times. There
                    is a legend that one of her ancestors lived in a hallow sycamore tree until he could get his cabin
                    built. This always appealed to me as fearless and heroic endurance. Aunt Louisa was tall and spare,
                    moving about on slender-slippered feet with a graceful, springing step, greatly belying her age. The
                    fact that she clung to a modified hoopskirt long after dame fashion had consigned such style to the
                    discard may have accounted for some measure for her billowy movements. I never saw her without the
                    be-ribboned lace cap that all elderly ladies wore then. Scott's lines in "Lady of
                    the Lake" describe her—"The mistress of the mansion came,
                    Matu're of age, a graceful dame." She looked well to the ways of her household,
                    seldom moving beyond its precincts, except to attend her church or to visit the sick. Kindly,
                    hospitable, great-souled, she often seasoned her remarks with quaint, quiet humor. Although she
                    lived to be almost eighty-nine, she never seemed to be old. She survived Uncle Bob some years and
                    was ready to accept the innovations he with pioneer snobbery had frowned upon. She installed
                    furnace, bath, and electric lights and was not above 'riding occasionally in her son's
                    auto, the first in the town. A remarkable woman, she kept a perennial interest in life, but when she
                    found it time to lay it down she did so with no regrets <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-043-2-097"/> saying
                    she had lived so long on earth, she was eager to see what the next life was like and regarded dying
                    as the great adventure. It seemed fitting, therefore, that during her funeral rites, her pet canary
                    should break forth in an exhileration of rejoicing as of a soul's release from its narrow
                    bounds into infinite freedom.</p>
            <p>Around the hospitable board of this delightful old homestead many distinguished guests were
                    entertained. Among others in the time of grandfather were Governors Robert P. Letcher and Thomas
                    Metcalfe of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, Governor William Bebb of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and Governor George Poindexter of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, grandfather's uncle. Uncle Bob continued to dispense the hospitality for
                    which the place was known. Governor William Hendricks and Lieutenant-Governor Ira P. Chase of
                    Indiana were also among his guests—a record of governors as guests for one village home.
                    Ole Bull, the famous Norwegian violinist, marooned in <placeName>

            <p>Edward Eggleston says in his "Recollections of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>," that he remembers when Governors Metcalfe and Poindexter spoke from a
                    platform at the top of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> mill in 1844. This old mill was afterwards moved to the rear of the yard where it now
                    stands.</p>
            <p>The gracious, old homestead still holds up its chin, as it we're, and retains much of its
                    original charm under the loving care of the Misses Lamson, whose kind hospitality and tasteful
                    arrangement of antiques and flowers carry on the traditions of the place.</p>
