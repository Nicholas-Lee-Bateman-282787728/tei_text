            <p>Frontier Indiana was a patchwork of competing religious views and interests. The Great <placeName>

                    </placeName> Revival at Cane Ridge in 1801 had set the dominant spiritual mood for evangelical
                    Protestants, and in the years following Cane Ridge the fires of revival had swept across the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. In the Hoosier state, as in the rest of the Midwest, the
                    result was a tremendous increase in adherents to such sects as the Methodists and Baptists who were
                    ready and able to serve up religion warm, if not hot.</p>
            <p>An important part of the story of the growth of evangelical Protestantism in the <geogName>Ohio
                        Valley</geogName> was the rise of the Disciples movement, popularly known as the
                    "Restoration" because of its emphasis on restoring simple or
                    "primitive" New Testament Christianity as the norm for faith and practice. The
                    Disciples are usually said to have been inspired by Alexander <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a Presbyterian turned Baptist reformer, and Barton W. Stone, a veteran of Cane Ridge.
                    Working independently before 1832 and cooperatively thereafter, these two pioneer ministers led a
                    reform crusade which resulted in the formation of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) by
                    about 1840. In Indiana, however, Restoration activities previous to the mid-1830s were indigenous
                    and largely independent of Stone and <placeName>

            <p>Although historians of the Disciples of Christ have long recognized the significant contributions of
                    the German Baptist Brethren, or Dunkers, to Restoration reforms in southern Indiana, their accounts
                    have usually been vague as to the congregations involved, their location, origin, and leadership.

                    of their congregations merged into the Restoration movement, have not clarified this picture.
                    However, a comparison of Disciples source materials with those of the Brethren reveals an explicit
                    relationship between the two groups.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> And an understanding of the tradition and
                    religious views of the German Baptist Brethren helps to place their involvement with the Disciples
                    in its proper perspective.</p>
            <p>The German Baptists of the early nineteenth century were a closed, noncreedal, pietist, and
                    anabaptist sect of European origin. Refugees of this group arrived in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> as early as 1719. Like their Mennonite neighbors, with whom they were often confused,
                    the Brethren grew and prospered in America. At least thirty congregation-communities were
                    established before the Revolution, primarily in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>
               </placeName>, and
                    the Carolinas.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Brethren were distinguished from other religious groups by several important characteristics,
                    perhaps the most significant of which was their form of baptism. The Brethren insisted on trine
                    (i.e., thrice repeated) immersion, with face forward, in flowing water. It was from this practice
                    that the popular designation Dunker, or Dunkard, was derived. Most Baptist groups, by contrast,
                    immersed once, face backwards.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Another unique practice of the Brethren was
                    their observance of love feast. This church ordinance was patterned after the last meal which Jesus
                    ate with his disciples in the upper room in Jerusalem (John 13). It consisted of the washing of
                    feet, a <list type="footnotes">

                            beginnings in Indiana was H. Clay Trusty, "Formation of the Christian Church in

                            treated the role of the Brethren in somewhat more detail. The standard treatment of the

                            herein discussed or the Brethren relationship to the Disciples movement. Roger Sappington,

                    bread and wine. Love feast was held over a weekend, usually once or twice a year, and was one of the
                    most important gatherings of the church.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several other characteristics made the Brethren a distinct people. They practiced nonresistance
                    (defenseless pacifism) with regard to the state and civil authority. They developed an Annual
                    Meeting, composed of representatives from each congregation, to decide matters of polity and
                    doctrine. Like the Quakers and Mennonites, the Brethren also wore plain dress, which included
                    bonnets and prayer coverings for the sisters and beards and broad-brimmed hats for the men. In
                    addition, most Brethren in the early nineteenth century remained German in culture and preferred
                    sectarian isolation to integration with the mainstream of American society.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As was the case with many religious groups, Brethren were quick to move west with the frontier
                    following the American Revolution. Dunker families had crossed the <geogName>Allegheny

                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                    </placeName> had organized congregations by 1802, Indiana by 1809, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> by 1815. Certain areas of southwest <placeName>

                    </placeName> and north central Indiana became centers of Brethren activity in the mid-and
                    late-nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> As many as fifteen Dunker congregations across the
                        <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName> may have joined the Restoration movement, and it is likely that
                    most of these churches were located in southern Indiana.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

                    Foutz and Hon families were also associated with the Bethel congregation. In addition to Olive
                    Branch, Lost River, <geogName>White River</geogName>, and Bethel, there were also Brethren
                    settlements of southern background in Jackson, <placeName>

            <p>The merger of the Brethren from southern Indiana with the Disciples movement was a gradual process
                    which took place in two stages. The first of these was the formation of an association of
                    congregations independent of the Annual Meeting. The second was contact between leaders of the
                    association and those of the emerging Restoration movement.</p>
            <p>Although all Brethren were supposedly unified by the Annual Meeting, close family ties, and traveling
                    senior ministers called elders, the congregations in southern Indiana, because of their location and
                    southern background, lacked adequate communication with other frontier Dunker congregations or the
                    Annual Meeting. One Restoration source suggests that about 1820 the Brethren in southern Indiana
                    formed themselves into an "Association" independent of the Annual Meeting because
                    they were "unwilling to conform to all the rules observed by the brethren in

                    </placeName>, he settled in <placeName>

               </placeName>, in 1794 with his parents and other
                    married brothers and sisters. At that time he and his father, Christian Hostetler (Hochstetler),
                    were already ministers in the Dunker faith, the father preaching in German and the son in English.
                    In 1825, after an extensive itinerant ministry among Brethren settlements in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana. He died there in 1826.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For reasons which are not known, Adam Hostetler and Peter Hon, a young minister from Nicholas County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, began to spread "strange doctrine" which was not in keeping with
                    Brethren tradition. While existing Brethren records are vague, it is evident that Hostetler and Hon
                    were expelled from the church sometime between 1816 and 1820. One source suggests that at least two
                    church councils were held on the Hostetler-Hon controversy. The first met in 1820 in Muhlenberg
                    County, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

               </placeName>. Brethren leaders from the eastern church attended both meetings.
                    Hostetler and his followers faced several charges, including one which stated that they had become
                    "too zealous in religious excitements," which more than likely suggests the
                    sympathy of western Brethren for frontier revivalism.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> Other issues included
                    both Hostetler's and Hon's failure to conform to the standards of the Annual
                    Meeting regarding plain dress, their acceptance of slave ownership among Brethren, and their use of
                    an innovative and unacceptable procedure for feet washing during the love feast.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>Universalism, however, was probably not a significant factor in the formation of the independent
                    Brethren Association in Indiana. Of the churches in this group, only Olive Branch seems to have had
                    connections with universalists and may have embraced universalist doctrine. The Stutzman family had

                    Association itself was embroiled in a controversy over the form or mode of baptism. Peter Hon and
                    Abraham Kern of the <geogName>White River</geogName> church began to advocate and employ a single

            <p>Interestingly enough, the Brethren Annual Meeting of 1821, which assembled in <placeName>

               </placeName>, addressed itself to the single immersion problem. The existing

                    out of the unrest in southern Indiana and <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Article six of the minutes questioned "Whether members (persons) might be
                    received into the church who have been but once immersed (without rebaptizing them in the manner we
                    believe it ought to be done according to the gospel)?"<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The answer of
                    the meeting is surprising, perhaps, in that it indicated flexibility on the part of the eastern
                    leadership. After affirming that trine immersion was the true baptism, the Brethern decided that
                    "if such persons would be content with their baptism and yet acknowledge the
                    Brethren's order as right, we would leave it over to them and receive them with the laying
                    on of hands and prayer."<hi rend="sup">21</hi> This answer does not suggest that ministers
                    were permitted to employ a single-action immersion. It may have been, however, a gesture of
                    reconciliation to the western Bethren. Those baptized by Hon and Kern could remain in full
                    fellowship with the brotherhood if the traditional practice was affirmed as correct. If the decision
                    of the Annual Meeting was indeed such a gesture, it met with no known reply. So powerful was the
                    move toward single immersion within the western Association that by 1826 its advocates completely
                    dominated the independent group.</p>

                    </placeName> on several points of doctrine. Why, for example, did not he, as an advocate of
                    primitive Christianity, practice feetwashing and the holy kiss of charity or observe communion at
                    night, following the apostolic (and Brethren) practice? Reflecting the debate within the
                    Association, Hostetler also asked for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s opinion on trine immersion baptism. "I yet think it [trine
                    immersion] is the proper action of baptism, and think that it should not be performed transversely,

                    basic point was that many Brethren practices, such as the holy kiss and feetwashing, were social
                    customs of the apostolic church and not rituals required for discipleship. He also expressed his
                    preference for single immersion since baptism in the New Testament is spoken of as one act.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

                    of his fellow Dunker ministers, gathered for the address. For an hour and a half the boy preacher
                    spoke on the theme that "the disciples were called Christian first at An-tioch."
                    In doing so he squarely placed himself in sympathy with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s emerging Restoration movement. So powerful was his preaching that the
                    audience was moved against the use of denominational names. Some of the Brethren ministers, however,
                    were not so easily convinced. Hostetler was informed that he would face stern charges at the next
                    yearly meeting of the Association. Not wanting to leave the decision of that body to chance, he
                    undertook a personal visit to each member congregation explaining his position.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Evidence suggests that the Association meeting of 1826 took place in August at the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The irony of the occasion must have been apparent to some. An independent Brethren
                    association, formed after the expulsion of Adam Hostetler from the Annual Meeting church for holding
                    non-Brethren views, now listened to his nephew explain why a Brethren identity should be altogether
                    terminated. Young Joseph Hostetler so completely vindicated himself of all charges that he was asked
                    to deliver the main address at the next annual gathering of the Association. He reportedly thought
                    to himself: "This day death passed upon this ecclesiastical body. About this time next year
                    it will breathe its last; and my discourse shall be its funeral."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>It was apparently at the yearly Association meeting of 1827 that John Wright and his brother, Peter,
                    of the <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Baptists came to the Brethren with their plea of unity.
                    Joseph Hostetler no doubt delivered his "funeral discourse." Adam Hostetler, who
                    had been the strongest Brethren preacher of the previous generation and who might conceivably have
                    been in a position to influence the Brethren away from reforms inspired by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had died the previous September. The Dunkers and the Baptists agreed to form one
                    fraternal organization and to call themselves "Christians." John Wright then
                    proposed that the new coalition consider merger with the New <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Frontier New Light Christian churches are difficult to define precisely. One such group, based in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and led by Barton W. Stone, emerged out of the Great <placeName>

                    </placeName> Revival. Other unrelated and independent "old Christian" movements,
                    primarily Methodist and Baptist in background, were active in New <placeName>

                    </placeName> before the turn of the century. The earliest New Light congregations in Indiana were of
                    the "old Christian" connection rather than from the Stone group. It is likely that
                    John Wright wrote to the "Eastern Conference of the Christian Church in Indiana,"
                    an organization formed in 1827 primarily of "old Christian" congregations.
                    Beverley Vawter was the clerk of this conference.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The traditional interpretation of John and Peter Wright's merger efforts has been that a
                    unity conference of Baptists, Dunkers, and New Lights was arranged for July, 1828. Representatives
                    met on a farm just south of Edinburgh in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. No detailed minutes or records of this meeting were kept, of course, for fear
                    of setting up new denominational rules and creeds. Joseph Hostetler, John Wright, and Beverley
                    Vawter, each representing their religious traditions, agreed to drop denominational names and creeds
                    and to work cooperatively in a loose organization called the "Southern

                            themselves the "church of Christ." I judge there are six to eight elders
                            among them, and many churches. When we met in conference together, we could find nothing to
                            separate us asunder. In fine, we saw as nearly eye to eye as any company of Elders who have
                            assembled in modern times—and there was such a sweet spirit of love.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The correspondence of Hughs and Hatchitt does not suggest that a formal merger of any kind took
                    place. Indeed, Brethren participation in this meeting is doubtful. The number of elders listed as
                    being in the "church of Christ" more clearly reflects John Wright's group
                    of Baptists alone than it does a combined Dunker-Baptist organization. Still, it is evident that the
                    Wrights were in full cooperation with the New Light body. They were asked to bear a letter of
                    greeting to another New Light Christian conference in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>, and John Wright was also chosen a member of a "presbytery"

            <p>The mystery of who merged with whom remains. It is clear that after 1827 the Brethren Association
                    ceased to function as a separate group and that its leaders became public advocates of the
                    Restoration movement. Joseph Hostetler and Peter Hon traveled widely in 1829 and 1830 among Brethren

                    </placeName>, Indiana, where he was baptized in 1808. In 1810 he relocated on the <geogName>Blue

                        <region type="county">Washington County</region>

                    Peter; and other brothers as well. John, Amos, and Peter are credited with forming the
                        <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Baptist Church in 1811. They all eventually became preachers.
                    John Wright continued to reside in this general area until his death but spent his last eight years
                    in an extensive itinerant ministry.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>The <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Baptist Church and others organized by the Wrights in a

                    "free will" or "dependent" Baptists. Presumedly this meant that
                    like the Brethren, and in contrast to most American Baptist groups that developed out of the
                    Calvinist tradition, the Wrights emphasized man's "free choice" in
                    securing salvation. Also like the Brethren, their churches were non-creedal and organized on the
                    principle of the Bible alone as sufficient guide for faith and practice. Accordingly, they did not
                    identify with the more numerous "general" Baptists. Indeed, the closest and
                    earliest association of the Wrights in Indiana was with the Brethren.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    into the Sears family, which was also Brethren. While Restoration sources do not describe John
                    Wright as a Dunker, there is at least one local tradition from Olive Branch which so remembers

                                    the <geogName>Blue River</geogName> Baptists were much concerned about orthodox
                                    theological positions. As biblical literalists they were more interested in

                            trine baptism, or dipping three times, which according to their discipline was a necessary
                            part of their religion. Feet-washing, too, was discarded by Rev. Mr. Hughes and between them
                            both a satisfactory settlement of conflicting views was made.<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>This passage identifying John Wright with the Dunkers, however, raises more problems than can be
                    resolved. Wright's merger proposal to the Hostetler Brethren supposedly came after they had
                    agreed to adopt the single immersion mode of baptism. According to the above account, Wright himself
                    practiced trine immersion. The passage also indicates that Hughes compromised on feet washing, a
                    practice central to the Brethren but unknown in New Light circles. If Wright were indeed a Dunker,
                    he rather than Hughes should have yielded on this point. And it is known that Wright, who regularly
                    conducted services at Olive Branch in the 1840s, practiced feet washing in his later ministry.<hi rend="sup">42</hi> Whatever Wright's religious background—Dunker,
                    independent free will Baptist, or some combination of the two—his relationship to the

            <p>At about the same time that the western Association Brethren were merging into the Restoration, the
                    Brethren of the Annual Meeting shut the door on single immersion. In 1827 the issue of the proper
                    mode of baptism was raised, but the Meeting reaffirmed its decision of 1821. The following year the
                    matter was again introduced. This time the Meeting counseled that candidates from other churches
                    ought to be baptized again in the "true manner." Between 1832 and 1834 several new
                    queries were introducted on the subject, but the language of the Meeting became more and more
                    uncompromising. Trine immersion became again the only form of baptism which the Brethren
                        recognized.<hi rend="sup">46</hi>

                    </placeName> Restoration after 1827, the change from Dunker to Disciple was apparently gradual.
                    Evidence suggests that Abraham Kern's congregation may not have fully embraced the movement
                    until 1832; Olive Branch not until 1839.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> Joseph Hostetler wrote that his
                    father, a deacon in the Dunker faith from 1796, did not support the Restoration until 1831. Other
                    members may have retained a Brethren identity much longer.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> It is also true
                    that while the Brethren gave up some unique practices and customs, they retained others. Feet
                    washing, for example, was practiced by John Wright, Peter Hon, and Joseph Hostetler until the close
                    of their active ministry. Hostetler vigorously defended this service as a church ordinance in print
                    as late as 1847.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

                    the Dunkers of Hostetler's Association ripe for a redefinition of their religious identity
                    along Restoration lines. In 1820 it must have appeared to Adam Hostetler, Joseph Hostetler, Abraham
                    Kern, and Peter Hon that the eastern Brethren were becoming more sectarian in terms of church
                    government, distinctive dress, continued use of the German language, and integration into American
                    culture and values—all in an age when unity and cooperation among frontier Christians
                    were being stressed. The Brethren in southern Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> clearly wanted to practice their faith without the restrictions of the eastern church
                    and the Annual Meeting. They favored an independent frontier spirit, and their Association was an
                    attempt to capture that spirit. Once they abandoned trine immersion baptism, however, there was
                    little which separated them from other frontier Baptist groups.</p>

            <p>Hoosiers were stout defenders of the Union in the Civil War, and one who came forward willingly to
                    serve and die was George W. Lennard. When the Thirty-sixth Indiana Volunteer Infantry regiment was
                    organized in September, 1861, Lennard joined Edited by Paul Hubbard its ranks as a private soldier
                    but was immediately elected lieutenant and named as adjutant. His duty with the Thirty-sixth was
                    short-lived, however, because within weeks he was made a captain and assigned as aide-de-camp to
                    Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood, who in the <placeName>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Shortly before the battle of Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, December 31,
                    1862-January 2, 1863, Lennard was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the Fifty-seventh Indiana
                    Volunteer Infantry, and at that battle he was wounded while fighting with his regiment. After
                    convalescing in the spring of 1863, he rejoined his unit for the campaign against <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> under Major General William S. Rosecrans. When the Federal forces occupied that city in
                    September, 1863, Lennard was detailed as provost marshal, and he had no part in the Battle of
                    Chickamauga. The Fifty-seventh Indiana, however, did participate in the storming of Missionary Ridge
                    in November, and Lennard escaped unscathed in that dramatic assault. In the spring of 1864 fortune
                    deserted him, and as the Army of the Cumberland marched toward <placeName>

                    in his absence. In a letter written from near Iuka, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, on June 10, 1862, Lennard remembers: "Ten years ago today we were united in
                    the holy bonds of matrimony, and our destinies became one. From that day to the present hour my love
                    for you has quietly flowed on widening and deepening in its course." Indeed, the subject of
                    love appears frequently in the correspondence. Lennard's letter of May 28, 1863, written
                    from Murfreesboro, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, comments on "the deep, constant and ardent love" he has for his
                    wife. He confesses: "There was a kind of sacred holyness about it which never warmed my
                    heart before." The product of a society perhaps less openly articulate about such a topic,
                    Lennard ponders somewhat the propriety of his statements. He concludes: "But why should I
                    feel ashamed of my feelings for you?"<hi rend="sup">4</hi> His letters are thus in part
                    love letters.</p>
            <p>A strong patriotism also shows through Lennard's writings. Dedicated thoroughly to the Union
                    cause, he was in the service until victory or death. In February, 1864, he elected to stay with his
                    regiment as it reenlisted, saying, "I wont back out when the work is half done."
                    He knew his wife would scold him for signing up for three more years, but he wrote: "To
                    tell you the candid, honest truth I dont think I would be contented at home while the war is going
                    on. I am solomly impressed that it is my duty to help put this rebelion down."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lennard was an ambitious man who very much wanted to get ahead in the army and be well regarded by
                    his superiors. Repeatedly he discusses his hope to become a full colonel, but although he did
                    command his regiment, he never rose above lieutenant colonel. Ruefully he wrote Clarinda from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>
                    </placeName> on October 18, 1863: "I guess I am about as high up in the military world as I
                    will ever get. I have only got about 440 men present and absent, and a regiment to be entitled to a
                    Colonel under the late order from the war-department must have over 800 of an agregate."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lennard must have been a good officer, however, because his compassion for the suffering men in the
                    ranks, the bewildered blacks, and the civilian victims of the war is frequently evident. As the Army

                    the army often came under Lennard's criticism. He told his wife that he believed every
                    officer from highest to lowest should be examined for competence and those found wanting, whether or
                    not they had "political influence or wealthy and influential friends," should be
                    dismissed from the service. "To many of our officers are inferior men, inferior to the

                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, Lennard encountered many black people. His comments show sympathy for their confusion
                    and fear, but he also registers the common white belief in black inferiority. His black servant,
                    Dick, and his horse, John, are placed in the same category when in one sentence both are said to be
                        well.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Referring to Dick on another occasion, Lennard said: "He is
                    like most negros—to get much out of him you have to watch him." In the same
                    letter Lennard wished he could send a Negro home, "but I think you would find one more
                    trouble than value."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the conflict ground on, Lennard's letters frequently revealed his concern for the evil
                    and futility of war. "What creatures we are. If the enemy runs we are mad, if he stands and
                    whips us we are mad, and if we whip him and dont kill every rebel and take every thing they have the
                    people at home are mad, and so it goes."<hi rend="sup">11</hi> While in a poor, backwoods
                    area of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, Lennard lamented the effects that army foraging, "which means to go out and
                    take every thing the citizens have to eat," had on the local population. "I do
                    wish this horid war was over. I am willing to meet the armed rebels, but when it comes to the old
                    men, women and children crying and whining around me it is more than I can stand."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Except for Lennard's urging his wife to be sure to give the children a good Christian
                    upbringing, the subject of religion does not come up very often in the letters. On the evening of
                    December 31, 1863, however, as the army lay at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Lennard expressed a concern that must trouble thoughtful men in any war. He fervently
                    wished he had that "jewel of great price—a clear and well defined hope that all
                    would be well with me in the world to come." <list type="footnotes">

                    death. "You will say, why dont you be a Christian? I say, how can a soldier be a
                    Christian?" He continued: "Read all Christs teaching, and then tell me whether <hi rend="i">one engaged in maiming</hi> and <hi rend="i">butchering men</hi>—men made in

                    my mind on this subject and you will do me a world of good." On the whole, however, Lennard

                    the field.</p>

                    whose love of wife, children, and hearth would have to be secondary as long as the Union was
                    endangered by what he considered to be treason. Too, they bring out in intimate detail the problems

                                            Lennard letters have been followed as closely as possible in this
                                            transcription. Spacing of headings, salutations, and closings has been
                                            standardized, but the punctuation originally used in these portions of the
                                            letters has been retained. It was frequently impossible to determine whether
                                            Lennard meant to use capitals or lower case letters, to begin new
                                            paragraphs, or to write certain words as two words or one; e.g., today or to
                                            day. In such instances the editors have attempted to conform to
                                            Lennard's intent or, when a decision could not be reached, have
                                            followed modern practice. Run-on sentences have been broken up by spacing so
                                            that the letters may be more easily read and understood; unintentional
                                            repetitions have been omitted; and incorrect spellings have been retained
                                            and have not been indicated by a [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] or a correction
                                            except for a few missing letters which have been bracketed in to clarify
                                            meaning. A bracketed question mark appears after a few words that the
                                            editors were unable to decipher satisfactorily. Lennard consistently used
                                            periods rather than commas in dates and in four digit numbers; e.g., 4.560
                                            or April 7. 1862. This practice has been maintained.</item>

                        <p>We are begining to get into some kind of shape, altho our baggage has not come up
                                    yet. All we have to eat is Hard crackers and pork with a little weak coffee. We use
                                    the crackers for plates and our fingers for forks. We have one tin plate in the mess
                                    which we put the meet on. Lewis, our cook, found an old Dutch oven which he uses to
                                    fry the meet in, and a camp kettle to make the coffee in. We have plenty such as it
                                    is, and a good appetite makes us relish it, or at least I do for I am kept very
                                    buissy and have but little time to think about what we have to eat. Schlater<hi rend="sup">23</hi> and some of the other boys have been sick and the General has
                                    complained some</p>
                        <p>I got on the battle field about twelve o'clock on Monday<hi rend="sup">24</hi> and remained in untill four in the evening when the rebals gave way. I have
                                    herd much of battle fields and read much of them, but I had no conception of what it
                                    was. The hotest time here was about one or two oclock on Monday. The roar of both
                                    cannon and musketry was terable and unseasing. The fight was mostly in the woods,
                                    and the twigs and limbs and splinters were flying in every directions. Every way you
                                    looked were dead men. The most horid sight I saw was where five poor [?] secesh were
                                    laying hudeled up to gether, their bodies mangled by a cannon ball. On one spot
                                    where the fight had been desperate I am confident there were fifty dead and wounded
                                    men on a spot of ground not larger than our door [?] yard. At a hospital about a
                                    mile from our cam[p] there were 114 dead secesh laid out that they could not take
                                    away or bury. But it is useless to particularise, for look in what way you would for
                                    miles and dead men greeted your eyes. How could it have been otherwise after two
                                    days hard fighting where not less than 50.000 men were engaged on a side in such a
                                    deadly conflict.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our loss in killed will not be far from 1.000 and in wounded about 3. to 4.000. I
                                    think we lost about 3.000 prisners. The rebals had not less than 2.500 and God only
                                    knows how many wounded. I dont know how many prisners we took, but probally about

                                    Gen'l Grant is terable for allowing himself to be surprised. If

                                            carelessly unprepared for the Confederate attack on April 6.
                                            Grant's account in the same work, 465, 466, indicates that he felt
                                            the battle was "more persistently misunderstood, than any other
                                            engagement between National and Confederate troops during the entire
                                            rebellion." Grant claimed that he was shunned by Halleck after the
                                            battle and was not allowed to see Buell's report until it was

                                            Brigadier General Beauregard, and the term "Bull Run" came
                                            to connote the Union humiliation in that first large battle of the Civil

                        <salute>Dear Clara</salute>
                        <p>As you will see from this we are still on the bloody field <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Shiloh</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I have been in the saddle nearly all day with
                                    Gen'l's Buell and Wood examining the country around here and
                                    looking up suitable ground to camp on. The country is very rough, and as we have to
                                    preserve an unbroken front to the enemy, it is difficult to place so large an army
                                    as we have here now. We had a very hard rain here this evening, most of which I was
                                    out in, but I care nothing for myself if the poor soldiers could be comfortable, for
                                    I have a change of clothing and somebody to wate on me and do my cooking, which many
                                    of them have not.</p>
                        <p>On yesterday when I wrote you I was quite unwell, but am very well this evening. I
                                    think the water and filth of this camp has caused much sickness which I hope will be
                                    remadied by the time this reaches you by a forward movement, when I think you will
                                    hear some startling news from these parts. Gen'l Hal-lack<hi rend="sup">36</hi> is here himself which is a suficent guarantee that there is something to be
                                    done big with importance to the nation and the sooner the better is my belief</p>
                        <p>The enemy is still in heavy force about six miles in our front, but there is no
                                    skirmishing as nether party seem disposed to wast their powder in a small way.</p>
                        <p>I have received nothing from you since yours of the 6th inst. but am anxiously
                                    looking and hoping. You must not fail to write at least twice a week whether you
                                    receive anything from me or not, as at is frequently so that I cant write to you for
                                    a week or two.</p>
                        <p>It is growing very late and so I must close with an earnest prare for the health and
                                    hapiness of you and our dear little ones</p>

                        <salute>Dear Clara</salute>
                        <p>We have had two days of gloomy wet weather, and to night it is still raining with
                                    little prospect of clearing up. I have been around among the troops of our Division
                                    to day and find them in rather a sory condition. We moved our camp on Friday evening
                                    and before the tents were pitched the rain came on and wet the ground. It appears to
                                    me I never saw so much wet weather as we have had this spring.</p>
                        <p>Gen'l Wood and Capt Schlater have been unwell for some days, The
                                    Gen'l is geting better, however. My health is good altho I have been
                                    exposed a good deal of late. I think temperate habits have kept me up.</p>
                        <p>I was over at the 36th to day a little while. Col Grose<hi rend="sup">37</hi> is
                                    complaining some. I did not see Pite, as he was out with the regiment on
                                    "Picket Duty". He was complaining some when I saw him last, but he
                                    is better now. The regiment will be paid now in a day or two. I am glad of it for
                                    they have wated a long time.</p>
                        <p>I wrote to Mother yesterday and told her if she needed the interest now due before I
                                    got the money to send her to call on you. If she calls on you try and pay her, as I
                                    suppose she will not call on you unless she needs it badly. I have not received my
                                    clothing yet, but in all probability will soon</p>

                        <p>Meny of the officers are very sick of soldering and talk of resigning. As for my part
                                    I enlisted for the war, and expect to stick it out let come what will. I think if
                                    the poor soldiers can stand it I can, and I will not desert them in this hour of
                                    trial.</p>
                        <p>I dont think after this terable rain storm we can move from here as soon as I told

                        <salute>Dear Clara</salute>
                        <p>A clear and beautiful sun rose this morning after three days of cloud and rain and
                                    mud and gloom. The birds in the green trees welcomed the bright morning with song
                                    and melody. Once more the poor soldiers begin to move about with life and animation.
                                    Such is the influence of pleasent weather on every thing around us.</p>
                        <p>An occasional gun is herd to crack and reverberate through the woods, keeping the
                                    camp nervous and anxious, as the enemy is but a few miles to our front and we dont
                                    know what break he may take, or what hour he may come, but come when he will he will
                                    have a warmer reception than he did on that lovely Sabbath morning he came here
                                    before.</p>
                        <p>The terrable rains we have had here will delay our movements for some days as the
                                    roads are at this time impassable for Artillery, and without that arm of the service
                                    I dont think we would be safe in attacking the rebs We are looking for

                        <p>Sabbath as it is I have been busy all day posting and visiting the Pickets in front
                                    of our Division. We hardly know when Sunday comes in the army. We have to keep our
                                    lamps well trimed and filled with oil for we know not what hour the bridegroom may
                                    come. Every thing has been quiet in front for several days, but the storm may burst
                                    upon us at any hour. Our most advanced camps are about five miles from the Landing.</p>
                        <p>I was down at Savanah a few days ago to see if my clothing had come, but could hear
                                    nothing of them. I suppose they will <list type="footnotes">

                        <p>I have not herd from you since yours of the 6th inst. The mails are very iregular
                                    here. I herd to day that Pite was not well. Rheumatism is said to be his complaint,
                                    with, probally, a little homesickness. Quite a number of our officers &amp;
                                    soldiers are complaining or sick. I think however, as soon as we get on the move
                                    agane the health of the entire army will improve.</p>

                                    cannot enjoy the same heavenly blessing.</p>

                                        Gohene," aged thirty-three as a member of the Lennard household. She
                                        was probably a hired woman. In his letter of December 2, 1861, Lennard wrote:
                                        "if Arabell is gone away to stay any time you should get some other
                                        good girl to stay with you." Years later an Arabella Goheen carried on
                                        correspondence with Asahel Lennard and seemed to be somewhat dependent on him.
                                        Some of these letters written in the 1890s are in the possession of the editors.

                        <p>We are encamped nine miles from Corrinth in a beautiful grove close by a primitive
                                    church called Olivi.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> We are ordered to have three days of
                                    cooked rations prepared for the men to night, with the intimation, Sunday as it is
                                    to-morrow, that we will move on Corrinth Gen'l Pope had a sharp little
                                    encounter with the enemy this evening which lasted about one hour.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> I have not herd the result I dont think our folks want to bring on the
                                    battle tomorrow as it is Sunday, for there appears to be some dread of Sunday
                                    attacks</p>
                        <p>In case any thing should happen [to] me, that I dont get back to see you any more, my
                                    wish is that you educate the childern well—Let each of them be a graduate
                                    of some Litter-ary Institution for what little I have would not do them much good
                                    only in the way of educating them. Be very careful and strict with Gertie for she is
                                    inclined to be wild and headstrong. I dont think you will have much trouble with the
                                    boys. Collect up what is due me as fast as you can without distressing any one and
                                    pay off all the debts, and keep the balance on interest. I think after paying all
                                    indebtedness there will be about $2.500= left, which at 10 pr cent
                                    interest with the rent of the two farms will keep you nicely and educate the

                        <p>When I last wrote you two evenings ago I expected by this time to be in the full
                                    blaze of battle before the enemys works at Corrinth, but owing to the very heavy
                                    rains that have fallen rendering the roads impassable for Artillery, we have had to
                                    defer our advance. We had every thing packed up and some of the troops commenced
                                    moving, but they had to be called back, and we are now encamped on the same spot we
                                    were when I wrote you on the 3d inst.</p>
                        <p>I received your very welcom and very interesting letters of the 24th &amp; 27th,
                                    April, this evening You can scarcse imagin the pleasure it gave me to read the
                                    childerns expressions about Dick. I called "Dick" up and read it
                                    to him. It pleased the "nigger" hugely. He says he will sing Dixie
                                    for Henry and make all kinds of little "triggers" for Sailie, and
                                    then do what ever Gertie wishes him to. So if "Dick" and I get
                                    home safe you may expect some fun.</p>
                        <p>Sam is down at Savanah I learn he is drinking some all the time. He is in the employ
                                    of Capt Cannon at what wages I am unable to say. The enclosed letter fell into my
                                    hands accidentally and I send it to you, but you must keep it a profound secret. Col
                                    Grose and I are on the best of terms and I hope we may ever remain so. I only showed
                                    Simon that portion of your letter where you said Col Grose had spoken lightly of
                                    Gen'l Wood, and wondered what he could mean by it, as the Gen'l

                                    in command of a brigade<hi rend="sup">48</hi> and Gen'l Nelson speaks
                                    highly of him. I hope he may succeed well.</p>
                        <p>I sent you $250—which I hope has reached you in safety ere
                                    this. We are going to have a big fight at Corrinth when it does come off. Both sides
                                    are staking every thing on it. But if we get fairly at them they must come down.</p>
                        <p>Give my love to our dear little ones and all others, and believe me, Dear wife, when
                                    I say I am as ever your loving</p>

                        <salute>Dear Clara:</salute>
                        <p>Here we are within six miles of Corinth and no blood shed yet, and the worst of it is
                                    we don't know whether the enemy is there or not. Our folks are closing up
                                    on them with great care. I hardly think there will be another surprise in our army.
                                    But if they have left Corinth we will know it tomorrow. And if they have not we will
                                    be fighting in good earnest by the 10th inst., and you will probally know the result
                                    before this reaches you, and anyhow, this will be the last you will hear from me
                                    untill the thing is settled on[e] way or the other.</p>
                        <p>I received the <hi rend="i">Courier</hi> you sent me this evening, and read it
                                    through advertisements and all. I noticed particularly the marrage of Joshua
                                    Williams which was news to me. I hope Joshua had a good time of it.</p>
                        <p>I saw Pite yesterday. His health is improving. The whole regiment is in a better
                                    condition than it was. The Col is a brigade commander and he feels the better of it</p>
                        <p>We are in just such a state of suspense at this time as to whether Corinth is
                                    evacuated or not that I scarsely know what, or how to write.</p>
                        <p>Dick and the John horse are well, and I never enjoyed better health in my life; so
                                    hoping you and the children are enjoying the same blessing, I am as ever your loving

                        <salute>Dear Wife</salute>
                        <p>Little did I expect when I wrote you one week a go that the great contest at Corinth
                                    would be undecided at this time, but here we are within a mile or two of the enemy
                                    and not as much prospect of an imediate atack now as there was then. The great snake
                                    is gradually coiling its self around Corinth. It is better to make a sure thing of
                                    whiping them bad and taking them here if it takes us a month longer than to be
                                    following them all over the South, unless the enemy atack us, this will reach you
                                    before the great battle.</p>
                        <p>Yours of the 4th inst. has just been received. I dont think there is any dainger of
                                    trouble between Col Grose and myself, or any one else about what I showed Powell.
                                    But be very careful what you write to me, for it is probable I will be showing it to
                                    Powell and the human family generally.</p>
                        <p>I will send Mother the money due her from here, as I have frequent oppertunities to
                                    send to <placeName>

                        <p>Another holy Sabath day has come and gone with its many trials and troubles. All day
                                    there has been more or less fireing among the Pickets and several skirmishes. We are
                                    liable to attack or be attacked at any moment. I am shure we cannot remain [in] this
                                    condition many days without hard fighting for we are only three miles from Corinth
                                    and about one mile from their entrenchments So, you see the ball must open in good
                                    earnest soon But what ever is to be our fate let it come. We are as well prepared
                                    now as we will ever be.</p>
                        <p>I saw Pite this morning and he informs me that he has a Furlough for thirty days but
                                    will not go home untill the battle is over. So he will probally be able to give you
                                    the first account of who is saved and who is lost</p>

                        <p>The agony and tension is over—Corinth is evacuated and we are all safe.
                                    The papers will doubtless have told you all about it before this reaches you, so I
                                    need say but little about it I think it was better for us for them to evacuate, and
                                    worse for them than tho we had had a hard battle and whiped them. It demoralises
                                    their army and causes the people of the South to loose confidence in their
                                        leaders.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

                        <p>Pite will go home in a day or two and I will send by him. I want a good many things
                                    which I will send by him for. I wish you would make a visit to Fathers and take all
                                    the childern along to see their Grand Pa before he dies, as I am confident he cannot
                                    live long. If you will write to Mother or Eliza they will meet you at the Lockland
                                    Depot, and then they will take you over to Uncle Johns and from their you can go to
                                    the City and stay as long as you wish. But do as you wish about going to the City
                                    but be sure and go with the little folks to see the old people, and pay mother the

                                        Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton on May 30, 1861, that the works at Corinth
                                        were "exceedingly strong" and described the enormous loss of
                                        materiel. "General Beauregard evidently distrusts his army, or he would
                                        have defended so strong a position. His troops are generally much discouraged
                                        and demoralized." <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, Vol. X, part 1,
                                        p. 773. Beauregard, on the other hand, in a report of June 13, considered the
                                        evacuation a triumph. With his vastly inferior army he could not expect to hold
                                        the city, and his masterful evacuation completely surprised the Union army.
                                        "I feel authorized to say by the evacuation the plan of campaign of the
                                        enemy was utterly foiled—his delay of seven weeks and vast
                                        expenditures were of little value, and he has reached Corinth to find it a
                                        barren locality, which he must abandon as wholly worthless for his
                                        purposes." <hi rend="i">Ibid.</hi>, 762, 763, 765. Beauregard also
                                        claimed that he was drawing the enemy deep into southern territory where a

            <p>On September 14, 1918, Judge David C. Westenhaver sentenced Eugene V. Debs to ten years in prison for
                    violation of the Espionage Act of 1917 in an antiwar speech made at Canton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, June 16, 1918. Prior to the sentencing the court clerk asked Debs if he would like to
                    make a final statement.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The resulting speech to the court was a masterpiece of
                    American oratory. Most well known is the concluding section in which Debs employed the metaphor of a
                    storm-tossed sailor to describe the people's struggle.</p>

            <p>Although the judge was not impressed, many of Debs' contemporaries were. Heywood Broun
                    described the speech as "one of the most beautiful and moving passages in the English
                    language. He [Debs] was for that one afternoon touched with inspiration. If anybody told me that
                    tongues of fire danced upon his shoulders as he spoke, I would believe it."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Ray Ginger also recognized the speech as a high point of Debs' career when he used
                    a key phrase, the bending cross, as the title of his biography of Debs.</p>
            <p>Debs' power as an orator and essayist was based on his capacity to translate socialist
                    ideology into American idioms. Native audiences responded to him emotionally, reacting as they might
                    to a preacher at a tent meeting. "Lover of Mankind," John Dos Passos called him in
                        <hi rend="i">The 42nd Parallel</hi>, a man who wanted "a world brothers might own,
                    where everybody split even."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Yet many of the images in Debs'
                    speeches were not original. The orator's talent lay, at least in part, in his capacity to
                    recognize the emotional potential of symbolism and allegory and history and religion as used by his
                    contemporaries. The sailor and his bending cross in the 1918 speech is an excellent example. The
                    metaphor was not Debs' creation. Early in his career Debs had been secretary treasurer of
                    the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and editor of their journal. It was at this
                    organization's 1890 convention that he possibly got the inspiration for his 1918 speech
                    from the concluding passage of a lengthy keynote address by the Honorable Tom Fitch.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>And shall not the toilers come to their own? Shall not crowns and castes be abased before them,

                        howling storm the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, waits for relief from his weary watch he
                        turns his eyes toward the Southern Cross burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean, and as

                    </placeName> he read law, was admitted to the bar, and in 1821 married Sarah Hill. Later that year
                    the Fletchers settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the future capital of Indiana. A civic-minded lawyer, landowner, and banker, Fletcher
                    was a leading citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> until his death in 1866.</p>
            <p>His diary is fragmentary for the early years, but from 1835 on it provides a systematic daily record
                    of the many and varied interests and activities of his large and prosperous family. During the four
                    years covered by this volume, Fletcher allegedly "was slowing down in all his activities
                    and taking more time to read, to contemplate, and to visit with friends and neighbors" (p.
                    ix). Nevertheless, this segment of the diary reveals a man who was still actively concerned about
                    the success and well-being of all eleven of his children, though only three of them were still at
                    home. During this period he also devoted considerable time and energy to liquidation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the State Bank of Indiana, of which he was president; the establishment of
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Branch Banking Company; and the acquisition of controlling interest in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> branch of the State Bank. He was a nonsectarian supporter of organized Christianity in
                    the city, and he led the way in raising money to keep the schools of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> open and free after the Indiana Supreme Court declared the school tax law
                    unconstitutional. Though not optimistic about the prospects for success, he continued to work with
                    the temperance movement, and he supported actively the <placeName>

            <p>Fletcher preserved a record of his life and work, his hopes and fears, and his successes and failures
                    in public and private relationships. The Indiana Historical Society has made that record available
                    to all and deserves the gratitude of everyone who reads it. Any person who is interested in life in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on the eve of the Civil War should consult Volume VI. The editors'
                    introduction, the chronology, the explanatory footnotes, and the forty-five-page index are most

            <p>The editors are to be commended for their careful treatment of a manuscript that is in part barely
                    legible and for their skillful handling of the entire editorial process. The standard of excellence
                    that was established by the first volume, published in 1972, and maintained through the next four
                    volumes has been upheld.</p>

            <p>Born in 1821 and raised just north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Oliver Johnson grew up with Indiana. He lived until 1907, long enough to regale his
                    grandchildren with stories of his boyhood days. One grandson, Howard Johnson, soaked up these
                    reminiscences, distilled them, and later penned them in the first person, producing an unusual,
                    useful, and always interesting account of pioneer life.</p>
            <p>Oliver Johnson's contemporaries appear as individualistic, resilient, inventive people,
                    people who sought and achieved a large measure of self-sufficiency. Their society was also broadly
                    consensual, warmly supportive, participatory, and amazingly trusting. These traits emerge from
                    Johnson's recollections of grist mills, new farms, and hog drives. Social tensions surfaced
                    frequently, the products of local political maneuverings, conflicting customs among settlers, and
                    clashes between eastern values and aspirations and western conditions. Rough play and fist fights
                    were socially acceptable outlets for aggression.</p>
            <p>This work is generally free from the sentimentality and sweeping generalizations commonly found in
                    oral histories. Valuable, detailed glimpses of everyday life abound: working with farm animals,
                    solving crop problems, clearing and constructing, balancing a diet, and attending a subscription
                    school. Even so, the many decades separating Oliver Johnson's boyhood from Howard
                    Johnson's writing cast some uncertainty on the work; time may play havoc with memory and
                    motives, making evidence somewhat suspect. The work is further diminished by the omission of an
                    index.</p>
            <pb n="59" id="VAA4025-076-1-065"/>
            <p>Militating against these weaknesses are helpful sketches and an afterward which links Oliver

                    of Howard Johnson, Oliver Johnson observed: "We had our ups and downs, but nobody went
                    hungry and nobody done much complainin. We just about lived off the land and was satisfied"

            <p>In her study <hi rend="i">From <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                        </placeName> to Indiana</hi> Elfrieda Lang has singled out the Gabriel Woodfill family of Welsh
                    ancestory as a case history of a family business in the Hoosier state. In five chapters of almost
                    equal length Lang chronicles the Welsh heritage in America; sketches the early history of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana; discusses the motivation and success of early settlers and settlement in that
                    county; narrates the county's early mercantile history; and concludes by tracing the
                    Woodfill family from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wlk">Wales</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>

                    </placeName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName> and recording the contributions that family made to the county's history.
                    During their years in Indiana the Woodfill family progressed from farming to merchandising, and
                    Lang's last chapter sketches this transition as well as the importance of the merchant to
                    community development. It also shows how the merchant tradition persisted and became intertwined
                    with other community enterprise.</p>
            <p>In her research Lang has used manuscripts, government documents, newspapers, periodicals, business
                    directories, articles, and books. Of particular value to the study were original census records,
                    especially those for 1850, which she used extensively. With these records she identified the free
                    inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1850 with assets of $5,000 or over and analyzed them on the basis of
                    occupation, nativity, age, and wealth. Then, using county histories, manuscript collections, and
                    personal memoirs, she traced the careers of selected examples from the group. In the use of these
                    resource materials and others, such as surveyor's field notes, Lang illustrates the wealth
                    of material available to those interested in writing family and local history.</p>
            <pb n="60" id="VAA4025-076-1-066"/>
            <p>The study's major weakness is its failure to integrate its several aspects into a complete
                    narrative. Thus, though Lang discusses at length the Welsh heritage in America, she does not connect
                    this heritage specifically to Indiana. Similarly, while describing extensively the physical and
                    political characteristics of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Decatur County</region>
                    </placeName>, she fails to relate those characteristics either to farming or to merchandising.
                    Despite these and other weaknesses the study offers an extensive look at materials that are
                    available for research in family and local history. Although the Woodfills were of Welsh ancestry,
                    they could as easily have been Scotch-Irish or German or almost any other ethnic group. Their story
                    is not a Welsh story; it is a story of pioneer success regardless of ethnicity.</p>

                        <region type="county">Vanderburgh County</region>
                    </placeName>, but, to the contrary, both for content and sheer delight, this book deserves a wide
                    audience. In addition to sponsoring reprints the Friends of Willard Library, with this venture, are
                    expanding into the publication of local source materials. Kenneth P. McCutchan, well-known area
                    historian, deserves enormous credit for providing unity and continuity to a rather miscellaneous
                    collection of manuscripts covering much of what there is to know about Saundersville, Indiana. This
                    then is the recorded history of an obscure hamlet some ten miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The village is now all but wiped from maps and twentieth-century memories; it is
                    typical, hardly unique.</p>
            <p>A perusal of community land entries, church and burial records, account books, and similar documents
                    will serve essentially genealogists. More exciting, however, are some sixty letters extending from
                    1818 to 1863 from pioneer settlers Martha and John Ingle to their relatives in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The story <pb n="61" id="VAA4025-076-1-067"/> of how these letters returned to Indiana
                    is complicated, but they reveal with almost naive honesty the life, times, observations, joys, and
                    sorrows of over forty years of the Ingle family as they move from pioneer rusticity to settled
                    "sophistication" in southwestern Indiana. With McCutchan's explications,
                    plus the supplementary town documents, almost every letter opens new insights into varied Hoosier
                    institutions, be they religious, political, economic, or intellectual.</p>
            <p>The excitement of learning to know people from the past may be even more valuable than the
                    information derived from the content of the letters. In this charming exposé of Ingle
                    family life the reader eagerly awaits the next episode to see how family health and wealth will
                    fare. These letters from a semiliterate pioneer family on the cutting edge of frontier civilization
                    flesh out statistics to reveal how Hoosiers really lived; Saundersville in turn comes alive. It is
                    to be hoped that a new generation of Indiana social historians with requisite imagination will
                    combine quantitative analysis with a growing supply of such local vignettes as these in order to
                    create a needed historical synthesis. Any good collection of Indiana history materials should
                    include this book; all friends of Indiana history are indebted to the Friends of Willard Library, <placeName>

                    </placeName> or not remains uncertain—despite Ralph D. Gray's best efforts. Gray
                    does succeed, however, in demonstrating that Haynes deserves far greater recognition as an early
                    automotive pioneer than he is generally accorded.</p>
            <p>Haynes was born into an upper-class family in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1857. He received more formal education than most of America's
                    Gilded Age businessmen and inventors. After completing high school, he entered <placeName>

                    graduated in 1881. Later on he spent a year in graduate study at Johns Hopkins University. Perhaps
                    that is why Haynes placed a far higher value on college education than most of his contemporaries.
                    He argued: "Never employ a man, not in this day of the world, who is not a college graduate
                    to attack any problem that requires an original process" (p. 213).</p>
            <p>In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Haynes, after a brief career as superintendent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName> (Indiana) Natural Gas and Oil Company, turned his attention to the development of the
                    automobile. The successful test drive in 1894 was the result of several years'
                    experimentation and development, always conducted in what Haynes perceived to be the proper
                    scientific method. In 1894 Haynes and Elmer Apperson, in whose machine shop the actual construction
                    of Haynes' first car had taken place, entered the automobile business. The Haynes-Apperson
                    partnership lasted less than a decade. Apperson, strongly attracted by the early
                    "races" and endurance "runs" being conducted at the turn of the
                    century to promote the automobile, set up his own company to specialize in the production of more
                    powerful racing cars. Haynes, until it was too late, ignored the market for small inexpensive cars
                    and concentrated on building medium or large luxury cars designed for upper-class customers. Lured
                    by a seemingly limitless market during the latter part of World War I and the immediate postwar
                    years, the Haynes Automobile Company overbuilt and despite heroic efforts never fully recovered from
                    the 1921-1922 depression in the industry. The company failed in 1925.</p>
            <p>At least part of the problem had been poor management. Haynes was never really an automobile business
                    executive. Without a great deal of business talent himself, Haynes relied much too heavily on his
                    family, none of whom possessed the necessary management experience and skills to direct an
                    automobile company during those turbulent years. It is difficult to fault Haynes for his lack of
                    entrepreneurship or business ability; he was an inventor and deserves recognition as a metallurgist.</p>
            <p>In September, 1912, Haynes received patents on "stellite," a ternary alloy of
                    cobalt, chromium, and tungsten, which produced an extremely hard metal ideal for machine tools,
                    medical and dental equipment, cutlery, and other items which needed to take and hold a fine edge.
                    After a brief period during which Haynes manufactured and marketed stellite through the Haynes
                    Stellite Company, the alloy patents were acquired by Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.</p>
            <pb n="63" id="VAA4025-076-1-069"/>
            <p>The same year that Haynes received his stellite patents he applied for patents on an iron or steel
                    and chromium alloy which was noncorrosive. Haynes' patent on the chromium alloy, popularly
                    known as "stainless steel," was not granted until 1917 when the Patent Office
                    Board of Examiners ruled that Harry Bearley's 1916 patent on the alloy had interferred with
                    Haynes' earlier work. Haynes may not have built the first automobile, but he undoubtedly
                    deserves credit for having first patented the corrosive-resistant properties of stainless steel.</p>
            <p>Working with rich sources relating to Haynes' businesses, Gray presents an excellent picture
                    of his subject's accomplishments in pioneer automobile development and metallurgy. He is
                    less successful in dealing with Haynes, the man, but it is difficult to fault Gray considering that
                    in this respect few sources were apparently available. What is otherwise a fine book is somewhat
                    marred by Gray's obsession with the question of whether or not Haynes built the first car.
                    Rather than dealing with the topic on at least three separate occasions, Gray would have better
                    served his readers with one thorough discussion. This is, however, a minor fault in an otherwise
                    excellent treatment of the first citizen of <placeName>

                    Illustrations, notes, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>This is the first full-length biography of Eugene Victor Debs since Ray Ginger's <hi rend="i">The Bending Cross</hi> (1949). Bernard J. Brommel's book is not as powerfully
                    evocative of the man and his times as is that previous work, but it is well grounded in original
                    research. The author has mined contemporary magazines and newspapers, labor and radical journals,
                    and the papers of socialists who worked with Debs. He has discovered some new Debs letters and the
                    collection that Theodore Debs kept as his brother's secretary. Brommel has even found some
                    volumes from Debs' own personal library and has interviewed survivors who knew the great
                    labor-socialist agitator.</p>
            <p>The book has fresh information on Debs' youth, including the sources of his formal education
                    and informal reading. The story of his early work as a labor organizer and editor is well told.
                    Brommel also notes Debs' service as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s city <pb n="64" id="VAA4025-076-1-070"/> clerk and as an Indiana legislator.
                    This fling in local Democratic politics produced a wonderful retrospective comment from the mature
                    Debs: "I have been trying to live it down. I am as ashamed of that as I am proud of having
                    gone to jail" (p. 26). The familiar story of the Pullman strike is curtailed, and the rest
                    of the book deals with Debs' role as presidential candidate and party leader between 1900
                    and 1920. A final chapter analyzes Debs as a public speaker and assesses his role in the stream of
                    American radicalism.</p>
            <p>Brommel depicts the Debs known to all—a man opposed to bigotry, economic inequality, and
                    political control. Debs was a reflexive radical because he liked the little people and was
                    suspicious of concentrated power. He spoke strong words and possessed a vivid vocabulary but
                    eschewed violence because of his concern for humanity and because violence would impede the
                    acceptance of socialism. Brommel sees Debs as a romantic with a sharp tongue, yet favoring pacific
                    responses to injustice.</p>
            <p>Brommel also sees his subject as a stronger force within the Socialist party than have previous
                    historians. Debs chiefly hoped to avoid the appearance either of bomb-throwing radicalism or simple
                    reformism and wanted to remain true to well-defined socialist principles; thus, he stayed in the
                    middle of the often comical yet bitter factional fights. He sometimes thought that
                    "slowcialists" like Victor Berger were too timid and that radicals like the
                    Wobblies were too radical, or at least too whimsical. Debs was bland about these disputes in public,
                    but his private correspondence was more biting and often bitter. In the end he took few overtly
                    divisive stands and retained power over the rank and file as a harmonizer above the battles.</p>
            <p>In terms of recoverable sources this book is probably the last word on Debs. Brommel's
                    approach is straightforward and sometimes lifeless, but he adds some fresh details and sober
                    insights to a familiar story. The book is not startling, but it is well worth having as a reminder
                    that every generation should have a Debs.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Jazz State of Indiana.</hi> By Duncan Schiedt. (Pittsboro, Ind.: The author,
                    1977. Pp. ix, 256. Illustrations, index. Paperbound, $9.95.)</head>
            <p>Duncan Schiedt is to be commended for his excellent "account of the rise and flowering of
                    jazz music in Indiana" (p. v). <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-076-1-071"/> Hoosiers should welcome
                    this work which, to this reviewer's knowledge, is the only state history on the subject.</p>
            <p>It is important to note at the outset that the author uses the term jazz in its widest sense; thus,
                    the music of the popular, theater, and "sweet" bands take up as much, and possibly
                    more (depending on the reader's definition of jazz), space than the "hot"
                    jazz groups. Some of the notable jazz musicians born in Indiana-Eddie Condon, Sidney Catlett, Wilbur
                    and Sidney DeParis, and Wes <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName>-are merely mentioned. The author is aware of the problem of definition and in his
                    introduction cautions the reader against being "misled into thinking that all the bands and
                    musicians in this book were jazz-oriented" (p. vi).</p>
            <p>The two opening chapters are devoted to music, musicians, and the social milieu found in the urban
                    areas from the 1880s to World War I. Included are discussions of three forces-ragtime, motion
                    pictures, and the phonograph-which played major roles in the development, diffusion, and
                    popularization of jazz music. The remaining six chapters cover Indiana jazz history chiefly in the
                    1920s. Included are discussions of outstanding musicians and musical groups, campus bands, the
                    development of orchestral arranging (by Earle M. Moss), black bands, "all-girl"
                    bands, and more detailed information concerning musical activity in the major cities.</p>
            <p>Schiedt is an internationally known collector of jazz photographs and memorabilia, and many items
                    from his collection are reproduced as illustrations in the volume. It is unfortunate that the
                    extensive data given in the illustrations are not included in the index. Geographical locations and
                    place names (theaters, dance halls, and so forth) are also missing. Thus, the list of individual and
                    group names which make up the present index is but a skeleton of the vast body of useful data
                    contained in the text and illustrations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Jazz State of Indiana</hi> is based chiefly on interviews and does not include
                    scholarly documentation-sources, footnotes, bibliography-which will perhaps be missed by only a few
                    readers. The book is relatively objective and free of errors and is both enjoyable reading and a
                    valuable reference source for Indiana jazz music. Copies belong in every Indiana library and in the
                    libraries of those interested in jazz and Indiana history.</p>

            <p>In the first few pages of her pioneering study of the early federal courts in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Mary K. Bonsteel Tachau raises the memory of Julius Goebel. Perhaps the most
                    distinguished American legal historian of the first half of the twentieth century, Goebel spent much
                    of his time patrolling the enclosed lands of "his" legal history to keep out
                    trespassers, in particular nonlawyer historians and other incompetents. He was remarkably (and
                    unfortunately) successful in this task. Aside from the small group of scholars who clustered around
                    Willard Hurst in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1950s and 1960s, historians have generally kept their distance from the spring
                    guns and other booby traps that awaited them in technical legal history. The federal courts below
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court have been especially neglected; therefore, the publication of a
                    systematic study by a historian of the workload of the lower federal courts in a jurisdiction and in
                    a period as important as early <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> is an event which one would like to celebrate.</p>
            <p>Tachau does many things very well in this book. In particular, she offers a useful statistical
                    breakdown of the circuit and district courts, a generally careful description of the changing
                    jurisdiction of the two courts, and illuminating portraits of Judge Harry Innes and other personnel
                    of the courts. She provides much new background on two famous cases of the early nineteenth century:
                    the trial of Aaron Burr and <hi rend="i">Green</hi>v. <hi rend="i">Biddle</hi>, the Supreme Court
                    test of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s occupying claimant law. And her chapter on the enforcement of the internal
                    revenue laws suggests the possibility of a legal history of moonshin-ing and is itself a fascinating
                    study in the politics of federal law enforcement in the early republic. Her book provides a splendid
                    base with which future historians can compare other lower federal courts. It is a useful beginning.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, however, this book might well lead Goebel's ghost to urge a renewal of
                    vigilance at the borders of his lands. Also unfortunately, one perhaps ought to pay attention to the
                    ghost's disquietude. Tachau's work raises the happy possibility of a social
                    history of law as an alternative to Goebelian tunnel history. Such a social history, however,
                    depends on an appreciation of the fact that technical legal questions—in particular
                    questions of legal procedure—are not merely roadblocks on the way to historical
                    understanding. The categories and procedures <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-076-1-073"/> that a trial court
                    uses in making decisions, as much as the decisions themselves, are important parts of the social
                    history of that court. Yet Tachau seems at times unaware of the historical and explanatory
                    significance of technical rules, and she is frequently mistaken in her use of legal categories.</p>
            <p>Some mistakes are merely irritating. The appended glossary and the definitions strewn throughout the
                    text are too often unnecessarily vague or inaccurate. Other mistakes suggest the dangers of a little
                    knowledge. Tachau ends a description of the formalism of federal court proceedings by asking why a
                    judge as old-fashioned as Innes permitted suits to be brought in only eight of the dozens of forms
                    of action or writs available in medieval <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The answer, of course, is that Innes was not a medieval judge. In fact, one can be
                    relatively sure that most of those dozens of writs were of no more significance to even the most
                    traditionalistic of late-eighteenth-century judges than an eighteenth-century "trespass vi
                    et armis" would be of concern to a conservative modern judge.</p>
            <p>Finally, and most importantly, a better understanding of the law would have deepened and perhaps
                    transformed Tachau's evaluation of the function of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> federal courts. Throughout the book the author argues for the relative and competitive
                    significance of her courts as decisionmakers, relying on comparisons to the respective workloads of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Supreme Court and of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> state courts. In chapter seven, for example, she explains the high volume of debt cases
                    before her court by stating that the formalism and high quality of decisionmaking of Innes'
                    court led plaintiffs to prefer it to the state courts as a forum for civil litigation. Basing her
                    argument on the sheer volume of the caseload before the federal court (since she can offer no
                    evidence of actual stated litigant preferences), she tries to demonstrate that quality and
                    predictability made the federal district court into a more desirable debt collector. Even a slight
                    understanding of the legal purpose of a federal court, however, would suggest a different answer.
                    The federal Constitution created diversity jurisdiction for the federal courts; they were meant to
                    provide a forum where out-of-state plaintiffs could sue and obtain judgments from in-state
                    defendants. The attractiveness of a federal court lay not in its formalism or its quality or its
                    predictability as such but in the fact that it was not a local court. The very
                    "predictibility" of local courts would lead creditors to prefer the federal
                    courts. Nowhere would this be more true than in a frontier state such as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> where capital was in short supply and enterprising individuals were forced to look
                    outside <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-076-1-074"/> the state for funds. Unless Tachau can demonstrate that
                    most plaintiffs in debt cases were <hi rend="i">not</hi> from out-of-state, one would reasonably
                    assume that it was diversity jurisdiction (almost irrespective of the quality of decision-making)
                    that provided the lure of the court. And more generally, the measure of the significance of early
                    federal courts lay not in their competitive place in a national or local market for judicial goods
                    but in the ways in which they fulfilled the particular and limited roles given them in the
                    federalist theory of the early republic.</p>

            <p>R. David Edmunds has made a solid, impressive addition to the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> Press' Civilization of the American Indian series. Like most volumes in the
                    series, Edmunds' book is not anthropological or ethnocultural and relies on traditional
                    historical documents to narrate the history of Potawatomiwhite relations. Within this traditional
                    framework the author succeeds admirably in placing the Potawatomis in the context of their times and
                    in relating their prolonged, but hopeless, struggle against the white onslaught.</p>
            <p>The Potawatomis always seemed to be on the losing side. They were closely tied to the French through
                    trade and sided with them in the eighteenth-century conflicts with <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. After the French defeat the Potawatomis were eager followers of Pontiac's
                    doomed rebellion against their new British masters. They were only reluctantly won over to the
                    British but nevertheless sided with them against the colonists during the American Revolution.
                    Although only part of the tribe actively participated in hostilities against the Americans, the
                    whole tribe was held accountable after the British defeat. After the Revolution various Potawatomi
                    bands participated in the wars against the expansionist <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Potawatomis were on the winning side of the defeats of Josiah Harmar and Arthur St.
                    Clair but were soundly defeated at Fallen Timbers by Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Recalcitrant to the end, Potawatomis formed an important part of Tecumseh's
                    strength and followed that fated warrior and his British allies in the War of 1812. This final
                    defeat sealed their doom, and it was only a matter of time before the pressure from white settlers
                    led to the removal of almost all the Potawatomis across the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>.</p>
            <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-076-1-075"/>
            <p>Edmunds is at his best in relating the inter-and intratribal rivalries that dominated Potawatomi
                    affairs in this period. As in most societies, economic interests, kinship ties, and personality
                    clashes all played a vital part in political development. Edmunds clearly reveals the operation of
                    this tribal political system.</p>
            <p>Although the book is admirable, two criticisms are in order. It is only natural for the author to
                    emphasize the role played by the Potawatomis in the conflicts with the invading whites. However, he
                    often gives the tribe too much credit. The reader might well assume that the Potawatomis played a
                    much more important part in the battles against Edward Braddock, Harmar, St. Clair, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> than is actually the case. It is also unfortunate that the book is so limited in scope.
                    Edmunds covers only the period from 1600 to 1840, from the earliest white contact to the final
                    removal of the Potawatomis from the Old Northwest. The opening date is understandable given the
                    paucity of research materials, but it is indeed unfortunate that the Potawatomis' history
                    was not brought up into the present century.</p>
            <p>The Potawatomis were an important midwestern tribe, and their history has been too long neglected.
                    Edmunds has used a wide range of source material to construct this fine contribution to Indian
                    scholarship and has provided the standard history of the tribe.</p>

                        <pb n="70" id="VAA4025-076-1-076"/> one quarter of the book is devoted to elaborate tables and
                    well-drawn maps setting forth population distribution, vote counts, and other useful statistical
                    information.</p>
            <p>Tutorow's painstaking work leaves no doubt whatever—if any ever
                    existed—that through the dilemmas and heroism that accompanied the winning of the Far
                    West and Southwest politicians never forgot partisan infighting or their own prospects in the next
                    election. They might occasionally declaim with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <hi rend="i">Banner</hi> that "we are now all Whigs and all
                    Democrats" (p. 129), but none of them meant it for a moment.</p>
            <p>Since politicians and attendant newspaper editors functioned in a democratic republic, a narrowly
                    political study such as this is apt to seem at times unreal or superficial. One cannot help
                    wondering what the mass of people thought about all these issues and to what degree they supported
                    or even accepted what they were told. Unfortunately, the historian of the many centuries before
                    polls is chained in Plato's cave straining to glimpse mere shadows of public opinion in the
                    flickering firelight of editorials and debates. Tutorow has certainly avoided much doubt and
                    conjecture with his self-imposed limitation on politics as such. Nevertheless, even he cannot resist
                    a little speculation at times. For example, in discussing northwestern opposition to the Mexican
                    War, he suggests that "opinion in Congress was more a molder of public opinion than a
                    reflection of it" (p. 182). How does he know? His evidence comes entirely from state and
                    county political conventions or is deduced from political actions. He might have provided at least a
                    whiff of public opinion by quoting constituents' letters in some of the collections that he
                    consulted (e.g., the papers of William Allen and Robert J. Walker). These are the genuine <hi rend="i">vox populi</hi> even if not numerous enough for statistical significance.</p>
            <p>The book contains much background material about the events of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> annexation and the Mexican War. This material could have been further condensed without
                    harm to the average informed reader. In the space thus saved Tutorow might well have given a more
                    penetrating discussion of the wartime split between the regional followers of David Wilmot (who
                    wanted territory from Mexico but none for slavery) and of Thomas Corwin (who wanted no territory at
                    all). In the Northwest, at least, this fault line became the epicenter of numerous wartime and
                    postwar tremors that shook the framework of American politics and society.</p>

            <p>In this latest book from a dean of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> railroad historians, John F. Stover has set out to describe the growth of the American
                    railroad business in the 1850s. This was, he reminds the reader, an important decade in economic
                    history, a decade that saw trackage grow from nine thousand to thirty thousand miles. The expansion
                    did not result in a fully integrated new transportation system—the development of
                    standard time and a standard gauge awaited the postbellum years—but it did produce a new
                    east-west axis of trade and travel that, politically, helped bind the West to the Northeast when the
                    Union divided in 1861 and that greatly stimulated the growth of American agriculture and
                    manufacture.</p>
            <p>Stover's descriptive material in this book provides little new insight into his topic. He
                    organized the data regionally—with separate chapters on the East, West, and
                    South—to describe the relative growth of rail mileage on a firm by firm basis in each
                    state. He compared miles of track laid to population, land area, and capital invested per mile.
                    Although the boom in railroad construction was national, the South lagged while the West was rapidly
                    catching up to eastern standards. The information provided may be useful to scholars who seek to
                    sort out the complexities created by the histories of hundreds of firms, for they will find here
                    brief accounts of each small company that first started to construct track and its growth or
                    absorption by other firms. The book includes information about the financing—including
                    governmental subsidies—of the lines and a brief account of the changing technologies
                    employed in railroad building.</p>
            <p>The author, unfortunately, does not range far beyond such descriptive matters. Although he does not
                    do so directly, Stover clearly disputes Robert Fogel's counterfactual argument that a canal
                    and water system, if fully developed, could have provided the transportation links necessary for the
                    industrial revolution. He points out, for example, Americans' preferences for the cheaper
                    capital costs, shorter distances, greater speed, and greater reliability of the "iron
                    road" over waterways. He shows that, because of those preferences, by the end of the 1850s
                    the economic importance of interior water transportation was in relative decline to the railroads.
                    For most historians this is nots <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-076-1-078"/> an especially new
                    interpretation, but it is convenient to have it succinctly stated.</p>
            <p>There is much that is missing from this account of the railroad business of the 1850s. It does have
                    brief vignettes of actual travels, comparing, for instance, Abraham Lincoln's east-west
                    trips of 1849 and 1861. For the most part, however, people and the problems they confronted do not
                    come alive in these pages. There is no description of the development of modern business management
                    in American railroad firms, a development which began during the decade of the 1850s. Nor is there a
                    discussion of the opposition that railroads encountered from persons who feared their impact on
                    social customs or on established avenues of trade. (The author does explain, however, that initially
                    train operation on Sundays was much disputed.) Thus, in terms of the establishment of firms and the
                    laying of track, the book appears definitive for the decade it discusses; but for some important
                    human aspects of the story, readers will have to look elsewhere.</p>

            <p>The author focuses his study upon the over three hundred dialect pieces that Dunne published in the
                    1890s in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers about his mythical Irish folk hero, Mr. Dooley, a philosopher-barkeeper on
                    Archer Avenue in Bridgeport. The book treats thematically four topics that underlie Mr.
                    Dooley's wit: daily living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Irish community; the problems in that community as the Irish adapted to
                    American life; the workers' views from an Irish ward in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s political arena in the 1890s; and Irish nationalism as it manifested itself
                    in the American Irish. In addition to creating the weekly Mr. Dooley articles, Dunne wrote daily
                    editorials, often on the same subjects. Fanning's comparisons, which include numerous
                    quotations, prove his argument that Dunne's opinions as editor were usually more
                    conservative than the views of Mr. Dooley, his wittier social critic.</p>
            <p>One of the values of this book is the skillful way in which Fanning traces events in Dunne's
                    life and relates the way in <pb n="73" id="VAA4025-076-1-079"/> which they emerged in his writings.
                    The author also provides background information on political life in <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the 1890s to help the reader to understand Dunne's writings and the fact
                    that back of Mr. Dooley's humor there was a story of the struggle of the Irish to be
                    assimilated, accepted, and successful in America. Fanning does this especially well in his
                    explanations of poverty and politics among the Irish immigrants.</p>
            <p>The gradual development of Mr. Dooley, wisest of saloon keepers on Archer Avenue, from a commentator
                    upon the local Irish-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> scene into a critic-philosopher upon the national and international scene has been
                    carefully documented and explained by the author. By the late 1890s Dunne wrote less about local
                    politics and more about Irish nationalism, the Philippine question, and the Spanish-American war.
                    Syndication of the Mr. Dooley essays spread Dunne's fame, and in 1900 he left <placeName>

                    Dunne's best work appeared in these earlier <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> writings. In a final chapter Fanning assesses Dunne's contributions as a
                    historian, as a literary realist, and as a philosopher. Although he obviously admires Dunne, Fanning
                    objectively analyzes his weaknesses and importance. The author's research on
                    Dunne's influence on Theodore Dreiser will interest students of American realism.</p>
            <p>Fanning's book contains far greater detail and pays more attention to the exact historical
                    events about which Dunne wrote than does Barbara C. Schaaf's recent <hi rend="i">Dooley's <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> (1977). Schaaf's journalistic style, however, makes for far easier
                    reading. Fanning's book includes quotations from almost all of Dunne's Mr. Dooley
                    essays, plus many in their entirety, and his frequent footnotes add more information to his
                    commentary. Lincoln Steffens once described Dunne's writings as a painful chore to read.
                    The reader unfamiliar with the Irish dialect might find the same true of the many pages of Mr.
                    Dooley's essays in this book. However, members of the devoted Dooley clan will appreciate
                    Fanning's research and comments and will thank him as the Sherlock Holmes fans do those
                    writers who further enlighten them about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Season of Youth: The American Revolution and the Historical Imagination.</hi> By
                    Michael Kammen. (<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978. Pp. xxi, 384. Illustrations, notes, index. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>Michael Kammen's latest inquiry into the sources of American national character is on
                    balance a work of considerable significance, perhaps even more so than his Pulitzer-Prize-winning
                        <hi rend="i">People of Paradox</hi> (1972), which was to some tastes too much a <hi rend="i">tour de force.</hi> There is some of the same tendency to get lost in details. There is some of
                    the same looseness of organization. But this time Kammen has sufficiently kept his virtuosi
                    temperament in check, perhaps because he is dealing with a much better focused objective. He takes
                    as his theme the relationship of the American people, at least insofar as can be gathered from the
                    evidence of "cultural artifacts," to their revolutionary heritage. It is a study
                    certainly worthy of consideration in light of the recent debacle of a national bicentennial. With
                    that latter sad occasion in mind, it comes as something of a surprise, then, when Kammen insists
                    that the American Revolution "stands as the single most important source for our national
                    sense of tradition" (p. 256). The paradox is shortly resolved when it is pointed out that
                    Americans are continually drawn to the Revolution in order to minimize its revolutionary character.</p>
            <p>The need to deal with the Revolutionary epoch is in part a function of a characteristic American
                    indifference, and even hostility, to the past, a condition of mind which seriously threatened the
                    development of an essential national consciousness in the earlier national period. Cultural
                    nationalists in search of a national tradition could only turn to the Revolution as an heroic
                    expression of an in-dwelling and even fated sense of nationality. But it was precisely for that
                    reason that they played down the socially disruptive and fratricidal elements that went into the
                    making of the Revolution. Kammen is not always as explicit as he might be on this process of
                    adulteration, but it is nonetheless quite implicit in his treatment of the early national culture.</p>
            <p>Kammen finds a significant shift in perspective among writers and artists in the late nineteenth
                    century. Earlier in the century, thus closer to the event itself, the Revolution was customarily
                    portrayed as an object lesson in civic spirit and high principles with George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, of course, serving as the personification of republican values. By the close of the
                    century the Revolution came to be seen more and more as a <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-076-1-081"/> pure
                    and simple military encounter, a shift in focus, which Kammen points out "helped to obviate
                    any need to deal with social radicalism, the ideology inherent in the Declaration of Independence,
                    the rights of man, and related issues that might have seemed awkward at that time" (p.
                    160). Kammen is quite correct in locating the source of this shift in the social conservatism of the
                        <hi rend="i">fin de siecle</hi>, but he is a little off center in asserting that the
                    conservative gentlemen and ladies of this era were "myopic" with respect to the
                    realities of economic and class conflict (p. 61). They were in fact considerably more realistic than
                    the earlier generation of romantics. It was not so much that they denied that side of the
                    Revolutionary experience as that they deplored and denigrated Revolutionary radicalism and radicals.</p>
            <p>Kammen is somewhat mistaken on this matter perhaps because he deliberately excludes professional
                    historians from the purview of his study, although he does occasionally sneak them in through the
                    back door. If he had taken into systematic account the historiography of the period, he would have
                    noted, as, for example, Richard Hofstadter does in <hi rend="i">The Progressive Historians</hi>
                    (1968), the recovery of a sense of social discord in the Revolutionary struggle. It seems that
                    Kammen has unnecessarily limited his inquiry on the rather specious grounds of a separation of the
                    culture into high and low.</p>
            <p>Kammen lets the reader know early in the game that the climax of his book comes in chapter six. (He
                    has the bad habit of telegraphing his punches.) The title of the book, <hi rend="i">A Season of
                        Youth</hi>, is drawn from the thesis of that chapter. Writers of historical novels dealing with
                    the American Revolution, Kammen finds, consistently portray the Revolution as a <hi rend="i">rite de
                        passage</hi>for their heroes and heroines. The Revolution is thus perceived as a crucial moment
                    of maturation wherein society makes the leap from the childhood dependance of colonies to the sturdy
                    manhood (or womanhood) of republican independence. It is not an altogether novel insight, as Kammen
                    himself testifies in his citations, but the use to which he puts that theme is constructive and
                    valuable. He argues that the metaphor of a rite of passage served as a device for derevolutionizing
                    the Revolution. It was "a means of replacing revolution with evolution" (p. 215),
                    and, Kammen concludes, "The net effect has been to trivialize the American
                    Revolution" (p. 219). A consideration at this point of a similar tendency among historians
                    might have been in order, but Kammen resists what must have been a temptation.</p>
            <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-076-1-082"/>
            <p>In a recent essay in the <hi rend="i">American Quarterly</hi>(XXX, No. 2), Michael Zuckerman observed
                    despairingly with respect to the Revolutionary bicentennial that by the manner of its celebration
                    "we declared our incapacity to connect rewardingly, or even coherently, with our
                    Revolutionary origins" (p. 226). The value and significance of Kammen's <hi rend="i">A Season of Youth</hi>lies precisely in its explication of that condition, a condition
                    which needs desperately to be overcome if in fact the <placeName>

                    </placeName> will continue to persevere as a republic founded "in liberty and justice for

            <p>The connection between abolitionism and feminism is well known. Who were these first generation
                    feminists, most of whom were born before 1825, who developed during their anti-slavery crusade an
                    awakening consciousness of feminism? To find the answer Blanche Glassman Hersh examines the lives of
                    fifty-one white women largely of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> ancestry. Her decision to omit black women leaves her with a relatively homogeneous
                    group from which to generalize.</p>
            <p>Hersh's discussion of the feminist movement's origins in antislavery, the
                    transition to a struggle for women's rights as an end in itself, and the biographical
                    sketches of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy Stone add little that is new. The
                    author's contribution lies instead in her composite biography of the early feminists, most
                    of whom came from prosperous families and enjoyed a high level of education for the times. At least
                    half had been teachers. Absorbed by a Calvinist sense of duty and an evangelical view of life as a
                    battle against evil, they nevertheless rejected orthodoxy. Reform was their religion. Although Hersh
                    sees this abandonment of orthodoxy as crucial to the development of the movement, it is unclear
                    whether the rejection was cause or effect. Hersh does make clear, however, the connection between
                    the feminists' passion for perfectionism and their involvement in other reforms, including
                    spiritualism and phrenology.</p>
            <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-076-1-083"/>
            <p>Thirty-seven of the early feminists were married, generally to husbands who shared similar
                    backgrounds and beliefs in women's rights. Instead of separate spheres, feminists
                    envisioned spouses as inhabiting partially overlapping spheres. They shared the roles of human being
                    and citizen whereas their roles of wife-mother and breadwinner remained separate. The responsibility
                    for housekeeping was retained by the wife, whose burden was thus intensified by the glorification of
                    domesticity in response to the image of feminists as unsexed monsters. What was new in these
                    marriages was the freedom of wives to labor for reform outside the home, leaving the husband with
                    occasional responsibility for the children. Hersh's judgment concerning the equality
                    achieved in these marriages seems overly optimistic. She sees such a union as an
                    "egalitarian marriage that would still be remarkable today" (p. viii). Her
                    description of the constant balancing act demanded by the roles of wife-mother and reformer are less
                    sanguine. Hersh is right in concluding that the independence these women enjoyed owed much to the
                    marriages they made, but perhaps the widespread availability of servants was equally essential.</p>
            <p>Hersh's picture of the first generation of feminists shows a group of women with
                    extraordinary vitality. The average age at death was eighty! She concludes that their rejection of
                    separate spheres opened the way for changes in marriage and society in general. They certainly made
                    a beginning, but by adding the role of reformer to the already demanding one of wife-mother, the
                    image left in this reviewer's mind is not so much one of the egalitarian woman as of the
                    superwoman!</p>

            <p>Had this book been published earlier, many questionable "restorations" of historic

                    do, with meritorious success, was "to provide a framework for thinking; and to provide
                    signals in the form of basic facts" (p. ix) to guide those who undertake the re-creation of

            <p>The primary function of a house-museum, as opposed to a museum of decorative arts, is to interpret a
                    particular period of history in the context of the people who lived there. Properly documented, the
                    smallest details become interpretive materials that give the house human and social dimension. Since
                    historic houses seldom survive with their contents intact, how does one go about re-creating the
                    interior so that it will ring true? Says Seale: "A house that has stood for a hundred years
                    need not be rushed backward or forward" (p. 26). He advises stabilization while awaiting
                    later decisions.</p>
            <p>The groundwork for making those decisions is outlined in what can be considered the
                    "meat" of this book, the chapters dealing with historical research. Stressing the
                    importance of local documentation, Seale provides a comprehensive checklist of potential sources and
                    even goes so far as to recommend a system for filing and retrieving the data gathered. Eventually
                    this file will serve as the basis for a detailed recommendation on the restoration and re-creation
                    of the house as well as the later interpretation of the site to the public.</p>
            <p>Succeeding chapters address many of the common problems encountered in the course of restoration, and
                    no reader can fail to be fascinated by the array of historical minutiae contained therein. For
                    example, early paperhangers cooked up their own pastes, "usually composed of a flour base,
                    often mixed with alum, stale beer or port wine" (p. 31); and softwood floors can be
                    returned to their original appearance "by careful stripping with paint or varnish remover,
                    followed by several scrubbings with lye water" (p. 39), which is obtained by boiling wood
                    ashes.</p>
            <p>Seale admonishes against relying too heavily on published sources that deal primarily with the best
                    examples of period styles. These books can be highly misleading because most American homes would
                    have included a number of locally produced vernacular pieces. Even the interiors of houses now
                    considered architecturally sophisticated would rarely have reflected any high style in the
                    international sense before the end of the nineteenth century. A homey domesticity, "which
                    in Europe is usually associated with the rise of the middle class, was in America the dominant
                    character of the whole" (p. 53).</p>
            <p>The twelve color and sixty-four black and white plates that follow the text include documentary and
                    contemporary views of <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-076-1-085"/> interiors from 1720 to 1929 and are
                    accompanied by instructive commentaries on the significant elements in each. Among these pictures
                    are two views of "Ruthmere," the A. H. Beardsley house in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana.</p>
            <p>The book might have been improved by more judicious placement of the thirty-four smaller
                    illustrations scattered through the text. They seem to serve the requirements of page layout better
                    than they do those of the reader, especially since the plates are not numbered or cross-referenced
                    in the text. Nevertheless, this volume should be considered one of the best primers available on
                    recreating historic interiors.</p>

                    the beginning student and the advanced scholar the Barnhart and Carmony opus has been the starting
                    point and often the only readily available source for study of most significant topics relating to
                    Indiana history. Although research in the last quarter century has modified or added to some of the

                    become increasingly difficult to acquire copies of Barnhart and Carmony in recent years, this

                    Map. Booklet, $4.00.) There is no aroma of battle in this compilation of Civil War
                    letters from Private William D. Cook, Fourteenth Indiana Light Artillery, to his brother, James.
                    Gladieux describes the collection as a personalized view of camp life and suggests that the letters
                    amount to a personal regimental history. The claim is a substantial overstatement of their value. In
                    this reviewer's judgment the pamphlet adds little to the literature of military history but
                    may be marginally interesting to the extent that it reflects the life-style and relationship of two
                    brothers who also happened to be soldiers. Gladieux provides an accompanying narrative that will
                    help the reader to understand the correspondence, although it occasionally is somewhat disorganized

            <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-076-1-089"/>
            <p>Appropriate photographs and succinct paragraphs analyze the data appearing on the maps. The volume
                    includes such currently significant data as recent election returns, mineral resources, air and
                    water quality, area development districts, horse farms, value of farmland, and surface mining. Two
                    thirds of the maps fall into the categories of forestry and agriculture (26), land use and physical
                    characteristics (14), the urban system (14), population characteristics (13), social and economic
                    patterns (13), and transportation and communication (10). The historian who examines the maps
                    carefully can identify patterns and discover quirks that might be explained through historical
                    analysis. There are maps of pioneer trails and county boundaries and a series of illustrations

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to present a lecture in the series that honors Dr. R. Gerald McMurtry, the second
                    director of the library and museum. Richard N. Current presented the first lecture in 1978. He
                    eloquently countered recent assertions that Lincoln's life is no longer relevant to ethnic
                    Americans–that he belongs not to the ages but only to "WASPS." In 1979
                    Don E. Fehrenbacher's <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-076-1-090"/> lecture followed the story of
                    Lincoln's love for Ann Rutledge as presented in <hi rend="i">Atlantic Monthly</hi>in the
                    1920s. Fehrenbacher shows that the entire presentation was an elaborate and exciting hoax. Each of
