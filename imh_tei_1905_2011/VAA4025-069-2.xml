            <p>The spring of 1846 found Democrats well in control of the national government. Supported by
                    majorities of 143 to 77 in the House and 31 to 25 in the Senate, President James K. Polk was
                    actively constructing national policy from the planks of his 1844 platform.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    protective tariff and of federal assistance for internal improvements, desperately needed an issue

                    congressional Whig leaders, typified by Representative Caleb B. Smith of Indiana, suddenly found

            <p>Since 1840 the Mexican government had been unwilling or unable to pay the more than $5
                    million in debts it owed to Americans.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Furthermore, it had refused to accept

                    war message was being prepared, word arrived that the small military force under General Zachary
                    Taylor, which Polk had sent to the Rio Grande to put pressure on the Mexican government, had been
                    attacked by Mexican troops. The initiation of hostilities brought the war message to Congress a day
                    earlier than anticipated,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and on May 11, 1846, Polk formally asked Congress for

                    by Smith and most other congressional Whigs. They never ceased denouncing the war as unnecessary and

            <p>Recently appointed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Smith's importance in the
                    national Whig party was on the rise. A member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1833 to
                    1837 and again in 1840 and 1841, Smith had served as speaker from 1835 to 1837. In a triangular
                    election in 1841, he was defeated in his first bid for Congress, but he won a seat easily in 1843
                    and again in 1845.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> After waiting two months to make his first House

                    of the largest interest groups in Smith's district.<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although he was addressing the Democratically controlled House, Smith was in reality speaking
                    directly to the people of Indiana: "My constituents desire information…. I
                    intend to give them this information…." He divided his well organized speech
                    into two parts: the first, a point by point rebuttal of Folk's May 12 justification of the
                    war; the second, a listing of what he believed were the real reasons for America's
                    involvement in the conflict. Before attacking Polk, however, Smith attempted to strengthen his own
                    credibility. He sought to build rapport with his Hoosier audience by announcing that he would not
                    allow them to be "kept in ignorance…." The Democratic administration
                    had tried to keep the truth from the people, but he would give them the facts. Furthermore, he would
                    report the truth even "at the hazard of incurring a portion of that vituperation which has
                    been so liberally heaped upon others." Donning the mantle of the patriot, he recognized
                    "the obligation which patriotism imposes upon every citizen to defend his
                    country," but he would not support a war unjustly declared by the President. Thus armed as
                    a courageous and patriotic friend of the people, he began his attack on the President's
                    justification for the war.</p>

                    or which can be urged as a pretext or excuse for the war in which we are engaged."
                    Referring to the debts owed by several states to Great Britain, he repeated a common Whig analogy
                    when he suggested that if debts justified war, "several sovereign States of this
                    Confederacy … would be in imminent danger of war."</p>
            <p>Smith added nothing new to the debate on the border question. However, in presenting his constituents
                    with his version of the circumstances surrounding the outbreak of hostilities, he selected the facts
                    most damaging to the administration and presented them in a clear and vivid manner. He refuted
                    Folk's assertion that the legislative acts of Texas showed that she had a title to the
                    disputed territory: "As well might he contend that we could acquire a title to the Canadas
                    by passing a legislative act declaring them to be ours." He asserted, but offered no
                    evidence, that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> "had no settlements beyond the Nueces…." He also argued
                    that an examination of the congressional debates on annexation would show that "the united
                    opinion of members" of both Houses was that the question was unsettled. Finally, he pointed
                    out that Santa Fe, east of the Rio Grande and thus claimed by Polk, contained "a Mexican
                    population…." The Mexican laws were "regularly administered
                    there" and all her officers were "supported by the Mexican Government."</p>
            <p>Although the Democratically dominated House Foreign Relations Committee had defended the
                    President's movement of General Zachary Taylor to the Rio Grande, Smith, a member of the
                    committee, vigorously dissented from its report. Charles J. Ingersoll, Pennsylvania Democrat and
                    chairman of the committee, claimed that hostilities had begun on American soil; but Smith declared
                    that eighteen months earlier Ingersoll had referred to the desert between the Nueces and the Rio
                    Grande as the border. In writing the committee's report, Smith asserted, the chairman had
                    largely relied upon "his imagination for his facts." Its readers must be wary:
                    "He who relies upon its conclusions will be as far from the truth as are many of the
                    statements which it contains. The cause must be bad which its friends find necessary <pb n="102" id="VAA4025-069-2-010"/> to defend by such means."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Ingersoll was
                    at his seat during the speech and Smith "looked him in the face while he was holding him up
                    to scorn," but, reportedly, it was not in Ingersoll's "power to
                        blush."<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Smith suggested that Polk had sent the troops to the Rio Grande "with the deliberate design
                    of acquiring <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>." Effectively using one of the few pieces of evidence offered in the speech,
                    Smith read a letter from William Marcy, secretary of war, to Colonel J. D. Stevenson of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, asking him to raise a regiment of volunteers composed of such men "as would

                        </placeName>.</hi>" The letter showed that as early as June, 1846, the government felt
                    it would possess new territory in the West at the end of the conflict. Forecasting the future, Smith
                    expected that "[w]hen the war shall be ended, California and other northern provinces will
                    be in the possession of our armies. If she [<placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>] cannot pay the money, our Government will demand a cession of her territory as an
                    equivalent…." He considered the administration "a Southern
                    one" and believed that "[t]he acquisition of California is desired as a means of
                    extending and perpetuating the power and influence of the South."</p>
            <p>To this point in the speech, Smith's remarks might well have been written by Joshua Giddings
                    or another member of the "immortal fourteen." Smith diverged from the radical Whig
                    position, however, when he declared that it was "not the desire of the Whigs in the House
                    to embarrass the Administration by withholding the supplies necessary to bring the war to a close.
                    Wanton and unjustifiable as they view the war, still we are engaged in it, and our army must be
                    sustained." Just as Giddings had clearly staked out the minority Whig position of denying
                    the President all men and supplies requested, Smith's statements exemplified the pragmatic
                    course preferred by the moderate majority of the party. Determined to make support for the troops
                    something quite apart from support of the war, he rejected the idealistic <list type="footnotes">

                    the enemy and protract the war than to advocate and adhere to their cause, and thus give them `aid
                    and comfort.' "<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Smith responded to Polk on January 6, 1847, during debate on a bill before the House to raise ten
                    additional regiments. He had little to say about the bill itself, except to comment that he believed
                    its only object was a "vast increase of Executive patronage…." However,
                    it did provide him with an opportunity to express his views on "the existing state of our
                    public affairs"—of vital concern since he believed the government was
                    "daily and hourly sinking under the utter imbecility of the Administration which controls
                    it." Combining a rhetorical question with an analogy, Smith justified his remarks:
                    "Shall the mariner, when he sees the vessel, in which his life and that of all the crew is
                    embarked, plunging madly upon the breakers, through the wickedness or unskilfulness of the pilot,
                    sit still and hold his peace?" Besides leading the country into the war, Polk was waging it
                    poorly: "Our Democrat friends assured us that they would end the war … in ninety
                    days…. Well, sir, it is now about eight months since the war commenced, and although we
                    have expended many millions of dollars, and sacrificed several thousand lives, it seems to be
                    generally supposed that we are no nearer a peace than when it began." Smith's
                    language strengthened the force of his attack. He used many rhetorical questions, usually in groups
                    of three or four. Instead of relying on similes or metaphors, he painted vivid descriptions with
                    series of adjectives. He pictured the Mexican leader Santa Anna, for example, as
                    "cruel," "rapacious," "blood-thirsty,"
                    "remorseless," "avaricious," "perfidious," and
                    "deceitful."</p>
            <p>Smith's speech might be dismissed as mere political invective had he not turned from his
                    attack on Polk to look to the future and to offer a solution to the problem of how to <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName>. Smith admitted, what Giddings had claimed for some time, that "the question
                    of slavery, in connexion with the territory of which we are seeking to despoil <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, cannot be avoided." Like Giddings, he believed the slavery question would
                    "admit of no compromise," but his idea of "no compromise"
                    differed radically from the notion of the tall spokesman for the Western Reserve. While Giddings
                    claimed that the North should rely on the Wilmot Proviso, a congressional measure to forbid slavery
                    in new territories, Smith, who consistently voted for the Proviso, desired to avoid the question of
                    new territories entirely. Afraid that a congressional debate on admitting new territories into the
                    Union would "come attended with a train of consequences more alarming than any which
                    attended the admission of Missouri into the Union," Smith offered a solution, saying,
                    "the only ground of safety—the only ground which will secure the peace and
                    harmony of the country—… is to keep the territory, with all the distracting
                    questions connected with it, out of the Union." Although he called it a "no
                    compromise" position, Smith had in fact offered middle ground between those forces who
                    would bring free territory into the Union through the Wilmot Proviso and those Southerners who
                    wanted additional slave territory. Neither side would lose if no new territory were annexed.</p>
            <p>Smith sat down to the approbation of his Whig colleagues who no doubt recognized the speech for what
                    it was—a partisan political attack designed to stimulate and to unite the Whig party for
                    the coming congressional and presidential elections. As in his first speech Smith offered no
                    constitutional argument against Polk's conduct, nor did he present the philosophical or
                    moral grounds on which he claimed the war was unjust. He preferred to engage in <hi rend="i">ad
                        hominem</hi> attacks against the President, whom he characterized as a
                    "despot" of "small mind" and "low cunning" who
                    engaged in "usurpation" and "imbecility." Even the apparently
                    genuine concern Smith evinced over the slavery question may have been an attempt to find in
                    rejecting any annexation common ground on which northern and southern Whigs could unite and thus
                    avoid the sectional division <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-069-2-014"/> which the Wilmot Proviso had rent

            <p>Although the Whigs of the Fourth District would not meet to select a congressional candidate until

                    … the wishes of the Whigs of this district," announced him as a candidate for
                    reelection. In March, Democrat William Dailey issued a challenge that he would "deliver
                    speeches upon the war question" at <placeName>

            <p>The Whig convention confirmed Smith as the party's congressional candidate, and the

                    Giddings that he was "in the field and canvassing the district in opposition to the

                    campaigned for antiwar Whig candidates in other states. The Democratic press in Robert

                    subject which "has been very ably and thoroughly discussed, not only at this session, but
                    during the last Congress," Smith chose to examine the cost of the war and the
                    war's effect on the national debt. As in his previous speeches, he asserted that he spoke
                    to reveal information which the government had attempted to withhold from the public. Using official
                    Treasury Department figures, Smith undoubtedly bored many of his colleagues by detailing federal
                    costs to the penny. He made the important point, however, that throughout the war the administration
                    had consistently underestimated expenses and overestimated revenues. In the 1846–1847
                    fiscal year a $19,000,000 error had been made. "Are we," Smith
                    wondered, "to attribute it to the errors of the Secretary of the Treasury ….
                    [or] has there been an attempt to cover up and conceal from the country the enormous expenses of the
                    war, and the alarming national debt it is creating?" Smith's arguments about the
                    dangers involved with being in debt would have had great influence with westerners who had recently
                    seen the unhappy effects of debt in their own states.</p>
            <p>In words which show the hazards of making political forecasts, Smith predicted that no peace treaty
                    would be signed until after the presidential election in November so that as much Mexican territory
                    as possible could be taken. Apparently he did not completely accept the peace rumors he had
                    mentioned in his letter to Pratt, and he had no way of knowing that the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
                    had been signed in <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName> the day before he rose to speak. Smith concluded with the plea he had made in his
                    second speech, that no Mexican territory be taken: "If we can succeed in wringing from the
                    distress and suffering of <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>, a cession of more of her territory, every foot which we thus acquire will prove a

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, the most significant question was whether the two militia companies should continue to
                    accept their separate status or attempt to be reincorporated into the established regiments.
                    Although the black leadership was divided over the issue, a majority including the Negro militia
                    officers favored reincorporation into the regimental structure. To this end, Captains Porter and
                    Buckner, along with other officers of their companies and Detective Thornton, held a series of
                    conferences with state Adjutant General James K. Gore, during which they emphasized their
                    dissatisfaction with the drawing of the color line in the national guard. With war probable, this
                    grievance acquired an urgency from the conviction of the Negro militiamen that they would stand
                    little chance of participating in the conflict unless they were attached to some regiment.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>On April 1, 1898, Governor James A. Mount, a Republican elected two years earlier, became directly
                    involved in the discussions between the black militiamen and the adjutant general's office.
                    He claimed that a personal investigation confirmed the wisdom of the action taken by his Democratic
                    predecessor in separating "the colored companies from the white regiments."
                    Furthermore, this action conformed to the practice of the <placeName>

                    representatives of the black militia companies that in the event of war their separate status would
                    operate to their advantage because it would insure the retention of their own officers. If they were
                    mustered into service as a part of a "mixed regiment," the War Department would

                            militiamen in "separate" companies on January 6, 1896, in deference to the
                            wishes of white troops, who objected to having black militia officers promoted to regimental
                            positions. When Captain John J. Buckner made an "indiscreet" attack on the
                            adjutant general in 1897 for refusing to re-incorporate the Negro militiamen into the
                            regimental structure, he was charged with insubordination and temporarily relieved of his
                            commission. See the <placeName>

                    regiments, Mount promised to work for a black battalion, in which Negroes might rise to the rank of
                    major. Mount emphasized, however, that if the black militiamen refused to accept their separate
                    status and to join him in an effort to raise a black battalion, they would have to be removed from
                    the national guard altogether.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    </placeName>, were inclined to accept the proposition of a black battalion, others indicated that
                    nothing less than a full regiment with a complete roster of black officers would compensate for
                    acquiescence in retaining the separate status. The source of greatest concern was the
                    governor's suggestion that the black militiamen might be mustered out of service. Advocates
                    of the plan to reineorporate the black companies into the white regiments now joined those who held
                    out for a "separate regiment" to oppose either of the alternatives put forward by
                    Mount. Quick to translate the controversy into partisan politics, black Democrats insisted that the
                    governor's references to the organization of a battalion were wholly specious. His
                    intention, they argued, was to deprive Negroes of an opportunity to serve their country on the same
                    terms as other citizens. The pro-Democratic <hi rend="i">World</hi> of <placeName>

                    out. If war came, Editor Manning declared, "not a Negro in the whole U. States should
                    volunteer to serve in it. If they can't go as citizens with full rights, they should not be

                    out of self respect or for some other reason, they notified the governor that their companies
                    desired to be mustered out. The adjutant general acted upon their request promptly.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    gathering heard a series of speakers deplore the plight of black citizens desirous of rendering
                    patriotic service to their country in a time of national crisis. John J. Blackshear, minister of the
                    Corinthian Baptist Church, interpreted the whole episode regarding the black militia companies as
                    evidence of "the growing race sentiment" in Indiana. Fully aware that the growth
                    of such sentiment was not easily thwarted, Blackshear insisted that the least the black citizens
                    could do was to protest specific acts of the governor. The "most radical" speaker
                    was Detective Thornton, who was bitter toward Governor Mount as the
                    "representative" of the Republican party. Although Chairman Lott had emphasized
                    that the purpose of the meeting was not "to denounce anybody" or "to make
                    political capital," several resolutions were passed condemning Mount for mustering the
                    black companies out of the militia.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> By the time war with <placeName>

            <p>With the official declaration of war and the issuance of President William McKinley's first
                    call for volunteers, black leaders were worried lest their seeming indifference be cited as
                    justification for disregarding the rights of Negro citizens. But as these leaders clearly
                    recognized, it was not merely a matter of having black men enlist in the volunteer service. The
                    President's call for volunteers stipulated that in filling their quotas states should give
                    preference to organized militia units. Since Negroes were no longer represented in the Indiana
                    militia, a movement was initiated to recruit an "independent colored regiment" of
                    volunteers whose services would be offered to the governor. Regardless of whether such a regiment
                    would be accepted, black spokesmen were convinced that its existence would help combat the notion
                    that Negroes were unpatriotic. Lott, Professor Willis Kersey, and Gabriel Jones, a black member of

                    purportedly reflected the sentiments of "the colored people of Indiana" regarding
                    the war. The letter stated: "The colored people of Indiana entertain the profoundest
                    sympathy for the oppressed and downtrodden Cubans, and feel that a war, having for its purpose their
                    emancipation, is a holy war. They desire to manifest their sympathy by taking as a race, an active

                            black regiment in addition to, rather than as a part of, the state's quota because
                            of the arrangement adopted in Indiana whereby volunteer units were allotted on the basis of
                            congressional districts. Raising a full regiment within the quota would have necessitated a
                            violation of this arrangement because of the concentration of the Negro population in one or
                            two congressional districts. As for the organization of the army, infantry regiments after
                            the outbreak of the war in 1898 were usually made up of three battalions of four companies
                            each, with the maximum strength of each company set at 106 men. A brigade included three or
                            more regiments; a division consisted of three brigades; and a corps embraced three or more
                            divisions. See <hi rend="i">Annual Reports of the War Department for the Fiscal Year Ended

            <p>Upon receipt of the secretary's telegram, Mount returned to the idea that he had promoted
                    earlier during the dispute over the Negro militia companies. He now requested authority to furnish
                    in addition to the state's quota a battalion rather than a regiment of black volunteers. He
                    advised Senator Fairbanks: "We must not fail in this." The governor's
                    plan called for a battalion of four companies with a complete roster of Negro officers, which would
                    be attached to one of the five so called "immune" regiments of black volunteers
                    recruited directly by the War Department without regard for state boundaries. The plan was presented
                    to Secretary Alger by Fairbanks, who was led to believe that the proposition met with the approval
                    of the War Department.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mount proceeded on the assumption that at least one black battalion would be allowed from Indiana.
                    After consulting various Negro leaders, he indicated that former militia captain Porter would be
                    commissioned major to command the unit. The governor also expressed the hope of ultimately
                    recruiting two black battalions "to give the colored people as much as it is possible to
                        secure."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> He suggested that two such battalions from Indiana might
                    be combined with the Ninth Ohio Battalion, a black unit already mustered into service, to form a
                    Negro regiment.30 Apparently convinced of the governor's good faith, Editor Knox of the <hi rend="i">Freeman</hi> warned Negroes against demanding more than could be obtained. In his view

                    suicidal because the end of segregation and discrimination would come only with a revolution in the
                    sentiment of the country as a whole. Too many demands while the nation faced a foreign enemy were,
                    in his view, likely to postpone rather than hasten such a revolution.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>During the first week in June, 1898, Mount's plan for a black battalion hit a snag in the
                    War Department. Disturbing news was first reported from <placeName>

                    </placeName> by a member of the governor's staff, Colonel Winfield T. Durbin, who learned
                    that the department intended to reduce the number of black companies to be furnished by Indiana from
                    four to two. Furthermore, the department planned to attach these companies to the Eighth Infantry, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Volunteers, one of the immune regiments in which Negroes were not allowed to hold
                    positions above the rank of lieutenant. Durbin learned that the matter rested entirely with Colonel
                    Eli L. Huggins, commander of the Eighth Infantry, who insisted that he could accept only two
                    companies "with white captains only."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> The prospect of being
                    allowed only two companies would have been sufficient in itself to dampen the enthusiasm of those
                    Negroes busily engaged in recruiting volunteers in Indiana, but the idea of white captains was a
                    source of outrage. The pro-Democratic <hi rend="i">World</hi> wondered how black voters in the North
                    would react to this "humiliating policy …. this contemptible policy of the
                    national [Republican] administration."<hi rend="sup">33</hi> One of the black Republican

                    regarding the same issue.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> In their appeal to the white House the Indiana
                    Republican leaders emphasized that the two companies in question would consist largely of
                    ex-militiamen who had performed creditably "in strikes and riots" and who were
                    "thoroughly drilled and experienced." Mount told the President: "It is
                    manifestly unjust to refuse colored captains to these companies. Our people feel that such
                    discrimination is unjust."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> The pressure brought by Mount and

                    </placeName>, was sufficient to obtain modification of the War Department's regulation
                    concerning black officers. When the two companies were authorized to retain their Negro captains,
                    the governor assured Fairbanks that his "good work" would be "of
                    inestimable benefit to our friends in Indiana."<hi rend="sup">38</hi> The exception made in
                    regard to Indiana made it difficult for the War Department to adhere in other cases to its earlier
                    policy regarding black officers. The precedent afforded governors of other states, including those

            <p>By mid-June, 1898, the problem regarding Indiana's black volunteers seemed to have been
                    resolved. Even so, state officials received no instructions from the War Department about the
                    enlistment of Negro recruits. Mount confided to Fairbanks his belief that these instructions were

                    consisted of one regiment and two companies of infantry. The two companies, of course, referred to
                    the black volunteers. Relieved that his black constituents would be represented in the volunteer
                    forces, the governor hastened to assure Senator Fairbanks: "You have achieved a splendid

                    immediately began a rigorous program of military training while awaiting muster into federal

                    recruits at least it was not so much a question of participating in a humanitarian cause as it was
                    of being paid. These recruits were under the misconception that they were members of the militia,
                    constituting a part of "the reorganized colored national guard companies," and
                    that as such they were entitled to pay as militiamen from the date of their enlistment until their
                    muster into federal service. They were greatly disappointed when Mount explained that they were not
                    in state service and that the only way the old militia companies "figured in" at
                    all was in persuading the War Department to accept Negro officers whose experience in the national

                    country but also to "make history" for their race. In the governor's
                    words the Negro troops were in a position to "add new luster to the act of the immortal
                    hero who emancipated your people …." He admonished: "Soldiers of the

                    Manning especially resented the idea that Negroes were on trial, and he pointed out that the role of
                    black men in every national crisis, from the Revolution through the Civil War, scarcely made them

                    were not actually absorbed into the regimental structure of the Eighth, however, but in an unusual
                    arrangement retained their identity as separate units. Their camp, known as Camp Capron, was

                    </placeName>, and the black volunteers were well aware that their presence was a source of
                    considerable concern among whites. They were constantly reminded by their officers and by visiting
                    dignitaries as well of the necessity "to be better men in every respect in order to receive

                    of the additional burden that their race placed upon them and attempted to avoid behavior which
                    could be cited in support of the claim by some whites that Negro soldiers were unruly and
                    insubordinate when commanded by Negro officers. The Indiana soldiers took especial pride in their
                    military bearing and in the proficiency they exhibited on the parade ground. They began to refer to
                    themselves as "The Indiana Invincibles."<hi rend="sup">56</hi>

                    far less moment than their conduct outside the camp, and good conduct was measured by the degree to
                    which the volunteers conformed to local racial mores. Experiences earlier in the year with black
                    soldiers of the regular army had aroused considerable hostility toward Negroes in uniform. Like the
                    black regulars, the volunteers showed little inclination to abide by the segregation practices in
                    saloons, cafes, and especially on the railroad between <placeName>

                    November when a volunteer from Indiana refused to leave his seat in a railway car reserved for
                    whites and "take one assigned to colored people." The incident created a stir in

                    "every instance of misconduct on the part of colored soldiers." He declared:

                    that the training of his own men precluded any serious breaches of discipline but claimed that the
                    same could not be said of the Indiana volunteers. "I have done what I could to discipline
                    these [Indiana] companies," he wrote the adjutant general, "but they had been

            <p>In October, 1898, Colonel Marion Maus, an inspection officer, visited the camp of the Indiana
                    companies and transmitted to the War Department a lengthy report. He complimented "the good
                    appearance" of the men and declared that "both companies appear to be as well
                    drilled as those of the 8th [Infantry]." Maus continued: "I found that as a rule
                    the officers could give commands fairly well and could drill companies." Despite such
                    compliments he recommended that the two companies be mustered out. To justify this recommendation
                    his report cited the "poor condition" of the company records which resulted from
                    the fact that all officers except Lieutenant James H. Thomas were "insufficiently educated
                    to hold commissions." Maus was particularly shocked to discover that neither of the
                    captains knew what constituted a government ration. He also indicated that like so many other
                    volunteer outfits, those from Indiana were inspired more by political than military considerations.
                    The Indiana companies, he had been told, "were organized by Senator Fairbanks." In
                    taking note of the racial factor Colonel Maus wrote: "I do not think it is for the best
                    interests of the service to have these two [Indiana] companies attached to the 8th Regiment. The
                    captains of that regiment are white and these are colored, and a distinction is thus made. I have
                    found that there was an objection …. There seemed to be a slight friction which, however,
                    was not pronounced." Even though Colonel Maus thought that the Indiana companies should be
                    mustered out, he nevertheless recommended "that such of the men that desire to remain in
                    service should be assigned to fill vacancies in the [immune] regiments," because they were
                    "good men as a rule and on account of their instruction would be most desirable to fill
                    vacancies in the regiments named." Notwithstanding these recommendations, <list type="footnotes">

                    cottage." He envisioned "a little shack" which he could use as a retreat

                    pool, softball diamond, and forty foot water tower. The grounds were landscaped and elaborate

            </p>
            <p>Ade did not remain constantly at Hazelden, of course. The business of publishing his books and
                    producing his plays and the pleasure of the company of friends elsewhere frequently drew him out of
                    rural Indiana. "You may acquire peace of mind by listening to the breeze in the
                    trees," he said, "but you will not get any man-size experiences out of botany. If
                    you wish to keep tab on the human race you must go, once in a while, to where the interesting
                    specimens are assembled."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Yet, because his hospitality was both homey
                    and expansive, it was not rare to find that the interesting specimens were assembled in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Ade took pleasure in seeing people enjoying his home, and Hazelden was often as far
                    from a quiet retreat as it was from a one horse farm. The neighbors became accustomed to walking
                    right in without knocking, and huge crowds of visitors regularly descended upon the place. Ade
                    hosted annual community parties, conventions of Sigma Chi, the fraternity he had joined while a
                    student at Purdue, a Fourth of July homecoming for soldiers and sailors in 1919, and political
                    wingdings of all sorts. William Howard Taft opened his campaign for the presidency with a rally at
                    Hazelden in 1908. Charles G. Dawes closed his campaign for the vice-presidency there in 1924. Almost
                    any event, even the opening of a segment of state road, could become an excuse for festivities at
                    George Ade's farm.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The following correspondence involving Ade, Richard Lieber the director of the Indiana Department of
                    Conservation, and Meredith Nicholson the well known author, diplomat, and journalist, concerns what
                    was to be the fate of Hazelden after Ade's death.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Ade offered to leave
                    the farm to the conservation department for use as a state park, but Lieber demurred, feeling that a
                    park "would be the unmaking of Hazelden and its memories." He suggested instead
                    that Ade provide for its preservation as a literary museum, which "would set aside your
                    home as a shrine and at the same time would permit the good friends and neighbors to come in and
                    enjoy a quiet day in the open."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Nothing definite came of this 1932
                    effort, but it indicates Ade's desire to have Hazelden's tradition of hospitality
                    continue in some form after his death. The correspondence also demonstrates that Lieber, who is so
                    completely identified with the state park idea, was also interested in the development of other
                    forms of public recreational and educational facilities and did not encourage the acquisition of
                    parks where he felt they would be inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Never entirely giving up the notion of leaving Hazelden to the state, but apparently unable to decide
                    precisely what to do with it, Ade left the question open in the will he wrote in 1934. Probated
                    after his death ten years later, the will directed that the house and its immediate environs be
                    turned over to a five man board of trustees who would have full power to dispose of the property.
                    Ade suggested that the trustees transfer the estate either to Purdue University, to the state
                    conservation department, or to an association or foundation which would undertake to manage it. He
                    did not bind the trustees to any of these suggestions,<hi rend="sup">6</hi> however, <list type="footnotes">

                    delayed the project even further.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Meanwhile, the estate fell into disrepair and
                    ruin. A threat to terminate the insurance on the house created sufficient interest so that in 1953
                    Governor George N. Craig appointed a twenty man board to study the Hazelden dilemma. When this board
                    was unable to devise a solution, the house and grounds were left to suffer neglect for nearly a

                    members of the association raised $20,000 by the fall of 1962 and began restoration.
                    Within a year the major repairs on the house were completed, though work still continues on the
                    building and its furnishings. Today, the Ade home is once again the scene of many social and
                    cultural events, including wedding receptions, parties, and meetings of local organizations such as

                                    Dear Colonel Lieber:</salute>
                        <p>I was sorry to learn from a letter written by your Secretary that you would not find
                                    it possible to be at our celebration of the opening of the road.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> For a little while I have had a rather heavy project on my mind. The other
                                    day I talked it over with Clarence Doland, your Manager at Clifty Falls, and he gave
                                    me some encouragement. Here is the whole situation and I will try to make it brief:
                                    I live here on a farm of about 430 acres. A small part north of the new State Road
                                    and another part east of my home grounds are occupied by the Hazelden Country Club,
                                    although the ground belongs to me and I have a large but undetermined equity in all
                                    the improvements. My home is in a grove of about ten acres with many wide open
                                    spaces for recreation grounds. South and west of my park there is some bottom land
                                    and also some beautiful upland, heavily wooded. To the south are the farm buildings.
                                    In my will, as it now stands, I am leaving the entire fram [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                                    to a corporation not yet formed, to be called THE GEORGE ADE FOUNDATION, the idea
                                    being to carry on an arrangement with the Hazelden Country Club and maintain my home
                                    and continue our policy of using the home grounds. What I would now like to do is
                                    this, divide the farm into three tracts, giving the farming section at the south to
                                    someone of my relatives, give the forty or fifty acres at the northeast
                                    unconditionally to the Hazelden Country Club <list type="footnotes">

                                    of Conservation, if it cares to accept it.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> As nearly as I can
                                    guess there would be in this tract between eighty and one hundred acres. Any of one
                                        [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] your viewers or surveyors could readily determine the
                                    extent of it. The buildings on this tract include my home, a large garage, a storage
                                    house, a green house, a caretakers house with comfortable outbuildings, a cow
                                    stable, an ice house, a large pavilion for assemblages or dances, probably 50x35
                                    feet, a row of dressing rooms and shower bath along side of the swimming pool. My
                                    suggestion would be to throw a fence from the north and south putting the pavilion
                                    and the swimming pool into the general public park and leave the other buildings in
                                    my home grounds and making the admission to them somewhat more restricted, although
                                    I would not be disposed to make the slightest suggestion as to what those
                                    restrictions should be. The land which I am offering as a public park gets its value
                                    because it is adjacent to my home grounds which have became quite well known. Only a
                                    week ago we had four thousand people here to celebrate the opening of the state
                                    road. Part of the park I am describing is on high ground, suitable for camping, part
                                    ranges off into low lands toward the river and there is one dip in the ground
                                    between the north and south end but these low lands are wet only for a few weeks in
                                    the year and it might be that eventually you would want to connect up the whole
                                    thing with the river and make an interesting artificial lake of the low land.</p>
                        <p>I want to turn the whole tract over to the state so I will know it will be properly
                                    cared for. If it is something that the state can use I will be glad to learn the
                                    facts in the case. One thing is certain, we are giving them the beautiful home tract
                                    with a number of buildings and a very attractive setting. The state park would be
                                    entirely distinct from the Hazelden Country Club but the privileges of the Hazelden
                                    Country Club would be available to all visitors to the state park at a very
                                    reasonable rate, those who used the club could find food at the club house. If you

                                    Dear Mr. Ade:—</salute>
                        <p>I read with very great interest your letter of October 16th. Last week Governor
                                    [Harry G.] Leslie spoke to me about the same matter. Of course I regretted my
                                    inability to be present at the celebration of the opening of the road. The occasion
                                    would have incidently [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] furnished me with a better
                                    understanding of your property.</p>
                        <p>Off hand I should say Hazelden will not make a state park for I fear it would be the
                                    unmaking of Hazelden and its memories, but I hope to be able to submit to you a
                                    better idea to work out your own intentions. You see besides state parks we have a
                                    number of state memorials, such as the [James F. D.] Lanier Home, the Old State
                                    House, the Pigeon Roost Monument, the Nancy Hanks <placeName>

                                    Memorial coming in. Indiana has literary memories, not to speak of the present, and
                                    it is my hope to work out with you and such other friends as you may designate, a
                                    plan to have the George Ade Foundation prepare and maintain a literary museum at
                                    Hazelden. This would set aside your home as a shrine and at the same time would

                        <p>Only a brief note to tell you confidentially that George Ade wishes to turn over his
                                    delightful property to the State for public use. He thought of a state park. I
                                    disagree with him and think that we ought to make Hazelden into a Hoosier literary
                                    museum.</p>
                        <p>The thing is only in my mind and has not yet assumed any shape. What would be your
                                    reaction? Do you think the thought is worthwhile and how would you suggest to
                                    proceed, it being understood that the State would take possession, put the house in
                                    a condition of safety from fire and make a sort of an Apollo Club out of it with all
                                    members dead or absent.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                        <p>I wrote George I would come up sometime this week and talk things over with him.
                                    Kindly keep the matter to yourself until we have a chance to formulate plans.</p>

            <head>Irregularity of IMH Mailings, 1933 and 1973</head>
            <p>"The <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> is published quarterly by Indiana
                    University, the numbers being issued as of March, June, September, and December. The <hi rend="i">Editor</hi> is a regular member of the history department of the University… . Each
                    issue should be ready to mail by the end of the month in which it is scheduled to appear.
                    Unavoidable delays frequently occur, however, and issues sometimes appear from four to six weeks
                    late. Individual subscribers and libraries can count on receiving copies of the March issue by the
                    end of April, of the June number by the end of July, of the September number by the end of October
                    and of the December number by the first of January. That is, we are quite regular in our
                    irregularity, from which we derive some consolation, and trust that our readers may also be able to
                    extract comfort from the fact that they can predict with a fair degree of accuracy the date when any
                    issue is likely to be received."</p>
            <p>The above paragraph first appeared in the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> in June,
                    1933, during the editorship of Professor William O. Lynch. The present staff, in its zealous
                    exertions to make the irregularity of the magazine somewhat less regular, has taken steps to make
                    delayed mailings somewhat less common than those experienced by Editor Lynch. Ideally, subscribers
                    will receive numbers during the month for which they are dated, and the editor would be glad to be
                    informed whenever such is not the case. Meanwhile, the staff has derived much consolation and
                    extracted no little comfort from the realization that the frustrations of importunate deadlines and
                    the vicissitudes of a capricious mail service are not peculiar to the current generation.</p>

                    spiritual atmosphere the outsider can detect something of the vision, the conflict, and perhaps even
                    the eccentricity that were part of the effort by Robert Owen to establish an intellectual oasis in
                    the Indiana backwoods.</p>
            <p>In so well endowed a setting, it should not have been expected that the observance of the bicentenary
                    of Owen's birth would be attended with the fol-de-rol and hoopla that often accompany
                    "historical" festivals. Directed by Professor Donald E. Pitzer of Indiana State

                    </placeName> on October 15 and 16, 1971, were evidently determined that the event should reflect
                    something of Owen's own dedication to intellectualism. They were successful. In the words
                    of one of the participants in the conference, Owen was not merely commemorated, he was reconsidered
                    (p. 71).</p>
            <p>The approachable but very perceptive address by former Governor Roger D. Branigin,
                    "presented not as history but rather as the remarks of a friendly observer" (p.
                    14), was an excellent prelude to the presentation of four scholarly papers which attempted to place
                    Owen in the context of his period. In "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World
                    in America," John F. C. Harrison of the University of <placeName>

                    "the foremost contemporary historian of Robert Owen and the Owenite tradition" (p.
                    29), discuses <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-069-2-065"/> Owen's approach to the problems of his
                    time, with emphasis on the origins and significance of the concepts of community and education
                    through which he sought to bring about his envisioned new state of society. The other
                    papers—"Robert Owen and the Millenialist Tradition" by Robert G. Clouse

            <p>Uncontaminated by irrelevant anecdotes of misfits in the wilderness or the sly intimations of sexual
                    misconduct which characterize so much of the writing on the Owenite movement, these papers are not
                    light reading, nor could their content have been easily absorbed aurally. That the conferees were
                    equal to the task is demonstrated in the panel discussion which is produced <hi rend="i">almost</hi>
                    verbatim in this volume. The papers are real contributions to Owenite scholarship. Those who
                    arranged their presentation and now their preservation in published form are to be commended.</p>

            <p>Paul Fatout's book on Hoosier canals is the first modern work dealing with the subject at
                    length, and it will be welcomed by students of Indiana history and transportation. The author
                    provides a narrative account of Indiana's canal era, beginning with the agitation for a
                    canal around the falls of the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early nineteenth century and continuing through the efforts to construct the
                    mammoth internal improvements system of the 1830s, the actual completion of the Wabash and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Canal and parts of the Central and Whitewater canals, and, finally, the abandonment of
                    the remnants of the system by about the 1870s.</p>
            <p>The author's forte is his writing style. Fatout is an excellent <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-069-2-066"/> storyteller with a remarkable talent for involving the reader in his
                    subject and recapturing the spirit of the past. His obvious fascination with and love for Indiana
                    and its great canal adventures shine through every page. However, the book has weaknesses which will
                    frustrate the serious student. The footnoting style, while perhaps fashionable, is extremely
                    irritating. There is absolutely nothing in the text to indicate when, where, or if a statement is
                    footnoted. All of the notes are included in a section at the end of the book and are not numbered in
                    any way. Instead, they are listed under page references and identified through inclusion of
                    fragments of the sentences they are supposed to document or explain. This format does nothing to
                    ease the task of the reader.</p>
            <p>Beyond the peculiar style of footnoting, the documentation itself is exasperating. Explanatory
                    footnotes and documentation of small matters abound, but sweeping statements and specific
                    statistical information with absolutely no reference to the materials consulted are omnipresent.
                    There are many statements in this book which are certainly open to question, and the author would
                    have better served both himself and his readers by providing adequate evidence of the sources behind
                    his reasoning.</p>
            <p>Fatout's bibliography and footnotes indicate that he apparently did consult a large and
                    varied body of material. However, he depended most heavily upon contemporary newspapers and state
                    legislative journals. He lists a number of primary sources in the Indiana State Library and other
                    collections, but his narrative and citations do not indicate that he has done an exhaustive job of
                    research in many of them, particularly the records of the Wabash and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Canal in the Archives Division of the Indiana State Library.</p>
            <p>Finally, the author does not seriously attempt to fit the Indiana internal improvements picture into
                    the national or regional scene or to assess fully its economic impact on the state. <hi rend="i">Indiana Canals</hi> is a readable book, handsomely designed and produced, and it provides a
                    pleasant introduction into the Indiana canal era. It cannot, however, be regarded as the definitive
                    work on the subject.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Kentucky Rifle.</hi> By Merrill Lindsay. Photographs by Bruce Pendleton. (York,
                    Pa.: The Historical Society of York County, 1972. Pp. [100]. Illustrations. $15.00.)</head>
            <p>The name "Kentucky rifle" is intrinsically such a misnomer that even omnivorous
                    Kentuckians who stand ready on the glimmer of a legend to claim all things realize the rifle
                    originated elsewhere. Merrill Lindsay, the author of this book, is somewhat less than clear in his
                    explanation of the origin of the name "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>," except to say Kentucky frontiersmen bought their guns in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>. He all but implies a connection between the name of the gun and the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and between the gun and Samuel Woodworth's famous ballad, "The
                    Hunters of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>." Drawing a fine line of distinction between a true "Kentucky
                    rifle" in the classic sense and the common mountaineer's "hog
                    rifle," Lindsay no doubt is correct in saying that few Kentucky rifles were made in that
                    state. There were, however, some local gunsmiths. There is a thesis in the University of Kentucky
                    graduate collection which gives at least some of the history of the state's gunsmiths.</p>
            <p>Lindsay has divided the gun types of Kentucky rifles into the products of "schools"
                    which are defined in terms of local places in Pennsylvania and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> where gunsmiths gave their products distinctive trim and form. There can be no question
                    that the author has assembled a fine representative sampling of the handiwork of "the more
                    creative gunsmiths of the 18th and 19th centuries." He has traced European influences as
                    they were merged with American modifications and innovations.</p>
            <p>The superb photographic exhibits illustrating this book clearly detail the Kentucky rifle's
                    characteristics and varying types. The succinct paragraphs describing the individual illustrations
                    collectively comprise a technical history of Pennsylvania gunmaking. Generally there are some common
                    features of the rifle, no matter to which school the maker belonged, which show considerable
                    conformity. These were long barrels, usually rifled, long and graceful stocks which extended forward
                    into graceful barrel and lock cradles. Most of the stocks were made from magnificent bolts of crotch
                    walnut or tiger maple and were carved with a considerable <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-069-2-068"/>
                    variety of graceful designs and figures. There were cheek pieces or rests, butts were brass bound,
                    patch boxes were elaborate brass utilities as well as ornamentations, and there were frequently
                    handsome cheek piece metal plates. The flint or breech mechanism differed in design from maker to
                    maker, but not in fundamental principles. This was also true of the trigger and guard mechanism.</p>
            <p>The brass and silver trimmings placed on the Kentucky rifles by the Pennsylvania and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName> gunsmiths, including the elaborate stock carvings, have a strong flavor of American
                    folk adaptations of old world rococo design and motif. Occasionally a silver plate reflected the
                    spirit of American nationalism by use of the spread eagle, even though the eagles' heads
                    were more often <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> or Austrian in character. Some adornments reflected the American passion for hunting in
                    the use of animal figures.</p>
            <p>A section of the book is devoted to the "Kentucky pistol." These graceful elbow
                    shaped weapons were as intricately carved and filigreed as were the rifles themselves. In fact they
                    seem almost hand varieties of the long guns.</p>
            <p>This is a well conceived book which gives in precise detail the background of muzzleloading flintlock
                    rifle history. It grew out of the labors of Joe Kindig, Jr., who sought to draw together an exhibit
                    of the finest specimens of rifles made between 1760 and 1860 but who died before the exhibit was
                    completed in the York County Historical Museum. The photographs are so excellently done that the
                    reader loses all sense that he is looking at instruments of death and destruction, but he can rather
                    see them as superb folk artistic creations which formed a bridge between old world and American
                    frontier cultures. In dealing with both the precisions and subtleties of writing about guns, Lindsay
                    has demonstrated in his text a high degree of technical confidence growing out of good scholarship.
                    This book surely must meet even the most hypercritical approval of the confirmed gun collector and
                    student. The gun is presented here as a firearm and not as an instrument influencing the spread of
                    population or as the deciding factor in military conflict.</p>

            <p>"Heaven is a Kentucky of a place!" said one frontier preacher, but few of the early
                    inhabitants were angelic. It was the urge for land which inspired men to migrate to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, and according to Professor Watlington land questions divided them into political
                    parties, two at first, then three. Those who study other states would do well to imitate her careful
                    examination of land matters, for land was the basis of prosperity and status on every frontier.</p>
            <p>Virginians, especially the county surveyors and later the legal guild, formed an "articulate
                    center in a diverse society" (p. 43) and thought themselves the proper leaders of the
                    district. They were opposed by non-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s and the landless in general who felt cheated by <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s land policy, particularly the act of 1779. Termed
                    "partisans" by their betters, the latter group formed a self conscious opposition
                    seeking support from the Continental Congress and a general reallocation of land.</p>
            <p>In 1783–1784 the nature of the dispute changed sharply as land questions faded after <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>'s claims were upheld. The center divided. A "court party" of
                    judges and lawyers, centering about the notorious James Wilkinson, favored commercial development
                    and separation from Virginia while secretly dealing with Spanish officials at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The surveyors, now a "country party" of large landowners, also came
                    to favor separation, but only through orderly legal procedures giving full protection to their land.
                    By 1786 everyone had shifted positions, with the partisans now active against a separation that
                    their enemies would control.</p>
            <p>The shifting fortunes of these three parties are explained as fully as the sources permit, but much
                    remains vague, particularly the reasons for a marked lack of popular interest in politics.
                    Watlington shows that the Spanish Conspiracy was far wider and more important than most scholars
                    believe. By 1787 the country party, led by the Marshall family, prevailed and finally achieved
                    statehood in 1792 under a court <pb n="162" id="VAA4025-069-2-070"/> and country constitution. Their
                    rivalry continued for many years, with most federal appointments going to court men who in time
                    became Republicans, while the country party turned Federalist.</p>
            <p>The author skillfully defends her use of "party," rightly anticipating the
                    criticism she has received. Her usage seems legitimate enough, for the word was certainly often
                    employed in the controversies she so carefully elucidates. She knows well that "politics in
                    Kentucky was largely a matter of personal friendships and antipathies" (p. 156), frequently
                    involving the quarrelsome Humphrey Marshall, although these relationships were at times obscured.
                    Perhaps if she had used the phrase "court interest" in the eighteenth century
                    British fashion, those who worry so over "party" would study more carefully the
                    valuable substance of this work, which is based solidly on painstaking examination of scattered and
                    sometimes sparse sources. They should also heed her warning that Kentucky attitudes simply do not
                    fit the liberal and conservative categories cherished by so many observers of the frontier. Kentucky
                    politics, Watlington concludes, were never conventional—or as Judge Mulligan put it so
                    long ago:</p>

            <p>In this second volume of <hi rend="i">The Missouri Sesquicentennial History,</hi> a five volume
                    series being published in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s statehood, Professor Perry McCandless traces the story of Missouri and its
                    people through the formative years between statehood and the Civil War. The author has developed a
                    concise and sound synthesis based on extensive research in both primary and secondary sources, and
                    the result is a well balanced history <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-069-2-071"/> that describes and
                    analyzes the social, political, and economic growth of the state. Because the format of the series
                    calls for a general survey of each chronological period rather than a highly detailed study,
                    footnotes have been limited to explanatory matters.</p>
            <p>McCandless is at his best when dealing with political history. Effectively using the career and
                    personality of Thomas Hart Benton to connect <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s history with that of the nation, he details the state's political
                    development and the role it played in both regional and national history. Benton looms as a giant on
                    both the state and national levels, and a thorough and sound knowledge of his life permits
                    McCandless to write a masterful account of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s place in national politics during the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
            <p>The treatment of social and cultural history in this study does not measure up to the standards of
                    the discussion of politics. For example, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> culture in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>, especially as regards <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> newspapers and the theater, could have been more thoroughly analyzed. There are also
                    weaknesses in the handling of religious history, where, for one thing, McCandless inaccurately
                    states that the cooperative Plan of Union between the Presbyterians and the Congregationalists in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> "was discarded" in 1840 (p. 209). Actually, the Plan of Union
                    continued until 1857 when the New School Presbyterian Church split over slavery. On the other hand,
                    McCandless' discussion of education in Missouri is both complete and accurate.</p>
            <p>McCandless focuses his volume primarily on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>'s involvement in the sectional issues which ultimately led to civil war. In
                    1820, when Missouri was at the center of the rising sectional controversy, he finds a homogeneous
                    people "united in their demands for statehood without restriction on slavery." In
                    1860, McCandless sees <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> "torn internally" by the sectional issues involving slavery in the
                    nation. He considers that the primary reason for this change was the growth of cultural diversity, a
                    result of immigration from Europe and migration from the North which brought diversification of the
                    economy and new ideas that challenged the social system of the old sectional ties (pp. ix, 289).</p>

                    delineates the advantages and importance of the state's key geographical location as the
                    gateway to the Far West. Its unique geographical position determined that Missouri would play a
                    significant role in both southern and western history.</p>
            <p>As represented by this volume, <hi rend="i">The Missouri Sesquicentennial History</hi> is a useful

            <p>It has been fifty years since anyone undertook to write a comprehensive history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. In that sense Robert Howard's book was long overdue, but it was worth the
                    wait. <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> State</hi> ranks as the definitive account of an important subject in American
                    state and local history and as a model of the state history genre.</p>
            <p>The author, a veteran journalist and resident of the state capital in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, exercised both head and heart in a task that took more than six years. His twenty-five
                    page bibliography reflects exhaustive knowledge of the published literature, and his narrative
                    incorporates the most recent findings and interpretations. At the same time, Howard was motivated by
                    "a deep affection for the state and its people" (p. xxiv) acquired during a full
                    career of travel and work throughout the state. That attachment is evident in his attention to
                    colorful details and personalities in the story but not in his assessments, which are honest and
                    critical.</p>
            <p>Howard refrains from any grand design or majestic themes; three hundred years of history and the
                    lives of millions of citizens are not susceptible to such simple generalization. Neither does he
                    advance many fresh or revisionist interpretations; this book necessarily rests upon the published
                    monographs and specialized studies of other historians. <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-069-2-073"/> Rather,
                    he chronicles in rich detail the historical development of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, noting in the text or footnotes those instances in which he has waded through an
                    historian's controversy or incorporated the findings and judgments of recent scholarship.</p>
            <p>A dilemma to historians of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, just as to state politicians, is the division between Cook County and downstate. It is
                    tempting and sometimes appropriate to treat such a subject independently, but Howard chose the more
                    difficult job of interrelating it into the complex political and economic history of the entire
                    state. He is at his best dealing with those topics which were central to his work as a legislative
                    correspondent: political, constitutional, and institutional history. He also devotes generous
                    attention to railroads, internal improvements, banking, industry, and other economic matters. There
                    is interesting information on such diverse subjects as slavery, the early moviemaking industry in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, pioneer aviation and automobile manufacturing, world's fairs, gangsterism
                    after World War I, coal mining and union strife, and the home front during World War II.</p>
            <p>There are a few disappointing lapses and omissions in this comprehensive story. State parks and the
                    park system are neglected, as is that colorful institution, the Illinois State Fair. The reader
                    looks in vain for references to Frank Lloyd Wright, Robert M. Hutchins, John Dewey, or R.
                    Buckminster Fuller, who made significant contributions and international reputations while living in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. While Howard does discuss major Illinois poets and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s literary renaissance, he fails to cover the lives and works of novelists who
                    wrote about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Theodore Dreiser, Frank Norris, and Sherwood Anderson.</p>
            <p>Similarly but less important, the index contains errors and inconsistencies, chiefly in the form of
                    omissions and failures to cross index proper names and subject headings. There are some useful maps,
                    but the cartographer apparently was not interested in the past century of Illinois history; the
                    final map traces the extent of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Fire of 1871. Future editions of the book would be improved by the addition of maps
                    portraying such transportation networks as the interurbans of the early 1900s, modern day railroad
                    lines, and the interstate highway system and also by representations <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-069-2-074"/> of the state park system and historical shifts in population density.
                    However, the illustrations, tables, chronology, and bibliography are of excellent quality and help
                    make this book a useful reference work as well as outstanding history.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School architects. He relates simply and in an intact context that rather complex and
                    scattered style of building often confused with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> School. The author describes the difference between the two schools and documents his
                    findings to clarify the distinctions and characteristics of each style, putting each in its proper
                    time and place.</p>
            <p>While establishing this difference in the reader's mind, the author identifies the link
                    between the two schools as Louis H. Sullivan, the only architect involved in both. In fact, Brooks
                    further honors him, as did Frank Lloyd Wright, as "the Master," since the work of

                    students. The author enumerates the architects of the <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> School thus clearly defined, the interaction between the architects and the existing
                    social environment is illuminated, bringing into clearer focus the meaning and rationale of the
                    resultant buildings.</p>

                    reinforcing the data presented in the text, and supplemental footnotes provide information to those
                    readers interested in further research. At times the prose seems highly technical, but it reflects

                    study.</p>
            <p>This book is published at a time when demolition, the plague of all historical periods, threatens or
                    has already struck many of the buildings described, and the information presented will be a timeless

                    $12.00.)</head>
            <p>Thelen's highly original study captures the spirit of early progressivism better than any
                    other historian this reviewer has read. He describes and explains the Wisconsin reformers'
                    sense of anger at "corporate arrogance" with such conviction that at times it is
                    not possible to separate the views of the author from those of his subjects. Where the Gilded Age
                    mugwump had hoped to reform society by altering the individual through education and moral suasion,
                    the progressive held "special interests" responsible for many social ills and
                    urged their control by concerted political action. The early progressives' "major
                    accomplishment was the creation of a yardstick—`the public
                    interest'—that provided the thrust to Wisconsin progressivism as it united
                    diverse groups against selfish and special interests in their communities… . The
                    significant point about the concept of the public interest was that it created a new mass politics
                    that united men as consumers and taxpayers in opposition to the <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-069-2-076"/>
                    old politics that was based on ethnic and producer identities" (p. 308).</p>
            <p>Thelen recalls the historian's attention from class and psychological analysis to the
                    significance of events in creating social movements—in this case, convincingly
                    demonstrating the catalytic effect of the panic and ensuing depression of 1893–1897
                    following a decade of explosive urban and industrial development. He also reminds the reader that
                    the state or national leaders of such movements often reap a harvest already planted and cultivated
                    by others at the local or regional level. In this case John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Municipal League, John Bardon and the Ashland Civic Federation, and Richard T. Ely of
                    the University of Wisconsin sowed the seeds of the new progressivism for the better part of a decade
                    before Robert M. La Follette gathered in their sheaves to become the state's best known
                    political reformer.</p>
            <p>Thelen, however, pays for working primarily within the progressive tradition and concentrating so
                    much upon events. He needs at times to step outside the progressives' categories and beyond
                    the traditional ways of using newspapers to identify clearly those elements of the population most
                    susceptible to progressivism and to explain adequately the opposition to reform. If the early
                    progressives truly unified "men from all classes as consumers, taxpayers, and
                    citizens" and "combined workers and businessmen, foreign-born and native-born,
                    Populists and Republicans, drinkers and abstainers, Catholics and Protestants," then who
                    formed that narrow majority which turned back the progressives at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
                    </placeName> polls in the crucial 1900 election (p. 288)? Were there no important constituent
                    differences between Populists, Democrats, and progressives? To be convinced, one requires more
                    evidence than the reformers' hopes or claims that they appealed to a cross section of the
                    urban population. One needs to know, furthermore, much more about the vast rural areas of the state,
                    some of which provided La Follette's rather important early political base and without
                    which progressivism might not have made a lasting impact upon state politics. Thelen's
                    desire to avoid a producer oriented analysis has also led to some analytical sloppiness, as when he
                    describes both petit bourgeois craftsmen and factory laborers as "workers" <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-069-2-077"/> and corner druggists and international traders as
                    "businessmen." His expert presentation of the Wisconsin progressive's
                    vision does not still those persistent questions about the material, class, and social conditions
                    which lay beneath reform, but Thelen has placed them in a significantly new perspective.</p>

                    1780–1910.</hi> By H. Shelton Smith. (Durham: Duke University Press, 1972. Pp. x, 318.
                    Notes, index. $8.50.)</head>
            <p>Our nation has been full of white racism from the start; blacks have been counted as inferior and
                    degrading, even if useful. Thomas Jefferson wanted blacks out of slavery but also out of the
                    country. Patrick Henry could lament the slavery of Negroes but be "drawn along by ye
                    general inconvenience of living without them" (p. 23).</p>
            <p>Our nation's churches also have been full of white racism. There were a few crusaders
                    against slavery; a Woolman, O'Kelly, or Bourne could pay a high price to sharpen
                    sensibilities. However, most church members managed to reconcile black servitude with Christianity.
                    If they became at all uneasy within their inherited institutions, they were ready with an arsenal of
                    biblical texts and social myths to put down any assaults of conscience. Perhaps the marvel is that
                    racism could predominate but never quite take unquestioned rule. Some small base for appeal and for
                    correction was always preserved among the churches, black and white. It was a base to be well used
                    in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Professor H. Shelton Smith limits his topic clearly. He intends to tell the story of racism in
                    southern churches 1780–1910. The book turns out to be a superior one. After forty years
                    as a teacher of American church history, Smith moves easily among the sources. A novice in the field
                    may pant a little at Smith's pace but will appreciate his economy which wastes no words.
                    The graduate scholar will find the documentation respectable and conveniently placed. It is useful
                    to read this monograph with a Bible at hand. The title itself <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-069-2-078"/>
                    is based upon Genesis 1:27; certain biblical texts were keystones of the southern case.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there is retrospective humor in the account. Here are otherwise sensible men solemnly
                    inferring God's blessing on racism from the account of Shem, Ham, and Japheth in Genesis 9
                    or from some strange interweaving of Leviticus 25:44–46 with a generous measure of self
                    interest. In the main it is a tragic story with a few heroes but almost no characters capable of
                    transcending their own time and place to advocate genuine freedom. No denomination in the American
                    South has a good record on racism; even the Quakers came to conviction late and at great cost. The
                    uniformity of white supremacy notions is depressing. The abolitionists themselves were often stoutly
                    racist.</p>
            <p>Racism was the crucial social issue of Smith's chosen period. The alliance of churches with
                    anti-Negro forces assured that the racist issues would not be fairly met or settled. Churches
                    supported the Confederacy in order to preserve the institution of slavery. After the war the
                    churches helped fashion patterns of white supremacy to keep the black "in his
                    place." So the wound of racism was passed along to newer generations, constantly bruised
                    but never healed.</p>

            <p>Some historians have recently observed, with scant effort to conceal their indignation, that
                    virtually all current projects to publish the papers of great Americans serve to perpetuate an
                    elitist and hence inadequate version of history. These published collections, critics point out,
                    exclude such numerically significant groups as the poor and ethnic minorities <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-069-2-079"/> as well as the vast and otherwise undefined mass of American humanity
                    now modishly designated as "the inarticulate." Thus is our understanding of the
                    past rendered faulty and incomplete and the historical role of the majority unacknowledged as well
                    as uncommemorated.</p>
            <p>Publication of the Booker T. Washington papers should help satisfy these objections. Not that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> himself in his palmy days was clearly excluded from the elite! A magisterial figure,
                    despite his humble origin and black complexion, he eventually enjoyed greater power on the national
                    scene than almost any of his white southern contemporaries. Indeed, if the present collection were
                    confined solely to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own writings, one would have ground for consigning the enterprise to the
                    same "elitist" category to which critics contend practically all the other
                    projects now supported by the National Historical Publications Commission belong. But such
                    categorization is not in this instance appropriate; for the editors have adopted an extended
                    selective principle that allows them to include not only letters from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s own hand but also letters addressed to him and a variety of other documents
                    related to his life and work. Thus there is presented an array of items emanating not so much from
                    establishment figures as from obscure blacks and others who hitherto have scarcely been represented
                    at all in published documentary collections. It need hardly be pointed out that the recovery of such
                    material should prove of inestimable utility in expanding awareness of the character, activity, and
                    aspirations of persons until now all but lost to formal history.</p>
            <p>While republication of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s full scale autobiographies and of his autobiographical articles as volume
                    one of the series is appropriate and welcome, it is the second volume, comprising the initial
                    installment of his manuscripts, that constitutes the major achievement. As would be expected of a
                    man born in slavery, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s early years are sparsely documented. Yet the editors resourcefully located
                    census records to confirm early traces of his existence; and to chart his emergence from utter
                    anonymity, they uncovered such sobering information as the fact that at the age of five this future
                    adviser of presidents was valued in the inventory of his master's estate as worth
                    $400. Sixteen fat hogs on the same occasion were worth $128. While much in the
                    collection <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-069-2-080"/> concerns life at Hampton Institute when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> studied and taught there, the focus naturally is on the founding and first years of
                    Tuskegee Institute, the period when <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> constructed the base on which his later power and eminence rested. But even here the
                    importance of the material lies less in tracing a great man's early achievements than in
                    documenting the activities of hitherto faceless people engaged in momentous efforts of self
                    improvement at a critical time and an inauspicious place.</p>
            <p>Readers with varying interests can find much of value in these publications. They may also be
                    persuaded that those who assert the wisdom of according greater attention to the seldom acknowledged
                    molders of our past are not merely captious in their critiques and proposals.</p>

            <p>Despite the somewhat innocuous title, Professor Fuller has written an exceptionally good and long
                    needed account of the American postal service from its colonial beginnings through the Postal
                    Reorganization Act of 1970. The work is immeasurably enhanced by the author's ability to
                    weave postal history into the broader fabric of the American past. His descriptions of the
                    relationship between the postal revisions of Queen Anne's Act and the later Stamp Act
                    controversy, the effect of Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s improved postal service on the solidarity of the colonies during the 1760s,
                    the appalling financial condition and the growth of postal service during the heyday of
                    Jacksonianism, the emerging struggles between rural and urban America, and the overriding issue of
                    whether the postal service should pay for itself are cases in point. In all of these areas Fuller
                    outlines the problems and draws the necessary implications. There are, in addition, several
                    chapters—"Bond of Union," "Expansionism and the Post
                    Office," and "Government Business vs. Private Business—which <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-069-2-081"/> are well organized and serve to tie together the chronological
                    development of the story.</p>
            <p>As Fuller demonstrates throughout his book, the Post Office was inevitably drawn into national
                    controversies. Worthy of special notice are his remarks concerning slave mail carriers and the
                    southern fear of slave conspiracy. Fuller dates the closing of the southern mind on the slavery
                    question as early as 1802, when concern was expressed that allowing Negroes to carry the mail would
                    afford an opportunity "of associating, acquiring, and communicating sentiments, and of
                    establishing a chain or line of intelligence" that would encourage insurrection (p. 90).
                    Then, too, as the author explains, southern opinion was solidified before the Civil War partly
                    because of the expansion of the mail service into the backcountry. Just as the mail facilitated the
                    spread of abolitionist literature in the North and West, so the extension of mail service into the
                    Southwest during the 1850s provided a greater audience for the southern newspapers and fiery
                    pamphlets which helped to build the imposing edifice of southern nationalism and sentiment.</p>
            <p>Fuller is at his best when discussing the relationship of the postal service to the free enterprise
                    system. In an era of vocal dedication to laissez faire, Congress chose to pursue a
                    "socialistic experiment" in government owned business while at the same time,
                    almost as an apology for that decision, allowing the growing railroad monopolies to gouge the public
                    with excessive charges for mail transportation. Never could it be claimed that the government was
                    competing with the business community in an economic venture. The author also relates a fascinating
                    history of the franking privilege, the businessman's discovery of second class postal laws,
                    the impact of postal laws on the paperback book industry, and the development of rural free
                    delivery.</p>
            <p>Fuller's work would have benefited from an effort to provide more comparative history.
                    Although he begins the book with a brief survey of the development of mail services from the time of
                    the Persians and Romans, he tends in later chapters to describe the American postal system too much
                    in a vacuum. If, as he suggests, the postal system cut broad swaths through American politics, then
                    surely a remark or two concerning postal systems in other nations in the nineteenth <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-069-2-082"/> century might have added strength and validity to his thesis. Then,
                    too, the author provided only a minimum coverage of the Confederate postal service. Fuller might
                    also have investigated more fully the development of the postal savings banks, and there is an
                    interesting history yet to be written on the relationship between the mail and Populism, northern
                    philanthropy, and black history in the late nineteenth century. These criticisms, however, are only
                    incidental and do not detract from an excellent study of the American mail.</p>

            <p>The outbreak of World War I in Europe was a signal for the formation of a large number of
                    citizens' groups in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, each designed to further some specific set of national goals. Each group devised an
                    impressive letterhead stationery, printed on it a list of distinguished names to give their
                    principles added weight, and set out to agitate for armed neutrality, a league to enforce peace,
                    some form or another of "patriotism," or one kind or another of
                    "pacifism."</p>
            <p>Professor Clifford has written the story of one of those organizations, the volunteer training camp
                    movement which advocated preparedness, military training for all able bodied men, and the careful
                    professional training of a non-political officer corps. The movement had its origins in a series of
                    college training camps which were started even before the European war began. A group of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> graduates, well to do and of the "best sort," developed that idea
                    into the famous and well publicized Plattsburg, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, training camp for businessmen in the summer of 1915. From that time onward, the task
                    of this group was to further the "Plattsburg idea," both through ceaseless and
                    ever expanding organization and publicity and through their considerable influence within the War
                    Department and Congress. They started <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-069-2-083"/> camps all over the
                    country and set up local committees to recruit and publicize, they influenced federal legislation on
                    defense policy starting with the Defense Act of 1916, and they became so proficient and
                    indispensible that by the end of the war they actually occupied a quasi-official position as
                    recruiters for officer training. In all their efforts the Plattsburgers were led and guided by a
                    remarkable young lawyer from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Grenville Clark, who emerges from this study as a man of talent, good sense,
                    organizational ability, and reformist zeal.</p>
            <p>Some will complain that the story is too narrowly conceived—that Clifford does not deal as
                    fully, for example, with the opposition to the Plattsburgers as he does with the inner clique
                    itself. But on the whole, the book is superb. It is a model of tight organization, sound research,
                    and clear and colorful writing. Clifford moves his narrative forward with his eye fixed on the
                    particular story he is telling, but he is wise enough to realize that the story is affected by
                    presidential elections, events on the battlefields of Europe, vested interests within the military
                    community, the currents of public opinion, and the unpredictabilities of American politics.</p>
            <p>It is not hard to see why this book won the prestigious Frederick <placeName>

                    Historical Society in cooperation with the Kentucky Young Historians Association and the Illinois
                    Council of Student Historians, is suggested by its title. The second booklet gives emphasis to
                    architectural structures along the Wabash River from the Ohio state line down to its mouth but also
                    includes pictures of scenery and historical markers along the way. Both publications represent the
                    continuing contribution of the Indiana Junior Historical Society to architectural study in Indiana,
                    and they are prepared in the format to which persons who have used previous studies have become
                    accustomed. Hence, pictures are numerous and commentary is modest, but, nonetheless, considerable
                    information is offered readers and viewers.</p>

                    $15.00.) General Oliver Otis Howard was "an Indian fighter and Indian
                    diplomatist, and his observations about the tribes with which he came in contact, make his
                    recollections an essential entry in any well-rounded bibliography of the American West" (p.
                    v). In 1872 Howard served on a special peace <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-069-2-086"/> making mission to
                    Arizona and the Chiricahua Apaches. Results of his mission included the founding of San Carlos
                    Indian Reservation and an "all but unescorted" trip to Cochise's
                    stronghold to conclude peace negotiations. The other major episode in Howard's frontier
                    Indian career was the Nez Perce War of 1877. Both events are chronicled in this autobiography which
                    reveals Howard as genuinely interested in and sympathetic with the Indian's plight. The
                    general regarded himself as especially gifted to deal with the redmen, ascribed almost all conflicts
                    to white provocation, and considered the Indians victims of white mendacity and greed. Nevertheless,
                    he saw no reason to preserve the redman's religion or culture and, in working to raise the
                    Indian from "savagery" to "civilization," advocated virtual
                    cultural extermination. <hi rend="i">My Life and Experiences Among the Hostile Indians</hi> is
                    "a classic revelation of how Indians and whites so frequently and so completely failed to
                    understand each other" (p. xv). <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    fascinating and successful book: a foreward by one distinguished Kentucky historian; a text by
                    another who "possesses numerous attributes of cultural statesmanship" (p. viii);
                    and a story of the Civil War which is both poignant and historically informative. The Shakers, a
                    religious order of celibates, settled at Pleasant Hill, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1805. From 1856 to 1871 a very articulate diarist meticulously recorded in a
                    journal the events of the Shakers' daily lives. Using this journal as the basis for his
                    story, Clark describes the society's activities during the Civil War when the road through
                    their town was a "virtual funnel" through which both Confederate and Federal
                    armies flowed. All soldiers were fed, although the Shakers' well filled storerooms were
                    depleted. As Clark concludes: "The ravages of War took its [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] toll on
                    the prosperous agricultural economy of Pleasant Hill starting a forty year decline which led to the
                    dissolution of the Society in 1910" (p. 8). Excellent pictures add to the delight of this
                    interesting volume. <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>
