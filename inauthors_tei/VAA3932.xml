                <head>AUTHOR'S NOTE</head>
                <p>Four years ago I published, at my own expense, a small edition of "The Young
                    Lawyer and Another Essay," with the view of distributing the volumes among my
                    professional and other friends as souvenirs. After the distribution had been
                    made I discovered, very much to my chagrin, that the edition was too small for
                    the purpose contemplated. The small edition of this book, now published, in like
                    manner, will enable me to begin where I left off and I think the number will be
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>Since the publication of "The Young Lawyer and Another Essay" I have been
                    frequently urged, both orally and in writing, to place the book upon the market
                    and thus give it a wider circulation. I have not done so.</p>
                <p>We live in a capitalistic age. Wealth is taken as the almost universal standard,
                    and, in some degree, is regarded as the measure of public capacity. I am a man
                    of my time; I love money; but have long since been convinced that when
                    commerciality is the sole or principal incentive to authorship, the production
                    is marred, especially when viewed from an esthetic or purely literary
                    standpoint.</p>

                <p>Everything has already been written. As men have lived and thought for more than
                    seven thousand years, we have been born too late.&#151;<hi rend="i">La
                        Bruyere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>A pleasure that I enjoy alone affects me but slightly, and is of short duration.
                    It is for my friends as well as myself that I read, that I reflect, that I
                    write, that I meditate, that I listen, that I look, that I feel. * * * If I am
                    struck with a beautiful line they must know it. If I meet with a fine passage, I
                    promise myself to impart it to them. * * * I have consecrated to them the use of
                    all my senses and faculties.&#151;<hi rend="i">Diderot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I perceive, methinks, in the writings of the ancients, that he who speaks what he
                    thinks strikes much more home than he that only dissembles. * * * I have devoted
                    this book to the use of my relations and friends; so that, when they had lost
                    me, they could here find some traits of my qualities and humor, and thereby
                    might foster, in a more perfect and lively way, what remembrance they had of me.
                    * * * It is for the corner of a library, or to entertain a neighbor, a kinsman,
                    or a friend that has a mind to renew his acquaintance and familiarity with me in
                    this my picture.&#151;<hi rend="i">Montaigne.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I was soon disgusted with the modest practice of reading the manuscript to my
                    friends. Of such friends, some will praise from politeness, and some will
                    criticize from vanity. The author himself is the best judge of his own
                    performance; no one has so deeply meditated on the subject; no one is so
                    sincerely interested in the event.&#151;<hi rend="i">Gibbon.</hi>

                        <p>The problem of perennial happiness is one the solution of which must be
                            relegated to another and higher world; for it seems to have been
                            foreordained that while on this terrestrial sphere we must alternately
                            chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancies. As to the bitter, it may be
                            said, that while we cannot kill the wasp we may at least soften the
                            venom of its sting. We recall the self-evident assertion of Hobbs that
                            there is no such thing as perpetual tranquillity of mind while we live
                            here, because life itself is but motion, and can never be without
                            desire, nor without fear, no more than without sense.</p>
                        <p>The mark at which we all aim is happiness. The sacredness and
                            universality of the right to do so is emphasized in our immortal
                            Declaration of Independence.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-010" n="2"/>
                        <p>It is believed that the nearest approach to true happiness is found
                            midway between the extremes of unrestrained gaiety and melancholy
                            discomfort, but this inequality of moods is almost inevitable where
                            there is a large preponderance of sensibility.</p>
                        <p>Reading, observation, and reflection have taught us many things: our
                            happiness will always be found within a narrow compass, and amidst the
                            objects more immediately within our reach. That all happiness dwells
                            more in the hope than in the possession. That enjoyments to be
                            adequately prized must be of rare occurrence; as no one can set a proper
                            value on pleasures which he tastes every day. To recognize the propriety
                            and necessity of friends but, if you wish to be happy, to have no
                            superfluous ties. Mr. Lincoln, though of the most kindly and generous
                            nature, was slow to acquire intimacies, and had few close friendships.
                            That love is absolutely essential to happiness; this fact is fully
                            recognized by a great English dramatist and novelist who declared, "Some
                            persons, I know, estimate happiness by fine houses, gardens and
                            parks&#151;others by pictures, horses, money and various things
                            wholly remote from their own species; but when I wish to ascertain the
                            real felicity of any rational man, I always inquire whom he has to love.
                            If I find he has nobody, or does not love those he has&#151;even in
                            the midst of all his profusion of finery and grandeur&#151;I
                            pronounce him a being deep in adversity."</p>
                        <p>That conversation, especially of the loud and demonstrative variety, is
                            not a prerequisite to happiness. There is happiness in a Quakers'
                            meeting where the <pb id="VAA3932-011" n="3"/> silence is so deep that
                            the unsheathing of a stiletto may be heard amidst its hush. Let Charles
                            Lamb in one of the inimitable essays of Elia portray it: "Wouldst thou
                            know what true peace and quiet mean; wouldst thou find a refuge from the
                            noises and clamors of the multitude; wouldst thou enjoy at once solitude
                            and society; wouldst thou possess the depth of thine own spirit in
                            stillness, without being shut out from the consolatory faces of thy
                            species; wouldst thou be alone, and yet accompanied; solitary, yet not
                            desolate; singular, yet not without some to keep thee in countenance; a
                            unit in aggregate; a simple in composite: Come with me into a Quakers'
                            meeting. * * * There are wounds which an imperfect solitude cannot heal.
                            By imperfect I mean that which a man enjoyeth by himself. The perfect is
                            that which he can sometimes attain in crowds, but nowhere so absolutely
                            as in a Quakers' meeting."</p>
                        <p>That there is no more healthy state of mind than one which is as nearly
                            as possible independent of human opinion, where one is neither elated by
                            its attention nor soured by its neglect.</p>
                        <p>That there is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses
                            known.</p>
                        <p>That nothing contributes more to one's happiness than a change of
                            condition, occupation and environment. So universal is this desire for
                            change that Pascal was led to remark, "That if an artisan could imagine
                            for twelve hours that he was a king, he would be almost as happy as a
                            king who for twelve hours imagined himself an artisan."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-012" n="4"/>
                        <p>We have also learned that the observation of Thackeray is true when he
                            says that the world is a looking glass, and gives back to every one the
                            reflection of his own face. Frown at it, and it will in turn look sourly
                            upon you; laugh at it and with it and it is a jolly kind companion.</p>
                        <p>That an honest and heroic effort to eliminate from our lives, as far as
                            possible, all worry and loss of temper is conducive to happiness.
                            Ambassador White, in one of his walks with Count Von Bulow, alluded to a
                            hot debate of the day before and to his suavity under provocation, when
                            he answered: "Old &#151; many years ago, gave me two counsels, and I
                            have always tried to mind them. These were 'Never worry; never lose your
                            temper.'"</p>
                        <p>That no applause which ever reaches human ears is more grateful than that
                            which emanates from old friends and neighbors.</p>
                        <p>That genuine friendship is impracticable between men and women, young or
                            old. The woman either loves, is indifferent, or hates.</p>
                        <p>That the only real platonic love is that between brother and sister.
                            Gibbon refers to this relation as "a familiar and tender friendship with
                            a female about our own age; an affection perhaps softened by the secret
                            influence of sex, but pure from any mixture of sensual desire." He
                            declares that this is the sole species of platonic love that can be
                            indulged with truth and without danger.</p>
                        <p>An observation of Goethe is confirmed by the experience <pb
                                id="VAA3932-013" n="5"/> of mankind. He affirms that all comfort in
                            life is based upon a regular recurrence of external things. "The change
                            of day and night, of the seasons, of flowers and fruits, and whatever
                            else meets us from epoch to epoch; so that we can and should enjoy
                            it&#151;those are the proper springs of earthly life. The more open
                            we are to those enjoyments, the happier do we feel ourselves; but if the
                            changes in those phenomena roll up and down before us without our taking
                            interest in them, if we are insensible to such beautiful offers, then
                            comes on the greatest evil, the heaviest disease: we regard life as a
                            disgusting burden." He cites the case of an Englishman who hanged
                            himself that he might no longer dress and undress himself every day.</p>
                        <p>It must be accepted as true that all men, with rare exceptions, have
                            their splenetic hours.</p>
                        <p>The question has been asked, what is happiness? Does it soothe, or does
                            it excite; We use the word in its broad generic sense as applicable to
                            every kind of enjoyment. Happiness is both elusive and delusive. An
                            author of great ability and varied acquirements calls her the great
                            mistress of the ceremonies in the dance of life. "That she impels us
                            through all its mazes and meanderings, but leads none of us by the same
                            route. Aristippus pursued her in pleasure, Socrates in wisdom, and
                            Epicurus in both; she received the attentions of each, but bestowed her
                            endearments on neither, although, like some other gallants, they all
                            boasted of more favors than they had received. Warned by their failure,
                            the stoic adopted a most paradoxical mode of preferring his suit; <pb
                                id="VAA3932-014" n="6"/> he thought, by slandering, to woo her; by
                            shunning, to win her; and proudly presumed that, by fleeing her, she
                            would turn and follow him.</p>
                        <p>"She is deceitful as the calm that precedes the hurricane, smooth as the
                            waters on the verge of a cataract, and beautiful as the rainbow, that
                            smiling daughter of the storm: but like the mirage in the desert, she
                            tantalizes us with a delusion that distance creates and contiguity
                            destroys. Yet, when unsought, she is often found, and, when unexpected,
                            often obtained; while those who seek for her the most diligently fail
                            the most, because they seek her where she is not. Anthony sought her in
                            love; Brutus in glory; Cæsar in dominion; the first found disgrace, the
                            second disgust, the last ingratitude, and each destruction. * * *
                            Neither is she to be won by flattery or by bribes; she is to be gained
                            by waging war against her enemies, much sooner than by paying any
                            particular court to herself. Those that conquer her adversaries will
                            find that they need not go to her, for she will come unto them. * * *
                            What detains her? She is traveling incognito to keep a private
                            assignation with contentment, and to partake of a tête-à-tête and a
                            dinner of herbs in a cottage."</p>
                        <p>There are brief periods of supreme happiness in the life of nearly every
                            individual. John Bigelow, the eminent publicist and diplomatist who, at
                            the age of ninety-four, recently started on a prolonged European tour,
                            accompanied by his two granddaughters, declares that he was made
                            supremely happy by his acquisition of a knowledge of the principles of
                            homeopathy.</p>
                        <p>A verdict of not guilty when the defendant is charged <pb
                                id="VAA3932-015" n="7"/> with a capital offense is received by him
                            with unalloyed satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>When Gibbon casually attended the great trial of Warren Hastings, not
                            having yet attained the acme of his fame, he was charmed by Sheridan's
                            eloquence&#151;and was stirred with the most pleasurable emotion
                            when the great orator paid him a personal compliment in the presence of
                            the British nation, by using the phrase: "The correct periods of
                            Tacitus, and the luminous pages of Gibbon."</p>
                        <p>What pen can adequately describe the delight of Byron when he awoke one
                            morning and found himself famous? Indeed, it has been said that
                            authorial happiness is more exquisitely delightful than any
                            other&#151;and that an author intoxicated with success will hug his
                            porter if there is nobody else on hand.</p>
                        <p>The accepted lover, especially after a long and arduous wooing, is in a
                            condition of unmixed bliss&#151;a happiness so radiant that it
                            shines from his eyes, and is written at large upon his forehead.</p>
                        <p>One of the principal causes of discomfort is our habit of drawing drafts
                            on the misery of futurity&#151;melancholy usually flies to the
                            future for its ailment. It was indeed a valuable suggestion made by an
                            eminent man that one should interest himself chiefly in the progress of
                            his journey, and not look forward to its end with eagerness. He asks
                            "How am I to enjoy this year as I ought, if I am continually wishing it
                            over?"</p>
                        <p>Another, who had a great mastery of the laws of human happiness, had an
                            excellent rule for the happiness and wisdom of life as to the future,
                            not to look too far <pb id="VAA3932-016" n="8"/> into it for inevitable
                            though probably distant disaster. "Take short views of life, hope for
                            the best, and trust in God." He once gave a lady two and twenty receipts
                            against melancholy: one was a bright fire; another, to remember all the
                            pleasant things said to and of her; another, to keep a box of sugar
                            plums on the chimney piece, and a kettle simmering on the hob.</p>
                        <p>We are here reminded of these lines from Newman's hymn:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1" rend="ti-1">"I do not ask to see</l>
                            <l n="2">The distant scene; one step enough for me."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>We think it is incumbent upon each and every one of us to get the best of
                            everything out of each stage of our life, "to gather all of its leaves
                            in spring, all of its flowers in summer, all its fruits in autumn."</p>
                        <p>Cheerfulness is a matter which depends fully as much on the state of
                            things within as on the state of things about and around us; and inner
                            sunshine warms not only the heart of the owner but all who come in
                            contact with it. Goldsmith's traveler seated on a crag in the Alps, in
                            solemn meditation, reviews his long pilgrimage, recalls the varieties of
                            scenery, of climate, of government, of religion, of national character,
                            and arrives to the just conclusion "That human happiness depends little
                            on political institutions, and much on the temper and regulation of our
                            own minds." We have read of one who, by reason of the application of
                            this truth, was very happy with some garden flowers, half a dozen
                            pictures, and a few books. He declared that he lived without envy,
                            without fear and without desire. Izaak Walton, <pb id="VAA3932-017"
                                n="9"/> author of the "Complete Angler," lived to the advanced age
                            of ninety years and, adopting this principle, the last forty years of
                            his life was a period of the utmost tranquillity and peace.</p>
                        <p>Another example is that of John Wesley, who, in 1790, said that he did
                            not remember to have felt lowness of spirits for a quarter of an hour
                            since he was born. It was said of the Duke of Wellington that the
                            general character of his last years was rather that of the old age of a
                            great man idealized. "To the unbroken splendors of his military career,
                            to his honorable and conscientious labors as a parliamentary statesman,
                            life unusually prolonged added an evening of impressive beauty and
                            calm." His delight lay within his own soul.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of Marcus Aurelius that "the nearer character attains
                            to immunity from passion, the greater is its power. That anger is as
                            weak as grief. Both mean that we have been wounded and have
                            succumbed."</p>
                        <p>Many do not consider that our well-being depends so largely upon the
                            temper and regulation of our minds. But we must accept as true the
                            declaration of a man of large observation and deep reflection, that no
                            bodily comforts which could be devised by the skill and labor of a
                            hundred generations would give happiness to a man whose mind was under
                            the tyranny of licentious appetite, of envy, of hatred or of fear.</p>
                        <p>As to what constitutes happiness depends to some extent upon the age,
                            temperament, disposition and environment, of each particular
                            individual&#151;though there are many sources of happiness common to
                            us all. Some seek happiness, or at least tranquillity, in the peaceful
                                <pb id="VAA3932-018" n="10"/> shades of the cloister, the
                            deprivations endured being in a measure compensated for by the
                            consolation of religion; some in recondite studies, some in general
                            literary pursuits. In ancient times the knight derived exquisite delight
                            in sighing away his soul in moonlight serenades under the balcony of the
                            empress of his affections. Some have an excessive fondness for the
                            sports of the field&#151;oftentimes resulting in a strenuous
                            idleness which disdains all useful occupations. There are others,
                            unfortunately not the majority, the chief part of whose happiness
                            consists in self-sacrifice, in the exercise of the benevolent
                            affections, and in giving and receiving sincere testimonies of regard.
                            Others, like Alexander the Great and Voltaire, deemed no occupation so
                            noble and delightful as that of making ingrates. To the young nothing is
                            more delicious than those illusions to which lovers are proverbially
                            subject during the season of courtship. Many have derived great pleasure
                            in following the suggestion of Goethe, that a man ought, every day, to
                            read a fine book, see a noble picture and look at a beautiful person.
                            There are men whose eyes always light up at the sight of a pretty woman,
                            even of such as merely pass by, never more to be seen of them again.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador White recalls with much satisfaction the period of his early
                            life when he became educated into the great truth that stores, shops,
                            hotels, facilities for travel and traffic are not the highest things in
                            civilization.</p>
                        <p>A man who has done a good stroke of business is happy, and this feeling
                            of satisfaction is sometimes indicated by a smug expression about the
                            mouth.</p>
                        <p>It has been said that in wicked Paris the highest <pb id="VAA3932-019"
                                n="11"/> degree of self-satisfaction ever registered by a human
                            countenance, is that of the bachelor emerging from a boudoir in the best
                            of humors with himself.</p>
                        <p>Balzac asserts that a man only lives by some personal gratification.
                            "That the passionless, perfectly righteous man is not human; he is a
                            monster, an angel wanting wings." And he asks "Who dares to bid farewell
                            to an old habit? Many a man on the brink of suicide has been plucked
                            back on the threshold of death by the thought of the cafe where he plays
                            the mighty game of dominoes."</p>
                        <p>Camille Desmouline's eternal and only receipt for universal happiness was
                            "entire freedom of action and speech."</p>
                        <p>We all know the ineffable pleasure experienced by a writer or a speaker
                            when he first sees himself in print.</p>
                        <p>There will be general acquiescence in the truth of the observation of
                            Goethe made in his preface to "Wilhelm Meister," when he declares that,
                            "There are loftier emotions, which afford us a contentment which is in
                            vain to seek in the amusements of the world; and, in these higher joys,
                            there is also kept a secret treasure for strengthening in
                            misfortune."</p>
                        <p>In woman, the love of becoming ornament is not only pardonable but
                            commendable, and cannot justly be regarded in the light of vanity. We
                            all know that the choice and arrangement of dress bestows an added charm
                            to her fascinations. To be perfectly charming, however, she must be
                            happy. It has been said that happiness is the poetry of woman, as the
                            toilet is her tinsel.</p>
                        <p>Women intensely enjoy the company and conversation <pb id="VAA3932-020"
                                n="12"/> of each other. No man can know, with absolute certainty,
                            the subjects which they consider and discuss, but dame rumor is
                            responsible for the intimation that the questions of feminine attire,
                            their own complaints, and the merits and excellencies of their favorite
                            physicians and ministers, are not, as a rule, completely ignored.</p>
                        <p>A brilliant but malevolent writer, with a gravity almost amounting to
                            solemnity, declares that "at the age of forty a woman, especially if she
                            has tasted the poisoned apple of passion, is aware of a solemn dread:
                            she perceives that two deaths await her&#151;that of the body and
                            that of the heart; and that all alike after that terrible date in life,
                            are aware of an acute pain." This can only be regarded as a gross
                            exaggeration. A perfect panacea for all such troubles would be a love
                            letter and a beautiful new gown, in consonance with the principle, long
                            since established, that these two things&#151;pretty dresses and
                            love letters&#151;create woman a second time.</p>
                        <p>Much satisfaction and tranquillity of mind result from the cultivation of
                            a feeling of self-reliance and independence. We have been deeply
                            impressed with the observation of Goethe: "For a time we may grow up
                            under the protection of parents and relatives; we may lean for a while
                            on our brothers and sisters and friends, be supported by acquaintances,
                            and made happy by those we love; but in the end, man is always driven
                            back upon himself. * * * Early enough, and by many a hard lesson, had I
                            learned that, at the most urgent crisis, the call to us is 'Physician,
                            heal thyself,' <pb id="VAA3932-021" n="13"/> and how frequently had I
                            been compelled to sigh out in pain 'I tread the wine press alone!'"</p>
                        <p>It has been said that in youth, melancholy is the twilight of dawn, in
                            age the dusk of night. "In youth, one is admirably adapted to give and
                            receive happiness; and it is the peculiar felicity of this period of
                            life that the most unpleasing objects and events seldom make a deep or
                            lasting impression; it forgets the past, enjoys the present, and
                            anticipates the future."</p>
                        <p>It is probable that no two persons will agree as to what constitutes the
                            ideal happy man. It is the opinion of one that a life alternately
                            devoted to action, reflection and literature is idealistic. Another
                            declares that an ideal life is one compounded of work and meditation, of
                            solitude and society. It was remarked of the late Senator Morrill of
                            Vermont that he was full of good cheer and sunshine, full of hope for
                            the future, full of pleasant memories of the past. To him life was made
                            up of cheerful yesterdays and confident to-morrows. The life of
                            Fontenelle, the celebrated French author, is, in our opinion, very far
                            from being ideal, but it is certainly unique and interesting. He died in
                            1757, having attained the age of one hundred years. He studied law but
                            abandoned the profession on losing his first case. As a writer he was
                            distinguished for his amazing versatility and also for the charm of his
                            conversation. His last words when dying were "I do not suffer, my
                            friends; but I feel a sort of difficulty in living." His character and
                            eccentricities have been vividly portrayed by Sainte Beuve: "He had
                            never wept; he had never been in a rage; he had never run; and as he
                            never acted from <pb id="VAA3932-022" n="14"/> motives of sentiment, he
                            never received impressions from other men. * * * He had never
                            interrupted any one; he would listen to his interlocutor to the very
                            end, without losing anything; he was never in a hurry to speak; and if
                            you had brought any accusation against him, he would have listened the
                            whole day to your impeachments without uttering a single word. * * * 'He
                            who wishes to be happy,' he observed, 'reduces and confines himself as
                            much as possible.' He has these two characteristics: he seldom changes
                            his habitation, and does not care in particular for any habitation. When
                            he took possession of any new quarters, he let the things remain as he
                            found them; he would never have thought of either removing or adding a
                            single nail."</p>
                        <p>The happiness of the individuals composing a nation is the happiness of
                            the nation. In the last century a celebrated Englishman referred to the
                            United States as a magnificent spectacle of human happiness; and, about
                            the same time, a distinguished Frenchman who had devoted several years
                            to the study of our institutions and people, declared that he found in
                            the United States that restlessness of heart which is natural to man,
                            when all ranks are nearly equal and the chances of elevation are the
                            same to all.</p>
                        <p>While it is true that our country has experienced the extreme
                            vicissitudes of the highest happiness and the direst affliction, it will
                            be conceded, we think, that upon the whole, no nation surpasses us in
                            individual and national prosperity and happiness.</p>

                        <head type="subtitle">LOVE.</head>
                        <p>In considering and presenting the subject of human happiness and its
                            opposite, we shall not ignore that great comedy which is the prologue of
                            every married life. We shall not be deterred from its consideration by
                            any apprehension of ridicule on the part of rude and uncultivated
                            persons, should this volume, perchance, fall into their hands. The love
                            of the sexes is, in fact, the foundation of all human happiness; and, of
                            all ties that bind one human being to another, it is the closest and the
                            strongest. It comes to us from God and does not depend upon ourselves to
                            kindle it in our own bosoms. It of course varies in intensity in
                            different individuals&#151;the highest degree of affection being
                            illustrated by that of the love bird which is indigenous to Africa and
                            South America. If a pair of these little birds have been kept together
                            in captivity, neither can long survive the loss of its partner.</p>
                        <p>The great anatomists of the human heart have, from time to time,
                            attempted to define or describe this passion of love; one declares that
                            it is the income of beauty, and he who seeks beauty without expressing
                            love, withholds its income in a manner that cries out for vengeance.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-024" n="16"/>
                        <p>Another defines love to be the consciousness of happiness given and
                            received, and the certainty of giving and getting it. Another asks the
                            question, what do you call loving, and answers, "Always thinking of a
                            person&#151;always seeking her society."</p>
                        <p>The historian Gibbon, in approaching the delicate subject of his own
                            early love, defines this passion as the union of desire, friendship and
                            tenderness, which is influenced by a single female, which prefers her to
                            the rest of her sex and which seeks her possession as the supreme or
                            sole happiness of our being. Another declares, that when the mind, the
                            heart, and the senses all have their share in the rapture which
                            transports us&#151;ah! then there is no falling to earth, rather it
                            is to heaven we soar; still another avers that when two love each other
                            so well that every day seems for them the first day of their love, such
                            vital happiness has a marvelous power of transforming the whole
                            conditions of life.</p>
                        <p>Goethe observes that the first propensities to love in an uncorrupted
                            youth take altogether a spiritual direction. Nature seems to desire that
                            one sex may by the senses perceive goodness and beauty in the other. He
                            adds: "Thus to me by the sight of this girl (Bettina), by my strong
                            inclination for her&#151;a new world of the beautiful and the
                            excellent had arisen." He subsequently declares that "It was not until
                            many years afterward, nay until after her death, that I learned of her
                            secret, heavenly love, in a manner that necessarily overwhelmed me."</p>

                        <p>It has been said that a woman's greatest charm consists in a constant
                            appeal to man's generosity, in a graceful admission of helplessness,
                            which stimulates his pride, and awakens his noblest feelings; and that
                            love in her "is the most unlimited confidence, joined to a craving to
                            reverence and adore the being to whom she belongs."</p>
                        <p>A celebrated woman declares that of all mysteries in life, love is the
                            least mysterious. "That it exhales from woman like a perfume, and that
                            she who can conceal it is a very monster. Our eyes prattle even more
                            than our tongues." So much as to the nature, definition and description
                            of love as viewed, not only by novelists, but by the profound thinkers
                            of our own and former times.</p>
                        <p>Hahnemann, the celebrated German physician, and the author and originator
                            of homeopathy as a distinctive system of medicine, taught that disease
                            is to be regarded as consisting essentially of the symptoms of it as
                            experienced and expressed by the patient, or as detected by the
                            physicians; in other words, that the chief symptoms, or the "totality of
                            the symptoms" constitute the disease. May not the same principle be
                            applicable to this strange and bewitching malady of the human heart,
                            called love? Would it be possible for any of the great analysts who have
                            essayed to define this malady to give a better definition than
                            this&#151;"the totality of the symptoms." To the symptoms then our
                            attention must be given.</p>
                        <p>The memorable colloquy between Rosalind and Orlando, <pb id="VAA3932-026"
                                n="18"/> in the Forest of Arden, renders comparatively easy the
                            solution of the question "when is a man in love."</p>
                        <p>"Rosalind&#151;My uncle taught me how to know a man in love; in which
                            cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</p>
                        <p>"Orlando&#151;What were his marks?</p>
                        <p>"Rosalind&#151;A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and
                            sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have
                            not; a beard neglected, which you have not; but I pardon you for that,
                            for simply you having no beard is a younger brother's revenue; then your
                            hose should be ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned,
                            your shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless
                            desolation; but you are no such man; you are rather
                            point&#151;devise in your accoutrements, as loving yourself than
                            seeming the lover of another."</p>
                        <p>It has been said that when a girl dimly divines the presence of love in
                            the world she smiles as she smiled in her babyhood, when she saw the
                            light for the first time; that the dawning of love in her is as faint as
                            the first light of the morning, and that this first illusion is "the
                            subtlest of feelings, the heart's daintiest morsel." Novelists have
                            exhausted their vocabularies in their efforts to portray the ineffable
                            loveliness of a young girl, gathering the first roses of an unspoken
                            declaration. The blind mother of the beautiful girl discovered the
                            secret of her daughter's budding passion. "Listen, my friends," said the
                            blind woman, "my daughter is in love. I feel it; I see it. A strange
                            change has come <pb id="VAA3932-027" n="19"/> over her, and I cannot
                            think how you have failed to observe it. * * * For the last two months
                            she has dressed herself with care as if she were going to meet some one.
                            She has become excessively particular about her shoes; she wants her
                            feet to look nice. * * * Some days the poor child sits gloomy and
                            watchful, as if she expected somebody. * * * Her cheerfulness betrays
                            itself in the tones of her voice, accents which I can detect and account
                            for. In short, she is happy. There is a tone of thanksgiving even in the
                            ideas she utters. * * * Though I am blind my affection is
                                clairvoyant."<ref id="ref_1" rend="super" target="note_1"

                        <p>The animation which love puts into a young life is marvelous, and there
                            certainly is no more becoming cosmetic. It is said that the eyes of a
                            lover are not his own, but you may rest assured that he makes good use
                            of them; and it has been observed that none but lovers and diplomatists
                            know all that the flash of the eye can convey of information or delight.
                            The remarks of a lover, as a rule, are not characterized by profundity,
                            and, indeed, it has been intimated, that his words are sometimes utterly
                            void of common sense&#151;but his eloquent looks more than
                            compensate for these deficiencies. Illustrative of the power of the eye,
                            is the proud boast of a fascinating woman that a single glance from her
                            made the boldest youth drop his eyes. When the eyes of two lovers fall
                            at once and meet again&#151;this circumstance portends much
                            happiness for both. A lover's mournful farewell glance at his
                            lady-love's window tells the whole story. When a woman is afraid to look
                            at her interlocutor <pb id="VAA3932-028" n="20"/> but suddenly becomes
                            interested in some article of furniture in her boudoir, she then and
                            there makes an unconscious avowal. The most commonplace phrases when
                            uttered with a faltering voice become truly eloquent. It is said that
                            when a young girl sings her lover is not far away. We shall say nothing
                            of the significance of the conduct of a young lady who carries a letter
                            in her bosom for a whole day&#151;postpones reading it till an hour
                            when everybody is asleep&#151;till midnight.</p>
                        <p>True love is oftentimes enshrouded in the mystery of
                            bashfulness&#151;distrust of himself&#151;"the shyness of a man
                            to whom no woman has ever said 'I love you.'"</p>
                        <p>To feign indifference, when she feels it not, is one of the tricks
                            peculiar to feminine beauty&#151;and marked avoidance of her lover
                            does not always imply indifference.</p>
                        <p>There are those who have the power to cover all inward ebullition with
                            outward calm, especially the solitary, because it is the nature of
                            solitude to make the passions calm on the surface&#151;agitated in
                            the depths. The face may sometimes wear an inscrutable mask concealing
                            the most vehement emotions&#151;there may be an ecstasy in the
                            depths of the heart which the face never betrays. These instances,
                            however, are exceptional. We have read of a charming young woman whose
                            cheerfulness and calmness were externally apparent, but who failed to
                            conceal two symptoms of a tender heart; she breathed deeply from time to
                            time and a transient red passed over her face.</p>
                        <p>It has been said of Rousseau that he preached the gospel of happiness in
                            love as earnestly as the saints <pb id="VAA3932-029" n="21"/> preach the
                            gospel of happiness in religion. We adhere, however, to the opinion
                            expressed in the first paragraph of this book that, while on this
                            terrestrial sphere, we must alternately chew the cud of sweet and bitter
                            fancies. Lovers are no exception to the rule.</p>
                        <p>Love is a more exacting master than marriage, and, like despair, it
                            sometimes catches at straws. These diseases of the heart require the
                            balm of sympathy and affection. There are instances, however, which
                            neither require nor deserve commiseration. For example, the woman who
                            exclaimed "What a pity it is that we can not live on love as we live on
                            fruit, and that when we have had our fill, nothing should survive but
                            the remembrance of pleasure;" and another, who declared that "she had
                            never seen a man whom she could not love, and hoped to heaven she never
                            might."</p>
                        <p>The success or failure of a lover is oftentimes determined by what would
                            seem to be the most trivial circumstance; a pair of trousers turned out
                            by a celebrated tailor is said to have made a most suitable and
                            advantageous match; and a splash staining the polish of a boot has been
                            known to bring a young man to discomfiture.</p>
                        <p>A woman declares: "We are fit only to love. Men have a thousand different
                            ways of spending their energy; all we can do is to dream, and pray, and
                            worship. But it must not be forgotten that there have been many
                            exhibitions of feminine perversity. To avoid looking at her lover,
                            apparently oblivious of his presence, and to sit with folded hands
                            seemingly lost in deep meditation&#151;this is absolutely maddening
                            to him. To answer in <pb id="VAA3932-030" n="22"/> brief negatives is
                            far from being reassuring to a lover's uneasy mind. When asked what's
                            the matter and she replies "Nothing," the lover is dismayed, and
                            anticipates the most serious consequences. She sometimes picks a little
                            quarrel with him, making a mountain out of a mole-hill. Women have been
                            known to absolutely snub their admirers, by speaking to them with a
                            slight, scornful inclination of the head. We have read of a gentleman
                            who was exceedingly popular with the ladies of his
                            acquaintance&#151;his popularity being due to the fact that one of
                            their contemporaries had died of a broken heart for him. What
                            perversity!</p>
                        <p>Young men are likewise sometimes amenable to the charge of
                            perversity&#151;perhaps they might prefer to call it diplomacy. They
                            sit thinking long and patiently over the problem of the strategy of
                            love. The lover will fire the fancy of his darling by a certain
                            reticence, which stirs in her such chords of curiosity as she did not
                            know existed in her. On another occasion he will display all of his
                            powers of attraction, but at the same time affect indifference, seem to
                            disdain her, and so goad her vanity.</p>
                        <p>Jealousy, as we know, is a prolific cause of perturbation between lovers;
                            and one of the insoluble mysteries of it all is that the more jealous
                            they are, the more jealous they want to be. Its existence is never
                            difficult to discern, but it often has for its foundation a mere figment
                            of the imagination. When the question is asked "Can you swear to me that
                            you are nothing, and never will be anything, to another woman," we all
                            know what's the matter.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-031" n="23"/>
                        <p>A reconciliation, following an estrangement between lovers, is of course
                            a cause of mutual delight and satisfaction; and in lovers' quarrels it
                            has been noted that the party that loves the most is always most willing
                            to acknowledge the greater fault. These great agitations of soul have
                            been compared to storms that purify the atmosphere; "they give tone and
                            bring counsel of strong and generous resolve." A reconciliation is
                            always possible. The darkest hour of the night is the one immediately
                            preceding the break of day; and it has been observed, truly, we believe,
                            that two hearts are never nearer to a mutual understanding than when
                            they have agreed to the necessity of an eternal parting.</p>
                        <p>Environment has much to do with the happy culmination of a courtship. How
                            many hearts have been made supremely happy in moonlight promenades, the
                            moon shining softly through the foliage of the forest, especially at the
                            season when summer is fading into autumn and the moonlight nights are
                            long? The harvest moon, rising as it does at nearly the same hour for
                            several days and being near its full, if it could speak, would, no
                            doubt, add incalculable interest to the literature of the heart. After a
                            prolonged and arduous wooing covering a period of many months, or even
                            years, with the result still somewhat in doubt, it might be well to
                            suggest riding double on horseback. The situation is said to be most
                            conducive to the revivifying of confidence and affection, and a

                            passengers have ample leisure and there is an absolute necessity for
                            killing the time&#151;and it might be said that there is almost an
                            enforced association. The courtship and marriage of Warren Hastings and
                            the Baroness Imhoff furnish a unique and intensely interesting
                            illustration. We also find here a singular blending of romance and
                            business. On account of the illustrious character of the participants in
                            this affair of the heart, we feel sure that we will be pardoned for
                            going somewhat into detail.</p>
                        <p>Warren Hastings was the first governor-general of British India. He
                            sprang from an ancient and illustrious race. It has been affirmed that
                            his pedigree can be traced back to the great Danish sea-kings, whose
                            sails were long the terror of both coasts of the British channel.<ref
                                id="ref_2" rend="super" target="note_2" targOrder="U">2</ref> The
                            historian of the period declares that Hastings looked like a great man,
                            and not like a bad man. In his case the body was wholly subjugated to
                            the mind. His frame, naturally slight, had been further attenuated by
                            rigorous habits of temperance and thus rendered proof against the
                            diseases of the tropics. Against his private character not even calumny
                            has breathed a reproach. A classical education and the instincts of
                            family pride saved him from both the greed and the vulgar display which
                            marked the typical "nabob," the self-made man of those days. He could
                            support the position of governor-general and of a country gentleman with
                            equal credit.<ref id="ref_3" rend="super" target="note_3" targOrder="U"

                            command of all of the resources of one of the most fertile minds that
                            ever <pb id="VAA3932-033" n="25"/> existed, and declared that he could
                            not regard without admiration "the amplitude and fertility of his
                            intellect&#151;his rare talents for command, for administration, and

                        <p>His was a stormy and tempestuous career. He died well&#151;an
                            additional proof of his greatness. His death occurred August 22, 1819,
                            in the eighty-sixth year of his age, and it is affirmed that he met it
                            with the same tranquil and decorous fortitude which he had opposed to
                            all the trials of his varied and eventful life.</p>
                        <p>In the spring of 1769 Hastings embarked on board the "Duke of Grafton"
                            for India. His voyage was distinguished by incidents which might furnish
                            matter for a novel.</p>
                        <p>Among the passengers in the "Duke of Grafton," says Macaulay, was a
                            German baron by the name of Imhoff. The baron was accompanied by his
                            wife, a native, we have somewhere read, of Archangel. This young woman,
                            who, born under the Arctic circle, was destined to play the part of a
                            queen under the tropic of Cancer, had an agreeable person, a cultivated
                            mind, and manners in the highest degree engaging. * * * She was
                            interested by the conversation and flattered by the attentions of
                            Hastings. The situation was indeed perilous. No place is so propitious
                            to the formation either of close friendships or of deadly enmities as an
                            Indiaman. * * * Most passengers find some resource in eating twice as
                            many meals as on land. But the great devices for killing <pb
                                id="VAA3932-034" n="26"/> the time are quarreling and flirting. * *
                            * Under such circumstances met Warren Hastings and the Baroness Imhoff;
                            two persons whose accomplishments would have attracted notice in any
                            court of Europe. The gentleman had no domestic ties. The lady was tied
                            to a husband for whom she had no regard. An attachment sprang up, which
                            was soon strengthened by events such as could hardly have occurred on
                            land. Hastings fell ill. The baroness nursed him with womanly
                            tenderness, gave him his medicines with her own hand, and even sat up in
                            his cabin while he slept. Long before the "Duke of Graf ton" reached
                            Madras, Hastings was in love. But his love was of the most
                            characteristic description. Like his hatred, like his ambition, like all
                            his passions, it was strong but not impetuous. It was calm, deep,
                            earnest, patient of delay, unconquerable by time. Imhoff was called into
                            council by his wife and his wife's lover. It was arranged that the
                            baroness should institute a suit for divorce in the courts of Franconia,
                            and during the time which might elapse before the sentence could be
                            pronounced, they should continue to live together. It was also agreed
                            that Hastings should bestow some very substantial mark of gratitude on
                            the complaisant husband; and should, when the marriage was dissolved,
                            make the lady his wife, and adopt the children whom she had already
                            borne to Imhoff.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with their plans they were subsequently married. It is said
                            that he loved his wife with that love which is peculiar to men of strong
                            minds&#151;to men whose affection is not easily won or widely
                            diffused. That his letters to her were tender, and full of indications
                            of <pb id="VAA3932-035" n="27"/> esteem and confidence; but at the same
                            time, a little more ceremonious than is usual in so intimate a
                                relation.<ref id="ref_4" rend="super" target="note_4" targOrder="U"
                                >4</ref>
                        </p>
                        <p>This extraordinary attachment demonstrates very clearly that weak and
                            silly men and weak and silly women are not the only ones who become
                            infatuated with the opposite sex. A man may be loved on account of his
                            superior intellectual attainments, and it has been beautifully and truly
                            said that the worship of talent is one of the rarest vagaries that ever
                            beat its wings in a woman's soul. It has even been affirmed that a man
                            may be loved independently of his person&#151;handsome or ugly, and
                            for his soul alone. A fascinating woman, somewhat given to coquetry,
                            declared: "I am convinced now that I could never torment or flirt with a
                            fool or make any impression on him. It is only men of real distinction
                            who can enter into our feelings and feel our influence."</p>
                        <p>It is a grave error to assume that young ladies are so absolutely foolish
                            as to be pleased with no other conversation than that of extravagant
                            compliment; and many a cause has been lost when the suitor became too
                            demonstrative, and declared his love with wild bursts of enthusiasm. It
                            has been said that a Pole is generally weak in the presence of women for
                            the reason that he is so full of tenderness that he becomes her
                            inferior.</p>
                        <p>It has been affirmed that absence endangers none but weak attachments. We
                            think this broad statement must be accepted with some qualifications.
                            The absence must not be too prolonged. Genuine affection can withstand
                                <pb id="VAA3932-036" n="28"/> "very severe storms of rigor but not a
                            long polar frost of downright indifference." It has been suggested that
                            lovers when widely separated should think of each other tenderly at the
                            same hour each day&#151;and thus prevent the waning of their
                                affection.<note id="note_4" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                        <p>We do not wish to be placed on record as approving any kind of fraud or
                            dissimulation&#151;not even in the delicate affairs of the heart;
                            but we were greatly amused and entertained, not to say impressed, by an
                            incident of which we have read. Two lovers were separated by more than a
                            thousand miles. The young lady discovered, or thought she had, a growing
                            coolness on the part of her lover. What did she do? When she had
                            finished writing her letter she let fall from her finger-tips a few
                            drops of water upon the stationery. Her lover, opening the letter very
                            naturally concluded that those were the tears she shed for him. What did
                            he do? He hurried back to her as on the wings of the wind. He could not
                            endure the thought of remaining away a moment longer from his dear one.
                            The result was that the rekindled flame in his bosom burned more
                            intensely than ever. It was no longer necessary for either to repeat the
                            line from the charming poem of Bishop Heber,</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"If thou, my love, wert by my side."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>It has been asserted, truly, no doubt, that indiscreet utterances at
                            partings exceed in number those made at all other times; and it is no
                            less true that a look or a word may sunder two lovers forever. "In the
                            eyes of a woman," says a profound student of the human heart, <pb
                                id="VAA3932-037" n="29"/> "the man to whom she is indifferent is
                            always more or less ugly; but the man whom she has ceased to love is a
                            monster."</p>
                        <p>What is not of colloquial acquisition is learned by reading, observation
                            and reflection, and from these sources we become possessed of many
                            axiomatic truths. We know that the aloofness of the love of a suitor has
                            oftentimes proved disastrous, but that he should never permit himself to
                            droop beneath the frown of a capricious beauty. We know that persistency
                            may accomplish marvels, and it should not be forgotten that the fairest
                            apple hangs on the highest bough. We know that the young gentleman who
                            is "to one thing constant never" is deservedly an egregious failure, and
                            that promiscuity in attachments invariably leads to trouble and
                            disaster. We know that parents sometimes prefer that their daughter
                            should marry "an average man," with solid virtues and sound morals; and
                            that the daughter, while not wishing to ignore those homely qualities,
                            is impressed by a lover "whose eye melts in love and kindles in
                            war&#151;one whose voice is sweetest and noblest when honor is his
                            theme&#151;one whose soul is mirrored in his
                            countenance&#151;especially if sorrow has given him an interesting
                            look&#151;for, be it said, that she is always the friend of desolate
                            hearts. She would never tire of inquiring if sorrow had his young days
                            faded."</p>
                        <p>We conclude with the words of Goethe:</p>
                        <p>"The first love, it is rightly said is the only one; for in the second,
                            and by the second, the highest sense of love is already lost. * * * Past
                            attachments seem like specters of the night, which glide away before the
                            break of day."</p>

                        <head type="subtitle">MARRIAGE.</head>
                        <p>We wish at the outset to put the seal of our reprobation upon the
                            declaration of a malevolent person that marriage is the end of man. It
                            is no part of our purpose to discuss, at length, marriage in its purely
                            legal aspects; but a few observations along this line may not be deemed
                            inappropriate. We do not care to inquire whether marriage is merely a
                            contract or more than a contract, whether a purely civil or a religious
                            act. It may be stated, however, that while marriage is generally spoken
                            of by lawyers as a contract, its complete isolation from all other
                            contracts is invariably recognized. As to the validity of a marriage it
                            has been well settled that the <hi rend="i">lex loci</hi> governs. If
                            the marriage is valid by the laws of the country where it was celebrated
                            it is recognized as valid everywhere. "This rule," says Story, "has
                            received the most deliberate sanction of the English and American courts
                            and of foreign jurists." There are, however, a few exceptions to this
                            general rule which we will not stop to consider.</p>
                        <p>Under the old Roman law, concubinage was recognized under certain
                            restrictions as an inferior form of union; but this has all but
                            disappeared from modern society. <pb id="VAA3932-039" n="31"/> The
                            morganatic or left-handed marriage, that is, the union between a man of
                            superior and a woman of inferior rank is the nearest approach ever made
                            by concubinage to true marriage. These marriages were in vogue among the
                            royal families in Germany and perhaps elsewhere. The children were
                            deemed legitimate, but neither they nor the wife acquired any right to
                            the rank or fortune of the husband. We have, in theory at least, no
                            stratification of society in this country, and happily such marriages
                            are unknown.</p>
                        <p>The man who declared that nine-tenths of those who have raved in
                            rapturous stanzas about the sweets of conjugal love are bachelors
                            shivering in solitary garrets, deserves commiseration on account of his
                            morbidity. La Bruyère, the eminent Frenchman, never married. "A single
                            man," he observed, "can, if he has wit, raise himself above his station,
                            and mix in the world on a footing of equality; which is less easy if he
                            be married, for marriage seems to settle people into their proper rank."
                            There may have been some force in this reason, in his own country and in
                            his own time, but in this age and generation, it would be universally
                            regarded as puerile. The truth is, that the family is the enduring basis
                            of all organized society. We need only to refer to Holy Writ: "Who so
                            findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favor of the
                            Lord."</p>
                        <p>Again: "A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband. * * * Her children
                            arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. *
                            * * Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of thy
                            life."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-040" n="32"/>
                        <p>That marriage is in some sense a lottery will not be denied. The bride
                            and her mother fully understand the conditions and dangers of this
                            lottery&#151;all women do&#151;and sometimes they shed tears as
                            they look on at a marriage. The men smile, thinking they risk nothing.
                            There are so many considerations involved in marriage as, for example,
                            consonance of tempers, physical sympathies and concord of character. If
                            the bride has a fortune, great or small, her husband may dissipate it;
                            because, when a young wife has given her heart she very rarely refuses
                            her purse. A woman may be much above the level of those about her and
                            she is driven to the necessity of deciding between the emptiness of the
                            men whom she meets, and the emptiness of her own life; and the emptiness
                            of her suitor is oftentimes concealed by his agreeable manners.</p>
                        <p>It was said of a young husband who turned out to be bad, that during his
                            courtship "not a syllable overstepped the pure regions of sentiment. The
                            blue of the forget-me-not and the white of the lily are not more pure
                            than were his flowers of rhetoric." We believe the observation to be
                            true that while there are a few general rules for mitigating the worries
                            of married life, there are none to enable one to guess or foresee
                            them.</p>
                        <p>The causes of domestic discord are countless, and it would, therefore, be
                            idle to attempt to name them all. Every woman is not in love with her
                            husband and of course this fact portends trouble; the friction produced
                            by incessant intimacy is another prolific cause of domestic infelicity.
                            It is said that nothing evaporates more quickly than conjugal affection;
                            and, when love is extinct, <pb id="VAA3932-041" n="33"/> only
                            indifference or contempt ever fills its place. A woman who takes as much
                            trouble every day to make herself as beautiful for her husband as other
                            women do for society will, as a rule, retain his love. We will let the
                            charming young wife who resorted to this expedient speak for herself, in
                            her own words: "I get up in the early dawn, while he is still sleeping,
                            and without disturbing him, pass into the dressing-room, where,
                            profiting by my mother's experience, I remove the traces of sleep by
                            bathing in cold water. For during sleep the skin, being less active,
                            does not perform its functions adequately; it becomes warm and covered
                            with a sort of mist or atmosphere of sticky matter, visible to the eye.
                            From a sponge bath a woman issues forth ten years younger, and this,
                            perhaps, is the interpretation of the myth of Venus rising from the sea.
                            So the cold water restores to me the saucy charm of dawn, and, having
                            combed and scented my hair and made a most fastidious toilet, I am ready
                            to give my husband a cordial welcome to breakfast. When he appears and
                            observes my freshness, buoyancy and vivacity&#151;looking as dainty
                            as a spring morning&#151;his love and tenderness for me are mirrored
                            in every lineament of his countenance."<ref id="ref_5" rend="super"

                        </p>
                        <p>Sometimes a woman imagines that if she can marry a great celebrity she
                            will be supremely happy but she will soon discover that a man, however
                            superior, is but a man like all others.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt that the love of a husband and wife depends less on
                            outward beauty than on graces of character. The wife may exercise a
                            marvelous influence over <pb id="VAA3932-042" n="34"/> her husband but
                            it ought to be entirely concealed, as the charm of all a woman does lies
                            in its unobtrusiveness. A husband who submits to a public and
                            ostentatious exercise of authority by a wife is justly held an object of
                            ridicule; and society would not tolerate, for a moment, a public
                            exhibition of the wife's power over her husband.<note id="note_5"

                        <p>All experience proves that marriage cannot rest alone upon passion as its
                            foundation; and, indeed, the instability of passion is regarded as a
                            cogent reason for making marriages indissoluble. It has been said,
                            truly, we believe, that a family cannot live on the tempests of love,
                            and that when two beings have nothing but sentiment to go through life
                            on, they soon exhaust its resources, and ere long satiety and disgust
                            ensue.</p>
                        <p>The selection of a wife is so entirely a personal matter that it would
                            seem obtrusive and presumptuous to make any suggestions on the subject.
                            It has been said, however, that "many men, when thinking of marriage,
                            prefer a girl taken straight from the convent impregnated with an
                            atmosphere of devotion to one who has been trained in the school of
                            society. On the one hand is the girl who has nothing left to learn, who
                            reads and discusses the papers, who has spun round ball-rooms in the
                            arms of countless young men, who has seen every play and devoured every
                            novel, who does not trouble her head about religion and has evolved her
                            own morality. On the other hand is the guileless simple girl."</p>
                        <p>It certainly is not an ideal marriage where the most the wife can say of
                            her husband is, that there is nothing in him which offends her; it is
                            where her love for him is of the kind which makes the heart throb, at
                            the sound <pb id="VAA3932-043" n="35"/> of a step, when she is thrilled
                            at the lightest tones of his voice, or the caress of a burning glance,
                            that conjugal felicity is supreme.</p>
                        <p>This oneness of husband and wife is marvelous. The devoted wife is not
                            content with wedding a man's heart, she must also share his thoughts. It
                            has been said<ref id="ref_6" rend="super" target="note_6" targOrder="U"
                                >2</ref> that when a man is adored by his wife, she can read his
                            face like a book, she knows the slightest quiver of his muscles, she
                            divines the reason when he is calm, she questions herself when he is the
                            least sad, wondering if she is in fault, she watches his eyes; to her
                            those eyes are colored by his ruling thought&#151;they love or they
                            love not.</p>
                        <p>An eminent writer discussing the subject of marriage declares that
                            "perfect happiness is only to be found at either extreme of the
                            intellectual scale; there is a like equability of temperament in the
                            good-natured idiot and in the man of genius, arising in the one case
                            from weakness, and in the other from strength of character. Both are
                            capable of a constant sweetness of temper, which softens the roughnesses
                            of life. Both natures are simple and transparent; the one because of its
                            shallowness, the other by reason of its depth. Clever women, therefore,
                            are sufficiently ready to take a dunce as the best substitute for a man
                            of genius." On account of his eminence as a writer and his profundity as
                            a thinker, it is with great diffidence that we express grave doubts of
                            the correctness of his conclusion. It certainly is not in harmony with
                            the view of Mrs. Thomas Carlyle who implored a young woman not to marry
                            a genius, saying: "I married one and am miserable."<note id="note_6"

                        <p>An incalculable amount of happiness is found in married life, but of
                            course there are many exceptional cases. Many historical characters are
                            supposed to have their matrimonial wrongs strongly established. Such was
                            Job with his wife, and Socrates with Xanthippe, and Richard Hooker
                            rocking the cradle, and John Wesley having his whiskers pulled.</p>
                        <p>A happy wife has affirmed that, "Not to her dearest friend, not to her
                            mother, not, perhaps even to herself, can a bride speak of her
                            happiness. This memory ought to remain absolutely our own, an added
                            rapture&#151;a thing beyond words, too sacred for disclosure."</p>
                        <p>As a rule the novelist of the period is singularly derelict in duty. His
                            work is incomplete; he is a quitter. The story usually ends with the
                            solemnization of the marriage and the regular expression for a bride,
                            "pale and shrinking." Why does he not pursue the subject further and
                            depict the gradual, gentle, but delightful transition from the rapture
                            of courtship to the placid joys of wedded life? Why should he completely
                            ignore the history of a happy household which has been compared to that
                            of a prosperous state? Why should he not dilate, with the utmost
                            minuteness of detail, upon the quiet and faithful intercourse of home
                            where the man always finds a woman at his side? Why not reveal to the
                            reader the family in all its strength and holiness, and depict the
                            delightful calm, the intimacy, the sharing alike of good and evil, the
                            glory of the home? He might discant, in elegant and fascinating
                            language, upon the peaceful and gracious life of the domestic hearth. He
                            might furnish an ample illustration of the truth that it is both the <pb
                                id="VAA3932-045" n="37"/> destiny and glory of woman to cling to a
                            man. If he wished concrete examples, drawn from the pages of history, he
                            might recite the poignant regret of Beethoven as he approached the end
                            of life&#151;that he had never married, and was in consequence
                            deprived of that feeling of home and comfort which only the unceasing
                            care of refined womanhood can bestow. He might refer to the venerable
                            and distinguished John Bigelow, diplomatist and statesman, who at the
                            age of ninety-four, has just returned from a long European
                            tour&#151;and recite the dedication of his great work recently
                            published, "Retrospections of an Active Life": "To Jane Poultney
                            Bigelow, my wife, and mother of my children, these volumes are
                            gratefully dedicated." He might expatiate upon the exquisite beauty of
                            this dedication, suggesting, as it does, all the loves and tendernesses
                            of the home and domestic life&#151;conjugal, paternal, maternal,
                            fraternal, filial&#151;a glorious combination, indeed! He might
                            demonstrate that absolute perfection in woman is unattainable without
                            the softening influence of maternity. He might give emphasis to the fact
                            that the only consolation to woman for the loss of beauty are dear and
                            loving children. It would be within his power to excite the tenderest
                            emotions by depicting such scenes as a child resting on its mother's
                            arm, or a mother sitting like a queen, in the midst of her children; and
                            he might contrast the situation with that of the woman president of a
                            federation of clubs who, amid sobs and tears, is endeavoring to decide
                            an intricate question of parliamentary law in the midst of a tumultuous
                            and hysterical assembly. As a grand climax he might recount how an <pb

                            soft endearments of marriage, without ever experiencing its bitterness;
                            and enjoyed unimpaired health, the fruit of temperance and tranquillity

                        <p>Much of what we know is of colloquial acquisition. Something may be
                            learned from nearly every one we meet, and we should not be over
                            fastidious as to the manner of the talker, or the subject-matter of his
                            conversation. Montaigne declares that "the study of books is a
                            languishing and feeble notion that heats not; but if I converse with a
                            man of mind, and no flincher, who presses hard upon me, and digs at me
                            right and left, his imagination raises up mine, it stimulates me to
                            something above myself." Of course, there is but little information to
                            be gained or benefit derived from mere chatting, or idle and familiar
                            talk; and there are those whose conversation is both charming and
                            instructive in a tête-a-tête, but who are absolutely dumb in a salon or
                            general conversation. It has been said that he who speaks sows and he
                            who listens reaps in colloquy, and it behooves us, therefore, to
                            cultivate the difficult art of becoming good listeners. They are indeed
                            very rare; it requires concentration of mind, and high moral and
                            intellectual qualities. It has been observed that the hypocrisy of the
                            hearer is not difficult to detect&#151;that the eye refuses to
                            dissemble&#151;that by its "dull vacant stare, its introspective <pb
                                id="VAA3932-048" n="40"/> look, or its restless wandering from place
                            to place it will betray the hypocritical hearer in spite of every
                            attempt at deception." The suggestion of Sir Mathew Hale is admirable:
                            In conversation, learn as near as you can, where the skill or excellence
                            of any person lies; put him upon talking on that subject, observe what
                            he says, keep it in your memory or commit it to writing.</p>
                        <p>The power of conversation is marvelous. It is said that Chamfort's
                            extraordinary influence upon French society was exercised wholly in
                            conversation, in sallies of wit, in those sparkling sayings "which make
                            one laugh and think at the same time."<ref id="ref_7" rend="super"
                                target="note_7" targOrder="U">1</ref>
                        </p>
                        <p>It needs tact to know when to be silent and when to speak; but it is true
                            of conversation as of many other things, that the half is better than
                            the whole. The Dutch in the Spice Islands recognized this fact when they
                            destroyed one-half of the timber in order to make the other half more
                            valuable.</p>
                        <p>To excel in conversation, says Hazlett, one must not be always striving
                            to say good things; to say one good thing, one must say many bad, and
                            more indifferent ones; and he declares that he would rather have water
                            than nectar for a steady drink&#151;bread and butter than ambrosia
                            for his daily bread.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to say what makes a conversationalist. It has been
                            remarked that there are people who possess every qualification for
                            conversing except the power to converse&#151;that there are two
                            absolutely essential things: in the first place a certain charm of mind,
                            and even <pb id="VAA3932-049" n="41"/> manner, which is a purely
                            instinctive gift; and in the second place real sympathy with, real
                            interest in, the person with whom you converse. A mere dribbling into
                            words of casual thoughts is not conversation; to be profitable, it must
                            be regarded as a definite mental occupation and, to make social
                            intercourse of value, of course there must be an opportunity for perfect
                                relaxation.<note id="note_7" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                        <p>Intense strenuousness in other pursuits is the deadly enemy of profitable
                            colloquy; it would be a waste of time to attempt to carry on a
                            conversation with one who declares "I am so tired" or, "I cannot wait
                            for my dessert to-day, I am so busy." We have known school teachers and
                            others who have gravitated into this condition of demoralization; in
                            fact, we are all more or less subject to it unless we make an
                            extraordinary effort to restrain it. It has been asserted that the one
                            thing which distinguishes the truly great, either by birth or mental
                            acquirements, is repose; and an eminent author has affirmed that he
                            could recognize the leading men of any community by their slower walk
                            and more abstracted expression of countenance.</p>
                        <p>Herbert Spencer confessed that such powers as he possessed in the
                            direction of conversation were of the tête-à-tète order; and it was his
                            opinion that to be a salon talker requires a certain self-possession, a
                            kind of grasp of the different individuals that surround you which he
                            declared to be of the nature of Napoleonic strategy. When conversation
                            became tedious to him, he simply put stoppers in his ears to blur the
                            sense of the talk. He declared that nothing worried him more than what
                            he was pleased to call "this surface cackle" <pb id="VAA3932-050" n="42"
                            /> that has to be indulged in in general society, simply to fill the
                            time.</p>
                        <p>In considering this subject it would be invidious and inappropriate to
                            completely ignore the views of the ancients, even though we may not give
                            them our unqualified approval. Epictetus enjoins that we "should be for
                            the most part silent, or speak merely what is necessary, and in few
                            words. * * * We may not enter into discourse on any of the common
                            subjects of gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or
                            feasts, the vulgar topics of conversation. * * * If you happen to be
                            taken among strangers, be silent. * * * Let not your laughter be much
                            nor on many occasions, nor profuse."</p>
                        <p>We all know that the cultivation of the voice is of transcendent
                            importance in singing. The voice is no less an important factor in
                            giving charm and interest to public speaking and conversation. Madame
                            Roland did not exaggerate when she declared that the voice is the key
                            which unlocks the heart. The lawyers and statesmen of Colonial Virginia
                            were celebrated for their forensic eloquence and power; at no period and
                            in no country, was the art of oratory cultivated with greater assiduity,
                            and the voice was always regarded as a prime consideration. The
                            historian of the period referring to Patrick Henry declared, that in
                            mild persuasion his voice was as soft and gentle as the zephyr of
                            spring; while in rousing his countrymen to arms, the winter storm that
                            roars along the troubled Baltic was not more awfully sublime. Of Edmund
                            Pendleton it was said that he had that silver voice of which Cicero
                            makes such frequent and honorable mention&#151;an articulation
                            uncommonly <pb id="VAA3932-051" n="43"/> distinct&#151;a perennial
                            stream of transparent, cool and sweet elocution. Referring to Richard
                            Henry Lee the historian affirms that the note of Lee's voice was deeper
                            and more melodious than that of Mr. Pendleton. It was the canorous voice
                            of Cicero. * * * His speech was so copious, so rich, so mellifluous, set
                            off with such bewitching cadence of voice, and such captivating grace of
                            diction, that while you listened to him, you desired to hear nothing
                            superior, and indeed thought him perfect. I have in mind a lady who,
                            even in relating the most unimportant incident, is charming, largely on
                            account of the seductive softness and sweetness of her voice. Indeed, we
                            can conceive of no more fascinating feminine accomplishment than the
                            ability to converse entertainingly. Of course, originality of both
                            thought and manner adds to the charm of conversation as does brilliant
                            repartee. We have read of a fascinating conversationalist of whom it was
                            said: His thrilling voice, which lent an added charm to thoughts, in
                            themselves so exquisite, reminded one of the nightingale's note. * * *
                            Words flowed upon words with the rush of the torrent. It was the
                            overflow of the heart. The boy, the fair-haired boy, the blue-eyed boy
                            of fifteen, the son of highly cultivated and refined parents, whose
                            demeanor inspired in every one a wish to know him&#151;would have
                            been less fascinating but for the fact that his voice was as clear as
                            crystal and seemed to have an emotional quality.</p>
                        <p>Young gentlemen should lose no time in cultivating their colloquial
                            powers. A charming and very popular young southern girl of eighteen
                            summers, remarked: <pb id="VAA3932-052" n="44"/> "Mr. Daugherty, I like
                            the boys very well but the trouble is so many of them have not the art
                            of conversation."</p>
                        <p>The fascination of a certain lady's conversation was attributed to the
                            fact that what she said seemed to be a continuation of what was said to
                            her.</p>
                        <p>How perfectly delightful it must have been to listen to the brilliant and
                            scintillating conversation of John Randolph of Roanoke, or the wise and
                            polished utterances of Sir James Mackintosh. Randolph was for more than
                            thirty years the political meteor of congress. He was not only a
                            profound and brilliant statesman, but a gentleman of incomparable
                            literary taste. Speaking of Randolph, Colonel Benton says: "The last
                            time I saw him, after his return from the Russian mission, I heard him
                            read the chapter in the Revelations (of the opening of the seals) with
                            such power and beauty of voice and delivery, and such depth of pathos,
                            that I felt as if I had never heard the chapter read before. When he had
                            got to the opening of the sixth seal, he stopped the reading, laid the
                            book (open at the place) on his breast, as he lay on his bed, and began
                            a discourse upon the beauty and sublimity of the scriptural writings,
                            compared to which he considered all human compositions vain and empty.
                            Going over the images presented by the opening of the seals, he averred
                            that their divinity was in their sublimity&#151;that no human power
                            could take the same images, and inspire the same awe and terror, and
                            sink ourselves into such nothingness in the presence of the "wrath of
                            the lamb"&#151;that he wanted no proof of their divine origin but
                            the sublime feelings which they inspired."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-053" n="45"/>
                        <p>Randolph possessed a wealth of "copious wit and classical allusion."
                            Colonel Benton heard many brilliant talks from him. On such occasions,
                            "a flow for hours (at one time seven hours)" of copious wit and
                            classical allusion&#151;a perfect scattering of the diamonds of the
                            mind." "I heard a friend remark on one of these occasions," says Colonel
                            Benton, "he has wasted intellectual jewelry enough here this evening to
                            equip many speakers for great orations."</p>
                        <p>Sir James Mackintosh, publicist, historian, statesman and philosopher,
                            died in 1832. He was one of the most cultured and catholic-minded men of
                            his time; and it was said of him that even at a very early age he bore
                            the reputation of a prodigy for multifarious reading and learning. With
                            his other accomplishments, Sir James was a charming conversationalist.
                            Macaulay affirms that his mind was "a vast magazine, admirably arranged;
                            everything was there and everything was in its place." Robert Hall
                            declares that his mind "was a spacious repository hung round with
                            beautiful images, and when he wanted one he had nothing to do but reach
                            his hand to a peg and take it down."</p>
                        <p>The soul of conversation is sympathy, and it has been truly said<ref
                                id="ref_8" rend="super" target="note_8" targOrder="U">2</ref> that
                            argument is the death of conversation, if carried on in a spirit of
                            hostility; but discussion is a pleasant and profitable thing, where you
                            advance and defend your opinions as far as you can, and admit the truth
                            of what is objected against them with equal impartiality. This tone of
                            conversation was well described by Dr. Johnson, when he said of some
                            party at which <pb id="VAA3932-054" n="46"/> he had been present the
                            night before&#151;"We had a good talk, Sir!"<note id="note_8"

                        <p>Talking "shop" in a large company is equally destructive of conversation;
                            it causes much embarrassment and confusion. Its effect is not unlike
                            that of the disturbance caused in a country dance by one who does not
                            understand the figure; and persistency in this course is regarded by
                            cultivated and refined people as equivalent to absolute rudeness. It has
                            been truly observed that persons of different trades and professions may
                            all have great knowledge and ingenuity in their several vocations, the
                            details of which will be very edifying to themselves, and just as
                            incomprehensible to their neighbors; but over and above this
                            professional and technical knowledge, they must be supposed to have a
                            stock of common sense and common feeling to furnish subjects for common
                            conversation, or to give them any pleasure in each other's company. An
                            eminent man declared, more than a century ago, that a doctor in good
                            society never talks of medicine, true nobles never speak of their
                            ancestors, men of genius do not discuss their works; then why should
                            some school teachers and professors, in a large company, incessantly
                            prate of their schools and colleges?</p>
                        <p>Occasionally, we meet with an individual whose conversation attracts us
                            no matter how nonsensical it may be. Coleridge is an example. Hazlitt
                            affirms that Coleridge could talk to all sorts of people, on all sorts
                            of subjects, without caring a farthing for their understanding one word
                            he says&#151;and he talks only for admiration and to be listened to,
                            and accordingly the least <pb id="VAA3932-055" n="47"/> interruption
                            puts him out. I firmly believe, says Hazlitt, he would make just the
                            same impression on half his audiences, if he purposely repeated absolute
                            nonsense with the same voice and manner and inexhaustible flow of
                            undulating speech! It was the habit of Coleridge when addressing public
                            meetings to make long-winded prefatory apologies for his youth and
                            inexperience. He was cured of this habit, however, by Horne Tooke, one
                            of his literary contemporaries. On one occasion, when Coleridge was
                            making his usual introductory apology, Horne Tooke abruptly called out,
                            "Speak up, young man." Coleridge, completely disconcerted, took his
                            seat, and it is nowhere recorded that he ever again committed the
                            offense. Carlyle did not appreciate the volubility of Coleridge. On one
                            occasion he exclaimed, after listening to one of Coleridge's harangues,
                            "To sit still and be pumped into is never an exhilarating process."</p>
                        <p>It has been truly said that one often feels an imperative need of silence
                            and recollection and repose. Carlyle must have been in this mood when on
                            meeting a great talker at dinner, he laid down his knife and fork, and
                            said in a voice of agonized entreaty: "For God's sake take me away, and
                            put me in a room by myself and give me a pipe of tobacco."<ref

                        <p>Gibbon, the historian, mentions the fact that four days in the week he
                            had a place, without invitation, at the hospitable table of the
                            celebrated Helvetius and, he declares, that in these synposia the
                            pleasures of the table were improved by lively and liberal
                                conversation.<note id="note_9" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                        <p>Helvetius was the friend of Fontenelle, Voltaire and
                            Montesquieu&#151;was not only the handsomest man of his time, but
                            was possessed of a manner singularly charming and of incomparable
                            conversational powers. His famous book, "Del 'Esprit," the composition
                            of which occupied him more than seven years, was translated into almost
                            all the languages of Europe, and was discussed in every literary circle.
                            We may well believe that the exquisite enjoyment derived from these
                            conversations was mutual, because, we have somewhere read, that the
                            young lady of a house where Gibbon had his temporary abode, expressed a
                            desire to marry him, in order that her parents might continue to enjoy
                            his society and his interesting and fascinating conversation.</p>
                        <p>It is no doubt quite a solace and comfort to a man fatigued by intense
                            mental labor or worn by the cares and struggles of life, to meet at the
                            fireside a dull simple minded person of kindly disposition, with whom he
                            can converse. Lord Mansfield found such a person and during winter
                            evenings when exhausted by the work of the day, his lordship used him as
                            a kind of cushion for his understanding. Some years ago there lived in
                            Southern Indiana a profound lawyer and jurist who performed an immense
                            amount of mental labor. It was observed by his friends that on Sunday he
                            never failed to attend a church, presided over by an illiterate minister
                            of the old type, whose only claim to distinction was based upon his
                            nonsensical and insipid platitudes with their usual
                            accompaniments&#151;violent jesticulation and marvelous power of
                            vociferation. The jurist was asked why he attended this church when
                            there were <pb id="VAA3932-057" n="49"/> other churches convenient in
                            which educated ministers of ability and learning officiated. He replied,
                            that when Sunday arrived he felt exhausted by the labors of the week,
                            and that by attending the church in question he was enabled to enjoy an
                            hour of absolute mental repose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Hazlitt gives an account of those delightful conversations at Lamb's.
                            "We used to have many lively skirmishes at Lamb's at their Thursday
                            evening parties. * * * There was Lamb himself, the most delightful, the
                            most provoking, the most witty and sensible of men. He always made the
                            best pun, and the best remark in the course of the evening. His serious
                            conversation, like his serious writing, is his best. No one ever
                            stammered out such fine, piquant, deep, eloquent things in a half a
                            dozen sentences as he does. His jests scald like tears; and he probes a
                            question with his play upon words. * * * What choice venom! How often
                            did we cut into the haunch of letters, while we discussed the haunch of
                            mutton on the table!"</p>

                        <head type="subtitle">TOWN AND COUNTRY.</head>
                        <p>In ancient times it was considered that the first requisite to happiness
                            was that a man be born in a famous city; but Plutarch very justly
                            observes that it makes no difference where one may have been born
                            because real happiness consists principally in the disposition and habit
                            of the mind.</p>
                        <p>The preference for town or country is largely determined by the
                            temperament and disposition of the individual. There are certain finely
                            strung and sensitive natures whose spirits are affected not only by the
                            climate, but by the scenery amid which they live. It is said that the
                            Englishman, "saturated with the fogs of his island, is notoriously less
                            cheerful than the inhabitants of sunny France." There are some places we
                            admire and others we love, and Le Bruyère declared that it seemed to him
                            that wit, humor, passion, taste and sentiment, depend on the place we
                            live in. The influence of places upon us is, indeed, marvelous; an
                            eminent writer was led to declare that if melancholy comes over us by
                            the margin of a great water another indelible law of our nature so
                            orders it that the mountains exercise <pb id="VAA3932-059" n="51"/> a
                            purifying influence upon our feelings, and among the hills passion gains
                            in depth by all that it apparently loses in vivacity. It is with
                            ineffable delight that the poet escapes from the smoke, glare and noise
                            of city life to drink in the sweet air of country lanes and fields. The
                            devotee of the country will assure you that God made the country and man
                            made the town, and that it is not a matter of surprise that so many
                            cultured and refined people are charmed with life in the country. He
                            will declare that living in the country is conducive to health and
                            longevity; that the pleasures of town life are, of course, within the
                            reach of every man who is regardless of his health, his money, and his
                            company. He will descant upon the salutary influence of the mountains
                            upon the mind, that they make one calm&#151;notwithstanding it is
                            the experience of many that the effects of mountain scenery are
                            exciting. Herbert Spencer, of whom it was said that he was not devoid of
                            esthetic perception, affirmed that the sight of a mountain and music
                            heard in a cathedral, were two of the things that moved him most.</p>
                        <p>Another will declare that he finds no monotony, no tedium in this quiet
                            life in the country&#151;that there is a certain morality, a certain
                            religion in the spirit of a secluded and country existence&#151;that
                            here he does not know the evil passions which ambition and strife are
                            said to arouse, and is thus enabled to lead a life unembittered by
                            contumely and devote himself to the agreeable duties of home and family.
                            He will tell you that all his life long he has loved rivers and poets
                            who sang of rivers&#151;and will recite the fact that even very <pb
                                id="VAA3932-060" n="52"/> young children are never more supremely
                            happy than when playing on the banks of a stream of water&#151;a
                            sentiment and desire which seem to be indigenous to our nature. He will
                            remind you that on account of his fondness for the song of the birds at
                            Cambridge, it was difficult to prevail upon the cultured and refined
                            Lowell to visit the city. He will relate, with much earnestness and
                            enthusiasm, that Rousseau and many other of the world's celebrities
                            sincerely preferred wild nature to a cultivated garden. He will urge
                            that life in the country is conducive to study and meditation, as one
                            may there find the solitude which is so indispensable to the student and
                            writer; and he will insist that "no considerable work was ever composed
                            till its author, like an ancient magician, first retired to the grove,
                            or to the closet, to invocate." He will quote the exact language of
                            Daniel Webster, when he declared: "I like to contemplate nature, and to
                            hold communion unbroken by the presence of human beings. When thinking
                            is to be done one must, of course, be alone. No man knows himself who
                            does not sometimes keep his own company." He will remind you that many
                            persons whose vocation is that of literature have remained in seclusion,
                            almost conventual, for long periods of time; that Voltaire,
                            notwithstanding he had talents well adapted for society, at one period
                            of his life passed five years in the most secret seclusion, and indeed
                            usually lived in retirement; and that Hawthorne withdrew himself from
                            the face of man, and meditated for twelve lonely years on humanity. He
                            will admit that there are men who think <pb id="VAA3932-061" n="53"/>
                            things out in town, but will affirm that they are the strong men of
                            abounding energy, who do their thinking only with their brains.</p>
                        <p>The degree of comfort and delight derived from country life must, of
                            course, depend upon climate, scenery and environments, as well as upon
                            the temperament and disposition of the individual. The vale of Cashmere,
                            an elevated and enclosed valley in the Himalaya mountains, though not
                            accessible to all who may wish to live or sojourn in the country, would
                            seem to be an ideal spot for such retirement. Much has been said and
                            written about the beauty of the vale of Cashmere. "Spring encircles a
                            fresh, green, smiling valley with a noble belt of glistening snow-capped
                            ridges; autumn fills the eye with the wonderful richness of the many
                            colored foliage. At all times flows on the quiet glassy river, showing
                            back the groves and avenues from its banks."<ref id="ref_10"

                                <p>It appears that the periodical rains, which almost deluge the
                                    rest of India, are shut out of Cashmere by the height of the
                                    mountains, so that only light showers fall there; these,
                                    however, are in abundance enough to fill some hundreds of
                                    cascades, which are precipitated into the valley, from every
                                    part of this stupendous and romantic bulwark that encircles it.
                                    The soil is the richest that can be conceived, and its
                                    productions those of the temperate zone.</p>

                        <p>Some of us know that it is especially delightful in midwinter to leave
                            the inhospitable climate of the north for tropical and semi-tropical
                            regions. Ambassador White, during an official visit to Santo Domingo,
                            was charmed by the wonderful beauty of the scenery, <pb id="VAA3932-062"
                                n="54"/> the luxuriance of the vegetation, and the bracing warmth of
                            the climate, while the United States were going through a winter of
                            unusual severity.</p>
                        <p>The splenetic and fastidious Hazlitt contrasts the town and country. What
                            he says is very interesting, but, of course, it can have only a limited
                            application to our own age and country.</p>
                        <p>"If familiarity in cities breeds contempt, ignorance in the country
                            breeds aversion and dislike.</p>
                        <p>"People come too much in contact in town, in other places they live too
                            much apart, to unite cordially and easily. Our feelings in the former
                            case are dissipated and exhausted by being called into constant and vain
                            activity; in the latter they rust and grow dead for want of use. * * *
                            If these, then, are the faults and vices of the inhabitants of town or
                            of the country, where should a man go to live, so as to escape from
                            them? I answer, that in the country we have the society of the groves,
                            the fields, the brooks, and in London a man may keep to himself, or
                            choose his company as he pleases. * * * In the country, men have no idea
                            but of individuals, none of rights or principles&#151;and a king as
                            the greatest individual, is the highest idea they can form. He is a
                            'species alone,' and as superior to any single peasant as the latter is
                            to the peasant's dog, or to a crow flying over his head. In London, the
                            king is but as one to a million, is seldom seen, and then distinguished
                            only from others by the superior graces of his person. A country squire
                            or a lord of the manor is a greater man in his village or hundred!"</p>
                        <p>That Hazlitt had a partiality for rural scenes and <pb id="VAA3932-063"
                                n="55"/> rural sports is manifest, from the following excerpts from
                            his essay on "Novelty and Familiarity": "Who would not rather see a
                            dance in the forest of Mont-morenci on a summer's evening by a hundred
                            laughing peasant girls and their partners, who come to this scene for
                            several miles round, rushing through the forest glades, as the heart
                            panteth for the water-brooks, than all the pirouettes and entrechats
                            performed at the French opera by the whole <hi rend="i">corps de
                                ballet?"</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Of course the advantages are not all on the side of the country. Sidney
                            Smith, in considering the subject, declared that the charm of London is
                            that you are never glad or sorry for ten minutes together; in the
                            country you are one and the other for weeks.</p>
                        <p>Diderot, of whom a celebrated woman said that four lines from his pen
                            made her ponder more, and interested her more, than a complete work by
                            any other author&#151;had a keen appreciation of the beauties of the
                            country. He said to the young husband: "Arise from your couch in the
                            early morn, in spite of the fascinations of the young and charming woman
                            at whose side you repose, in order that you may see the rising of the
                            sun in all his glory, and view the beautiful landscape moist with dew
                            and glistening with light."</p>
                        <p>Eminent men in all ages, and representing almost every vocation in life,
                            have been stirred by bucolic dreams of a farm and the charms of
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>John Hampden, the renowned leader of the Long Parliament, retired to the
                            duties and pleasures of a rural life. His country seat was located in
                            one of the most beautiful parts of the county of Buckingham. We <pb
                                id="VAA3932-064" n="56"/> read that the house was an old English
                            mansion, built in the days of the Plantagenets and the Tudors; that it
                            stood on the brow of a hill which overlooked a narrow valley. "That the
                            extensive woods which surround it were pierced by long avenues; that in
                            this delightful retreat Hampden passed several years, performing with
                            great activity all the duties of a landed gentleman and a magistrate,
                            and amusing himself with books and with field sports."</p>
                        <p>Lord Bacon, in his intervals of rest from his political and judicial
                            duties, was in the habit of retiring to Gorhamburg. At that place his
                            favorite amusement was gardening&#151;which he declared to be "the
                            purest of human pleasures."</p>
                        <p>He has lived to no purpose who has not observed the instability and
                            fickleness of public opinion. Public men, even those whose services to
                            the State have been invaluable, oftentimes become the victims of the
                            whims and coquetries of public opinion, and have retired to the country
                            for solace and comfort, and to be relieved from contumely and the
                            objurgations of their countrymen. The English statesman, Sir William
                            Temple, whom Macaulay characterized as a man of lively parts and quick
                            observation, a man of the world among men of letters, and a man of
                            letters among men of the world&#151;having fallen into disfavor and
                            having seen clearly that the tempest was gathering fast, retired with
                            his family to Moor Park. In that spot, then very secluded, Temple passed
                            the remainder of his life. "The air agreed with him. The soil was
                            fruitful, and well suited to the experimental farmer and gardner. The
                                <pb id="VAA3932-065" n="57"/> gardens were laid out with the angular
                            regularity which Sir William had admired in the flower beds of Haarlem
                            and the Hague. A beautiful rivulet flowing from the hills of Surrey,
                            bounded the domain."</p>
                        <p>Thomas Carlyle, in the selection of his country-seat, seems not to have
                            been influenced by the beauty of landscape or luxuriance of foliage.
                            "Hawkscliff," to which he removed, was a wild moorland farm. He said:
                            "Here I can have my horse, pure milk diet, and go on with literature and
                            my life task generally, in the absolute solitude and pure silence of
                            nature, with loving and helpful faces around me."</p>
                        <p>George Meridith lived in a charming home near Box Hill in the midst of
                            the most exquisite woodland scenery.</p>
                        <p>Victor Hugo declared that he used to sleep like a child in his lonely
                            dwelling in the country, which was so situated that he could hear
                            beneath the casements the "soothing lullaby of the sea."</p>
                        <p>Rousseau also retired to a cottage near the seashore. He said that as
                            soon as he found himself among the trees, and in the midst of verdure,
                            he felt that he was in an earthly paradise, and experienced an inward
                            pleasure, just as if he were the happiest of human kind. He declared: "I
                            took a curious pleasure in watching the waves break at my feet. They
                            seemed to me to symbolize the tumult of the world, contrasted with the
                            peace of my habitation; and the thought sometimes moved me so much that
                            the tears ran down my cheeks."</p>
                        <p>Henry Clay loved Ashland, his beautiful country home near Lexington. In
                            his adjuration to the Senate <pb id="VAA3932-066" n="58"/> to pass his
                            pacificatory measure and thus prevent Civil War, he said (we quote from
                            memory): "Pass this bill and tranquilize the country and I am willing to
                            go home to Ashland and renounce public service forever. I will there
                            find, amidst my flocks and herds and in the bosom of my family,
                            sincerity and truth, attachment and fidelity, that I have not always
                            found in the walks of public life."</p>
                        <p>The country is the refuge sought by many men of high aspirations who have
                            become cynics and haters of mankind. Samuel Crisp, a literary
                            contemporary of Dr. Johnson, in an unfortunate hour, decided to write a
                            tragedy. He did so and it was called Crisp's "Verginia." It was said
                            that his talents and knowledge fitted him to appreciate almost every
                            species of intellectual superiority; but his drama proved to be a
                            failure and was so feeble and unnatural that it was barely saved from
                            instant damnation by the acting of Garrick and the partiality of the
                            audience. He became thoroughly disgusted with the world and all mankind,
                            and retired to a solitary and long deserted mansion built on a commons
                            in one of the wildest tracts of Surrey. It is said that "no road, not
                            even a sheep walk, connected his lonely dwelling with the abodes of
                            men." He lived many years but continued to the end to mourn for his
                            tragedy. We may conclude that while a residence or sojourn in the
                            country may cure many of the ills of life, it cannot even mitigate the
                            wounds of vanity.</p>
                        <p>Voltaire had most ardent admirers and bitter detractors during his life,
                            and this condition has continued <pb id="VAA3932-067" n="59"/> through
                            all the ages since his death. We are indebted to Gibbon for the
                            assertion that Voltaire, after forfeiting by his own misconduct, the
                            friendship of the first of Kings, he retired at the age of sixty, with a
                            plentiful fortune, to a free and beautiful country, and resided in the
                            neighborhood of Lausanne. Goldsmith, however, declares that Voltaire was
                            banished from his native country for a satire upon the royal concubine.
                            That he was tired at length of courts and all the follies of the great,
                            and retired to Switzerland, a country of liberty, where he enjoyed
                            tranquillity and the muse.</p>
                        <p>Victor Hugo delivered an oration on Voltaire on May 30, 1878, the one
                            hundredth anniversary of his death. At the risk of becoming amenable to
                            the charge of irrelevancy, which Hallam long ago declared to be only a
                            venial offense, we will reproduce a few excerpts from that memorable
                            oration:</p>
                        <p>"One hundred years ago to-day a man died. He died immortal.</p>
                        <p>"He was more than a man; he was an age. He had exercised a function and
                            fulfilled a mission.</p>
                        <p>"To sum up epochs, by giving them the names of men, has only been done by
                            three peoples: Greece, Italy, France. We say the Age of Augustus, the
                            Age of Louis Fourteenth, the Age of Voltaire.</p>
                        <p>"These appellations have a great significance. * * * Until Voltaire, they
                            were the names of the chiefs of states; Voltaire is more than the chief
                            of a state; he is a chief of ideas.</p>
                        <p>"Voltaire declared war against the coalitions of all <pb id="VAA3932-068"
                                n="60"/> the social iniquities. * * * And what was his weapon? That
                            which has the lightness of the wind and the power of the thunderbolt. A
                            pen."</p>
                        <p>Many eminent men, on account of declining health or advancing years, have
                            retired to the country for repose and recuperation. John Locke who at
                            the end of twenty years' labor gave to the world that marvelous work,
                            "The Essay on the Human Understanding," occupied the manor of Oates in
                            Essex. He was then fifty-eight years of age. This was said to be the
                            brightest of all his homes. Notwithstanding he was troubled with asthma
                            and other ailments he survived fourteen years, deriving unspeakable
                            delight amid the beautiful foliage of rural England. "He there enjoyed,"
                            says his biographer, "as much domestic peace and literary leisure as was
                            consistent with broken health."</p>
                        <p>Lord Chesterfield whose letters to his son so abound in felicitous
                            thought and happy observation lived to a great old age. We read that by
                            reason of his numerous infirmities he lived at this period in complete
                            seclusion, the most painful ailment being that of total deafness. He
                            found his last solace in his charming country house at Blackheath. He
                            occupied himself with gardening, and the cultivation of melons and

                            Voltaire, then an old man, wrote Chesterfield a characteristic letter in
                            which he says: "I am content in believing that if you have the sunlight
                            in the beautiful house you have built, you will secure a few tolerably
                            happy moments; that is all one can hope for at our age. Cicero wrote a
                            beautiful treatise on old age, but he did not <pb id="VAA3932-069"
                                n="61"/> prove by the facts of his life the truth of his work; his
                            latter years were extremely unhappy. You have lived longer and more

                            charlatans, and this I consider a very uncommon quality, a quality
                            contributing to the glimpse of happiness we are allowed to enjoy in this
                            short life."</p>
                        <p>Charles Lamb seems to have divided his affections between the town and
                            the country: "I am in love with this great earth, the face of town and
                            country, the unspeakable rural solitudes and the sweet security of
                            streets. I would set up my tabernacle here. I am content to stand still
                            at the age to which I am arrived, I and my friends, to be no younger, no
                            richer, no handsomer. I do not want to be weaned by age, or drop like
                            mellow fruit, as they say, into the grave. * * * Sun and sky, and breeze

                        <p>It is as true as it is trite that in order to be happy one must be
                            occupied. Count Rumford recognized its truth in his House of Industry at
                            Munich. In order to inspire the rising generation with an early bias
                            toward labor he invited parents to send their children to his
                            establishment before they were old enough to do any kind of work, and
                            actually paid them for doing nothing but merely being present when
                            others were busy around them.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of Thomas Carlyle that the most unhappy of all men is
                            the man that cannot tell what he is going to do, that has got no work
                            cut out for him in the world and does not go into it. His last written
                            words were: "A life without work in it, as mine now is, has less and
                            less worth to me; nay, sometimes a feeling of disgrace and blame is in
                            me." He experienced the absolute necessity for incessant occupation even
                            in his very old age. Marcus Aurelius deplored the fact that there are so
                            many who fritter away their energies, wearying themselves with life,
                            without a settled aim to which they may direct every desire and every
                            thought. We all know from experience and observation that without
                            occupation <pb id="VAA3932-071" n="63"/> the whole nature lags; it makes
                            no progress, it attains no true value or dignity; and that nothing is
                            more conducive than idleness to morbidity of both mind and body. It has
                            been said<ref id="ref_11" rend="super" target="note_11" targOrder="U"

                        <p>Tacitus bitterly inveighs against those who loiter in voluptuousness and
                            inglorious ease. We know of a man who became absolutely sick of himself
                            by the fact that he had absolutely nothing to do, and by the transition
                            from an active to an indolent life; and we know of a woman who was bored
                            by the continual vacancy of her days. Rousseau declared that some women
                            in such cases take to love, some to drink, some to religion. It was the
                            observation of Pryde that young people should never be allowed to idle
                            away their time. Idleness is the soil from which almost every wickedness
                            grows. When we are idle our bodies and our minds soon become morbid.
                            Being morbid, we look at everything and everybody with a jaundiced eye;
                            and the people of every-day life seem insipid, tiresome and even
                            hateful.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of Perrèyve, the eminent Frenchman, that nothing
                            paralyzes the mind like the accepted habit of doing nothing; and he
                            observed that life, at watering places, is wonderful in this respect:
                            one has nothing to do, and yet never an instant to call his own. It is
                            idleness organized. His biographer avers that the misfortune of the
                            aristocracy seemed to Perrèyve to be want of occupation, especially in
                            young men; but he <pb id="VAA3932-072" n="64"/> found and approved a
                            tendency to combat this by giving them a professional training.<ref

                        <p>Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy" is regarded as one of the most marvelous
                            productions of the human mind. In this voluminous work the author
                            discusses the subject of melancholy from every conceivable
                            standpoint&#151;what it is, with all the kinds, causes and
                            symptoms&#151;and, as he himself declares, he treats the subject
                            philosophically, medicinally and historically. It is a storehouse of
                            quotations from Greek and Latin authors. The book went through five
                            editions in the author's lifetime, and Dr. Johnson declared that it was
                            the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours before the usual
                            time. After this learned and exhaustive dissertation he gives as the
                            best remedy for infelicity: "Be not solitary; be not idle."</p>
                        <p>One does not find repose in finding idleness. It is true that we may
                            sometimes envy the man who enjoys and rests, but it has been beautifully
                            and truly said that the smile of heaven settles on the front of him who
                            labors and aspires.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion to which some arrive that man was born to live "in the
                            convulsions of disquiet, or in the lethargy of idleness" is erroneous.
                            The owner of a small farm declared: I have no more than twenty acres of
                            ground, the whole of which I cultivate myself with the help of my
                            children; and our labor keeps off from us three great
                            evils&#151;idleness, vice and want. Work then without disputing it;
                            it is the only way to render life supportable.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-073" n="65"/>
                        <p>As a rule the life of all truly great men has been a life of intense and
                            incessant labor. It has been observed<ref id="ref_13" rend="super"
                                target="note_13" targOrder="U">3</ref> that when a very clever man,
                            or a very great man, takes to cultivating turnips and retiring, it is
                            generally an imposture. The moment men cease to talk of their turnips,
                            they are wretched and full of self-reproach. Let every man be occupied,
                            and occupied in the highest employment of which his nature is capable,
                            and die with the consciousness that he has done his best.<note

                        <p>It has been suggested that a young man should propose to himself a
                            brilliant and conspicuous goal, and go toward it secretly; let no one
                            see his methods or his progress&#151;and by all means to keep that
                            law of laws&#151;secrecy. It will be remembered that Lord Byron
                            adopted this method. In the midst of his rollicking set at Cambridge he
                            was secretly girding up his loins, and collecting his powers to make a
                            great struggle for fame. Having followed this regime he compared himself
                            to a slumbering volcano and longed to burst on the world; only a brief
                            period elapsed until he was able to say with truth: "I woke one morning
                            and found myself famous."</p>
                        <p>Of course it is not meant that the employment which is essential to
                            happiness must be incessant throughout the day. Mr. Benson deprecates
                            the fact that in literary work there are many people who work too long,
                            and try to prolong the energies of the morning into the afternoon, and
                            the tail of the afternoon into the peace of the evening.</p>
                        <p>The suffering from unemployed energy is no less poignant than that from
                            exhaustion. Indeed, a man's <pb id="VAA3932-074" n="66"/> health seldom
                            suffers from the work that he loves and does for his own sake.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of Hazlitt that no one is idle who can do anything.
                            That it is conscious inability, or the sense of repeated failure, that
                            prevents us from undertaking, or deters us from the prosecution of any
                            work. This is no doubt true in many cases, but it will not be denied
                            that oftentimes idleness is the result of disinclination&#151;a
                            dogged determination not to work. But we can all heartily concur in his
                            further observation that he who does nothing renders himself incapable
                            of doing anything; that while we are executing any work, we are
                            preparing and qualifying ourselves to undertake another.</p>
                        <p>The human countenance speaks volumes. The features of an industrious man,
                            with an informed and active mind, acquire a certain spirit and mobility
                            which is not observable in those of an idle person who spends the
                            greater part of his time in a state of stupor and thoughtless
                            repose.</p>
                        <p>We have all read of the fair and happy milk-maid who made her hand hard
                            with labor, and her heart soft with pity.</p>
                        <p>It is the plain unvarnished truth that if we wish to brush away the
                            cobwebs of melancholy from our brains we must get busy.</p>
                        <p>Gustave Flaubert, the French novelist, writes to Madame X: "The only way
                            not to be unhappy is to shut yourself up in art, and count everything
                            else as nothing. * * * I observe that I no longer laugh much, and am no
                            longer depressed. I am ripe. You talk of my serenity and envy me. * * *
                            I beat away at my anvil, <pb id="VAA3932-075" n="67"/> never troubling
                            myself whether it rains or blows, for hail or thunder. I was not like
                            that formerly. The change has taken place naturally, though my will has
                            counted for something in the matter."</p>

                        <p>A celebrated lady declared that she liked to entertain a circle of
                            gentlemen&#151;that it was so amusing to observe how they enjoy a
                            judiciously concocted repast. It is as true as it is trite, that the way
                            to a man's heart is through his stomach. Cleopatra is said to have owed
                            her empire over Cæsar as much to her suppers as to her
                            beauty&#151;and even so great a man as Cardinal Wolsey was
                            conciliated by the good dishes on the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Most
                            men will agree with the grave French jurist who wrote a learned work on
                            the physiology of taste, when he affirmed "that the discovery of a new
                            dish does more for human happiness than the discovery of a new star." It
                            has been said that it is France that leads the rest of the world in
                            civilization, and it is in France that the art of gastronomy has been
                            carried to the limit of perfection. We certainly all imperatively need a
                            nutritious diet and dire results have been known to follow its absence.
                            A regard for one's physical health is of primary importance. Among the
                            many sage observations of Dr. Johnson two have a bearing upon this
                            subject: "Every man is a rascal when he is sick;" and "A man who has no
                            regard for his stomach will have no <pb id="VAA3932-077" n="69"/> regard
                            for anything else." "That a man's energy, happiness and even goodness,
                            are dependent, more or less, upon his bodily condition, and consequently
                            upon the condition of his stomach, few persons at this day will hesitate
                            to admit. * * * A man of the kindest impulses has only to feed upon
                            indigestible food for a few days, and forthwith his liver is affected,
                            and then his brain. * * * Sydney Smith did not exaggerate when he
                            affirmed that old friendships are often destroyed by toasted cheese, and
                            hard salted meat has often led to suicide. * * * A man of unquestionable
                            piety once said that he could not worship God until he had eaten his
                            breakfast. * * * Voltaire affirms that the massacre of St. Bartholomew
                            was primarily due to the utter incapacity of the king to digest his
                            food. Had Josephine been a good cook, perhaps history might have been
                            spared one of its saddest scandals."<ref id="ref_14" rend="super"

                        <p>A person suffering from the effects of over-eating, or eating
                            indigestible food, is certainly in a pitiable condition. The tyranny of
                            the palate seems never to have been adequately described and criticized,
                            but an eminent French writer declared that in Paris the luxury of the
                            table is the courtesan's one competitor. The deplorable condition of
                            Jonathan Swift was said to have been caused by a surfeit of food. That
                            he suffered from nothing that could be called mental derangement until
                            the "labyrinthine vertigo," to which he was subject, produced paralysis,
                            a symptom of which was the automatic utterance of words ungoverned by
                            intention. "To think of him," says Thackeray, "is like thinking of the
                            ruin <pb id="VAA3932-078" n="70"/> of a great empire." We are here
                            reminded of the lines of Dr. Johnson:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"From Marlborough's eyes the streams of dotage flowed, And
                                Swift expired a driveller and a show."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>We have read of an ambassador who, during his splendid dinners at the
                            embassy, simply toyed with a bit of bread, not desiring to eat anything,
                            suffering as he was from induration of the liver caused by gastronomic
                            indiscretions.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador White is our authority for the statement that the ill nature
                            of Bismarck was caused by eating too many Plover's eggs, a diet which
                            was never considered favorable to digestion. Mr. White observes that
                            this had reference to the fact that certain admirers of the Chancellor
                            in the neighborhood of the North Sea were accustomed to send him, each
                            year, a large basket of plover's eggs, of which he was very fond. That
                            Bismarck's constant struggle against the disorders which beset him
                            became pathetic. He once asked the ambassador how he managed to sleep in
                            Berlin, and on being answered he said: "Well, I can never sleep in
                            Berlin at night when it is quiet; but as soon as the noise begins, about
                            four o'clock in the morning, I can sleep a little and get my rest for
                            the day." Bismarck, as we all know, was a man of iron will and is
                            regarded as the greatest German since Luther. His famous saying, "We
                            Germans fear God and naught beside," has become historic. We certainly
                            have here a most illustrious example of the tyranny of the palate.</p>
                        <p>We have read of a lady who ate little in order to attract <pb
                                id="VAA3932-079" n="71"/> the eye by her slender shape; but there
                            are considerations even more important than that. We are thoroughly
                            convinced that digestion is the great secret of life, and that
                            character, talents and virtues are powerfully affected by the quantity
                            and quality of the food we eat. It has been asserted by those versed in
                            dietetics that as a rule one-fourth of what we eat tends to sustain life
                            and the remaining three-fourths to destroy it. We think the man did not
                            exaggerate when he affirmed that a vast majority of people eat double,
                            if not treble, the food that is essential to robust health, and that the
                            excess engenders disease which induce a premature old age, and fill many
                            of its days with torment.</p>
                        <p>We read that in Greece the common people live on one meal a day, and the
                            richer on two, and that an English or American laborer will consume at
                            one meal what would serve a Greek family of six for a day. "They are
                            very courteous and very sunny in disposition, and entirely strangers to
                            melancholy, so that both suicide and insanity are unknown among them."
                            They are reputed to be the most temperate of Christian nations and the
                            chastest.</p>
                        <p>Jacquemont, the French traveler and naturalist, held to the doctrine that
                            man in a state of society eats entirely too much. He said: "I dine daily
                            with a piece of bread and cheese and a glass of wine, on the corner of
                            my writing-table." Most of us would consider this excessive
                            abstemiousness. He asserted, what is doubtless true, that to be able to
                            maintain health and strength on short rations is a most valuable
                            accomplishment for a traveler.</p>

                        <p>Herbert Spencer affirmed that one of the blessings that advancing years
                            had brought him was a certain freedom from depression. He was indebted
                            to an eminent doctor for a cure for this malady. His advice was: "Don't
                            eat pastry; and for a fortnight don't do anything you don't like. * * *
                            It is often a kind of cramp and needs an easier position. Try and get a
                            little change; read novels; don't get tired; sit in the open air." He
                            also acknowledged his indebtedness to a witty lady who suggested that a
                            recumbent position is a great aid to cheerfulness. Spencer was a
                            profound student and thinker and no doubt fully recognized the fact that
                            excessive concentration tends to impair digestibility.</p>
                        <p>Gibbon, the historian, was of tender constitution, and he declared that
                            while he never knew "the madness of superfluous health" his constitution
                            was greatly fortified by abstemiousness.</p>
                        <p>The venerable Senator Cockerill of Missouri, who, in his public capacity,
                            rendered valuable service to his country, being asked to account for his
                            admirable condition of physical and mental preservation, at his advanced
                            age, replied: "Many people eat very heartily at luncheon; I eat a big
                            apple and nothing more."</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bigelow, in dining with President Van Buren, observed that the latter
                            only drank one small wineglass of madeira at his dinner, and took no
                            dessert but an apple. He said that he never took any other dessert but a
                            little fruit, neither pudding nor pastry.</p>
                        <p>General James Grant Wilson in his sketch of the poet W. C. Bryant's life,
                            says Mr. Mathews, tells us that when he asked him the secret of his
                            health and vigor at <pb id="VAA3932-081" n="73"/> eighty and upward, the
                            poet replied: "It is all summed up in one word&#151;moderation. You
                            know I am a moderate eater and drinker, moderate in my work, as well as
                            in my pleasures."</p>
                        <p>It is a good and safe rule to punish our appetites rather than to be
                            punished by them. We occasionally meet with instances of gastronomic
                            perversity. Dryden ate raw meat, in large quantities, for the sake of
                            obtaining splendid dreams. Many persist in eating hard boiled eggs which
                            those skilled in dietetics will inform us become a tasteless leathery
                            substance, which can be of no more use in the stomach than so much skin
                            and hair. We now and then meet with a man whose voracity knows no
                            bounds. He will tell you that his stomach, like all nature, abhors a
                            vacuum; his digestion is so rapid and his appetite so speedily renewed,
                            that he ceases to be a man and becomes a mere digestive apparatus. But
                            these cases are rare. Then we sometimes meet with one who cherishes the
                            happy, but perverse, delusion that indigestion after dinner is a
                            complaint to be cured by a hearty supper.</p>
                        <p>It was said of an eminent jurist in explanation of his phenomenal success
                            that he lived eighty years and preserved his digestion unimpaired; and
                            Lord Oxford declared that on account of care and moderation in eating,
                            his stomach seemed likely to survive the rest of his person.</p>
                        <p>Radical temperance people insist on total abstinence from the use of
                            alcoholic liquor and other intoxicants at all times and under all
                            circumstances. It is our deliberate opinion that the intemperate
                            utterances and actions <pb id="VAA3932-082" n="74"/> of temperance
                            advocates have done more to retard the cause of real temperance than
                            anything else. Great good in the world has, without doubt, been
                            accomplished by agitation&#151;but the trouble is the agitator
                            rarely knows when to quit. The radicalism of the slavery agitators in
                            the North which finally precipitated a terrible civil war upon the
                            country is an illustration. They rejected with scorn the patriotic plan
                            proposed by Mr. Clay and other lovers of the Union to eliminate slavery,
                            preserve the Union and avert war. The extremists insisted on "a little
                            blood letting."</p>
                        <p>It is no part of our purpose to enter into any general consideration of
                            the subject of intemperance in drinking. That is, indeed, already a well
                            trodden field. We can not refrain, however, from enumerating some of the
                            good things arising from the discontinuance of the use of intoxicating
                            drinks, as noted by an eminent man of world-wide fame, who had himself
                            been addicted to the use of intoxicants at a former period of his life:
                            "First, sweet sleep; having never known what sleep was, I sleep like a
                            baby or a plow boy. If I wake no needless terrors, no black visions of
                            life, but pleasing hopes and pleasing recollections. If I dream it is
                            not of lions and tigers, but of things delightful to contemplate.
                            Secondly, I can take longer walks, and make greater exertions, without
                            fatigue. My understanding is improved and I comprehend political
                            economy. * * * The stomach quite at rest; no heart burn, no pain, no
                            distension."</p>
                        <p>We are indebted to Ambassador White, who has been much abroad, for the
                            assertion that the European takes <pb id="VAA3932-083" n="75"/> with his
                            dinners, as a rule, a glass or two of wine or beer, and is little, if at
                            all, the worse for it. If he ever takes any distilled liquor, he sips a
                            very small glass of it after his dinner, to aid digestion.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Chambers, a high authority on dietetics, declares that the effect on
                            a healthy man of taking with a meal such a quantity of fermented liquor
                            as puts him at ease with himself and the world around, without untoward
                            exhilaration, is to arrest the wear of the nervous system, especially
                            that part employed in emotion and sensation. Just as often, then, as the
                            zest for food is raised to its normal standard by a little wine or beer
                            with a meal, the moderate consumer is as much really better as he feels
                            the better for it. Where the food is as keenly enjoyed without it, the
                            consumption of a stimulant is useless. But alcohol is not a source of
                            force, and its direct action is an arrest of vitality. In a further
                            consideration of the subject the eminent doctor observes that "When a
                            man has tired himself by intellectual exertion, a moderate quantity of
                            alcoholic stimulant taken with food acts as an anesthetic, stays the
                            wear of the system which is going on, and allows the nerve force to be
                            turned to the due digestion of the meal. But it must be followed by rest
                            from toil, and is in essence a part of the same treatment which includes
                            rest&#151;it is an artificial rest. To continue to labor and at the
                            same time to take an anesthetic is a physiological inconsistency." Dr.
                            Chambers makes the further observation that there is no habit more fatal
                            to a literary man than that of taking stimulants between meals; the
                            vital powers go on wearing out more and more without their cry for <pb
                                id="VAA3932-084" n="76"/> help being perceived, and in the end break
                            down irrevocably.</p>
                        <p>But what shall we say of tea, that essentially feminine drink which
                            "cheers but does not inebriate?" We will let Lo Yu, the earliest Chinese

                        <p>In the present day the old proverb "He that increaseth knowledge
                            increaseth sorrow" has been given only a very limited application; and
                            it is no longer asserted that to be happy one must be a fool, upon the
                            theory that it is the empty vessel that has a merry ring. Even the
                            solemn warning of writers on dietetics that excessive concentration
                            impairs digestibility, has been disregarded; and the confident
                            declaration that the biographies of eminent men show that great powers
                            of mind are not friendly to cheerfulness, has been no less completely
                            ignored. These time-worn theories have been unceremoniously relegated to
                            the rear.</p>
                        <p>It is true that there have been celebrated men who, on account of some
                            singular perversity of disposition or temperament, have feigned to
                            regard every degree of literary attainments with indifference, and had
                            no appreciation whatever of the graces and refinements of literature in
                            others. In our own country, we have had a delectable exhibition of a
                            want of appreciation of literature, in the case of a hurly-burly
                            politician, who referred contemptuously to a man eminent in literature
                                <pb id="VAA3932-086" n="78"/> as "one of those literary fellows."
                            When Voltaire visited Congreve, the latter disclaimed the character of a
                            poet&#151;declared that his plays were trifles produced in an idle
                            hour, and begged that Voltaire would consider him merely as a gentleman.
                            "If you had been merely a gentleman," said Voltaire, "I should not have
                            come to see you."</p>
                        <p>It was said of Mr. Saurin, an eminent barrister, "That his leisure has
                            never been dedicated to the acquisition of scientific knowledge, nor has
                            he sought a relaxation from his severer occupations in the softness of
                            the polite arts. His earliest tastes and prelilections were always in
                            coincidence with his profession. Free from all literary addiction, he
                            not only did not listen to, but never heard the solicitations of the
                            muse."</p>
                        <p>Horace Walpole had an extreme aversion to being considered a man of
                            letters. "He wished to be looked upon," says Macaulay, "as one of those
                            epicurean gods of the earth who do nothing at all, and who pass their
                            existence in the contemplation of their own perfections. * * * Walpole
                            could not bear the imputation of having attended to anything so
                            unfashionable as the improvement of his mind."</p>
                        <p>The same author declares that his works "are destitute of every charm
                            which is derived from elevation or from tenderness of sentiment."</p>
                        <p>It was said of Trippier, the great French lawyer, that he was wholly
                            innocent of the sin of polite reading. Lord Manners had no taste for
                            general reading or solitary meditation&#151;and, it is affirmed of
                            him that he "dedicated his extrajudicial hours to social ease, and <pb
                                id="VAA3932-087" n="79"/> naturally fell into a companionship with
                            those who were least disposed to shake his faith in his prejudices."</p>
                        <p>Lord Abinger, for many years the most eminent member of the bar of
                            England, ignored literary pursuits; and, in the opinion of his
                            biographer, "his life teaches the evanescent character of the celebrity
                            of a mere advocate. He addicted himself exclusively to advocacy in the
                            courts. * * * Doubtless he despised the lofty aspirations of Erskine,
                            and the versatile usefulness of Brougham."<ref id="ref_15" rend="super"
                                target="note_15" targOrder="U">1</ref> Patrick Henry was richly
                            endowed by nature, but we are assured by his biographer that "in the
                            zenith of his glory, Mr. Henry had frequent occasion to deplore the
                            consequences of his early neglect of literature, and to bewail the
                            ghosts of his departed hours." His biographer adds: "Of Mr. Henry it was
                            certainly true, as Doctor Johnson observed of Swift, that he was not one
                            of those who, having lost one part of his life in idleness, are tempted
                            to throw away the remainder in despair."<note id="note_15"

                        <p>In the second quarter of the last century, De Tocqueville declared in his
                            "American Institutions" that "The inhabitants of the United States look
                            upon what is properly styled literary pursuits with a kind of
                            disapprobation. * * * If the observer singles out the learned, he will
                            be astonished to find how rare they are; but if he counts the ignorant,
                            the American people will appear to be the most enlightened community in
                            the world." If the eminent Frenchman were alive to-day, he might be
                            disposed to make some modifications of his opinion expressed
                            three-quarters of a century ago.</p>

                        <p>We are persuaded that the instances of absolute indifference or hostility
                            to literary pursuits, are distinguished by their singularity, and
                            operate as exceptions. Francis Bacon was a busy man, with his laborious
                            duties in the study and practice of law, and with the "assiduities of a
                            courtier's life;" but he found time during his periods of relaxation
                            from those duties, to retire to his beautiful retreat, Gorhamburg, where
                            he devoted himself wholly to study. The utilization of his hours of
                            leisure was the means of his becoming the father of modern science, and
                            giving to the world the "Baconian Philosophy." Alexander the Great was
                            fond of polite learning and found time for extensive reading. Erasmus
                            found time for literary pursuits. It was said that he was so much versed
                            in common life that he has transmitted to us the most perfect
                            delineation of the manners of his age; and that he "joined to the
                            knowledge of the whole such application to books, that he will stand
                            forever in the first rank of literary heroes." Hugo Grotius,
                            pre-eminently successful in his profession, and the great founder of
                            modern international law, found time to enjoy the pleasurers of
                            literature. "History, theology, jurisprudence, politics, classics,
                            poetry&#151;all these fields he cultivated, and has left numerous
                            works in each kind." Sir Mathew Hale, the head of his profession, and
                            Lord Chief Justice of England, devoted much time to the study of pure
                            mathematics, to investigations in physics and chemistry, and even to
                            anatomy and architecture; and there can be no doubt, says his
                            biographer, that this varied learning enhanced considerably the value of
                            many of his judicial decisions.</p>

                        <p>William Wirt, attorney-general of the United States, under the
                            administration of Mr. Monroe, and counsel in the celebrated case of
                            Aaron Burr, devoted much time to literature and gave to the reading
                            public several admired productions&#151;the beautiful life of
                            Patrick Henry being one of them. The same is true of Chancellor Kent.
                            His intense judicial and professional labors did not prevent him from
                            reading largely of history, poetry, geography, voyages and travels.
                            Judge Story, notwithstanding his prodigious judicial and authorial
                            labors, found time to engage in literary pursuits&#151;was an
                            indefatigable reader&#151;and his letters abound in literary
                            allusions. John Quincy Adams devoted much time to literature and general
                            reading. His biographer affirms that "Although Mr. Adams gave most of
                            his days to the service of his country, yet he was fond of literary
                            pursuits, and acquired during his hours of relaxation from sterner
                            duties, a vast fund of classic lore and useful learning." Hig biographer
                            adds: "That the reputation of Mr. Adams for literary and scholastic
                            attainments quite equaled his fame as a politician and statesman."</p>
                        <p>It will not be denied that intellectual work, labor in the upper regions
                            of mental effort, is one of the greatest achievements of man; and, day
                            by day, as time passes on, one becomes more and more convinced that the
                            pleasures of the mind are vastly superior to those of the senses. An
                            eminent writer<ref id="ref_16" rend="super" target="note_16"
                                targOrder="U">2</ref> urges the importance of cultivating a literary
                            taste as a foundation for the purest enjoyment the world affords. He
                            declares that a <pb id="VAA3932-090" n="82"/> book is a voiceless
                            teacher, and a great library is a virtual university; that a literary
                            taste brings its possessor into ever-renewing communion with all that is
                            noblest and best in the thought of the past. He says: "The winnowed and
                            garnered wisdom of the ages is his daily food. Whatever is lofty,
                            profound or acute in speculation, delicate or refined in feeling, wise,
                            witty or quaint in suggestion, is accessible to the lover of books. They

                        <p>Some one has observed that there is nothing more conducive to happiness
                            than the free exercise of the mind in pursuits congenial to it; and it
                            was the opinion of Doctor Johnson that a desire of knowledge is the
                            natural feeling of mankind, and he declared "that every human being
                            whose mind is not debauched will give all that he has to get
                            knowledge."</p>
                        <p>It is unquestionably true that the love of study is a passion which
                            derives fresh vigor from enjoyment and, as the historian Gibbon
                            suggests, it supplies each day, each hour, with a perpetual source of
                            independent and rational pleasure. It is said that one of the most
                            beautiful passages in the writings of Rousseau is that in the sixth book
                            of the "Confessions" where he describes the awakening in him of the
                            literary sense. "An indefinable taint of death had always clung about
                            him, and now in early manhood he believed himself smitten by mortal
                            disease. He asked himself how he might make as much <pb id="VAA3932-091"
                                n="83"/> as possible of the interval that remained; and he was not
                            biased by anything in his previous life when he decided that it must be
                            by intellectual excitement, which he found just then in the clear, fresh
                            writings of Voltaire."</p>
                        <p>It has been asserted with truth that reading, study, and literary
                            pursuits are the true food of a healthy mind. They are something more.
                            They fortify the soul against the calamities of life; they are a relief
                            from loneliness, and a solace and refuge in sickness and sorrow; they
                            are conducive to serenity amid uncongenial environments, and a source of
                            consolation for physical pain and domestic afflictions; they prevent the
                            despondency of age and declining health from resting like a pall upon
                            the countenance; and, in short, if not a panacea for the ills of life,
                            they are all powerful in the mitigation of those ills. Macaulay says
                            that "Literature consoles sorrow and assuages pain, and brings gladness
                            to eyes which fail with wakefulness and tears, and ache for the dark
                            house and the long sleep." The same author declares that a great writer
                            is the friend and benefactor of his readers. That the debt which one
                            owes to the great minds of former ages is incalculable. "They have
                            guided him to truth. They have filled his mind with noble and graceful
                            images. They have stood by him in all vicissitudes&#151;comforters
                            in sorrow, nurses in sickness, companions in solitude."</p>
                        <p>When a passion for knowledge and reading has been acquired the battle is
                            almost won; then a life destitute of literary pleasures, would be
                            absolutely insipid. The reasons in favor of general reading and polite
                            literature <pb id="VAA3932-092" n="84"/> are so multifarious that it
                            would be difficult to enumerate them. That such pursuits develop the
                            kindlier feelings, and are conducive to an agreeable life will not be
                            denied. They soften and polish our nature by reason and discipline; they
                            give us true freedom of soul and real self-sufficiency; they impart to
                            us that noble faculty "whereby man is able to live in the past and in
                            the future, in the distant and in the unreal;" they enable us to hold
                            converse with the spirits of the mighty dead; they mitigate sorrow and
                            assuage pain; they give us after many years "a tranquil self-respect,
                            and, what is still rarer and better, a very deep and earnest reverence
                            for the greatness which is above us;" they ennoble the mind and as a
                            result invigorate the body, and are thus conducive to longevity; they
                            give us the spirit of toleration, and that nameless grace that comes
                            from a mind fortified by literary culture; they make us "clearer in
                            head, larger in heart, and nobler in action;" they give us the power to
                            think and enjoy the thoughts of others; they widen the present by adding
                            to it the past and the future; and they enlarge us in thought, feeling
                            and purpose, and "lay the foundation of intellectual pleasures at the
                            other extreme of life."</p>
                        <p>Plutarch filled his mind with the sublime images of the best and greatest
                            men, by attention to history and biography; and he says, "If I contract
                            any blemish or ill custom from other company which I am unavoidably
                            engaged in, I correct and expel them by calmly and dispassionately
                            turning my thoughts to those excellent examples."</p>
                        <p>We have the words of Cicero that there is nothing so <pb id="VAA3932-093"
                                n="85"/> charming as the knowledge of literature, that branch of
                            literature which enables us to discover the infinity of things, the
                            immensity of nature, the heavens, the earth and the seas. That it is
                            this which furnishes us where-with to live well and happily, and guides
                            us to pass our lives without displeasure and without offense.</p>
                        <p>Sydney Smith, always charming and instructive, has painted in glowing
                            colors the exquisite delight and consolation derived from literary
                            pursuits. He says: "Well and happy has that man conducted his
                            understanding, who has learned to derive from the exercise of it,
                            regular occupation and rational delight; who, after having overcome the
                            first pain of application, and acquired a habit of looking inwardly upon
                            his own mind, perceives that every day is multiplying the relations,
                            confirming the accuracy, and augmenting the number of his ideas; who
                            feels that he is rising in the scale of intellectual beings, gathering
                            new strength with every new difficulty which he subdues, and enjoying
                            to-day as his pleasure that which yesterday he labored at as his toil.
                            There are many consolations in the mind of such a man which no common
                            life can ever afford; and many enjoyments which it has not to give. * *
                            * It is worth while in the days of our youth to strive hard for this
                            great discipline; to pass sleepless nights for it, to give up to it
                            laborious days; to spurn for it present pleasures; to endure for it
                            afflicting poverty; to wade for it through darkness, and sorrow, and
                            contempt, as the great spirits of the world have done in all ages and
                            all times."</p>
                        <p>Smith was convinced that the greatest natural genius cannot subsist on
                            its own stock; and that he who resolves <pb id="VAA3932-094" n="86"/>
                            never to ransack any mind but his own, will be soon reduced from mere
                            barrenness to the poorest of imitations. He declared that the first
                            thing to be done in conducting the understanding is precisely the same
                            as in conducting the body&#151;to give it regular and copious
                            supplies of food, in order, as he said, "to prevent the atrophy and
                            marasmus of mind, which comes on from giving it no new ideas."</p>
                        <p>It was said that he read many books, and was content, on principle, to
                            secure the best use of his faculties, to remain ignorant of many others,
                            though he was capable of plucking out the heart of a series of volumes
                            in a morning. Gibbon recommended to the student a practice which he
                            adopted; after glancing his eyes over the design and order of a new
                            book, he suspended the perusal till he had finished the task of
                            self-examination, till he had resolved in a solitary walk all that he
                            knew, or believed, or had thought on the subject of the whole work, or
                            some particular chapter; he said he was then qualified to discern how
                            much the author added to his original stock. "If I was sometimes
                            satisfied by the agreement," he declares, "I was sometimes alarmed by
                            the opposition of our ideas."</p>
                        <p>It is rarely indeed that we meet with a passage more beautiful in thought
                            and expression&#151;and more truthful&#151;than the following
                            quotation from DeBury:</p>
                        <p>"The desirable treasure of wisdom and knowledge, which all men covet from
                            the impulse of nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of the world;
                            in comparison with which precious stones are vile, silver is clay, and
                            purified gold grains of sand; in the splendor of which <pb
                                id="VAA3932-095" n="87"/> the sun and moon grow dim to the sight, in
                            the admirable sweetness of which honey and manna are bitter to the
                            taste. * * * The touch of the voice perishes with the sound. Truth,
                            latent in the mind, is hidden wisdom and invisible treasure; but the
                            truth which illuminates books desires to manifest itself to every sense,
                            to the sight when read, to the hearing when heard; it moreover in a
                            manner commends itself to the touch, when submitting to be transcribed,
                            collated, corrected and preserved. Truth confined to the mind, though it
                            may be the possession of a noble soul, while it wants a companion and is
                            not judged of either by the sight or the hearing, appears to be
                            inconsistent with pleasure. * * * But the truth written in a book, being
                            not fluctuating, but permanent, shows itself openly to the sight passing
                            through the spiritual ways of the eyes, as the porches and halls of
                            common sense and imagination: it enters the chambers of intellect,
                            reposes itself upon the couch of memory and there congenerates the
                            eternal truth of the mind."</p>
                        <p>If a young friend, with a decided literary predilection, should ask a
                            suggestion from us we would advise that he keep a diary or journal. It
                            is all important. Mr. Benson declares that he derived many advantages
                            from keeping a full diary. He says that it was of infinite service to
                            him in learning to write prose&#151;that the habit is easily
                            acquired, and as soon as it becomes habitual, the day is no more
                            complete without it than it is complete without a cold bath and regular
                            meals. He observes that a diary need not be a dreary chronicle of one's
                            movements; it should aim rather at giving a salient account <pb
                                id="VAA3932-096" n="88"/> of some particular episode; a walk, a
                            book, a conversation. He affirms, what every one that has kept a diary
                            knows to be true, "That it is a singularly delightful thing to look at
                            old diaries to see how one was occupied, say, ten years ago; what one
                            was reading, the people one was meeting, one's earlier point of view. *
                            * * It has the immense advantage of developing style; the subjects are
                            ready to hand; and one may learn by diarizing the art of sincere and
                            frank expression."</p>
                        <p>The journal kept by the historian Gibbon contained, along with some
                            learned and argumentative dissertations, an account of his domestic and
                            private life, his amusements, his engagements, even his rambles, with
                            all his reflections that turn upon subjects which are personal to
                            himself. He noted all that he learned from observation or conversation.
                            He also related everything pertinent to the most important part of his
                            studies&#151;and recorded his digested judgment upon the author and
                            his production.</p>
                        <p>Petrarch is regarded as one of the greatest names of modern Europe. It
                            has been said of him that "his eminent services to mankind as one of the
                            restorers of learning, exhibit the union, which pertains to the highest
                            intellects alone, of the imaginative with the practical."</p>
                        <p>"A prey to useful or distressing cares," says Petrarch, "We are tormented
                            by the present, the past and the future; and, as if we feared we should
                            not be miserable enough, we join to the evil we suffer the remembrance
                            of a former distress; and the apprehension of some future calamity. * *
                            * Our life might be gay and happy <pb id="VAA3932-097" n="89"/> if we
                            would, but we eagerly seek subjects of affliction to rend it irksome and
                            melancholy. * * * The discourse of the wise and the study of good books
                            are the best remedies I know of. * * * What gratitude do we not owe to
                            those great men who, though dead many ages before us, live with us by
                            their works; discourse with us, are our masters and guides, and serve us
                            as pilots in the navigation of life when our vessel is agitated without
                            ceasing by the storms of our passions."</p>
                        <p>More than thirty years ago the brilliant literary career of a celebrated
                            Englishman was terminated by his death. His versatility was marvelous.
                            He was novelist, dramatist, poet, politician, essayist. He had been
                            commended for his extraordinary "plasticity of mind and practical
                            insight; his freshness of thought, brilliancy of invention and breadth
                            and variety of portraiture." The productions of his fecund brain have
                            been a source of exquisite delight on both sides of the Atlantic. We
                            refer to Lord Lytton. This eminent man ventured into what was then, so
                            far as we know, an untrodden field&#151;that of Literary
                            Therapeutics:</p>
                        <p>"People repeat vaguely that books are the medicine of the mind. Yes; but
                            to apply the medicine is the thing.</p>
                        <p>"I have known some people in great sorrow fly to a novel, or the last
                            light book in fashion. One might as well take a rose-draught for the
                            plague! Light reading does not do when the heart is really heavy. I am
                            told that Goethe, when he lost his son, took to study, a science that
                            was new to him. Ah! Goethe was a physician who knew what he was about.
                            In a great grief like that you cannot tickle and divert the mind; you
                                <pb id="VAA3932-098" n="90"/> must wrench it away, abstract, absorb,
                            bury it in an abyss, hurry it into a labyrinth. Therefore, for the
                            irremediable sorrows of middle life and old age, I recommend a strict
                            chronic course of science and hard
                            reasoning&#151;counter-irritation. Bring the brain to act upon the

                            understanding. I would administer something elegant and cordial. For as

                            rather the head that aches and suffers by the loss of money. Here we
                            find the higher class of poets a very valuable remedy.</p>
                        <p>"For hypochondria and satiety, what is better than a brisk alterative

                            legendary travels! How they freshen up the spirits! How they take you

                        <p>The humanizing effect of literature is unquestioned. As a grand
                            exemplification of this fact the case of Sir Walter Scott has been
                            cited. It is affirmed of Sir Walter that "his fame and knowledge ripened
                            the innate virtues of his character, and made him more sympathetic, more
                            sociable, more genial, more grandly simple. * * * The simplicity of his
                            character was almost as wonderful as his matchless genius."</p>
                        <p>It will not be denied that mental labor and literary pursuits defer
                            mental decay and are conducive to longevity. The truth of this
                            oft-repeated assertion is exemplified by those great patriarchs John
                            Adams and Thomas Jefferson. The letters that passed between them when
                            they were aged respectively ninety and eighty-two, prove the marvelous
                            vigor and lucidity of their minds in extreme old day.</p>
                        <p>I know of one instance, and there doubtless have been many, where a man
                            owed his superiority to his misfortunes. In his day of abject poverty
                            and isolation he had read and educated himself, and compared and thought
                            much; indeed, it is not unusual for the intellectual energies to grow
                            stronger in calamity, if we give credence to history and biography. It
                            was so with the blind Milton. "The remembrance of early reading came
                            over his dark and lonely path like the moon emerging from the
                            clouds."</p>
                        <p>Cultivation consists in an acquaintance with all the best productions of
                            the human mind; but we must not disregard the observation of Channing,
                            that intellectual culture does not consist alone in accumulating
                            information <pb id="VAA3932-100" n="92"/> but also "in building up a
                            force of thought which may be turned at will on any subject on which we
                            are called to pass judgment."</p>
                        <p>It has been said that culture makes a greater difference between man and
                            man than nature has made between man and brutes. This fact may have
                            inspired Lord Lytton to exclaim: "How little the nobleness of aspect
                            depends on symmetry of feature, or the mere proportion of form! What
                            dignity robes the man who is filled with a lofty thought!"</p>
                        <p>Walter Pater thus defines and illustrates the aim of all culture: "To
                            withdraw the thoughts for a little while from the mere machinery of
                            life, to fix them on the great and universal passions of men, the most
                            general and interesting of their occupations, and the entire world of
                            nature, on the operations of the elements and the appearances of the
                            visible universe, on storm and sunshine, on the revolution of the
                            seasons, on cold and heat, on loss of friends and kindred, on injuries
                            and resentments, on gratitude and hope, on fear and sorrow. To witness
                            this spectacle with appropriate emotions is the aim of all culture."</p>
                        <p>Montaigne affirms that the inquisition into great and occult things is
                            very pleasant, even to him who acquires nothing by it but the reverence
                            and awe of judging it. A more modern writer,<ref id="ref_18"
                                rend="super" target="note_18" targOrder="U">4</ref> however, insists
                            that the fullest enjoyment is never derived from books till we have
                            ventilated the ideas obtained from them&#151;that a man never knows
                            anything until he has taught it in some way, it may be orally, or it may
                            be by writing a <pb id="VAA3932-101" n="93"/> book. He asserts that
                            "Solitary reading will enable a man to stuff himself with information;
                            but, without writing or conversation, his mind will become like a pond
                            without an outlet, a mass of unhealthy stagnation." It was said that the
                            life of Ampere, the celebrated French historian and traveler, was one of
                            the best adapted for culture that could be led by a human being. From
                            his childhood he lived in the kind of society which is at the same time
                            the best informed and the most perfectly communicative. "His time was so
                            beautifully divided between acquisition and communication that the blue
                            mold of ignorance could never grow upon him, and his intellectual armor
                            could never be rusted by reserve. He was neither, on the one hand, the
                            silent scholar, incapable of imparting what he knows, nor, on the other,
                            the copious chatterer, whose words were empty and vain."<note

                        <p>The miseries endured by the uncultured portion of humanity are vividly
                            depicted by George Eliot: "When uncultured minds, confined to a narrow
                            range of personal experience, are under the pressure of continued
                            misfortune, their inward life is apt to become a perpetually repeated
                            round of sad and bitter thoughts; the same words, the same scenes are
                            revolved over and over again, the same mood accompanies
                            them&#151;the end of the year finds them as much what they were at
                            the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of
                            movements."</p>
                        <p>Another author contrasts the conforts and discomforts of cultured and
                            uncultured man in the most striking manner. "The soul of the man of no
                            culture is tied <pb id="VAA3932-102" n="94"/> to the present, and to
                            that small part of the earth's surface on which he moves in his daily
                            rounds. The accomplished man of letters sits in his quiet study with a
                            clear head, sympathetic heart and lively fancy. * * * His soul grows and
                            extends itself until it lives in every region of the earth and in every
                            by-gone age. * * * Though originally a frail mortal creature, he arises
                            toward the God-like attributes of omnipotence and omniscience."</p>
                        <p>When one has attained the age of fifty years, having given assiduous
                            attention to his profession or occupation, we conceive that nothing
                            would be more delightful than to pass the concluding period of his life
                            in lettered and social ease and in retirement.</p>

                        <p>We do not need the assurance of Seneca that it is a great calamity to
                            have a mind anxious about future things; and it is the imperative duty,
                            as it should be the pleasure of every man, by honest effort, to
                            accumulate a sufficiency of means for the decent support of himself and
                            family, at the present time and in the future, having regard for the
                            possible vicissitudes of life. The venerable and distinguished John
                            Bigelow had evidently arrived at this point when he wrote to his friend:
                            "I do not wish to devote any more of my life to mere money-getting. I
                            mean to live on what I have, be it more or less." We know that poverty,
                            especially when accompanied with extravagant tastes and habits, is a
                            great evil. It was said of the poor of France that they were compelled
                            to live upon hope and the mists of the Seine; and a celebrated Frenchman
                            was led to remark: "I fear God, yet more I fear the hell of poverty. To
                            be destitute is the last depth of misfortune in society as now
                            constituted. I am a man of my time; I respect money. * * * I spend my
                            life in watching people die not of their disease, but of another bad and
                            incurable complaint&#151;the want of money." We must all admit, <pb
                                id="VAA3932-104" n="96"/> however, that sometimes it is not poverty,
                            so much as covetous desires, that causes sorrow. The next best thing to
                            being able to buy an automobile is to have the ability to do without one
                            with composure&#151;without fretting and without repining. And
                            poverty oftentimes has its compensations, as illustrated by the case of
                            a bride, who referring to her young husband, declared that an honorable
                            poverty had been his safeguard and had handed him over to her, unsoiled
                            by the loose life which ruins so many young men.</p>
                        <p>We should be satisfied at first with the comfort and necessities of life,
                            and let the luxuries come later; and avoid following the example of
                            Shenstone, a country gentleman of elegant taste, "who expended his means
                            and ruined himself in making his patrimony the most beautiful of
                            landscape gardens." We believe that he is the happy man who sees his
                            condition in life constantly and gradually, though it may be slowly,
                            improving. It was the opinion of Lord Lytton that, placed between the
                            two extremes of life, the tradesman "who ventures not beyond his means,
                            and sees clear books and sure gains, with enough of occupation to give
                            healthful excitement, enough of fortune to greet each new-born child
                            without a sigh, might be envied alike by those above and those below his
                            state." La Bruyère complains that obscure citizens, simply because they
                            are rich, have the audacity to swallow in one morsel the living of a
                            hundred families, and declares that he would not choose to be either so
                            poor or so rich, but would find refuge in moderation.</p>
                        <p>The pushing of thrift to the loathsome excess of an inhuman avarice is
                            always to be deplored. When avarice <pb id="VAA3932-105" n="97"/> has
                            once gained a strong hold upon a man, as time passes on it becomes more
                            and more intense; indeed it may be said that all lasting passions grow
                            with man's growth. The miser's life is a constant exercise of every
                            human faculty in the service of personality. He thirsts for gold as
                            devils thirst for the dew of heaven; in wealth he makes himself
                            miserable by the fear of poverty. He is an extremely covetous person, a
                            sordid wretch&#151;</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"As some lone miser, visiting his store,</l>
                            <l n="2">Bends at his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>A miser can usually be detected by his countenance&#151;his facial
                            expression. If we may be permitted to do so we wish here to make a brief
                            digression: We have many illustrious examples of digressive composition.
                            "Digressions," says Sterne, in Tristram Shandy, "incontestably, are the
                            sunshine; they are the life, the soul of reading; take them out of this
                            book, for instance, you might as well take the book along with them: one
                            cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it; restore them to the
                            writer; he steps forth like a bridegroom, bids all hail; brings in
                            variety, and forbids the appetite to fail."</p>
                        <p>De Quincey was the great apostle of digression. "Whatever he announces to
                            be under discussion, the title to one of his papers affords no key to
                            its contents. * * * Like the writer on Ireland, who begins his chapter
                            'Of the Snakes of Ireland,' by saying 'There are no snakes in Ireland,'
                            De Quincey contents himself often with the barest allusion to his theme,
                            and strays into a thousand tempting by-paths, leading off whole leagues
                            therefrom, * * * winding like a river at <pb id="VAA3932-106" n="98"/>
                            its own sweet will, * * * but profoundly indifferent whether at the end
                            of his disquisition he will have made any progress toward the goal for
                            which he started. Like a fisherman he throws out his capacious net into
                            the ocean of learning and sweeps in everything, however miscellaneous or
                            motley its character."<ref id="ref_19" rend="super" target="note_19"

                        <p>And now to proceed. Physiognomy, or the art or science of discerning the
                            character of the mind or the predominent temper and disposition, by the
                            external signs of the countenance has, in our day, almost become a lost
                            art. Saint-Simon, the great memoir writer of France, was the prince of
                            physiognomists. His country has been regarded as the richest in memoirs
                            of any in the world, and he was superior to all others in this
                            department of literature. He was passionately fond of observing and
                            dissecting character by studying the countenance, and he was thus
                            enabled to penetrate the mysteries of any intrigue. It was said that
                            when once Saint-Simon falls furiously upon any individual, he does not
                            release his hold; he tramples his victim under foot. He is an almost
                            unique example of a man who has acquired great literary fame entirely by
                            posthumous publications. His extraordinary genius for character drawing
                            is unsurpassed, and it is said that the interest of the memoirs is one
                            of constant surprise at the novel and adroit use of word and phrase. His
                            skill as a physiognomist was applied in discerning the character and
                            fathoming the hearts of courtiers and others of his time. He did not
                            deign to study the countenance of the miser, but used his art upon those
                            high in authority. But <pb id="VAA3932-107" n="99"/> other
                            physiognomists have detected the miser by the signs of his countenance.
                            They have observed that rigid nostrils betray a certain shallowness;
                            that the nose of a miser never quivers, it is tightly set like his lips;
                            everything in his face is as close shut as himself. There is something
                            vulpine about the eyes which seem to have the yellow metallic glitter of
                            the coin over which he broods. Hallam declares that Plautus first
                            exposed upon the stage the wretchedness of avarice, the punishment of a
                            selfish love of gold, not only in the life of pain it has cost to
                            acquire it, but in the terrors that it brings, in the disordered state
                            of mind which is haunted as by some mysterious guilt, by the
                            consciousness of secret wealth.</p>
                        <p>We must not fail to distinguish, however, between avarice and that severe
                            and rigid economy rendered necessary by one's circumstances in life;
                            there is something absolutely sublime in the conduct of a man who, in an
                            exigency, practices self-denial, especially if it continues for any
                            considerable period. Strong instances of self-denial operate powerfully
                            on our minds; and the observation is true that a man who has no wants
                            has obtained great freedom, and firmness, and even dignity. There are
                            instances where the most rigid economy is the instrument of
                            virtue&#151;especially where it has been induced by greatness of
                            purpose.</p>
                        <p>An ancient writer defined luxury to be a tumor and inflammation caused by
                            riches, and declared that it makes a man so soft that it is hard to
                            please him and easy to trouble him&#151;so that his pleasure at last
                            becomes a burden. Another affirms that luxury was the last of <pb
                                id="VAA3932-108" n="100"/> all vices that prevailed over mankind;
                            for after riches had been hoarded up, they rotted, as it were, into
                            luxury.</p>
                        <p>In our own era, except in certain localities, money is the one all
                            powerful force; ours is pre-eminently the epoch when money is the
                            law-giver politically, if not socially; and unfortunately, it is
                            oftentimes regarded as the measure of public capacity. These facts and
                            conditions warrant the conclusion that the imperfectibility of
                            government and governmental institutions is no less obvious than the
                            imperfectibility of man himself.</p>
                        <p>The philosophy of Rude, the great French sculptor, about wealth, is not
                            in harmony with that which generally prevails at the present day, but it
                            is logical and intensely interesting. He says: "I have not yet met with
                            rich people who consider themselves rich enough; and it has always been
                            so, if we may believe the writings of the ancients. And why do men
                            desire riches, if not to arrive at a state of contentment, at a feeling
                            of satisfying possession? But if every man, whatever may be his wealth,
                            has never enough, according to his own opinion, it is proved that this
                            feeling of contentment does not depend upon riches in themselves. Can I
                            hesitate between the two lines of conduct before me? One of the two
                            would be to acquire a great fortune, a very difficult thing to do, and I
                            am not certain of success; if I succeeded, I should be no better off;
                            for the example of all the ages proves that the more a man has, the more
                            he desires to have. The other line of conduct would be to try to
                            consider myself rich enough as I am, which costs infinitely less
                            anxiety, and disturbs nothing in my way of life." As a result of this
                            process of reasoning, <pb id="VAA3932-109" n="101"/> Rude made his
                            choice of contended mediocrity, and adhered to it. He was certainly an
                            extraordinary character. He cared nothing about notoriety and his
                            biographer observes that "In an age when men struggle frantically for
                            the means of luxury, and use their utmost ingenuity to advance in the
                            world's estimation by plotting for the praise of coteries and
                            newspapers, Rude concerned himself neither about wealth, nor about
                            notoriety. * * * You may often find artists and men of letters who are
                            content to suffer poverty that they may pursue a beloved occupation, but
                            the indifference to notoriety is rarer."</p>
                        <p>We can hardly expect the present generation to accept and adopt, with
                            enthusiasm, the principle enunciated by Socrates that to want nothing is
                            divine&#151;to want as little as possible is the nearest possible
                            approach to the divine life. However, Jacquemont declared that he would
                            rather not be rich, that in his present condition he had more sympathy
                            with men and things and exclaimed, "What an admirable receipt for
                            happiness, to know how to do without things!" The story of the solitary
                            life of Alexander Selkirk on the island of Juan Fernandez exemplifies in
                            the highest degree the manner in which our internal resources increase
                            with our external wants. Richard Steele deduces from this story a great
                            universal truth "That he is happiest who confines his wants to natural
                            necessities; and that he who goes further in his desires, increases his
                            wants in proportion to his acquisitions." Selkirk lived four years and
                            four months on the island. We have been both instructed and charmed by
                            the narrative of Mr. Steele. He says: "I <pb id="VAA3932-110" n="102"/>
                            had the pleasure frequently to converse with the man soon after his
                            arrival in England, in the year 1711. It was a matter of great curiosity
                            to hear him, as he is a man of good sense, give an account of the
                            different revolutions in his own mind in that long solitude. * * * He
                            grew dejected, languid and melancholy, scarce able to refrain from doing
                            himself violence, till by degrees, by the force of reason, and frequent
                            reading the Scriptures, and turning his thoughts upon the study of
                            navigation, after the space of eighteen months he grew thoroughly
                            reconciled to his condition. When he had made the conquest, the vigor of
                            his health, disengagement from the world, a constant, cheerful, serene
                            sky, and a temperate air, made his life one continued feast, and his
                            being much more joyful than it had before been irksome. * * * This
                            manner of life grew so exquisitely pleasant that he never had a moment
                            heavy upon his hands; his nights were untroubled and his days joyous
                            from the practice of temperance and exercise. It was his manner to use
                            stated hours and places for exercises of devotion, which he performed
                            aloud in order to keep up the faculties of speech, and to utter himself
                            with greater energy. * * * Selkirk frequently bewailed his return to the
                            world, which could not, he said, with all its enjoyments, restore him to
                            the tranquillity of his solitude. * * * To use his own expression: 'I am
                            now worth eight hundred pounds, but shall never be so happy as when I
                            was not worth a farthing.'"</p>
                        <p>In this connection we should listen to the words of wisdom from the pen
                            of our old friend, the quaint and lovable Izaak Walton&#151;for
                            every one that reads him <pb id="VAA3932-111" n="103"/> loves him. "The
                            sleepy smile that lies so benignly on his sweet and serious diction" is
                            ever present.</p>
                        <p>"Nay, let me tell you, there be many that have forty times our estate
                            that would give the greatest part of it to be healthful and cheerful
                            like us. I have a rich neighbor who is always so busy that he has no
                            leisure to laugh; the whole business of his life is to get money, and
                            more money, that he may still get more and more money; he is still
                            drudging on, and says that Solomon says, 'The diligent hand maketh rich'
                            and it is true indeed but he considers not that it is not in the power
                            of riches to make a man happy for it was wisely said by a man of great
                            observation, 'That there be as many miseries beyond riches as on this
                            side them'. * * * Diogenes went to a county fair and saw many things. He
                            said to his friend, 'Lord, how many things are there in this world of
                            which Diogenes hath no need.' * * * Content will never dwell but in a
                            meek and quiet soul. * * * Riches without meekness and thankfulness do
                            not make any man happy. * * * I will tell you, scholar, I have heard a
                            grave divine say that God has two dwellings: one in heaven, and the
                            other in a meek and thankful heart."</p>
                        <p>The golden rule in respect to one's expenditures is to live within one's
                            income. Cato's enmity to Carthage was so intense that he never gave his
                            opinion in the senate upon any other point whatever without adding these
                            words: "And my opinion is that Carthage should be destroyed." The rule
                            above enunciated is so fundamental and is of such transcendent
                            importance that it would be well, after the manner of Cato, to repeat on
                                <pb id="VAA3932-112" n="104"/> every important occasion, mentally if
                            not audibly: "That every man should live within his income." This rule
                            is the basic principle which, if possible, should never be disregarded.
                            A wise Hollander observes that a man should divide his estate in three
                            parts: upon one-third he should live, another third he should lay up for
                            his children, and the last he should lay by for accident. In Holland
                            when any one lives up to his income he is looked on as a madman. It was
                            with much pride and satisfaction, amounting almost to enthusiasm, that
                            Jacquemont, even when he was poorest, could write to his father, "I have
                            had the admirable talent of remaining within my budget."</p>
                        <p>Gibbon, the historian, spent many delightful years at Lausanne. He
                            declared that if every day passed there had not been equally soft and
                            serene, that not a day, not a moment, had occurred in which he had
                            repented of his choice. Immoderate wealth did not fall to his share, yet
                            he possessed a decent affluence. He very truly observes that our
                            importance in society is less a positive than a relative weight: "In
                            London," he says, "I was lost in the crowd; I ranked with the first
                            families of Lausanne, and my style of prudent expense enabled me to
                            maintain a fair balance of reciprocal civilities." He congratulated
                            himself upon the fact that the golden mediocrity of his fortune had
                            contributed to fortify his application. He declared that according to
                            the scale of Switzerland, "I am a rich man; and I am indeed rich, since
                            my income is superior to my expenses, and my expense is equal to my
                            wishes."</p>
                        <p>We should not endeavor "to keep up with the procession," <pb
                                id="VAA3932-113" n="105"/> and rival our more opulent neighbors in
                            ostentatious expenditures. One should live within one's income cost what
                            it may. The contrary course will, sooner or later, lead to disastrous
                            results&#151;to distress and humiliation. The facile pen of a

                            to half the town with an intimation that she is 'at home.'</p>
                        <p>"She has all the while been prolific to the full extent of Hibernian
                            fecundity.</p>
                        <p>"The counselor's sons swagger it with the choicest spirits of Kildare
                            street; and the young ladies are accomplished in all the multifarious
                            departments of musical and literary affectation. Quadrilles and waltzes
                            shake the illuminated chambers with a perpetual concussion. The
                            passer-by is arrested in his nocturnal progress by the crowd of
                            brilliant vehicles before the door, while the blaze of light streaming
                            from the windows and the sound of the harp and the tabor, and the din of
                            extravagance, intimate the joyance that is going on within.</p>
                        <p>"But where is the counselor all this while? He sits in a sequestered
                            chamber, like a hermit in the forest of Comus, and pursues his midnight
                            labors by the light of a solitary taper, scarcely hearing the din of
                            pleasure that rolls above his head.</p>
                        <p>"The wasteful splendors of the drawing room, and the patient drudgery of
                            the library, go on for years. The counselor is at the top of the
                            forensic, and his lady stands upon the summit of the fashionable world.
                            At length death knocks at the door. He is seized by a <pb
                                id="VAA3932-115" n="107"/> sudden illness. The loud knock of the
                            judges peals upon his ear, but the double tap of the attorney is heard
                            no more. He makes an unavailing effort to attend the courts, but is
                            hurried back to his house and laid in his bed. His eyes now begin to
                            open to the realities of his condition. In the loneliness and silence of
                            the sick man's chamber a train of reflection presents itself to his
                            mind, which his former state of professional occupancy had tended to
                            exclude. He takes a deathbed survey of his circumstances; looks upon the
                            future, and by the light of that melancholy lamp that burns beside him,
                            and throws its shadowy gleams upon his fortunes, he sees himself at the
                            close of a most prosperous life, without a groat.</p>
                        <p>"The sense of his own folly, and the anticipated destitution of his
                            family, settle at his heart. He has not adopted even the simple and
                            cheap expedient of insuring his life, or by some miserable negligence
                            has let the insurance drop. What is to become of his wife and
                            children?</p>
                        <p>From the sources of his best affections, and of his purest pleasures, he
                            drinks that portion, that aqua Tofana of the mind, which renders all the
                            expedients of art without avail. Despair sits ministering beside him
                            with her poisoned chalice and bids defiance to Colles and to Cheyne. His
                            family gather about him. The last consolations of religion are given,
                            amid heartbroken sobs; and as he raises himself, and stretches forth his
                            hand to receive the final rite, he casts his eyes upon the wretches who
                            surround him and shrinks back at the sight. It is in the midst of a
                            scene like this and when <pb id="VAA3932-116" n="108"/> the hour of
                            agony is at hand that the loud and heartless voice of official insolence
                            echoes from chamber to chamber, and after a brief interval the dreadful
                            certainty of which the unhappy man had but too prescient a surmise is
                            announced.</p>
                        <p>"The sheriff's officers have got in; his majesty's writ of <hi rend="i"
                                >fieri facias</hi> is in the process of execution; the sanctuaries
                            of death are violated by the peremptory ministers of the law, and the
                            blanket and the silk gown are seized together; and this is the
                            conclusion of a life of opulence and of distinction, and, let me add, of
                            folly as well as fame.</p>

                        <p>It has been truly said that education and knowledge, the power to think
                            and enjoy the thought of others, has long since transformed a cottage
                            into a palace. It is not every one, however, who possesses the gift of
                            meditation.</p>
                        <p>The ancient philosophers were agreed that the highest happiness is to be
                            found in contemplation and speculative thought. One of them declares
                            that reflection calms the ardor of the blood and swallows up all the
                            silly illusions of man; another avers that the true and allowable luxury
                            of the soul consists in contemplation or thinking. In our own day,
                            however, we find many more people, who, in order to be happy, must live
                            upon the breath of popular applause. It is said that the rude man is
                            contented if he sees something going on, the man of more refinement must
                            be made to feel, the man entirely refined desires to reflect. Thomas A.
                            Kempis, the great German devotional writer, whose "De Imitatione
                            Christi" has been translated into every civilized language, including
                            Hebrew, and a more popular work even than Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress,
                            gives for the world this adjuration: "Seek a convenient time to retire
                                <pb id="VAA3932-118" n="110"/> into thyself; and meditate often upon
                            God's loving kindnesses."</p>
                        <p>Reflection is conducive to tranquillity of mind.</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"Sweet are the thoughts that savor of content.</l>
                            <l n="2">The quiet mind is richer than a crown."</l>

                        <p>It fortifies one against the calamities of life; it aids in the solution
                            of intricate questions affecting one's well-being which seem at first
                            insoluble.</p>
                        <p>It is marvelous what one hour of cool, calm reflection will accomplish.
                            We do not refer to that violent and intense meditation so well
                            illustrated by the cat. It has been said, and we know it to be true,
                            that a cat on the watch is as motionless as death stationed at its place
                            of observation, and that neither hunger nor thirst can draw it away from
                            its meditations. Of course a Turk could derive but little benefit from
                            reflection because in him meditation almost invariably induces
                            sleep.</p>
                        <p>Most of us spend a great part of our lives in clearing our minds of the
                            notions that sprang up unchecked during our early years. By reflection
                            we are enabled to get rid of many preconceived notions that are
                            erroneous; for example, we become more tolerant, abandon all thought of
                            making other men in our own image&#151;and ultimately conceive that
                            drunkenness is a disease to be cured rather than a crime to be
                            punished.</p>
                        <p>It is said that when Perreyve, the eminent Frenchman, ceased to be able
                            to read and write, he was delighted almost to the point of enthusiasm to
                            find that he could still derive happiness from mere thinking; and <pb
                                id="VAA3932-119" n="111"/> he had never before so completely
                            realized the value of the gift of thought. A celebrated English moralist
                            declared that what some would call idleness he would call the sweetest
                            part of his life, and that was his thinking. Sir William Grant averred
                            that his mind was so secure in its reflection that thunder, which breaks
                            other men's slumbers, rocked him to sleep. When Pascal's books were
                            taken from him to save his health, injured by excessive study, he
                            supplied their place by the depth and force of his personal reflection.
                            We know of an eminent man now far advanced in years who declares that he
                            lives happily with himself and his memories.</p>
                        <p>It was the theory of Victor Jacquemont, the famous French traveler and
                            naturalist, that a man ought to exercise himself continually in
                            conquering his own desires, and that when he had to suffer he ought to
                            find within himself an amount of endurance sufficient to meet the
                                suffering.<ref id="ref_21" rend="super" target="note_21"

                        <p>Charles Sumner appreciated the benefits and delights of reflection. When
                            his name was first mentioned for the United States senate and he was
                            importuned to become a candidate, he hesitated, because, as he said, the
                            office would take from him all opportunity of study and meditation.</p>
                        <p>A renowned writer<ref id="ref_22" rend="super" target="note_22"
                                targOrder="U">2</ref> declared a long time ago that reflecting men
                            in all ages have a philosophy. With the educated Greeks and Romans
                            philosophy was religion. That the vulgar belief, under whatever name it
                            may be, is never the belief of those who have leisure for reflection.
                            That the vulgar rich and vulgar poor are immersed <pb id="VAA3932-120"
                                n="112"/> in sense: the man of reflection tries to emerge from

                        </p>
                        <p>It is our deliberate opinion that the prevailing tendency is to read too
                            much and to think too little. We cannot recur too frequently to the
                            words of Confucius: "Learning, undigested by thought, is labor lost;
                            thought, unassisted by learning, is perilous. It was said of a certain
                            individual, "he was communicative enough, but nothing was distinct in
                            his mind. How could it be otherwise? He had never spared time to think;
                            all was employed in reading."</p>
                        <p>We have said on a former occasion, and now repeat, that reading and
                            thinking should, in a certain sense, go hand in hand&#151;one duly
                            proportioned to the other, and so that each may be the complement of the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>There may be dissipation in reading&#151;reading too much. Dire
                            results have been recorded which were attributable to this cause; and,
                            on this subject, we should profit by the experience and observation of
                            others. It has been declared possible for one to lay so many books at
                            the top of his head that his brains could not move; or, in the language
                            of another, "there are readers whose wit is so smothered under the
                            weight of their accumulations as to be absolutely powerless." On account
                            of this literary dissipation the digestive organs have been known to
                            become "worn and macerated by the relentless flagellations of the
                            brain."</p>
                        <p>That it will be found more nutritious to digest a page than to devour a
                            volume will hardly be denied; and no one will question the truth of the
                            observation of Macaulay that it is not by overturning libraries, but by
                            repeatedly <pb id="VAA3932-121" n="113"/> perusing and intently
                            contemplating a few great models, that the mind is best disciplined.</p>
                        <p>It was the complaint of Burke that calamity is unhappily the usual season
                            of reflection, and that the pride of man will not often suffer reason to
                            have any scope until it can be no longer of service.</p>
                        <p>We must all feel how difficult it is abruptly to pass from the buzz of
                            men to the meditations of the closet. No man should make reflection his
                            whole life's business. De Quincey affirmed that it was his disease to
                            meditate too much and to observe too little, and the remedies he sought
                            were to force himself into society and to keep his understanding in
                            continual activity upon matters of science. It has been truly observed
                            that contemplation generates; action propagates. Without the first, the
                            latter is defective: without the last, the first is abortive and
                            embryous. We have read of one who buried himself in the depths of his
                            own reflections, while he exhibited externally a semblance of simplicity
                            and modesty, affecting the pursuit of letters and a passion for poetry
                            to veil his real purposes. But as a rule the human countenance does not
                            dissemble. It is easy to discern when the face is stamped with the
                            sadness of constant meditation&#151;"all sicklied o'er with the pale
                            cast of thought." We believe that an ideal life is one compounded of
                            work and meditation, of solitude and society.</p>
                        <p>The incalculable benefits derived from reflection, not only to
                            individuals but to the nation, is illustrated by reference to the
                            "Augustan age," the era so illustrious in Roman history. This epoch,
                            with which the great <pb id="VAA3932-122" n="114"/> names of Vergil,
                            Horace, Ovid and Livy are indissolubly associated, covered a period of
                            less than fifty years. It was distinguished for its splendid
                            attainments, more especially in literature. It is not a matter of
                            surprise that the Romans in later times looked back to the age of
                            Augustus with great complacency, as the most prosperous and the most
                            distinguished of their annals. The name of the "Augustan age" has been
                            specially applied to it in modern times. And the title itself, apart
                            from its special application to Rome, when applied to the literature of
                            any nation denotes the supposed period of its highest state of purity
                            and refinement. Thus the age of Louis XIV has been called the "Augustan
                            age," of French literature, and that of Queen Anne the Augustan age of
                            English literature. The giving of this title to certain epochs in modern
                            history is regarded as the highest compliment to their glory. The
                            philosophic historian accounts for the intellectual and literary
                            superiority of the Augustan age of Rome, when compared with other epochs
                            of the world's history, by the fact that it was singularly and
                            emphatically an era of rest for reflection and self-control.</p>

                        <p>We have referred in another place to home&#151;its perfect trust and
                            truth&#151;its simple holiness, and its exquisite happiness. It has
                            been truthfully and beautifully said that home is to the world what
                            conscience is to the human mind.</p>
                        <p>We know of an eminent man who declared that he regarded his home as a
                            snug nest for content and contemplation, but one within which the wings
                            of action and ambition could not long lie folded.</p>
                        <p>It has been said by an American writer that no one more thoroughly
                            appreciates a home than an Englishman&#151;that if he has one he can
                            easily forego society, that even the solitude of the wilderness has no
                            terrors for him, and he is happy on the very borders of civilization.
                            The same writer declares that the French language has no such words as
                            comfort and home; this may be true, but if the French have not the
                            words, they may have what those words represent in other languages,
                            which is far more important. Indeed, the French insist that their homes
                            are incomparable. Jacquemont says: "I do not conceal my opinion that the
                            system of English life is nothing but a succession of errors, all <pb
                                id="VAA3932-124" n="116"/> fatal to happiness. They talk of home
                            without ceasing; and this home which they like so much is the material
                            side of their existence&#151;their sofas and easy chairs. Our home,
                            which we do not talk about, is in the heart. I tell them that the poor
                            in our country have more pleasures, and pleasures sweeter and nobler,
                            than the rich in theirs." Another eminent Frenchman<ref id="ref_23"
                                rend="super" target="note_23" targOrder="U">1</ref> writes in terms
                            of high commendation of the American home. He says: "There is certainly
                            no country in the world where the tie of marriage is so much respected
                            as in America, or where conjugal happiness is more highly or worthily
                            appreciated. In Europe almost all the disturbances of society arise from
                            the irregularities of domestic life. To despise the natural bonds and
                            legitimate pleasures of home is to contract a taste for excesses, a
                            restlessness of heart, and the evil of fluctuating desires. Agitated by
                            the tumultuous passions which frequently disturb his dwelling, the
                            European is galled by the obedience which the legislative powers of the
                            state exact. But when the American retires from the turmoil of public
                            life to the bosom of his family, he finds in it the image of order and
                            of peace. There his pleasures are simple and natural; his joys are
                            innocent and calm; and as he finds that an orderly life is the surest
                            path to happiness, he accustoms himself without difficulty to moderate
                            his opinions as well as his tastes. While the European endeavors to
                            forget his domestic troubles by agitating society, the American derives
                            from his own home that love of order which he afterward carries with him
                            into public affairs."<note id="note_23" place="unspecified"

                        <head type="subtitle">TRAVEL.</head>
                        <p>It is a very important sanitary truth that a timely change of air and
                            residence is beneficial. We can accept as true the observation of Mr.
                            Carnegie as to the advantages to be derived from a journey around the
                            world. He says that the sense of the brotherhood of man&#151;the
                            unity of race&#151;is very greatly strengthened thereby. For one
                            sees that the virtues are the same in all lands and produce their good
                            fruit. That the vices too are akin; and also that the motives which
                            govern men and their actions and aims are very much the same all the
                            world over.</p>
                        <p>We recognize the fact that with some there is an instinct for permanence
                            in the mind so strong that to leave the place of their abode for a long
                            journey causes a feeling of depression and melancholy. But, as a general
                            rule, no people on earth have such vagabond habits as ourselves. It is
                            said that the continental races never travel at all if they can help it;
                            nor does an Englishman ever think of stirring abroad, unless he has
                            abundance of money to spare, or proposes to himself some definite
                            advantage from the journey. English gentlemen sometimes <pb
                                id="VAA3932-127" n="119"/> regard a journey abroad as essential to
                            the completion of their education. It is a remarkable fact that very few
                            men could ever have seen less of the world than Shakespeare saw. He
                            never passed the boundaries of England. From Stratford to London is
                            barely a hundred miles; and there is no evidence that he was ever fifty
                            miles from the highway between these two points.</p>
                        <p>The purposes of travel at the present day are manifold; some go upon
                            business or with a specific end in view; others journey abroad because
                            their neighbors have done so&#151;as nothing affords greater
                            pleasure and satisfaction than a consciousness of the fact that we are
                            keeping up with the procession; a vast majority go to gratify curiosity
                            and get rid of superfluous wealth. It was somewhat different in former
                            times. Bacon declared that "travel in the younger sort is part of
                            education; in the elder a part of experience." Another declares the
                            purpose to be "to unite and distil into one's self the scattered
                            perfections of several nations;" still another affirms that "traveling
                            maketh a man sit still in his old age with satisfaction." It was the
                            opinion of Lowell that "the wise man travels to discover himself; it is
                            to find himself out that he goes out of himself and his habitual
                            associations."</p>
                        <p>It is said that the French people as a rule read no language but their
                            own and refrain from foreign travel. There are some notable exceptions,
                            however, as in the case of Ampère, the celebrated historian and
                            archæologist, who developed a passion for travel during his first tour
                            beyond the boundaries of France. Notwithstanding the right of
                            expatriation is a natural and inherent <pb id="VAA3932-128" n="120"/>
                            right of all people, indispensable to the enjoyment of the rights of
                            life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the French people as a whole
                            shrink from its exercise.</p>
                        <p>Traveling is without a doubt at least a temporary cure for taciturnity.
                            One who at home practices an habitual silence and reserve in speaking,
                            will, when conversing with a stranger in a distant land, unburden his
                            mind with the utmost facility and volubility. He is relieved from the
                            constraints of home and he is apt to feel that he is stepping not only
                            into an unknown, but into a perfectly free world.</p>
                        <p>We think the most of us would do much better to stay at home.</p>

                        <head type="subtitle">SOLITUDE.</head>
                        <p>Man is by nature a gregarious creature; and it has been truly said that
                            he cannot isolate himself continuously without becoming either less or
                            more than a man. "Prolonged solitude darkens and disenchants the
                            loveliest objects, and eventually brings terror even to the strongest
                            heart." No man can afford to stagnate like a frog under a stone in a
                            marsh. It has been well said that of all kinds of isolation, inward
                            isolation is the most appalling. When a man persists in being unsociable
                            it is his own loss&#151;his continuous solitude makes him grumpy and
                            morbid and, in short, makes him very unhappy; and it has been suggested
                            that a shy man ought to take occasional dips into society from a
                            "medical point of view as a man should take a cold bath." There are many
                            illustrations of extreme unsociability; it is related of a man, not
                            unknown to fame, that even when he walked he drew his shoulders forward
                            so as to be nearer himself. Goethe observes that even the most eminent
                            man lives only by the day, and enjoys but a sorry entertainment when he
                            throws himself too much back upon himself, and "neglects to grasp into
                            the fullness of the external world, where alone he can find nourishment
                                <pb id="VAA3932-130" n="122"/> for his growth, and at the same time
                            a standard for its measurement." The observation is true that in
                            solitude we shrink up, and that no plant so much as man needs the sun
                            and the air. It was the lament of one that if he had lived more with
                            men, and less with dreams and books, he would have made his nature large
                            enough to bear the loss of a single passion. We can all readily concur
                            with Arnold when he asserts that it is not in retirement and separation
                            from the world but in the energies and activities of life, that the true
                            means of man's highest culture is to be found. Burns confessed, in one
                            of his letters, that his design in seeking society, was to fly from
                            constitutional melancholy, and he declared that even in the house of
                            social mirth "my gaiety is the madness of an intoxicated criminal under
                            the hands of an executioner."<ref id="ref_24" rend="super"

                            and isolation is sometimes attended with great inconvenience; Sydney

                            strength that comes to us in solitude from that shadowy, awful presence
                            that frivolous crowds repel. * * * There are natures that go to the
                            streams of life in great cities as the hart goes to the water brooks;
                            there are other natures that need the solitude of primeval forests and

                            he believed this course to be essential to one's happiness and success
                            in life. He said that he was extremely gregarious at the right time and
                            place, but that he loved to spend a large part of the day alone. It was
                            his belief that a perfect day consists in a solitary breakfast and a
                            solitary morning, a single companion for luncheon and
                            exercise&#151;again some solitary hours; then he loved to dine in
                            company, and, if possible, to spend the rest of the evening with two or
                            three congenial persons. He declared, however, that "more and more, as
                            life goes on, do I find the mixed company tiresome and the tête-à-tête
                                delightful."<note id="note_25" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                        <p>Occasional solitude is of course indispensable to the student or writer.
                            We do not mean that long continued isolation which, Plato says, has for
                            its companion an overbearing austerity, nor the solitude which Epictetus
                            defines to be the state of a helpless person. I have referred in another
                            place to the observation of Daniel <pb id="VAA3932-132" n="124"/>
                            Webster: "I love this occasional solitude. I like to contemplate nature,
                            and to hold communion unbroken by the presence of human beings. When
                            thinking is to be done, one must, of course, be alone. No man knows
                            himself who does not thus sometimes keep his own company." But even the
                            intellectual life does not require the complete abandonment of the
                            world, but, as Hamerton suggests, it does require free and frequent
                            spaces of labor in tranquil solitude, "retreats like those commanded by
                            the church of Rome, but with more of study and less of
                            contemplation."</p>
                        <p>Rousseau was a man of genius but his morbidity is unquestioned. He had an
                            innate contempt for men and his intense love of solitude justified the
                            charge of singularity and affectation. He says: "What period do you
                            think I recall most frequently and most willingly in my dreams? Not the
                            pleasures of my youth; they were too rare, too much mingled with
                            bitterness, and are now too distant. I recall the period of my
                            seclusion, of my solitary walks; of the fleeting but delicious days that
                            I have passed entirely by myself, with my good and simple housekeeper,
                            with my beloved dog, my old cat, with the birds of the field, the hinds
                            of the forest, with all Nature, and her inconceivable Author. In getting
                            up before the sun to contemplate its rising from my garden when a
                            beautiful day was commencing, my first wish was that no letters or
                            visits might come to disturb the charm."</p>
                        <p>In our day and generation the duties of a lawyer are pre-eminently
                            practical. There is but little in his pursuit that is conducive to the
                            development of either a <pb id="VAA3932-133" n="125"/> taste or a talent
                            for the poetic muse. The transition from the dull, unpoetical,
                            unimaginative, characteristics of a legal document, to the poem
                            expressing thought and feeling suitable to an excited and elevated
                            imagination, would seem to be so great as to be practically impossible.
                            An eminent writer distinguishes between the poets muse and the muse of
                            prose, showing the impassable gulf between them. He says: "The poet's
                            muse is like a mistress, whom we keep only while she is young and
                            beautiful; the muse of prose is like a wife, whom we take during life,
                            for better, for worse." This world would be much less interesting if it
                            were entirely without anomalies and we are supplied with one by Tacitus.
                            A lawyer, worn out with the intense labors of his profession, and being,
                            as it was alleged, of a poetical turn of mind, decided to entirely
                            withdraw himself from the fatigues of the bar. He declares: "That woods
                            and groves, and solitude itself, to me afford such delight, that I
                            reckon it among the chief blessings of poetry that it is cultivated far
                            from the noise and bustle of the world, without a client to besiege my
                            doors, or a criminal to distress me with his tears and squalor. Free
                            from those distractions, the poet retires to scenes of solitude, where
                            peace and innocence reside, and there he treads on consecrated
                            ground."</p>
                        <p>According to the modern view, when Tacitus enumerates the essential
                            deprivations of the poet, he certainly deals in language of hyperbole.
                            He says that it must not be forgotten, that the poet who would produce
                            anything excellent, must bid farewell to the conversation of his
                            friends; that he must renounce not only the pleasures <pb
                                id="VAA3932-134" n="126"/> of Rome, but also the duties of social
                            life; that he must retire, as the poets say, "to groves and grottoes,"
                            in other words to solitude.</p>
                        <p>It was the opinion of Goethe that a creation of importance could be
                            produced only when an author isolated himself, and, referring to his own
                            productions, said that those which had met with so much applause were
                            children of solitude.</p>
                        <p>There are men upon whom society grates. We have in our mind one who is
                            affable and frank toward every one, but shuns fashionable society.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is more interesting than to observe and note the habits, whims
                            and idiosyncrasies of men&#151;especially eminent men. A
                            distinguished Frenchman, being in sore distress, assured his friend that
                            under the circumstances nothing could be more agreeable to him than to
                            retire to his solitude, beneath his noble trees on the banks of the
                            Loire. He added: "If heaven be the overruling physician of the evils of
                            the mind, nature is a sovereign remedy."</p>
                        <p>We are told that Jacquemont bore solitude easily, and said that when
                            alone his thoughts were full of tenderness and sweetness. "A long,
                            studious retreat, entirely separated from the men and things of Europe,
                            would not, he thought, be painful to him. When he came to the test, he
                            found the intellectual isolation easy to bear; but he suffered from the
                            too long absence of those dear to him, and his imagination realized the
                            distance from them too well."</p>
                        <p>There is a singular fascination and charm about the life of De
                            Tocqueville. It was the life of a philosopher. <pb id="VAA3932-135"
                                n="127"/> His style of writing is said to be an imitation of that of
                            Mostesquieu; however this may be, we know that it has a magic charm. It
                            was said that "though his name was celebrated he knew the value of
                            tranquillity, and loved the penumbra of personal obscurity, estimating
                            public opinion at its just value, and taking fame for no more than it is
                            really worth."</p>
                        <p>It was said of a great French statesman that he had no love of personal
                            magnificence, no ambition even, but exerted great influence in public
                            affairs. "No important political step was ever taken without his being
                            consulted, but he never went to court, and was seldom seen in his own
                            drawing room."</p>

                        <p>The most extraordinary fondness for solitude, amounting almost to
                            self-annihilation, was exhibited by the great Duke of Leinster,
                            "Ireland's only duke." He was the scion of a noble and historic family,
                            the head of the house of Fitzgerald, the founder of which came to
                            England with William the Conqueror in 1066. After having attained his
                            majority, he returned to Ireland to take possession of his vast estates.
                            It is stated that "his frank and open air, the unaffected urbanity of
                            his manners, the kindness and cordiality which distinguished his
                            address, and an expression of dignified good nature in his physiognomy"
                            endeared him to the Irish people. Much was expected from the duke. Great
                            turmoil and unrest existed in Ireland on account of the <pb
                                id="VAA3932-137" n="129"/> excessive abuses of the local government.
                            It was to him the people looked for the correction of these abuses and
                            the pacification of Ireland. The historian of the period affirms that
                            the great duke "voluntarily consigned himself to oblivion." It required,
                            indeed, that he should make a sort of effort to be forgotten. He at last
                            succeeded in sinking out of the recollection of the public. We are
                            indebted to Mr. Shiel for his fascinating portraiture of this unique
                            character. Shiel, himself, was no inconsiderable personage. His writings
                            bespeak a cultivated taste; and one is charmed with the smoothness and
                            grace of his diction. He declares in the first sentence of one of the
                            chapters of his book: "I am an Irish barrister and go to the Leinster
                            Circuit." As a speaker he commanded admiration and applause, and it was
                            said of him that he was one of the greatest orators that Ireland,
                            "affluent in eloquence," ever produced. Shiel says, referring to the
                            great duke:</p>
                        <p>"The first injudicious step which he adopted was the sale of his
                            magnificent mansion in Merrion Square. It surpassed any private
                            residence in London, and rather resembled the palace of a Venetian
                            senator than the house of a British subject. That vast structure, upon
                            which enormous sums had been expended by his father, was a perpetual
                            intimation of the importance of the duke as long as it was called
                            Leinster house; but after he had sold it to the Dublin society, and its
                            original distinction was laid aside, a memorial of the family was
                            wanting, which the duke's political conduct was not calculated to
                            supply. * * * After having sold <pb id="VAA3932-138" n="130"/> his
                            house, the duke retired to the woods and solitudes of Carton. There he
                            buried himself from the inspection, and gradually dropped out of the
                            notice of the country. Having a turn for mechanics, he provided himself
                            with a large assortment of carpenter's tools, and beguiled the tedium of
                            existence with occupations by which his arms were put into requisition.
                            There is not a better sawyer in the county of Kildare. As you wander
                            through the forests on his demesne, you occasionally meet a vigorous
                            young woodman, with his shirt sleeves tucked up to his shoulders, while
                            he lays the ax to the trunk of some lofty tree that totters beneath his
                            stroke. On approaching, you perceive a handsome face, flushed with
                            exercise and health, and covered with perspiration. Should you enter
                            into conversation with him, he will throw off a few jovial words between
                            every descent of the ax; and, if he should pause in his task for his
                            breath, will hail you in the tone of good-humored fellowship. He sets to
                            his work again, while you pursue your path through the woodlands, and
                            hear from the ranger of the forest that you have just seen no less a
                            person than his grace himself.</p>
                        <p>"In the midst of these innocent employments, the Duke of Leinster passes
                            away a life which ought to be devoted to higher purposes. * * * He not
                            only holds no place in the public estimation beyond that which virtues
                            confer upon him, but he is without any influence at the Castle. * * *
                            How different an impression would he have produced, had he taken the
                            more active and intrepid part to which his fortunes appeared to invite
                            him! The mock regality of a lord-lieutenant <pb id="VAA3932-139" n="131"
                            /> would fade at once before him. The representative of a nation would
                            stand superior to the delegate of the king. * * * Nature had not mixed
                            that mounting quality in his blood which teaches men to aspire to
                            greatness, and makes them impatient of subordination."</p>

                            <p>We are too prone to borrow trouble and anticipate evils that may
                                never appear. "The fear of ill exceeds the ill we fear." Mr. Lincoln
                                once said that he never crossed Fox river, no matter how high the
                                stream was, until he came to it. "It is madness," says Jeremy
                                Taylor, "to make the present miserable by fearing it may be ill
                                to-morrow. This day only is ours; we are dead to yesterday and we
                                are not born to the morrow." We should give ourselves the full
                                benefit of the present time, but many of us, if we examine our own
                                thoughts, will find them occupied with the past and the future,
                                ignoring the present. The truth of the observation of Pascal is
                                evident when he declares "That the present is never our end; the
                                past and present are our means; the future alone is our end. Thus we
                                never live but we hope to live; and always disposing ourselves to be
                                happy, it is inevitable that we never become so. * * * Many believe
                                that they are sincerely seeking repose, and are seeking in reality
                                only agitation." This view of Pascal suggests Pope's line, "Man
                                never is, but always to be blessed."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Howells relates of a friend who was eminent in <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-141" n="133"/> literature, that he had a philosophy
                                which he liked to impress with a vivid touch on his listener's
                                shoulder: "Put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it. It's
                                the only one you've got, or ever will have."</p>
                            <p>The absurdity of drawing drafts on the misery of futurity ought to be
                                obvious to every one. Sydney Smith had an excellent rule for the
                                happiness and wisdom of life as to the future, not to look too far
                                into it. His rule was "Take short views of life, hope for the best,
                                and trust in God." He declared that this habit of taking very short
                                views may be acquired by degrees and that a great sum of happiness
                                will be gained by it. Herbert Spencer is in accord with this
                                conception when he insists that one should live for the day and in
                                the day&#151;not lose oneself in anxieties and schemes and aims;
                                and not be overshadowed by distant terrors and far-off hopes, but
                                should say, "To-day is given me for my own; let me use it, let me
                                live in it." Walter Pater, though not a follower of Aristippus, who
                                believed in a life of ease and self-indulgence, declared that we may
                                believe most firmly in a future life and still be assured of our
                                duty to get all we can out of this one; that we may believe most
                                firmly in the duty of living for others and yet we never can escape
                                the duty of living for ourselves. His aim was, as he says, "To well
                                adorn and beautify these fleeting lives into an exquisite
                                graciousness and urbanity."</p>
                            <p>The universality of the belief that prevailed throughout Christendom
                                that the end of the world would occur at the close of the tenth
                                century, is impressively related by Sismondi. This belief was based
                                upon a misconception <pb id="VAA3932-142" n="134"/> of the twentieth
                                chapter of the Apocalypse. The historian declares that it is almost
                                a matter of surprise, that a belief so general did not bring about
                                its own dreadful fulfillment. So, an individual, who is constantly
                                anticipating and dreading the happening to himself of some dire
                                calamity, may contribute to its actual occurrence. Swift died as he
                                had feared and constantly predicted, "In a rage like a poisoned rat
                                in a hole." We recall these lines from Johnson's "Senility and
                                Imbecility":</p>
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">"From Marlborough's eyes the streams of dotage flowed,</l>
                                <l n="2">And Swift expired a driveller and a show."</l>
                            </lg>
                            <p>It will be conducive to one's happiness to avoid the inexplicable. Do
                                not attempt the solution of insoluble problems. There are many of
                                them. The great author of the "Provincial Letters" cites some of
                                them when he says: "Man is himself the most marvelous object of
                                nature; for he can not conceive what body is, and still less what
                                mind is, and least of all how a body can be united with a mind. This
                                is the climax of his difficulties, and yet it is his own being."</p>
                            <p>Young men have their troubles. They are oftentimes shy and
                                embarrassed and ill at ease. A man of large observation and with a
                                profound knowledge of nature, observes that a young man in making
                                his first entrance into society is so ignorant as to imagine he is
                                the object of universal attention; and that everything he does is
                                the subject of the most rigid criticism. Of course, under such a
                                supposition, he is shy and embarrassed; he regains his ease as he
                                becomes aware of his insignificance. <pb id="VAA3932-143" n="135"/>
                                Again, in youth we look forward to the advances of age and feel them
                                more strongly than when they arrive. Mr. Hazlitt suggests that this
                                is no more extraordinary than that from the height of a precipice
                                the descent below should make us dizzy, and that we should be less
                                sensible of it when we come to the ground.</p>
                            <p>No one borrows more trouble than the miser. It is said that many of
                                them are not afraid of death but are possessed of a horrible dread
                                of coming to want; having begun with poverty they are constantly
                                haunted with the idea that they shall end in it and it is related
                                that some have actually died to save charges.</p>
                            <p>We believe that we ought to be satisfied if we have succeeded in any
                                one thing, or with having done our best, and we concur in the
                                opinion of Hazlitt that anything more is "for health and amusement,
                                and should be resorted to as a source of pleasure, not of fretful
                                impatience and self-imposed mortification."</p>
                            <p>There are many instances where the despondency of age rests like a
                                pall upon the countenance. Mr. Benson has much to say of a
                                consolatory nature to those past the meridian of life. He declares
                                that there are many compensations for the lack of youthful prowess.
                                One is the loss of the quality of self-consciousness which is
                                peculiar to the youth and which causes shyness, and the unpleasant
                                consciousness of having nothing to say or of having said the wrong
                                thing in the wrong way. Another great gain is that with age there
                                comes a sort of patience. He says, "In youth mistakes seemed
                                irreparable, calamities intolerable, disappointments unbearable. An
                                anxiety hung like a dark impenetrable cloud, a disappointment <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-144" n="136"/> poisoned the springs of life. But now
                                I have learned that mistakes can often be set right, that anxieties
                                fade, that calamities have sometimes a compensating joy, that an
                                ambition realized is not always pleasurable, that a disappointment
                                is often of itself a rich incentive to try again. * * * That one
                                learns to look over troubles, instead of looking into them; one
                                learns that hope is more unconquerable than grief." Mr. Benson also
                                cites, with approval, the assertion of Lord Beaconsfield that the
                                worst evil one has to endure is the anticipation of the calamities
                                that do not happen, and that the thing to aim at is to live as far
                                as possible in the day and for the day. Wordsworth declared that he
                                thought we had pleasanter days in the outset of life, but that our
                                years slid on pretty even one with another, as we gained in variety
                                and richness what we lost in intensity. Hazlitt averred that, upon
                                the whole, there are many things to prop up and reinforce our
                                fondness for existence, after the intoxication of our first
                                acquaintance with it is over: "health, a walk and the appetite it
                                creates, a book, the doing a good-natured or friendly action, are
                                satisfactions that hold out to the last; and with these and many
                                others to aid us that fall harmlessly in our way, we may make a
                                shift for a few seasons, after having enjoyed the short-lived
                                transports of an eager and enthusiastic imagination, and without
                                being under the necessity of hanging or drowning ourselves as soon
                                as we come to years of discretion."</p>
                            <p>We are told that to be pensive, not sentimental, is the joy of later
                                life: "to grow old, patiently and bravely&#151;even
                                joyfully&#151;that is the secret; that life, if it does not

                            <p>The most prolific source of our borrowed troubles is the certainty of
                                death; but much consolation is derived from the conviction that, in
                                the wise economy of Providence, no one ever dies too soon or lives
                                too long. We all understand that to die is the common lot of
                                humanity; and that in the grave, the only distinction is between
                                oblivion and renown&#151;and that a vast majority of us must be
                                content with the former. We learn much from the ancients, one of
                                whom declared that it was better to die once than to live always in
                                fear of death; but we do not need the wisdom of the ancients to
                                convince us that it is not necessary to make a hell of this world in
                                order to enjoy paradise in the next. We have reason to thank our
                                stars that the old theological idea that mortals are sent here as to
                                a place of sore chastisement and mortification, if not obsolete, is
                                at least obsolescent. Goethe was perfectly enchanted with the beauty
                                of the thought that the ancients had recognized death as the brother
                                of sleep; and George Meredith declared that nothing is more
                                beautiful than a peaceful death&#151;that there is nothing
                                shocking to the mind&#151;that it suggests heaven and seems a
                                fulfillment of our prayers. In many instances, the friends around
                                the patient are scarcely aware that he has gone, until the
                                "moonlight of death" has passed over his countenance&#151;so
                                silently and tranquilly has he departed.</p>
                            <p>Ampère, the celebrated French historian and traveler, was told by his
                                physician in Egypt that his malady, dysentery, was almost invariably
                                fatal in the Egyptian <pb id="VAA3932-146" n="138"/> climate, but
                                added "that human life is not worth much at the best, and dying is
                                much less difficult than people generally believe."</p>
                            <p>Ambassador White, upon request, accompanied Count Tolstoi to the
                                funeral of one of the latter's friends. In the course of their
                                conversation, Tolstoi remarked that to look upon the dead should
                                rather give pleasure than pain; that <hi rend="i">memento mori</hi>
                                is a wise maxim, and looking upon the faces of the dead is a good
                                way of putting it in practise.</p>
                            <p>It has been suggested that the fancied shortness of life is aided by
                                the apprehension of a future state&#151;that in ancient times
                                the fear of death was a less prominent feature than it is at
                                present, because the thought of it and of a future state, were less
                                frequently impressed on the mind by religion and morality.<ref

                            <p>Lord Bacon declared that men fear death as children fear to go in the
                                dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales,
                                so is the other; and that the surroundings of death terrify more
                                than death itself. He says that it is as natural to die as to be
                                born; and to a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful as the
                                other, and adds, "He that dies in an earnest pursuit is like one
                                that is wounded in hot blood, who, for the time, scarce feels the
                                hurt; and therefore a mind fixed and bent upon somewhat that is good
                                doth avert the dolors of death."</p>
                            <p>Socrates advises that we be of good cheer about death, and know of a
                                certainty that no evil will happen to a good man either in this life
                                or after death.</p>
                            <p>Marcus Aurelius declares that if one considers death <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-147" n="139"/> by itself, separating it in thought
                                from its imaginary terrors, it will be understood to be a work of
                                nature, and nothing else; and that to dread what is natural is
                                childish. "That death like birth is a mystery of nature; the one a
                                combining of elements, the other a dissolution; and that we should
                                await the summons with a serene mind, as the natural dissolution of
                                the elements of which every animal is composed."</p>
                            <p>He adjures the people not to worry about the future. That they will
                                meet it, if need be, with the same reason that they now employ in
                                their present affairs.</p>
                            <p>We have been impressed by the observations of Montaigne on this
                                subject. We must admit, however, that his first statement barely
                                missed being a platitude, when he declares that "The care of
                                funerals, the place of sepulture, and the pomp of the obsequies, are
                                rather consolations to the living than any benefit to the dead."
                                Referring to himself he says, "Never was any man prepared to bid
                                adieu to the world absolutely and purely, nor did anyone ever quit
                                his hold of it more universally than I hope to do. The deadest
                                deaths are the best.</p>
                            <p>"By the same passage that you came from death to life, without
                                passion or fear, go back from life to death. Your death is part of
                                the constitution of the universe; it is a part of the life of the
                                world.</p>
                            <p>"Why do you not go away from life like a satisfied guest from a
                                feast?</p>
                            <p>"Make room for others, as others have done for you. Equality is the
                                soul of equity.</p>
                            <p>"Let your life end where or when it will, it is all included in
                                eternity.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-148" n="140"/>
                            <p>"If company will make it more pleasant, does not all the world go the
                                selfsame way as you do? * * * A thousand men, a thousand animals,
                                and a thousand other creatures die at the same instant that you
                                expire.</p>
                            <p>"Do but seriously consider how intolerable and painful a life would
                                be which was to last forever."</p>
                            <p>The great French novelist<ref id="ref_32" rend="super"
                                    target="note_32" targOrder="U">3</ref> expatiates upon the two
                                manners of death: "The agony of death has its own wisdom. Not seldom
                                a simple girl, scarcely more than a child, will grow wise with the
                                experience of a hundred years, will gain prophetic vision, judge her
                                family, and see clearly through all pretenses, at the near approach
                                of death. Herein lies death's poetry. But, strange and worthy of
                                remark it is, there are two manners of death.<note id="note_32"

                            </p>
                            <p>"The poetry of prophecy, the gift of seeing clearly into the future
                                or the past, only belongs to those whose bodies are stricken, to
                                those who die by the destruction of the organs of physical life.
                                Consumptive patients, for instance, or those who die of
                                gangrene&#151;like Louis 14&#151;may possess this supreme
                                lucidity to the full; their deaths fill us with surprise and wonder.
                                But many, on the other hand, die of intelligential diseases, as they
                                may be called; of maladies seated in the brain or in that nervous
                                system which acts as a kind of purveyor of thought fuel&#151;and
                                these die wholly, body and spirit are darkened together. The former
                                are spirits deserted by the body, realizing for us our ideas of the
                                spirits of scripture; the latter are bodies untenanted by a
                                spirit."</p>
                            <p>It has been observed that the approach of death usually brings the
                                exhibition of kindly and gentle emotions. Senator Hoar relates that
                                he and Senator Walthall of <pb id="VAA3932-149" n="141"/>
                                Mississippi were intense political opponents and almost invariably
                                disagreed, and that the latter was not wont to wear his heart upon
                                his sleeve. On one occasion, however, the senator from Mississippi
                                gave expression of deep and kindly feeling toward Senator Hoar. The
                                latter was convinced that it was "due to a premonition, of which he
                                was perhaps unconscious, that the end of his life was near, and to
                                the kindly and gentle emotions which in a brave and affectionate
                                heart like his the approach of death is apt to bring."</p>
                            <p>The subject of death has received the calm and deliberate
                                consideration of the wise men of all ages, and it is a source of
                                comfort and satisfaction to recall their words of wisdom.</p>
                            <p>Lord Chesterfield, in his old age, declared that he got as much as
                                possible of the quiet pleasures of gardening, walking and reading,
                                and, in the meantime awaited death without desiring or fearing
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Herbert Spencer considered that it would be great joy to die quickly
                                and suddenly, in all the activity of life, in comparative
                                tranquillity, with none of the hideous apparatus of the sick room
                                about one, and with no dreary waiting for death. He suggested that
                                the only course we can follow is this: "Not by endeavoring to
                                anticipate in thought the moment of our end&#151;that, perhaps,
                                only adds to its terrors when it comes&#151;but by resolutely
                                and tenderly, day after day, learning to commend ourselves to the
                                hand of God; to make what efforts we can; to do our best; to decide
                                as simply and sincerely as possible what our path should be, and
                                then to leave the issue humbly and quietly with God."</p>
                            <p>The observations of Mr. Benson on this subject are <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-150" n="142"/> admirable and one can not fail to be
                                profoundly impressed by reading them. He declares that we begin to
                                see, some later, some earlier, that we must find something to hold
                                onto, something eternal and everlasting in which we can rest. There
                                must be some anchor of the soul. He declares that "The anchor can
                                not be a material one, for there is no security there; it can not be
                                purely intellectual, for that is a shifting thing, too. The well of
                                the spirit is emptied gradually and tenderly; we must find out what
                                the spring is that can fill it up. * * * But the faith must be
                                deeper faith even than the faith of a dogmatic creed; for that is
                                shifting, too, every day, and the simplest creed holds some
                                admixture of human temperament and human error. * * * To me there
                                are but two things that seem to point to hope. The first is the
                                strongest and deepest of human things, the power of
                                love&#151;not I think the more vehement and selfish forms of
                                love, the desire of youth for beauty, the consummate love of the
                                mother for the infant&#151;for these have some physical
                                admixture in them. But the tranquil and purer manifestations of the
                                spirit, the love of a father for the son, of a friend for a friend;
                                that love that can light up a face upon the edge of a dark river,
                                and can smile in the very throes of pain. That seems to me the only
                                thing that holds out a tender defiance against change and suffering
                                and death. * * * And then there is the faith in the vast creative
                                mind that bade us be. * * * A faith in God and a faith in love; and
                                here seems to me to lie the strength and power of the Christian
                                Revelation. It is to these two things that Christ pointed men."</p>

                            <head>DEVOTION THE HIGHEST HEIGHT OF LOVE.</head>
                            <p>All fiction abounds with expressions of admiration for the beauty and
                                grace of women. We contend that their greatest charm is devotion. In
                                the course of time beauty will inevitably fade, devotion may
                                continue during life and after death&#151;forever. It has been
                                said that the best loved women in history have been by no means
                                perfectly beautiful for ordinary eyes; that Cleopatra, Madame de
                                Pompadour and nearly all women famous throughout the world for the
                                love which they inspired, have had their defects and shortcomings.
                                There is a limit to the charm of mere physical beauty, while the
                                beauty of the soul is infinite. It has been said, most truly, I
                                believe, "that devotion is the highest height of love."</p>
                            <p>Exemplifications of this devotion are to be found in every-day life.
                                Only a few days ago the newspapers relate that a young lady residing
                                in South Bend, Indiana, arrived in Atlanta on her way to the bedside
                                of her lover who was critically ill at Macon. Rather than wait two
                                hours for the regular train, she demanded a special which carried
                                her, as on the wings of the wind, to her destination, a distance of
                                ninety-three miles.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-152" n="144"/>
                            <p>In the great battle of Gettysburg, in which the Confederate General
                                Pickett made his celebrated charge which amazed and electrified the
                                world&#151;and while the terrible conflict was going
                                on&#151;the general discovered Mrs. Pickett near him. Being
                                gently reproved for her daring, she insisted that "in time of
                                imminent danger a woman's place is by the side of her husband".</p>
                            <p>Another impressive example of the devotion of woman is that of
                                Bettina for Goethe. The great poet resided at Weimar, had attained
                                the age of fifty-eight years, and his name was already trembling on
                                every tongue. Bettina's home was at Frankfort; she was nineteen,
                                but, on account of her small stature, seemed to be twelve or
                                thirteen. Quite suddenly Bettina fell in love with Goethe, though
                                she had never seen him. She only knew him through his renown and his
                                great works. Her adoration of Goethe began while Bettina was musing
                                alone in the garden upon a delicious summer morning, an hour most
                                favorable for noble conceptions&#151;when all nature and the
                                world were silent, save the feathered songsters, and the sun, being
                                just risen, causing the flimsy gossamers to glisten in the morning
                                dew. "Gifted with a varied imagination, exquisite poetical feeling,
                                and a passionate love of nature, she personifies all her tastes and
                                youthful aspirations in Goethe's image, loving him with rapture as
                                the incarnation of all her dreams."</p>
                            <p>The adoration of Bettina for Goethe is difficult of description and
                                analysis. It certainly was not an ordinary love but rather a kind of
                                worship. It has been described as "an ideal sentiment better than a
                                love purely from the imagination and yet dissimilar to one entirely
                                    <pb id="VAA3932-153" n="145"/> from the heart. * * * That
                                Bettina felt in him the dignity arising from the grandeur of his
                                mind." Again it has been said that their mutual love "was a flame
                                that carressed without burning."</p>
                            <p>On Goethe's part, he realized that he was charming to one that he
                                kept at a distance, and that he was indebted to Bettina for "a
                                rejuvenescence of mind and a return to spiritual life; but that he
                                was only in love with the heroine of his fancy, the ideal of his
                                dreams."</p>
                            <p>The highest literary authority has declared that Goethe was not only
                                the greatest poet of Germany, but one of the greatest poets of all
                                ages. "That his nature responded to every influence of passing
                                emotion. Like a delicate harp, it was silent if not touched, and yet
                                gave its music to every wooing of the wilful wind."</p>
                            <p>Bettina writes an account of her first meeting with Goethe. She
                                called with a letter of introduction. On arriving at the house of
                                the great poet, she waited a few minutes before seeing him. Suddenly
                                the door burst open and Goethe appeared. She says:</p>
                            <p>"He surveyed me solemnly and fixedly. I believe I stretched out my
                                hands toward him. I felt my strength failing me! Goethe folded me to
                                his heart, murmuring the while: 'Poor child! I have frightened you.'
                                Those were the first words he uttered, and they entered my soul. He
                                led me into his room, and made me sit on the sofa before him. We
                                were then both speechless. He at last broke the silence." * * * He
                                referred to the recent death of the Duchess Amelia, and inquired if
                                she had read it&#151;and that he imagined everything in relation
                                to Weimar interested her. She replied, "No, nothing <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-154" n="146"/> interests me except yourself." He
                                remarked, "You are a charming girl." Then came a long pause. "I was
                                still exiled on that fatal sofa, shy and trembling. My conduct was
                                utterly disgraceful. I at last exclaimed, 'I can not remain on this
                                couch!' and I rose suddenly. 'Well, do as you please,' he replied. I
                                threw my arm around his neck, and he drew me on his knee, pressing
                                me to his heart." * * * She remained long enough on his shoulder to
                                fall asleep. On awakening she began conversing a little. Goethe
                                plucked a leaf off the vine that clustered round his window, and
                                said: "This leaf and your cheek have the same freshness and the same
                                bloom."</p>
                            <p>"Their second meeting took place after an interval of several months.
                                Bettina could hardly speak, so deep was her emotion. Goethe placed
                                his hands on her lips and said: "Speak with your eyes. I understand
                                everything;" and when he saw that the eyes of the charming child
                                were full of tears, he closed them, adding wisely, "Let us be
                                calm&#151;it becomes us both to be so."<ref id="ref_33"

                            <p>I have nowhere been able to find any description of the personal
                                charms of Bettina&#151;of her graceful form, of her beautiful
                                face, of her bewitching manners. She may or may not have possessed
                                physical beauty. But how exceedingly unimportant this question
                                becomes, if she had that love, that devotion, which catches its
                                inspiration from the immortal God and leaves, at an immeasurable
                                distance below, sensualism and the sensualist, and all the baser
                                passions of the human heart!</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-155" n="147"/>
                            <p>Those who have read the history of France for the period embracing
                                the first half of the last century are no doubt familiar with the
                                life of that extraordinary woman, Madame Recamier. Nearly all of her
                                friendships were with men, but there is no evidence against her
                                morality. It is said that the leading motive of her life was simply
                                the desire to exercise a supreme influence in a certain limited
                                circle. "That she liked to be the queen of a little court, to live
                                surrounded by sympathy, affection and admiration." Those who
                                gathered around her were men of intellectual eminence usually much
                                younger than herself. She has been described as a woman of stately
                                beauty, royal grace of demeanor, and of exquisite tact and taste.
                                The most effectual of her arts was to manifest the heartiest
                                possible interest in a man's career, so that he felt at liberty to
                                consult with her at any time about his ambition and purposes in
                                life; and he always found an attentive listener and kindly adviser.
                                It is conceded that she knew the value of her extraordinary physical
                                attractions and availed herself of them in her efforts to preserve
                                her influence amongst her admirers. It seems that she never even in
                                old age, ill health, and reduced circumstances lost her
                                attraction.</p>
                            <p>Jean Jacques Ampère, a brilliant young Frenchman, historian,
                                archæologist, and traveler, early developed an ardent predilection
                                for literary pursuits, which was "strengthened by his intimate
                                intercourse with the brilliant circle to which his introduction to
                                Madame Recamier's celebrated reunions admitted him."</p>
                            <p>The lady manifested extraordinary interest in young <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-156" n="148"/> Ampère's intellectual pursuits, and
                                he frequently conferred with her personally, and sought her advice
                                by letters. In one of his letters to her he says:</p>
                            <p>"You like me to speak about my labor, to tell you all my studies, as
                                a schoolboy tells his mamma. Well, here is what just at present time
                                seems to me the finest thing in the world, and an infallible means
                                of arriving almost at universal knowledge. It is very simple and
                                consists only in remarking in each book that I read what are the
                                most important points, to concentrate all my attention upon them, to
                                engrave them in my memory, and endeavor to forget all the rest
                                entirely. To this I add another condition, which is to read, on each
                                subject and in each language, nothing but the best books. It seems
                                to me that by this method it may be possible, without uselessly
                                overburdening the mind, to acquire very accurate and very various
                                knowledge. I have begun to apply this system to various work, and am
                                delighted with it."</p>
                            <p>Madame Recamier, a blind old woman, died at the age of seventy-two.
                                Young Ampère overwhelmed by grief for her death, threw up his
                                employment, "crossed seas," and traversed both the Eastern and
                                Western hemispheres, hoping, if possible, to assuage his grief,
                                which seemed to be inconsolable. He was bound to her by no tie of
                                consanguinity, and she only liked him, the question of love, in the
                                ordinary acceptation of the term, so far as she was concerned, at
                                least, having no place in their association. This extraordinary
                                devotion on the part of Ampère certainly has no parallel in the
                                history of the human heart.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-157" n="149"/>
                            <p>To illustrate the truth that "devotion is the highest height of
                                love," I have already cited three instances of feminine and one of
                                masculine devotion. I now give an historical incident illustrative
                                of the mutual devotion of the sexes.</p>
                            <p>John Jacques Rousseau is one of the great historical characters of
                                the world. He was neither a great dramatist nor a great poet, nor
                                even a great novelist. He is usually characterized as "philosopher;"
                                and as a delineator of the passions of the human heart, and a
                                describer of the beauties of nature, he is considered to be without
                                a rival.</p>
                            <p>From the impartial student, his character and writings will command
                                neither unqualified approbation nor unqualified reprobation; but
                                many of his defects and shortcomings have been excused and palliated
                                by reason of his wonderful feeling and passionate sincerity.</p>
                            <p>His writings and teachings did more to precipitate the French
                                Revolution, than those of Mrs. Stowe to bring about the civil war in
                                America; unlike Mrs. Stowe, however, he died before the fire which
                                he had kindled broke forth in all its virulence and fury.
                                Robespierre and Madame Roland, and their followers, quoted Rousseau
                                in justification of their excesses and intolerance.</p>
                            <p>The most famous and most poetical episode in Rousseau's life was his
                                amour with Madame de Warren. Writers have reviewed it with emotion,
                                eloquence and enthusiasm, and it has passed into history as one of
                                the most famous love stories. "The scene of it long since <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-158" n="150"/> became a place of sentimental
                                pilgrimage, preserved as an historical monument at public cost."</p>
                            <p>It is only to the incipiency of this amour that we wish to refer.
                                Madame de Warren was a widow of twenty-nine, a handsome woman, but
                                of no dazzling beauty. John Jacques was a lad of sixteen. It is said
                                that the tones of his voice were suggestive of emotion, and that he
                                had strangely beautiful eyes; and that his face was beautified by
                                the serenity of a blameless soul. He was at the age when a boy is
                                still floating in the paradise of fancy&#151;when his love is
                                spiritual&#151;sentiment rather than passion. The very strength
                                of his spiritual passion imposes severe self-restraint, and inspires
                                one with a reverence for woman. To her what can be more delightful
                                than to feel that tenderness is inspired by sentiment rather than by
                                passion! On account of disparity of age, he must have felt that his
                                love could never become consummate by marriage&#151;but it has
                                been said that there is nothing so near divine love as hopeless
                                love.</p>
                            <p>It is as true as it is trite, that a boy has a very positive
                                predilection for falling in love with a woman many years his
                                senior.</p>
                            <p>The earliest manifestation of affection between Rousseau and Madame
                                de Warren was when, he kneeling at her feet, with his head in her
                                lap, they both sobbed&#151;sobbed themselves to sleep.</p>
                            <p>The hardened old "buffer" whose sensibilities have become callous in
                                his pursuit of gain, or whose mind has been infected with a moral
                                scrofula, will have no appreciation of this marvelous exhibition of
                                tenderness and sentiment. But Rousseau declared, in after years, <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-159" n="151"/> that he tasted on this occasion the
                                purest pleasure&#151;and enjoyed idyllic and Arcadian
                                happiness.</p>
                            <p>The principle applied to the age of chivalry, that sin loses half its
                                evil by losing all its grossness, has no application here, for the
                                very obvious reason that no sin had been committed.</p>
                            <p>We end as we began, by reiterating the thought, that the greatest and
                                only enduring beauty is devotion&#151;the beauty of the
                                soul.</p>

                            <head>PLAGIARISM&#151;ORIGINALITY.</head>
                            <p>The charge of irrelevancy, upon the strength of so great an authority
                                as Hallam, must always be regarded as hypercriticism. The accusation
                                of plagiarism is the charge which authors of both ancient and modern
                                times have been most generally called upon to answer. Most of our
                                thoughts are derived by perception rather than conception. This fact
                                does not constitute plagiarism. A plagiarist is one who purloins the
                                writings of another and puts them off as his own. This is certainly
                                a very grave offense and the one who commits it becomes an object of
                                both commiseration and contempt. It is our opinion that such cases
                                are exceedingly rare if, for no other reason, because the
                                perpetrator is sure to be found out and exposed. To assume that the
                                theft would not be discovered, would be a gross reflection upon the
                                alertness and acuteness of the literary world. This charge was
                                placed at the door of Coleridge. His son, after the death of his
                                father, made the fine observation, that the door which separates the
                                chambers of memory and imagination <pb id="VAA3932-160" n="152"/> is
                                so loosely hung, that it will now and then swing open, and allow the
                                treasures of one to roll into the other. If it were possible for any
                                author to eliminate from his work all thoughts, not indigenous to
                                his own brain, his book would be a veritable skeleton.</p>
                            <p>The author may legitimately derive his thoughts and material either
                                by perception or conception; the former may be by observation,
                                conversation with others, or by reading the writings of other
                                authors; the latter only requires susceptibility "which brings its
                                subject-matter with it, and is itself the instrument of
                                culture."</p>
                            <p>It has been truly observed that perception and conception mutually
                                require each other. Goethe declared, however, that he felt that the
                                surest basis on which to build was his own creative talents. He said
                                that for many years he had never known it to fail him for a moment.
                                "What, waking, I had seen by day, often shaped itself into regular
                                dreams at night; and when I opened my eyes, there appeared to me
                                either a wonderful new whole, or a part of one already commenced."
                                He added, in the same connection, that a creation of importance
                                could be produced only when its author isolated himself; and that
                                his own productions which had met with so much applause were
                                children of solitude.</p>
                            <p>The same great author declares that all that is wise has been thought
                                already but we must try nevertheless to think it again. He suggested
                                that the finest sign of originality is to know how to develop an old
                                thought so fruitfully that no one could have guessed before how much
                                truth there was in it.</p>
                            <p>The author of a novel may derive his characters from <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-161" n="153"/> different sources. He may observe
                                them directly in the actual world; he hears or reads about them and
                                thus appropriates the experience of other persons, or he may imagine
                                his characters.<ref id="ref_34" rend="super" target="note_34"

                            <p>Montaigne admonishes his readers not to let the subjects he writes on
                                be so much attended to as his manner of treating them, and says,
                                "Let it be observed whether, in what I borrow from others, I have
                                chosen what tends to set off or support the invention, which is
                                always my own."</p>
                            <p>The merit of an author lies in his form; "his true originality lies
                                in the plan of his work and in his style&#151;that manner of
                                expression which distinguished the mold of his genius from the
                                mintage of any other brain. Of the novelty of his ideas he can give
                                no guarantee, but the form in which they are conveyed is his own
                                peculiar property." The style of an author should be of the image of
                                his mind&#151;the necessary expression, not of himself, but of
                                his manner of thought. Thus, says Pater, Macaulay was a man who
                                perceived likenesses and unlikenesses; he thought largely by
                                contrast and generalizations.</p>
                            <p>Professor Flint in his "Philosophy of History," writing of
                                Montesquieu, declares that he was endowed with "that most valuable
                                sort of originality which enables a man to draw with independence
                                from the most various sources, and to use what he obtains according
                                to a plan and principle and for a purpose of his own&#151;the
                                originality of Aristotle and Adam Smith."</p>

                                originality&#151;in letters?</p>
                            <p>"Is it, or is it not, still true that, as the wise man proclaimed
                                twenty-eight hundred years ago, there is nothing new under the sun?
                                * * * The originality which some critics demand is simply an
                                impossibility. * * * To attain it, he must place himself in the
                                condition of the first man, and ignore all the ideas which he owes
                                to his contemporaries and the generations before him. * * * He
                                should be shut up from childhood, like Miranda, an a desert island,
                                with no companion but Caliban. * * * The most conscientious writer,
                                however hard he may strive to be original, is compelled to be, in a
                                greater or less degree, a literary resurrectionist. * * * If we wish
                                to know whether there is any originality in the literature of our
                                day, we shall not ask whether its materials are absolutely new, but
                                whether they have been so adapted and moulded as to be a new
                                creation. * * * The essence of originality&#151;the only
                                originality possible in our day&#151;is not the invention of
                                something bizarre and extraordinary, but the vitalizing of materials
                                that already exist, and which are common to all. It is not easy to
                                define what is called genius; but one thing is certain, namely, that
                                it does not feed on itself and spin cobwebs out of its own bowels,
                                which would only keep it forever impoverished and thin, but it is
                                essentially passive and receptive in its nature, and impregnates
                                itself continually with the thoughts and feelings of others.</p>

                            <p>"Voltaire laughed to scorn the idea of a perfect originality. He
                                declared that the most original writers borrow from one another; and
                                says that the instruction we gather from books is like fire,

                                growth soon fail like rivulets which dry up in summer. Far different
                                are those which receive in their course the tribute of a hundred
                                rivers, and which, even in the dog-days, carry mighty waves
                                triumphantly to the ocean."</p>

                            <p>We are well convinced that intellectual pursuits do not qualify
                                anyone for success in fashionable society. Byron, in a letter to
                                Moore, declared that society as then constituted was fatal to all
                                original undertakings; but the well-known morbidity of Byron would
                                tend to impair the force of his opinion. We believe that the
                                mingling in general society to a moderate extent, would, as a rule,
                                be beneficial to the student rather than detrimental. To permanently
                                withdraw from society&#151;to become a mere
                                recluse&#151;could only result in serious demoralization.
                                Moderation in these, as in the other affairs of life, should be our
                                shibboleth.</p>
                            <p>Now and then we find a frivolous man who is perfectly content with a
                                mere drawing-room celebrity. He wishes naught beside. He talks
                                himself out and is at <pb id="VAA3932-164" n="156"/> the end of his
                                rope. Balzac, so celebrated for his keen analysis of character,
                                described an individual who "learned to dance and waltz so well as
                                to be noted;" it was a source of exquisite satisfaction and delight
                                to this person to be known as "handsome Thuillier." It is related,
                                however, that he was as deficient in intellectual and literary
                                acquirements as if he had been born with a natural delicacy of
                                mental constitution. In brief, he became weak in "the
                                intellectuals."</p>
                            <p>Hamerton defines fashion to be nothing more than the temporary custom
                                of rich and idle people who make it their principal business to
                                study the external elegance of life. He says "that an intellectual
                                man may go into general society, quite safely, if only he can resist
                                its influence upon his serious work; but such resistance is
                                difficult in maturity and impossible in youth. * * * That the
                                impression which fashionable society produces upon a student who has
                                strength enough to resist it is a painful sense of isolation in his
                                earnest work."</p>
                            <p>An eminent man, of large observation, declares that great men are the
                                slaves of their work, and that their indifference to outer things,
                                their devotion to their work, make simpletons regard them as
                                egotists, and they "are expected to wear the same garb as the dandy
                                who fulfills the trivial evolutions called social duties. These men
                                want the lions of the Atlas to be combed and scented like a lady's
                                poodle."</p>
                            <p>The views of great men on this subject, as exemplified by their own
                                lives, are interesting and instructive. We read of Lowell that while
                                he was not an unsocial man, he was most distinctly not a society
                                man; that he loved <pb id="VAA3932-165" n="157"/> chiefly the
                                companionship of books, and of men who loved books. Mr. Howells, a
                                literary contemporary, declares, that of women generally Lowell had
                                an amusing diffidence: that he revered them and honored them, but he
                                would rather not have them about. Mr. Howells adds that "there was
                                never a more devoted husband, and he was content to let his devotion
                                to the sex end with that. He especially could not abide difference
                                of opinion in women; he valued their taste, their wit, their humor,
                                but he would have none of their reason. * * * Summer and winter he
                                sat there among his books, seldom stirring abroad by day except for
                                a walk, and by night yet more rarely."</p>
                            <p>The isolation of Hawthorne was almost conventual. There were months
                                together when he scarcely held human intercourse outside of his own
                                family, seldom going out except at twilight, or to take the nearest
                                way to the most convenient solitude. He said that he doubted whether
                                so much as twenty people in the town were aware of his existence for
                                nine or ten years. He lived habitually within himself, and seemed,
                                as his son Julian said, to find no better society. It was said that
                                he roamed the woods by day, and, in the moonlight nights of winter
                                skated upon the lake alone until midnight. It has been affirmed of
                                him that he withdrew himself from the face of man and meditated for
                                twelve lonely years on humanity.</p>
                            <p>It was said that Voltaire had talents well adapted for society; but
                                at one period of his life he passed five years in the most secret
                                seclusion, and indeed usually lived in retirement.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-166" n="158"/>
                            <p>De Tocqueville had a strong aversion to general society. His manner
                                was quiet and dignified but somewhat cold. A gentleman who for a
                                time acted as his secretary declared that De Tocqueville was the
                                most reticent man he ever met.</p>
                            <p>There are many persons who are instinctively averse to formality and
                                conventionalism. In our own community it devolved upon Mr. A. to
                                introduce Mr. B. to Captain C. A. addressing B., said: "My friend
                                here was a captain during the entire period of the war between the
                                states, and exhibited his prowess on many battlefields. He has since
                                resided amongst us and is universally beloved by the people of this
                                section; indeed, we cannot do him too much honor." A. then
                                addressing Captain C., said: "My friend here has recently graduated
                                with high honors at &#151; university. He is the prince of
                                athletes, as you may readily observe. It is his purpose to become a
                                lawyer and his many friends confidently expect that he will attain
                                high rank in his chosen profession. Mr. B., allow me to introduce
                                you to Captain C. Shake hands with each other, gentlemen." The
                                captain retreating one step, and bowing, replied: "Pardon me; I am
                                not making any new acquaintances now. I already know more people
                                than I can treat well."</p>
                            <p>Among the striking characteristics of Bismarck was his evident

                            <p>An Englishman when presented to the Duke of Wellington, remarked to
                                the duke that he would always regard it as the greatest honor of his
                                life&#151;the privilege of shaking hands with the great hero of
                                Waterloo. The duke replied: "Oh! don't act the d&#151;fool."</p>

                            <p>Rude, the celebrated sculptor, declared: "I do my very best, and
                                praises could neither make me do more nor better, whereas censure
                                would trouble me. If my works are good they will endure; if not, all
                                the laudation in the world would not save them from oblivion." His
                                biographer at the end of a fascinating delineation of the character
                                and philosophy of this extraordinary man, observes, that the reader
                                may imagine how difficult it was to persuade a man of this kind to
                                pay visits of ceremony, in correct costume, with gloves and a neatly
                                brushed hat.</p>
                            <p>Another of the world's celebrities asks the question, "What place
                                indeed is there in the shallow frivolous thing called society for
                                noble thoughts and feelings?"</p>
                            <p>It was said in commendation of Sydney Smith that he had the courage
                                in a luxurious, artificial society, where weak men are crushed by
                                conventionalism, of appearing what he was and spending no more than
                                he could afford.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bigelow, American ambassador to France, during the period of our
                                civil war, relates that he was called upon one morning by Governor
                                Morton, of Indiana, who was fond of being spoken of by the press as
                                the war governor. Morton presented a letter from Mr. Seward then
                                secretary of state, commending him to the usual courtesies due from
                                the embassy. He wished Mr. Bigelow to present him to the emperor,
                                that he might have an opportunity to talk with him in private about
                                our relations with France and Mexico, and to say to him some things
                                which it might not be suitable for the official representative of
                                the government in Paris to say. That <pb id="VAA3932-168" n="160"/>
                                coming from him, what he said to the emperor might have its weight
                                without in any way officially compromising the government or Mr.
                                Bigelow. The latter replied that he did not well see how he could
                                comply with the governor's wishes without special instructions: that
                                if he presented him officially to the emperor, the ambassador, by so
                                doing, made his government just as much responsible for what Morton
                                might say as if he had said it himself, and that he was not
                                warranted in authorizing any person to say to the emperor anything
                                which would not be suitable for the ambassador of the United States
                                to say to him. Morton could not disguise his great disappointment.
                                In order to comfort him, Mr. Bigelow said to him that there would be
                                a grand ball at the palace the following week and that he would
                                procure invitations for himself and Mrs. Morton, which he did. Mr.
                                Bigelow adds: "In a few days Morton came in and said he had been
                                informed that a uniform of some kind would be necessary for the
                                occasion&#151;and then asked me what they would say at home if
                                he were reported to have been at a ball in Paris wearing a sword and
                                a cocked hat&#151;in a tone as if what they would say 'lambs
                                would not forgive nor worms forget.' His question was one that I did
                                not feel competent to answer. I gave him the address of a tailor who
                                could fit him for the occasion at an expenditure of from 50 to 75
                                francs. He went off not cheerfully, but apparently satisfied. In a
                                day or two he sent me a note declining the honor of being presented
                                at court." Mr. Bigelow, with delicate irony, concludes his account
                                of the incident as follows: "Afterward Morton introduced in the
                                senate a bill for <pb id="VAA3932-169" n="161"/> regulating the
                                tailoring of the diplomatic corps to suit the standards of his
                                senatorial constituency. This was the only official result of the
                                governor's first and only visit to the old world."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, whose "From a College Window" and
                                "Upton Letters" have delighted so many readers, declares that one of
                                the important privileges of advancing years is the decreasing
                                tyranny of convention. He says that with every year he gets more and
                                more impatient with conventionality. That when the ordinary usages
                                of life have been complied with, all sensible people ought to have a
                                line of their own about occupation, amusements, friends, and not to
                                run to and fro like sheep just where the social current sets. He
                                says that he has learned gradually that after a decent compliance
                                with superficial conventionalities, there are not only no penalties
                                attached to independence, but that there, and there alone, is
                                happiness to be found. This eminent writer evidently has the courage
                                of his conviction, because he does not hesitate to give a practical
                                application of his theories. He says: "Now, if I am asked to stay at
                                a tiresome house I refuse. I decline invitations to garden parties
                                and public dinners and dances, because I know that they will bore
                                me; and as to games, I never play them if I can help, because I find
                                they do not entertain me."</p>

                            <p>REVIEW OF "THE REMINISCENCES" OF GOLDWIN SMITH.</p>
                            <p>We have read with intense interest the "Reminiscences of Goldwin
                                Smith," recently published. It is a large <pb id="VAA3932-170"
                                    n="162"/> volume containing nearly five hundred pages. The
                                author was an English essayist and historical writer. He was born at
                                Reading in 1823 and died in Canada in 1910; was educated at Eton and
                                Oxford; took his degree of B. A. at Magdalen College, Oxford, in
                                1845; became fellow and tutor in the university, and was called to
                                the bar in 1850. He did not enter upon legal practice, but became a
                                member of several educational commissions. In 1856 he was made
                                regius professor of modern history at Oxford. In 1868 he came to the
                                United States, having been elected professor of constitutional
                                history in Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. This position he
                                resigned in 1871. He then removed to Canada, where he was appointed
                                a member of the senate of the University of Toronto. In addition to
                                his numerous historical writings, he was a frequent contributor to
                                periodical literature and delivered numerous lectures upon social
                                and political topics.</p>
                            <p>There are many reasons why the book is invaluable. Its author was a
                                man of the highest scholastic attainments and the broadest culture:
                                he had the deep sagacity that may be acquired by long habits of
                                thinking and study; he had a vast comprehension, a maturity of
                                judgment and was unsurpassed in critical acumen and profundity of
                                knowledge; he bore an unsullied character through the turbid waters
                                of political contention; his knowledge of human nature was
                                consummate, and, while his wisdom was that both of observation and
                                reading, one must be especially impressed by his depth of
                                observation. His keen analysis of character and conduct is
                                universally recognized.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-171" n="163"/>
                            <p>We have seen that he was called to the bar in 1850. His powers,
                                though admirably adapted for grasping the fundamental principles of
                                law, were probably not of a nature to render him successful in legal
                                practise&#151;and, besides, it certainly was not the design of
                                his existence that his talents should be wasted in the contention of
                                the courts.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith's pretensions to eminence did not rest upon his oratorical
                                powers; indeed, he frankly admits that he was not an orator. He
                                should have thanked his stars for this deficiency&#151;if the
                                term be understood in its accepted modern signification. We cannot
                                conceive of the author of "Reminiscences" acting in the role of the
                                modern orator. We know what extraordinary temporary effects have
                                been produced by the mere manner of an orator, without any uncommon
                                weight or worth of matter. He has been compared to a magnificent
                                meteor which shot majestically across the heavens, from pole to
                                pole, and straight expired in glorious blaze. Often-times he is a
                                mere rhetorician and his discourse consists more of pomp of words
                                than greatness of thought. The possession of this accomplishment has
                                been known to be conducive to inordinate presumption and vanity, as
                                exemplified by the rhetorician who went all the way to Carthage to
                                instruct Hannibal in the art of war.<ref id="ref_36" rend="super"

                                    <p>We have in mind a public man, now in middle life, who began
                                        his career with many "latent possibilities of greatness."
                                        Well endowed by nature, highly educated, not deficient in
                                        perseverance, with an insinuating address, and with many
                                        graces of person and manner, his friends were confident of a
                                        great future for him. Unfortunately, however, he conceived
                                        the idea that in order to attain greatness, he must become a
                                        voluble rhetorician, must harangue popular audiences with
                                        every species of rhodomontade, and, if possible, stir their
                                        passions to the inmost depths. He has sailed along upon the
                                        surface of the great ocean of learning, apparently oblivious
                                        of the riches to be found in the depths below. Even his most
                                        intimate friends, so far as we know, have never accused him
                                        of profundity, either in law, statecraft, or diplomacy. His
                                        merit is almost wholly rhetorical. He does not succeed well
                                        either in exposition or refutation. He has ignored the
                                        obvious fact "that the vigorous and audacious bursts which
                                        overwhelm an audience at the moment, and are the birth of
                                        the moment, die almost as soon as born." The most that can
                                        justly be said of him, even by his most ardent admirers, is
                                        that "he is like an exquisite side dish not sufficiently
                                        substantial for a full meal." He has been relegated to
                                        private life.</p>

                            <p>The "Reminiscences" is not only an invaluable repertory of facts; it
                                also gives expression to the profound and comprehensive views of the
                                author upon questions of national and international importance, that
                                arose on both sides of the Atlantic during his long and chequered
                                career. He knew the prominent public men both of England and
                                America, with many of whom he was on terms of personal intimacy. His
                                singular propensity to observe and comment upon the human character
                                is everywhere apparent.</p>
                            <p>His recollections of contemporary English statesmen are of intense
                                interest; included in the number are Bright, Cobden, Brougham, Peel,
                                Disraeli, Salisbury and Gladstone. He knew the great scientists
                                Huxley, Tyndall, Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mill and Agassiz. In
                                the domain of literature, he was acquainted with Dickens, Bulwer,
                                Hallam, Carlyle, Guizot, Macaulay, Louis Blanc, Froud and Tennyson.
                                He also describes the personalities of Queen Victoria, Edward VII
                                and Louis Napoleon, and gives his estimates of their characters <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-173" n="165"/> and abilities. His reminiscences of
                                the great soldiers Wellington, Lee, Grant, Sherman and Mead will be
                                read with especial interest. He knew Lincoln, Seward, Emerson,
                                Longfellow, Bryant, Lowell and Bancroft, and writes entertainingly
                                of them all. In this connection he discusses the war between the
                                states, having sojourned in America while the great conflict was
                                going on. All his sympathies and predilections were with the North,
                                but he had not been influenced in his opinions by fifty years of
                                agitation, crimination and recrimination, so that his views on this
                                subject are presumably impartial.</p>
                            <p>In 1848 his father, who was a physician, having independent means,
                                gave up his profession, in which he had been very successful, and
                                retired to a country house at Mortimer, eight miles from Reading.
                                They had many visitors at Mortimer&#151;men eminent in
                                literature, state-craft, diplomacy and war. He says that the country
                                houses in that part of rural England were beautiful, but complains
                                that in the country society there was no enchantment; and he does
                                not omit to relate the important fact that there was a parson in his
                                parish who only put on a white tie when he was going to deal for a
                                horse.</p>
                            <p>The country-seat of the Duke of Wellington was in an adjoining
                                parish. Mr. Smith relates that there was a farm which ran into the
                                duke's estate and which he wished to buy; but it was held at too
                                high a price. One day he was greeted by his bailiff with the glad
                                tidings that the owner of the farm was in difficulties and was
                                forced to sell at a low price. "I don't want to take advantage <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-174" n="166"/> of any man's difficulties," the duke
                                replied; "go and give him the fair price for his land."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith declares that the names and faces of his schoolmates are as
                                fresh in his memory as if he had just left the school; while he
                                forgets the names and faces of people to whom he was introduced
                                yesterday.</p>
                            <p>This fact will be confirmed by the experience of almost every man of
                                advanced years. Smith inquires what is memory? "What is it that
                                stores up these myriads of impressions and retains them for seventy
                                years? It is, of course, something physical, since the receptive or
                                retentive power of the retina is diminished, as I know too well, by
                                old age."</p>
                            <p>Foreigners of distinction often visited Eton. "I saw in the
                                schoolyard," says Smith, "Daniel Webster, with his brow and port of
                                Jove." This visit of Webster to Eton was when he was negotiating the
                                Ashburton treaty between Great Britain and the United States.</p>
                            <p>On one occasion at the end of the summer term at Eton, Queen Victoria
                                was present. At her side stood the Prince Consort, "with features
                                regular and handsome, but wanting in expression." Smith observes
                                that while it is true that the prince was canonized for his virtues
                                when he died, that while he lived he was unpopular on account of his
                                manner, especially with women, and adds: "Englishmen will bear a
                                high manner in high people, though a frank manner pleases them more;
                                but Prince Albert had in fatal perfection the condescending manner
                                of German royalty. Happily he did not transmit it to his son."<ref

                            <p>Mr. Smith describes Queen Victoria as being dumpy but comely, with a
                                fresh complexion, low forehead, receding chin and prominent eyes.
                                That she had in short the features of the family&#151;that
                                notwithstanding her dumpiness, she acquired a queenly bearing. "She
                                was a good and domestically exemplary, but in no way extraordinary
                                woman."</p>
                            <p>Our author avers that he was unambitious&#151;and that the
                                university honors thrust upon him at the outset as a sort of
                                distinction had been the source of more pain than pleasure. That his
                                great pleasures have always been domestic, and that he should have
                                been happier in a perfectly private and tranquil walk of life.</p>
                            <p>He has something to say of football. He asserts that in his time the
                                game was never played by any adults but the roughs of the North, and
                                when they played it at Eton only the ball was kicked, whereas
                                everything now is kicked but the ball. He declares that the
                                statement now made that character is less masculine than it was is
                                not a paradox, athletic force being mascular, not moral.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith became regius professor of modern history at Oxford and was
                                a member of the National Education Commission.</p>
                            <p>He declares that at Oxford they were almost entirely free from the
                                hazing, which he characterizes as the "strange opprobrium of
                                American colleges."</p>
                            <p>Cobden said to Mr. Smith when he was going to America, "There are two
                                sublimities in nature, the sublimity of rest and the sublimity of
                                motion. The sunset Alps are the sublimity of rest, the sublimity of
                                motion <pb id="VAA3932-176" n="168"/> is Niagara." He observes that
                                Cobden would now find Niagara turned into a power and railroads
                                running up the sunset Alps.</p>
                            <p>He writes of his travels and he says that at Dresden he often stood
                                before the Sistine Madonna. He expresses the opinion that this is
                                the only infant Jesus with a supernatural look; and it occurred to
                                him that the effect might have been produced by putting the eyes of
                                a man into a child's face. As to the pictures of the virgin and
                                child in general, he expresses the opinion, in which we must all
                                concur, that art toils in vain to depict deity as a child in a
                                mother's arms.</p>
                            <p>He much prefers the former manner of spending one's vacation. Then a
                                man who had a holiday reposed. He asserts that the present age is so
                                restless that it can find repose only in action. "If a man has a
                                holiday, he sets out to travel as far as he can by rail,
                                encountering almost as many cares in catching trains, looking after
                                baggage and getting rooms at hotels as there are in the business for
                                relief from which he flies."</p>
                            <p>He knew Guizot, the celebrated French statesman and historian, having
                                made his acquaintance when the latter was an exile in London. He
                                received a kind invitation to visit the home of the eminent
                                Frenchman. Their talk, as they paced the garden after breakfast, was
                                mainly about the religious state of Europe. Guizot seemed to look
                                with complacency on the Papacy as a conservative power. Coming to
                                the subject of Ireland, he stopped in his walk, and with an emphatic
                                wave of his hand, said "The conduct of England to Ireland for the
                                last thirty years has been admirable." Smith replied <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-177" n="169"/> that in intention it had; but that
                                they had still to do away with the Irish church establishment. To
                                this Guizot assented, and then repeated what he said before.</p>
                            <p>He was well acquainted with Louis Blanc, the French politician,
                                historian, political writer and socialist. Mr. Smith relates that
                                they sat on Richmond Hill through a long summer afternoon talking of
                                his doings and those of his party in France. He found that in exile
                                he was moderate as well as very lovely and attractive, but that he
                                seemed to have no definite policy, though he had strong feelings,
                                and it was the belief of Mr. Smith that if the guillotine had been
                                put into his hands he would have used it.</p>
                            <p>He relates interesting stories of Lord Wastbury. Meeting him one
                                morning in consultation about an important bill, seeing him very
                                lively, and knowing how great his burden of work was, Mr. Smith
                                complimented him on the ease with which he bore it. "Yes," he
                                replied, "I thank God it is so, and I owe it under Providence to my
                                habit of always working early in the morning, not late at night. "I
                                set out in life," he added in a pensive tone, "with many dear
                                friends who worked late at night. I have buried them all."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith was offered a permanent place in the public service, which
                                he declined, he said, because it was not his line. He declared that
                                when he got the professorship of history at Oxford, which came to
                                him unasked, he had all that he desired in life.</p>
                            <p>It was the opinion of our author that the public school cannot do
                                much to mould character or manner. He <pb id="VAA3932-178" n="170"/>
                                says: "The influence of the teacher as a rule seems not to be great.
                                It is apt to have against it the fond parent, who, the teacher not
                                having been chosen by him, is apt to side with the refractory child.
                                The private school seems to be generally preferred to the public
                                school by those who can afford it, though they have as taxpayers to
                                pay for both."</p>
                            <p>He relates an anecdote illustrative of the perfection of jury trial.
                                His instructor in pleading told him that a country gentleman popular
                                in the neighborhood had a trial coming on at court. The day before
                                the trial a farmer called on him and said, "Mr. Temple, sir, you've
                                a cause coming on to-morrow. Don't you be afeared, sir; I am on the
                                jury. I have just bought a new pair of leather breeches, and I'll
                                sit a hole in 'em afore I find agin yer."</p>
                            <p>What he says in respect to the trial of a cause in an English court
                                is interesting, especially to members of the American bar. Two
                                things impressed him. One was the superior effect of a quiet and
                                seemingly fair manner on a jury.</p>
                            <p>He says that "bullying witnesses is certainly a mistake as well as an
                                offense. The natural sympathy of a juryman when a witness is being
                                bullied by counsel is with the witness. The juryman may some day be
                                a witness himself." The other thing was the command which an English
                                judge has of his court, which, in saving of time as well as in
                                security for justice, amply repays to the country the large salaries
                                required to tempt the leaders from the bar. He says, "I have since
                                seen something of American courts of justice and have been <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-179" n="171"/> struck with the contrast. A judge of
                                the American supreme court told me that in attending an English
                                court he had been surprised at the expedition with which cases were
                                settled, while, so far as he could see, justice was done. The
                                explanation is the command which the English judge has over his
                                court; and, it must be added, the freedom with which he is allowed
                                to charge the rural jury, whose power of reviewing and balancing the
                                evidence would often, in a case at all complicated, totally
                                fail."</p>
                            <p>Our author first met Macaulay at the dinner table of Sir R. H.
                                Inglis, a member for the University of Oxford. He says that Macaulay
                                did talk essays and engross the talking&#151;conversation it
                                could not be called. He would seize upon a theme and dilate, with
                                copious illustrations, from a marvellous memory. He declares that he
                                has seen a whole evening party kept listening in a ring to an essay
                                on final causes and the limits of their recognition, with numerous
                                illustrations. Mr. Smith regarded it as an exuberance rather than
                                assumption or ostentation. On one occasion, however, he thought
                                Macaulay a bore. "It was at a breakfast at Lord Stanhope's. Lord
                                Russell was beginning to give us an account of the trial of Queen
                                Caroline, which he had witnessed. Macaulay broke in with an essay
                                and Lord Russell was swept away by its tide. Of all English talkers
                                that I ever heard, Macaulay seemed to me the first in brilliancy. He
                                is the first in brilliancy of English writers, though not always the
                                most sober or just. Of all his writings the least just, while it is
                                perhaps the most brilliant, is the essay on Warren Hastings."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-180" n="172"/>
                            <p>Lord Houghton, from his good natured simplicity of speech, had earned
                                him the nickname of the "cool of the evening." He was a great and a
                                most successful collector of autographs. He showed Mr. Smith on the
                                same page some love-verses written by Robespierre when a youth, and
                                a death-warrant signed by him under the reign of terror. "General
                                Grant, when he went to breakfast with the lord, was presented with a
                                round robin which he had signed as a cadet at West Point. Houghton
                                could not tell how he obtained it."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith's friendship with Hallam's son Henry opened to him the
                                house of his illustrious father, the author of the "Constitutional
                                History of England" and the "State of Europe During the Middle
                                Ages". "The historian was then old and bowed down by the loss of the
                                son, whose epitaph is "In Memoriam," as well as by that of his wife
                                and his favorite daughter. In earlier days he had been rather a
                                social terror. People in his presence had spoken in fear of
                                contradiction. It was said that he got out of bed in the night to
                                contradict the watchman about the hour and the weather. Sydney Smith
                                said that the chief use of the electric telegraph would be to enable
                                Hallam to contradict a man at Birmingham. But in his old age and to
                                a boy like me Hallam was all mildness and kindness. I see the old
                                man now, sitting in his library with gout in his hands, in mournful
                                dignity waiting for the end. But he would know that his work was
                                done."</p>
                            <p>Our author was intimate with Huxley, the great comparative anatomist
                                and supporter of the Darwinian hypothesis, and also with Tyndall,
                                the natural philosopher; <pb id="VAA3932-181" n="173"/> with Tyndall
                                he became very intimate, and greatly loved him, though on some
                                points they widely differed. "He called himself a materialist, and
                                never allowed you to call him anything else, ever faithful to his
                                formula that matter contained the potentiality of all life. But
                                never was a man less materialist in the gross sense of the term.</p>
                            <p>In 1876 he became well acquainted with Herbert Spencer, author of the
                                Synthetic Philosophy. They were staying at Buxton together. Mr.
                                Smith is positive in the assertion that if a new moral world is
                                built upon materialism, Herbert Spencer will have been one of the
                                chief builders. "In any case," says Mr. Smith, "he was a shining
                                light and power: Of his personal eccentricities plenty of stories
                                have been told. His nervous sensibility was extreme. A game of
                                billiards was enough to deprive him of his night's rest. A literary
                                flippancy of mine once caused an estrangement between us, but I am
                                happy to say we became the best of friends again."</p>
                            <p>Some of Mr. Smith's most interesting social experiences were his
                                visits to The Grange. He met there Lord Ashburton, whom he describes
                                as a man of intellect and culture, and by no means a social cipher,
                                though a less important figure than his wife. He refers to Lady
                                Ashburton as a great lady, perhaps the nearest counterpart that
                                England could produce to the queen of a French salon before the
                                revolution. "In person, though not beautiful, she was majestic. Her
                                wit was of the very brightest, and dearly she loved to give it play.
                                She had at the same time depth of character and tenderness of
                                feeling." It was here that our author met Mrs. Bigelow <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-182" n="174"/> Lawrence, so renowned for her
                                marvellous beauty. Mrs. Lawrence was Sally Ward, the daughter of
                                Robert J. Ward, of Kentucky. She has been described as "a radiant
                                woman, instinct with sparkling life from the crown of her beautiful
                                head to the tips of her slender feet, spoiled, wilful, lovely and

                            <p>Carlyle was always at the Grange. He was a great favorite with Lady
                                Ashburton. Mr. Smith says his talk was like his books, but
                                wilder&#151;that his pessimism was monotonous and sometimes
                                wearisome, though he could not fail to say striking things, still
                                less to use striking words. Tennyson was also there. Mr. Smith is
                                not alone in his adoration of the poet, but confessed his inability
                                to worship the man. He declares that Tennyson's self-consciousness
                                and sensitiveness to criticism were extreme. He was fond of reading
                                his own poetry aloud, but on one occasion he caused general
                                disappointment by his refusal to do so.</p>
                            <p>"At his side," says our author, "was sitting Carlyle, who had been
                                publishing his contempt of poetry. Immolating myself to the public
                                cause, I went over to Carlyle and asked him to come for a walk in
                                the grounds. While we were gone the reading came off. I was reminded
                                of this incident, which I had long forgotten, by a reference to it
                                the other day in the Illustrated London News." Mrs. Carlyle was also
                                at the Grange. She was a modest personage, rather in the background.
                                Mr. Smith expresses great respect for her character as well as
                                admiration for her wit and declares that he had always cherished the
                                memory of the message which she sent him from her death-bed. Bishop
                                Wilberforce was <pb id="VAA3932-183" n="175"/> also in the circle of
                                the Grange. Our author says he had a good right to be there, for he
                                was a very brilliant talker, especially happy in repartee, and of
                                his eminent ability there could be no doubt, and his meritorious
                                activity in his diocese was unquestioned. He observes, however, that
                                the bishop "was at first a fine preacher, but at last his incessant
                                activity, leaving no time for reading or thought, impaired the
                                matter of his sermons and compelled him to make up for lack of
                                substance by delivery, of which, having an admirable voice and
                                manner, he remained a perfect master."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith only once saw Dickens, but he had a friend who was very
                                intimate with him. This friend told him much of the unhappy
                                relations of Dickens and his wife. "It was a common case; Dickens
                                had married at a low level, and his wife had not risen with him;
                                otherwise there was no fault on her side." Our author here observes
                                that the matrimonial history of writers of works of imagination has
                                often been unhappy: their imagination turns a woman into an angel,
                                and then they find that she is a woman." It seems that about this
                                time the scandalous world was being regaled with the war between
                                Bulwer and his wife. "When Bulwer was being elected at Hertford,"
                                says Mr. Smith, "his consort drove up in a post-chaise, mounted the
                                hustings and delivered a philippic against him. Their son was
                                credited with some lines on the occasion:</p>

                            <p>Our author very truly observes that if Dickens' own home was not
                                happy, few writers have done more to make other homes happy and
                                diffuse kindly feelings. His "Christmas Carol" is an evangel.</p>
                            <p>We knew something of Brougham before reading the fascinating
                                "Reminiscences" of Goldwin Smith. We have read of his marvelous
                                versatility&#151;that to portray him one must not only portray a
                                lawyer, but an author, a philosopher, a scientist, a statesman, a
                                humanitarian and a reformer. That he was as great in peace as
                                Napoleon in war. That to him repose was an impossibility. We have
                                read Wordsworth's definition of Brougham's most salient
                                characteristic thus: "Independence is the explosive energy of
                                conceit making blind havoc with expediency." We have seen his own
                                epitaph which, it has been truly said, not only recognizes his
                                volubility, but illustrates his wit:</p>
                            <lg>
                                <l n="1">"Here reader, turn your weeping eyes,</l>

                                <l n="3">The hole in which my body lies</l>
                                <l n="4">Would not contain one-half my speeches."</l>
                            </lg>
                            <p>Sumner writes of his visit to Brougham: "My wonder at him rises anew.
                                To-night he has displayed the knowledge of the artist and the
                                gastronomer. * * * He was horribly profane. When I took leave of
                                him, he exclaimed, "Oh, God! must you go?'"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, in his observations in respect to his eminent
                                contemporaries, does not omit this extraordinary man. He says that
                                Brougham aspired to leadership not only in law, politics and
                                literature, but in science. His <pb id="VAA3932-185" n="177"/>
                                private secretary is the authority for the statement that when he
                                was leading at once in the bar and in Parliament, making one speech
                                several hours long, he could do with two hours' sleep each night. On
                                Saturday afternoon he would turn in till Monday morning. His
                                marvellous endurance is attested by the fact that "when he was in
                                full practise on the northern circuit and at the same time candidate
                                for the representation of Yorkshire in Parliament, he would, after a
                                long day in court, get into a post-chaise and go very long distances
                                to election meetings." He was ardently devoted to his friends,
                                weeping bitterly when he heard of the death of an old political
                                associate. Our author declares that "nothing can adequately paint
                                the galvanic motions of Brougham's face and figure, and that his
                                activity and productiveness were miraculous."</p>
                            <p>Smith had the greatest respect for Peel, but loathed Disraeli and
                                what he was pleased to call the "blackguard combination," by which
                                the Peel government was overthrown.</p>
                            <p>He was thrown much into Lord Salisbury's company, but declares that
                                he always felt and expressed more confidence in his judgment and
                                rectitude than in his strength, and refers to the observation of
                                Bismarck that Salisbury was a reed painted to look like iron as an
                                exaggeration.</p>
                            <p>He considered Froude, the historian, a man of genius and a most
                                brilliant and fascinating writer, but asserts that neither accuracy
                                nor justice ever was his strong point.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith was offered the nomination for Chelsea <pb id="VAA3932-186"
                                    n="178"/> and Kensington, a constituency in which the Liberals
                                had a safe majority, but he declined. He says: "I knew the
                                difference between the pen and the tongue. I never was a speaker,
                                nor had I strength for parliamentary life." He probably means that
                                he made no pretensions to oratory.</p>
                            <p>Our author was on terms of intimacy with many of the public men of
                                England&#151;with the Peelite circle at first, and afterward
                                with Bright and Cobden, who are so well known and so highly
                                appreciated in this country. Sir Robert Peel was always the object
                                of his political allegiance. He says: "I saw in him a statesman
                                above party who sought and studied with singleness of heart the good
                                of the whole nation, and though I had less respect for some
                                venerable institutions than he had, I recognized his wisdom in
                                preferring administrative reform, which he steadfastly pursued, to
                                organic change. Beyond doubt he had the confidence not only of the
                                majority, but of the most intelligent and respectable part of the
                                nation."</p>
                            <p>We are told by Mr. Smith that one part of the parliamentary strategy
                                of Disraeli was the concoction of little pointed sayings about the
                                personal peculiarities of his opponents. He said of Horsman, a Whig
                                politician, that he was a "superior person," and alluded to Hope's
                                "Batavian Grace." Lord Salisbury was "a master of gibes, flouts and
                                jeers." He tried to kill Gladstone by saying that he was a
                                "sophistical rhetorician intoxicated with the exuberance of his own
                                verbosity." "Disraeli was a Jew by descent, but a baptized
                                Christian. He <pb id="VAA3932-187" n="179"/> was married to a rich
                                wife. He started in public life as an adventurer, angling for a seat
                                in Parliament by baits thrown out to both parties, and going through
                                a series of transformations in the course of which he had a slanging
                                match with O'Connell, who called him the "lineal representative of
                                the impenitent thief."</p>
                            <p>Our author says of Gladstone that his sympathy was with everybody who
                                was struggling to be free, and this it was mainly which led him in
                                the American war of secession to lean to the side of the South, and
                                to proclaim that Jefferson Davis had made the South a nation.
                                Gladstone's private character was admirable in every way and Mr.
                                Smith's delineation of his public character is both interesting and
                                instructive. He says: "That Gladstone was a statesman of the very
                                highest class I should find it difficult to believe. His moves
                                always seemed to be impulses rather than parts of a settled plan. *
                                * * When his love of power and his pugnacity were excited, it is
                                questionable whether he thought much of anything but victory. * * *
                                There was nothing fine or indicative of high intellect in the face
                                except the fire of the eye. The whole frame bespoke nervous energy.
                                * * * As a speaker he was in the highest degree effective, but the
                                effect was produced by his command of the subject, by the ascendency
                                of his character, by the impressiveness of his manner and an
                                admirable voice rather than by any grace or force of language. He
                                was at his best, I think, in expounding a great measure and steering
                                it through the House. He had, as was said before, marred the
                                freshness of his style <pb id="VAA3932-188" n="180"/> by overmuch
                                speaking in debating clubs early in life. His prolixity, which
                                Disraeli called his verbosity, was not felt by the hearers of his
                                speeches, who were rather struck by his command of perfectly correct
                                language, but it is greatly felt by his readers. * * * If Gladstone
                                had not, like Brougham, the vanity of versatility, he had the
                                propensity in large measure. It is true that his amazing powers of
                                acquisition enabled him in a way to deal with many subjects. But his
                                writings, enormously voluminous and various, are of little
                                value."</p>
                            <p>Smith was an ardent Free Trader. He observes that the Protectionist
                                tariff of the United States itself was a war tariff; that while
                                protectionism reigned in American legislation, almost all the
                                professors of political economy in the American universities and the
                                writers on economy generally were on the side of free trade.</p>
                            <p>Our author was on terms of personal intimacy with both Bright and
                                Cobden and the three were in accord on the great paramount questions
                                before the country. He says that Bright was not devoid of sentiment;
                                that he adored Milton, and read poetry, as well as the Bible, better
                                than any other man he ever heard. Cobden was a reader of Burke,
                                Spenser and Cervantes, as his speeches and pamphlets show. He
                                asserts that Bright's speeches are classic, and Cobden was a
                                first-rate writer in a plain style; "that his heart was thoroughly
                                open to beauty and to poetical impressions of every kind." We can
                                readily concur in the belief of Cobden, Bright and Smith that if the
                                people were prosperous they would be happy, and that if they were
                                happy they would as a rule be good.</p>

                                protecting, not regulating, the conduct of life. They (says Mr.
                                Smith) would have gone heartily with anyone who sought to regulate
                                taxation so that as little of the burden as possible should fall
                                upon the poor; though they would not have gone with any one who
                                wished to use the taxing power for the purpose of demagogic
                                confiscation.</p>
                            <p>Our author writes that "Liberalism&#151;colonial, economical and
                                general&#151;had early connected me with Bright and Cobden; but
                                the tie was rendered much closer by sympathy and joint action at the
                                time of the war in America between North and South."</p>
                            <p>He does not hesitate to give John Bright the foremost place among the
                                British orators of his day.</p>
                            <p>He says that Bright had no doubt formed his style on the Bible, which
                                he had never heard read so well as when he heard him read it to his
                                household. He describes Bright's delivery as calm and impressive,
                                without gesticulation or appearance of oratorical passion; his
                                enunciation was perfectly distinct, and he thus without straining
                                his voice made himself heard in the largest hall. His weight and
                                dignity of character added much to the impressiveness of his
                                oratory. Our author asserts that Bright probably did not read much
                                beyond the materials of his speeches. "He was, however, fond of
                                sonorous poetry, and once read aloud to me with great <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-190" n="182"/> gusto a sonorous passage from the
                                'Epic of Hades,' by Lewis Morris. Of Milton he was very fond, both
                                on poetical and political grounds. He asked me whom I thought the
                                greatest of Englishmen and answered his own question by naming
                                Milton, because Milton was so great at once as a man of letters and
                                as a citizen. * * * As he sat on my lawn at Oxford one summer
                                afternoon when the music of the bells was floating from the ancient
                                city, I overheard him say, "It would be very pleasant to be eighteen
                                and to be coming here."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith knew Cobden well. He declares that a man more transparently
                                honest, more single-minded, more truthful, more entirely devoid of
                                selfish ambition and of selfishness of every kind, more absolutely
                                devoted to the service of his country and humanity, never appeared
                                in public life. He says that Cobden looked forward, with much
                                satisfaction, to the ultimate junction of Canada with the United
                                States, and the union of the whole English-speaking race on the
                                American continent; but he expected this to take place with the
                                consent of the mother-country, and believed that it would be greatly
                                to her advantage.</p>
                            <p>Cobden was an absolute free trader; and differed essentially from
                                those who, calling themselves free traders, are in fact nothing of
                                the kind, but merely advocates of a particular tariff, framed with
                                reference to British industries and interests, but not necessarily
                                suited to those of all the countries in the world. "His heart was
                                with those who proposed absolutely to abolish all import duties, and
                                supply their place, so far as was necessary, by direct taxation. His
                                desire and hope were to make <pb id="VAA3932-191" n="183"/> one
                                commercial community of the whole human race."</p>
                            <p>Our author notes the fact that Peel and Cobden, after their long
                                strife and final reconcilement, were in a way united in their
                                burials. "Peel lies, not in Westminster Abbey, but in his home;
                                Cobden lies in a country church-yard. Peel, by his will, specially
                                forbade his son to accept a peerage on account of his father's
                                services. Cobden was essentially a republican."</p>
                            <p>Those ambitious gentlemen who, in our own country, are seduously
                                cultivating the art of public speaking, may profit by what Cobden
                                says of himself and of his own experience:</p>
                            <p>"You must not judge me by what I say at these tumultuous public
                                meetings. I constantly regret the necessity of violating good taste
                                and kind feeling in my public harangues. I say advisedly necessity,
                                for I defy anybody to keep the ear of the public for seven years
                                upon any one question without striving to amuse as well as instruct.
                                People do not attend public meetings to be taught, but to be
                                excited, flattered and pleased. If they are simply lectured, they
                                may sit out the lesson for once, but they will not come again; and
                                as I have required them again and again, I have been obliged to
                                amuse them, not by standing on my head or eating fire, but by
                                kindred feats of jugglery, such as appeals to their self-esteem,
                                their combativeness, or their humor. You know how easily in touching
                                their feelings one degenerates into flattery, vindictiveness or
                                grossness."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith again asserts that in spite of their conflicts, Peel and
                                Cobden were really united in their political lives, and it may be
                                said that in death they were not <pb id="VAA3932-192" n="184"/>
                                divided. Neither of them was buried in Westminster Abbey. "Peel lies
                                among his family and neighbors. Cobden lies in a country churchyard.
                                A man who had worked for fame will like to rest in a pantheon; a man
                                who has worked for duty and for the approbation of the power of duty
                                will perhaps prefer to rest by the side of honest labor, and among
                                those whom he has loved."</p>
                            <p>Cobden's intense belief in free trade was based upon the assumption
                                that the world was a single community; and our author suggests that
                                while Cobden could not bring the human race to that "far-off goal of
                                philanthropy," he did something to help it on its way.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith was appointed regius professor of modern history at Oxford
                                in 1858. He had previously been connected with the Saturday Review.
                                While the new position was wholly unsolicited, he declares that it
                                was the height of his desire and he thought with pleasure that he
                                was settled in it for life. "On the north of the Parks," says he, "I
                                built me a little house which I called Park's End, and which
                                afterward had the honor of being occupied by Max Müller and after
                                him by Professor Osler. I planted my little garden. I laid out my
                                little croquet ground, which in summer evenings was the scene of
                                pleasant little croquet parties followed by pleasant little
                                suppers."</p>
                            <p>He says that for one of his class and pursuits society could not be
                                more delightful than it was at Oxford in those days. The professors,
                                with the resident tutors and fellows of colleges, formed a circle
                                with various lines and interests, moderate incomes, socially and
                                hospitably disposed. "Hospitality, easy and frugal, college <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-193" n="185"/> kitchens and common rooms supplied.
                                At the little dinner parties talk was rational, yet bright and
                                merry."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, as professor of history at Oxford, had for a pupil the
                                then Prince of Wales, afterward King Edward VII. He says that the
                                prince was a comely youth, like his mother in face, and with a
                                slight German accent, showing, as he had not been in Germany, that
                                German was spoken in his domestic circle; and that his manner was
                                very engaging and he was thoroughly good-natured. Mr. Smith was
                                invited to go with the prince's party to Canada, but could not leave
                                his chair. He says "The king has always shown a kindly remembrance
                                of his old preceptor."</p>
                            <p>Our author says of Louis Napoleon that he, like his putative uncle,
                                "wanted the consecration of glory for his usurped throne, and a
                                recognized place for himself, an upstart of birth not unquestioned,
                                among the crowned heads of Europe, which he gained by being allowed
                                publicly to embrace the Queen of England. * * * He was a political
                                cracksman who, with his legs under your table, would be meditating a
                                raid upon your strong box. His friend and confederate, Palmerston,
                                at last awakened to his real character and bade the nation stand
                                upon its guard."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, in commenting upon bribery in English elections, declares
                                that "Demagogic bribery by the sacrifice of public interest corrupts
                                the community at large and costs the state a good deal. Witness the
                                American pension list." The veterans of our civil war will doubtless
                                look with much disfavor upon this last statement.</p>
                            <p>Our author discusses the American civil war. He <pb id="VAA3932-194"
                                    n="186"/> says that the aristocratic and wealthy classes in
                                England generally, exulting in the downfall of democracy, at once
                                embraced the side of the South. But he declares that slavery was
                                accursed: it was under the ban of humanity and that England had made
                                great efforts and sacrifices for its extinction. He notes the fact,
                                however, that in the United States, Congress, Lincoln and Seward had
                                disclaimed any intention of making war on slavery, and Congress had
                                offered to perpetuate its constitutional existence if the slave
                                states would return to the Union. He adds: "We who took the side of
                                the North had to contend that the formal was not the practical
                                issue, and to make the masses see this was not easy, especially when
                                the masses, by the cutting off of cotton, were being stinted of
                                their bread."</p>
                            <p>He declares that Lincoln, with all his wisdom and goodness of heart,
                                never took&#151;or at least never showed that he took&#151;a
                                right view of the case with which he had to deal; and that if he
                                had, perhaps there would have been no war. Our author says that
                                "Lincoln viewed and treated as a rebellion that which was in fact a
                                natural disruption, postponed for some time by uneasy shifts and
                                compromises, but inevitable in the end. This same error pervaded
                                reconstruction. It led to the fatal exclusion of the southern
                                leaders from the work of reconstruction, to carpet-bagging
                                government, to the Ku-Klux, and to the almost desperate situation
                                which has ensued. * * * By us in England Lincoln's character and
                                history were unknown, and his official utterances were naturally
                                taken as decisive."</p>
                            <p>Our author avers that at this critical period of our <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-195" n="187"/> civil war England was unfortunate in

                                bad as possible; it was haughty, unconciliatory and brusque. On the
                                other hand he declares that his country was fortunate in having as
                                the American ambassador Mr. Charles Francis Adams, "whose bearing
                                throughout was excellent, and who, to the pride of aristocracy,
                                could oppose the dignity of an illustrious line." Mr. Smith adds,
                                "that Mr. Adams certainly was not exposed during those years to the
                                social allurements, under the sweet but emasculating influence of
                                which American ambassadors to England are apt to fall."</p>
                            <p>In 1864, when the war was drawing to a close, Mr. Smith paid a visit
                                to the United States charged with the sympathy of Bright, Cobden and
                                other British friends of the North. He was desired at the same time
                                to report on the real state of affairs. He says: "The first thing
                                that struck me was that there was no civil war to be seen. The war
                                was between two nations, formed by an inevitable disruption, and in
                                the northern, which was the invading nation, though war was visibly
                                on foot, and all minds and papers were full of it, life was
                                undisturbed. In the border states alone, which were the borderland
                                between freedom and slavery, was there anything like civil war.
                                Social intercourse, therefore, went on pleasantly as usual, and my
                                enjoyment of it was complete.</p>
                            <p>During this visit to America our author met Emerson and heard him
                                lecture. What he has to say of Emerson and his writings is
                                interesting, though we may not concur in all that he says on the
                                subject. He writes: "I <pb id="VAA3932-196" n="188"/> of course
                                looked with interest on a man whose name and influence were so
                                great. Emerson's character was undoubtedly fine and his influence
                                was very good. But I can not honestly say that I ever got much from
                                his writings. I can find no system; I find only aphorisms; an
                                avalanche, as it were, of unconnected pebbles of thought, some of
                                them transparent, some translucent, some to me opaque. Carlyle
                                introduced Emerson to the British public as one who brought new fire
                                from the empyrean. But the two men in genius were leagues apart, and
                                Carlyle at last found the new fire a bore. George Venables, calling
                                one evening on Carlyle at Chelsea, found himself received with
                                extraordinary warmth, the reason of which Mrs. Carlyle explained by
                                exclaiming, "Oh, we were afraid it was Emerson." I heard Emerson
                                lecture. Now and then he shot a telling bolt. The rest of his
                                discourse to me was almost darkness. I heard him read his own poetry
                                aloud, but it remained as obscure to me as before. Certain, however,
                                it is that, by whatever means, he was an inspiring and elevating
                                influence in his day."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith also met Longfellow with interest, considered him most
                                attractive as a man, but could not give him credit for anything more
                                than sweetness as a poet. He says that Bryant lives by his
                                "Waterfowl" and almost by that alone. He concedes that Poe had
                                poetic genius if he had only taken more care of it and of himself
                                and asks if, excepting Poe, it can be said that America has produced
                                a poet. He adds however, "Perhaps America might ask whether at this
                                time there is such a thing as a true poet in the world."</p>

                            <p>Our author spent many days with Bancroft, the American historian,
                                statesman and diplomatist, in his Newport villa. He says those days
                                were most pleasant and instructive. When Bancroft told him that he
                                knew Andrew Jackson well and that Jackson was mild by nature and put
                                himself into a rage only when it would serve a purpose, Mr. Smith
                                was greatly surprised. He says in respect to Bancroft's "History of
                                the United States" that it is "in Fourth of July style, as was to be
                                expected in that day; but it is a considerable work; easy reading,
                                and not unfair or in bad taste for its time."</p>
                            <p>He here digresses for a moment to toss a bouquet to the Republican
                                party. He says: "The Republican party, as a body, remains the same,
                                with the name unchanged. But how changed is the spirit! How unlike
                                is this league of log-rolling monopolists to the patriot democracy
                                headed by Lincoln in the days of the war!"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith was impressed by the fact that it was for the Union rather
                                than against slavery that the North appeared to be fighting. He says
                                that when the people were asked the cause, the usual answer was "to
                                uphold the law." "That slavery was the object of hostility chiefly
                                because it was the cause of disruption. This was the case especially
                                with the officers of the army, among whom the feeling against
                                slavery was not strong. It was partly a sense of this, I believe,
                                which caused Lincoln to hesitate in proclaiming emancipation."</p>
                            <p>Our author observes that the humanities and chivalries of war were
                                well observed on both sides, except perhaps by the Southerners
                                toward negro soldiers. He says this <pb id="VAA3932-198" n="190"/>
                                proved to him that there was a sun behind the cloud, and that the
                                strife, bitter as it was at the time, would end in reconciliation.
                                It is very rarely, indeed, that Mr. Smith indulges in jocularity,
                                but in this connection he could not omit to relate that a "secesh"
                                lady at Baltimore had eloped with a Yankee trumpeter. In a more
                                serious vein, however, he gives an incident confirming his view that
                                the strife would end in reconciliation. He vouches for the truth of
                                the story, having been furnished with the names of persons, time and
                                place. "A Federal commander with the local forces found himself in a
                                very tight place. It was a question whether he should waste blood by
                                fighting or surrender. He surprised the Confederate by paying him a
                                visit under a flag of trace, and asking him for his candid opinion
                                upon the case, saying that he could make a good fight, but did not
                                wish to sacrifice the lives of his people in vain. The Confederate
                                showed him around the position and then gave him his candid opinion,
                                which was that if his command formed part of a general plan of
                                operations, he was bound to fight; otherwise he might with propriety
                                surrender."</p>
                            <p>He gives this story as illustrative of American character and of the
                                feelings of the military men on the two sides toward each other; and
                                he asserts what we all know to be true, that the manifestations of
                                intense bitterness were on the part of civilians.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith entertained views on the subject of reconstruction. He says
                                if the military leaders of the South, after their defeat, instead of
                                being treated as rebels could have been taken into counsel in the
                                work <pb id="VAA3932-199" n="191"/> of reconstruction, the result,
                                though it could hardly have solved the desperate negro problem,
                                might have been far better than it was. He adds: "Neither Lincoln
                                nor any one else seemed at that time to understand that this was not
                                a rebellion, but the inevitable parting of two groups of states,
                                radically antagonistic in their social and political structure,
                                which had been long held together in uneasy union by hollow
                                compromise, but had obeyed their natural impulses at last."</p>
                            <p>Our author's estimates of the great leaders, both civil and military,
                                in our civil war, are both instructive and interesting. Being a
                                foreigner, he is presumably impartial and uninfluenced by the
                                tempestuous passions engendered by the war, amongst the people of
                                the two sections of our own country. Speaking of Grant he says: "He
                                was a silent, somewhat saturnine man, very simple in his demeanor
                                and habits. His quarters were a common tent, in which was a chest
                                with his kit marked 'U. S. G., U. S. A.' He was said to dislike
                                military parade and even military music. He seems to have been less
                                of a strategist than of a sledge-hammer of war, pounding his enemy
                                by his blows, with little regard for the expenditure of life. He may
                                be almost said to have professed the strategy of attrition. Of this
                                the bloody battle of Cold Harbor, fought in a blind country, was a
                                signal instance. * * * But there can be no doubt as to the
                                inestimable service which Grant by his iron resolution and
                                inflexible tenacity did the cause. His great victory at Fort
                                Donelson was the first light of hope in a darkness which seemed
                                almost that of despair. He also rendered a great service by firmly
                                taking the whole war <pb id="VAA3932-200" n="192"/> into his own
                                hands and out of those of the politicians, whose meddling had done
                                much mischief. * * * His generosity Grant showed by handing back to
                                Sherman, when the attack on Vicksburg had succeeded, the protest
                                which at the council-of-war Sherman had put in against the attack.
                                His chivalry was shown by his demeanor to Lee after the surrender at
                                Appomattox, when he treated Lee at once as a friend and refused to
                                receive his sword. His good feeling and his good sense together he
                                showed by at once paroling the beaten army, providing for their
                                wants, and giving them back their horses 'for their fall plowing.' "
                                He nobly declined to enter Richmond as a conqueror.</p>
                            <p>Our author affirms that Grant being totally without political
                                experience was a failure in civil life, and that he was pitchforked
                                into the Presidency by the passion of the Americans for military
                                glory. He refers to Grant's hostility to Charles Sumner and says
                                that "Between this rough soldier and such a man as Sumner, with his
                                high-stepping culture and lofty self-esteem, antipathy was sure to
                                be strong. That some one, to please Grant, was decrying Sumner to
                                him, saying that Sumner was a freethinker and did not believe in the
                                Bible. 'Well,' said Grant, 'I suppose he didn't write it.'
                                Wellington, between whom and Grant there was some resemblance, also
                                once in his life said a good thing. When he appeared at the Court of
                                the Restoration the marshals of the empire turned their backs on
                                him. The king apologized to him for their rudeness. 'N'importe,
                                Sire. C'est leur habitude,' was Wellington's reply."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith met Grant and Mrs. Grant some <pb id="VAA3932-201" n="193"
                                /> years afterward at a garden party at Lambeth Palace, the
                                residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He says that they looked
                                a curiously rustic couple in that assemblage of fashion, and adds:
                                "Grant was then touring under the auspices of politicians who wanted
                                a third term for him and thought it might be secured by presenting
                                him to the world's homage. No showman could have had a worse lion.
                                Stanley, who showed Grant over Westminster Abbey, said that of all
                                men of rank whom he had met Grant 'was the most boorish'. Grant was
                                no doubt un-appreciative of antiquities, and Stanley had no
                                opportunity of diving into the character of the man."</p>
                            <p>Our author met Sherman at a dinner of the Chamber of Commerce at New
                                York. He says that Sherman was generally accounted the greatest
                                strategist on the side of the North, though some put Thomas first.
                                He observed that Sherman was then showing the effect of years.</p>
                            <p>Some years afterward at Philadelphia he made the acquaintance of
                                Meade, who appeared to him to be a high-minded soldier and a
                                thorough gentleman. He says that Meade had done good service in
                                restoring the tone of the Army of the Potomac when it had been run
                                down under Hooker. Meade in his conversation said not a word against
                                Grant but intimated that he did not admire the strategy of
                                attrition.</p>
                            <p>He says that Lee has been pronounced a great strategist by those
                                whose judgment cannot be disputed, though only by an American writer
                                has he been put above Marlborough. That Lee seems to have fought,
                                    <pb id="VAA3932-202" n="194"/> not against the Union nor for
                                slavery; but simply as a liegeman of his state; that his character
                                was fine, and that it would have been well both for South and North
                                if in reconstruction his voice could have been heard.</p>
                            <p>Our author declares that Benjamin Butler was a curious personage. He
                                says that Butler "was exceedingly ugly, and squinted horribly; but
                                his face and figure were an incarnation of rude force, and reminded
                                you of a steam ram. Unscrupulous he was in the highest degree. But I
                                believe his ruling passion was notoriety rather than gain. Those who
                                were put on his track at New Orleans found, as I was told at the
                                time, no trace of his stealing for himself, though he had winked at
                                the doings of subordinates. He was evidently a loving husband to his
                                admirable wife and a loving father to his beautiful daughter. He was
                                evidently popular with his aides and his men. He wanted to be
                                President. This was his motive in his attack on Andrew Johnson and
                                in his advocacy of repudiation. In his advocacy of repudiation he
                                was misled, as the unscrupulous are apt to be, by underrating the
                                general honesty of the world."</p>
                            <p>Our author continues, "As a general, Ben was not a success. Grant
                                said that he was 'bottled up' in the bend of the James river where
                                he was carrying on some engineering operations suggested by his
                                restlessly inventive genius. He did me the honor to impart to me his
                                plan for blowing up Fort Fisher, which had obstinately resisted
                                federal attack, by running ashore under it a gunboat loaded with
                                powder. I could not help venturing to suggest to the general the
                                ineffectiveness of <pb id="VAA3932-203" n="195"/> powder fired in
                                the open air. But Butler thought he had scientific proof that the
                                displacement of air would be so great that Fort Fisher would cease
                                to exist. The experiment was afterward made, and the breaking of two
                                or three windows in the fort was the only result.</p>
                            <p>Our author says that he had the honor of being the guest of Mr.
                                Seward in Washington and saw the diplomatist unbend in his social
                                hour, and that there was no limit to the freedom of his talk. He
                                declares that Seward was the least cautious of diplomatists, and
                                sometimes startled the British ambassador, Lord Lyons, who was
                                accustomed to the reticence and impassiveness of diplomatists in the
                                old world.</p>
                            <p>"Crossing the mud-hole between Seward's house and an official
                                building," Mr. Smith presented his card and found himself in the
                                presence of Abraham Lincoln. He says: "The notion formed of Lincoln
                                in England had been that of a Yankee rail-splitter with an ungainly
                                and grotesque figure, displaying an unfeeling levity by the
                                utterance of rather coarse jokes, from which he did not abstain even
                                among the relics of the battle-field. Ungainly and grotesque the
                                figure, with its gaunt height its shock of unkempt hair, and its
                                large hands and feet, undeniably was; but on the face, instead of
                                levity, sat melancholy and care. * * * Lincoln since his death has
                                been deified. He has been styled the greatest statesman of the age.
                                The American mind is never sparing of superlatives in either
                                extreme. He had the wisdom which happily belongs to a perfectly
                                honest and simple character. He never was misled by cupidity,
                                vanity, or selfishness of any kind. He had also, as the result of
                                    <pb id="VAA3932-204" n="196"/> a naturally sympathetic nature,
                                improved by campaign practise, a remarkable power of reading public
                                sentiment and keeping himself in touch with what he called the plain
                                people. His addresses and state papers are admirable; the simplicity
                                and clearness of their style bespoke the integrity and sincerity of
                                their author." Mr. Smith here reiterates with emphasis what he has
                                said more than once before, that Lincoln if he saw, never showed
                                that he saw the fundamental character of the situation with which he
                                had to deal. That he always spoke and wrote as if he took secession
                                to be a rebellion, whereas it was a natural severance of the
                                slave-owning South from the free North, social structure having as
                                usual asserted its ascendancy over political organization.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith was on terms of intimacy with John Stuart Mill. They were
                                together on the Jamaica Committee. He regarded Mr. Mill as the most
                                strictly conscientious man that he ever knew. He says that in an
                                unhappy moment Mill allowed himself to be elected to the House of
                                Commons&#151;that he sat there night after night like an image
                                of patience, listening to debates on which the time of the great
                                philosopher and economist was miserably wasted. * * * Our author
                                adds: "I have always looked upon him as a notable instance of the
                                division which is taking place between the dogmas and the ethics of
                                Christianity; the dogmas remaining with the orthodox, the ethics
                                often going to the infidel. Upon the ethics it is to be hoped
                                Christendom will reunite."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-205" n="197"/>
                            <p>Mr. Smith returned to America in 1868 with the view of further
                                studying American history and institutions. He afterward became
                                Professor of Constitutional History in Cornell University, upon the
                                urgent solicitation of Andrew D. White and others. He pays a well
                                deserved tribute to Mr. White, referring to him as a "wealthy
                                citizen of Syracuse, a man of the highest attainments and culture,
                                who devoted to the foundation of the university not only much of his
                                wealth, but labor, which was of higher value and bestowed at a
                                greater sacrifice. * * * He has shone as a diplomatist at St.
                                Petersburg and Berlin. He has also shone as a writer."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith deplores the fact that what he terms the extravagant and
                                costly passion for athletics, which had its source in the
                                universities of the English gentry, has invaded in full force the
                                American universities, and Cornell among the number. He says:
                                "University authorities ought to have the courage and integrity to
                                control it. University education is already challenged by commercial
                                men as interfering with a youth's start in business life. To this
                                challenge, if the student is to spend his time and his father's
                                money in training his muscles, there will be no reply. After all, no
                                excellence that he can gain in that way will put him on a level with
                                many a negro porter. I have, in fact, seen a negro porter who was
                                physically a finer man than any college athlete. The model of
                                perfect human form in the London museum of the College of Surgeons
                                is or was a negro, who we may be sure was as nature had made him. A
                                lower level still is reached when the student becomes a professional
                                performer and gate-money is the object <pb id="VAA3932-206" n="198"
                                /> of the game. A university which permits this suffers absolute
                                degradation."</p>
                            <p>Before he became a professor at Cornell, Mr. Smith was one of a set
                                of non-resident lecturers which included Agassiz, Lowell, George
                                Curtis and Bayard Taylor. Agassiz was lecturing when he arrived;
                                they boarded together in the Clinton House for some weeks and our
                                author greatly enjoyed his society. He says of Agassiz: "Eminent as
                                a man of science, in character and habits he was simple as a child.
                                He never used a bank, but, as he told me, carried his money in his
                                pocket, and when it was spent went lecturing to get more."</p>
                            <p>Our author knew Lowell, who was one of the ten lecturers. He says
                                that Lowell's anti-British prejudice was at that time still rather
                                strong; he found him more sociable when he afterward met him as
                                American ambassador in England. He adds: "Lowell was not only cured
                                of his anti-British prejudice, but largely Anglicized, as American
                                ambassadors to England are apt to be. It is hardly wise to make them
                                afterward American secretaries of state. Mr. Charles Francis Adams,
                                who was minister to Great Britain during the civil war, of course
                                escaped the influence, his great natural strength of character being
                                aided by the circumstances of a mission which he discharged with
                                incomparable skill."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith says that his life at Ithaca was social and merry, that the
                                people in the city were kind, and that he looks back upon those days
                                with pleasure. He declares that no years of his life have been
                                better spent; was impressed by the beauty of the country round the
                                head of <pb id="VAA3932-207" n="199"/> the two lakes, Cayuga and
                                Seneca, and frequently indulged in excursions on foot. He adds:
                                "This British habit the people could not understand. A farmer, if he
                                overtook me on the road in his buggy, would kindly offer me a ride,
                                thinking that it was only for the want of a horse that anybody could
                                be going on foot."</p>
                            <p>He attended a great camp meeting, the first one he had ever
                                witnessed. It impressed him as being quite as much a social
                                gathering as a religious communion. "Preaching of a vehement kind
                                was going on all the time," he says, "and people were coming up to
                                the preacher's stand and declaring themselves converted. But there
                                were ice cream establishments, and there was a good deal, evidently,
                                of social enjoyment at the same time." He was thrilled when "Rock of
                                Ages" was sung by the multitude "among the pines and under the
                                stars."</p>
                            <p>Our author declares that the occasional lynchings in the United
                                States, "paradoxical as it may seem," are proofs rather of respect
                                for law than of lawlessness.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, when settled in Canada, made frequent visits to
                                Washington, which city, he observed, was always growing in
                                brilliancy, architectural and social. He declares that it is the
                                only great city on the American continent that is permanently and
                                securely well governed. "Instead of being under an elective council
                                of ward politicians, it is under three commissioners appointed by
                                the President of the United States. Here the problem of municipal
                                government, supposed to be insolvable, is solved if other cities
                                would accept the solution. They will never get out of the slough of
                                mal-administration <pb id="VAA3932-208" n="200"/> and corruption in
                                which they are all wallowing while they hug the elective system and
                                government by ward politicians."</p>
                            <p>He frequently met Bancroft, the historian, at the Cosmos Club, of
                                which they were both members, and had many pleasant and instructive
                                talks with him. He says that "Bancroft had preserved his health and
                                his powers of work into old age by a careful regimen. Like Bethell,
                                he worked early in the morning. He took regular horse exercise till
                                very late in life. When he could no longer ride he took to driving,
                                which as he was apt to let the reins drop, was rather perilous to
                                himself and his companion." Our author adds: "When he took my wife
                                out for a drive, I was glad to get her back safe."</p>
                            <p>One of his great friends at Washington was Mr. Bayard, secretary of
                                state, whom he pronounced a thoroughly high-bred and honorable
                                politician. Mr. Bayard was afterward ambassador to England, and
                                there distinguished himself, says our author, as an envoy of peace
                                and friendship. He adds: "It might be ungracious to say that with
                                the highest of motives he somewhat overdid the part. An American
                                ambassador to England should be cautious how he allows himself to be
                                brought under the spell of London society. He should remember that
                                he is an ambassador, the representative of a separate and
                                occasionally conflicting interest. I have touched on this point
                                already in the case of Lowell."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith excoriates the Grand Army of the Republic and places the
                                seal of his reprobation upon what he is pleased to term the
                                plundering of the nation for the payment <pb id="VAA3932-209"
                                    n="201"/> of exorbitant pensions. Certainly, no one reading what
                                he says, would mistake it for the utterance of the average American
                                politician. The Grand Army of the Republic is, without doubt, a
                                formidable and compact political organization, and we recall the
                                name of no public man in this country who has had the temerity or
                                moral courage to inveigh against it. He declares that "admiration
                                filled the world when, after the war, the army, instead of
                                overturning the Constitution and making its general a dictator, as
                                it had turned its ploughshares into swords, turned back the swords
                                into ploughshares and returned generally to the employments of
                                peaceful life. Nobody could foresee that out of the grave of the
                                military organization would arise a political organization styling
                                itself the Grand Army of the Republic and plundering the nation on a
                                gigantic scale. Thirty-five years after the end of the war, the
                                country was paying one hundred and forty millions in pensions, of
                                the claims for which a large proportion were notorious frauds.
                                Compared with this, what are the worst cases of monarchical
                                wastefulness? What was the cost of that paragon of monarchical
                                wastefulness, Versailles? Nor was the expense the worst of the evil.
                                The worst of the evil was the demoralization. Yet not a politician
                                dared say a word, while the platforms of both parties paid a
                                cowardly homage to the Grand Army vote and promised a liberal
                                construction of the pension law, that is to say, increased license
                                of public pillage. There are few things more shameful in the annals
                                of any nation. The total cost of the war of secession, when to the
                                enormous outlay <pb id="VAA3932-210" n="202"/> on the war itself,
                                including bonuses and payment to substitutes, is added the pension,
                                beggars experience and almost defies calculation."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith frequently visited the Senate and the House. He declares
                                that in the latter it may almost be said that a voice of thunder is
                                a condition of political eminence. That the acoustics are bad, and
                                "so incessant is the noise of talking, moving about, slamming of
                                desks, and calling of pages, that hardly any speaker can be heard.
                                It is a babel with a gavel accompaniment. Order there is none. I
                                have seen a number of members leave their places and group
                                themselves, standing, round a speaker whom they particularly wished
                                to hear. Speaker Reed's stentorian voice prevailed over the din. So
                                did that of Mr. Bryan."</p>
                            <p>He admits that the average of speaking in America, both in Congress
                                and elsewhere, is far higher than it is in England. That rhetoric
                                and elocution are parts of American education, but he declares that
                                the training has one bad result&#151;the orator seldom gets rid
                                of the air of speaking for effect. Referring to Edward Everett he
                                says: "I once heard Everett, whose platform oratory was the acme of
                                American art. His language was unimpeachable. But his every word and
                                not only his every word, but his every gesture, was unmistakably
                                prepared. He seemed to gesticulate not only with his hands, but with
                                his legs. He even planned scenic effects beforehand. Having to
                                deliver a Fourth of July oration, he introduced a veteran of 1812,
                                put him in a conspicuous place, and told the old man to rise to him
                                at his entrance into the hall. The old man did as he had been
                                bidden. <pb id="VAA3932-211" n="203"/> Everett apostrophized him
                                with, 'Venerable old man, sit down! It is not for you to rise to us,
                                but for us to rise to you.' The veteran said afterward, 'Mr. Everett
                                is a strange man; he told me to rise when he came into the hall, and
                                when I did rise he told me to sit down.'"</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith had a poor opinion of American statesmanship. He declares
                                that in the United States the grocers are statesmen; the statesmen
                                are grocers. But he magnanimously concedes that the level of
                                political intelligence among the people is higher than it is in any
                                other country. He considers the term of the member of the House of
                                Representatives too short for political training, and asserts that
                                "the House is a chaos led, if at all, most incongruously by the
                                Speaker, who acts as the head of a party when he ought to be
                                perfectly impartial."</p>
                            <p>Our author, of course, knows full well that there are inherent
                                defects in all governments and in all constitutions&#151;that
                                perfection in them is unattainable as it is in the individuals who
                                devise and construct them. He declares that the weak points of the
                                American Constitution are beginning to appear and he attributes them
                                to the "deference to the false diagnosis of Montesquieu which
                                entered into its construction, and is now interfering with its
                                working as a Republican counterpart of the Constitution of Great
                                Britain."</p>
                            <p>On the subject of society at Washington he says: "The tendency of
                                society at Washington, of official and congressional society
                                particularly, to dress itself after European courts and to mimic
                                their etiquette is manifest and amusing. Still, when I was there,
                                democracy continued to assert itself, especially in the familiarity
                                of <pb id="VAA3932-212" n="204"/> the people with the head of the
                                republic. I attended one of the Presidential receptions at the White
                                House. It was in the evening. There was an immense attendance of
                                people all in their common dress. From the time when I fell into the
                                line it took three-quarters of an hour to reach the White House. It
                                took the same time to get from the entrance to the White House to
                                the reception room, where the name of each visitor was called by the
                                marshal, and the President took each in turn by the hand. Sad the
                                plight of his hand at last must have been. Nothing, however, could
                                be better than the behavior of the people. They moved on quietly in
                                line, showing not the slightest sign of impatience. It is doubtful
                                whether a crowd of the aristocratic society at London would have
                                behaved quite so well. We used to hear of scuffles and of torn
                                dresses in the 'Crush Room' at St. James."</p>
                            <p>He comments on the party system of the United States. After reciting
                                the fact that there were two great organizations always on foot, he
                                declares that the principles of each oranization are ambulatory, and
                                a fresh platform is constructed before each Presidential election,
                                the planks being selected with a view to the attraction of votes. He
                                says: "It is possible to trace a connection, though of very tortuous
                                kind, in the principles of the Democratic party, which have in the
                                time of Jefferson been, though under a different name,
                                ultra-Democratic, became that of the slave-owning oligarchy of the
                                South, the medium of transformation being the ultra-Democratic
                                theory of state-right, which sheltered slavery. The changes,
                                nevertheless, are vital. Nobody <pb id="VAA3932-213" n="205"/> would
                                recognize the identity of the plutocratic Republican of the present
                                day with the patriotic Republican of the struggle for the
                                Union."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Smith, in 1871, after severing his connection with Cornell, went
                                over to reside with a branch of his family settled in Canada. In
                                Canada he was destined finally to make his home. Four years after
                                his arrival there he married Mrs. Harriet Boulton and, with her in
                                The Grange at Toronto, he declares that the rest of his life was
                                most happily passed. His description of The Grange and of their
                                domestic life there is fascinating in the extreme:</p>
                            <p>"The Grange at Toronto, with its lawns and its old elms, is the
                                counterpart in style and surroundings of a little English mansion.
                                It is the only specimen of the kind that I happen to have seen on
                                this side of the Atlantic. There were one or two more in Toronto,
                                but they have succumbed to progress. The Grange is an antiquity
                                among mushrooms, having been built in 1817. It originally stood
                                outside of the city, though now it is in the exact center. In
                                summer, when the trees are in leaf, nothing is seen from its door
                                but a church spire. In such a mansion lived Miss Austen's Emma, and
                                her father. We had, moreover, a household of faithful and attached
                                domestics, our relations with whom were like those of an English
                                family in former days. The married ones lived with their children,
                                on the grounds in four cottages, which they took pride in making
                                pretty with flowers and creepers, giving an air of happy life to the
                                place. In summer, only chimes were wanting to make me fancy that I
                                was in England. The great elms <pb id="VAA3932-214" n="206"/> were a
                                special feature of the place, and to their whispering under the
                                starlight I owe some lessons in philosophy."</p>

                            <p>People of the present generation can have no adequate conception of
                                the intense animosity, verging in many cases upon absolute ferocity,
                                that prevailed as a result of fifty years of slavery agitation,
                                culminating in our great civil war. Any such vitriolic fulmination
                                as the following, emanating from a Northern pulpit, would now be
                                received with loathing and reprobation:</p>
                            <p>"Greek fire for the families and cities of the rebels and hell fire
                                for their chiefs." Certain pulpit champions boldly asserted this as
                                a sentiment. It was not merely the raving of a single religious
                                mountebank.</p>
                            <p>An eminent public man declared while the conflict was going on that,
                                "I entertain no doubt whatever that hundreds of thousands of people
                                at the North would be frantic with fiendish delight if informed of
                                the universal massacre of the Southern people, including women and
                                children, in one night."</p>
                            <p>It was not to be expected that the speeches of Thad-deus Stevens, the
                                leader of the war party in the House of Representatives, would be
                                interlarded with encomiums upon the South and the Southern people;
                                and, indeed, it might reasonably be supposed that he would, in a
                                measure, inspect the truth of the situation through the magnifying
                                glass of passion. But that he would exhibit a merciless and fiendish
                                ferocity would hardly <pb id="VAA3932-215" n="207"/> be expected
                                from one of his acknowledged ability. It certainly could not be said
                                of Stevens, as was said of Sir James Mackintosh, "that he could not
                                hate; that the gall-bladder was omitted in his composition."</p>

                                profound Roger B. Taney, chief justice of the Supreme Court of the
                                United States, the immediate and worthy successor of John Marshall,
                                renowned on both sides of the Atlantic for his legal profundity and
                                acumen, did not escape the objurgations of the political guerrilla
                                of the period, engaged in the pernicious occupation of inflaming the
                                minds of the people with sectional hate. The following delectable
                                excerpt from a speech of Stevens is significant:</p>
                            <p>"Sir, this doctrine of a white man's government is as atrocious as
                                the infamous sentiment that damned the late Chief Justice Taney to
                                everlasting fame, and I fear to everlasting fire."</p>
                            <p>Those of us who at the present day believe that true patriotism
                                consists in loving one's whole country in its entirety, and each
                                state in its unity, congratulate ourselves and the country that the
                                old animosities caused by the prolonged agitation of the question of
                                slavery and the civil war, are rapidly passing away. If sectionalism
                                is not obselete it is at least obsolescent. Indeed, we are living in
                                an entirely new atmosphere. No stronger evidence of this can be
                                given than the opinions now expressed by Northern statesmen and
                                others, of abolition antecedents, in regard to the South and her
                                representative public men.</p>

                            <p>James Russell Lowell, of whom, as poet, essayist, and diplomatist,
                                the American people are so justly proud, did his part in the
                                prolonged agitation of the slavery question. When he graduated at
                                Harvard in 1838 he was the poet of his class, and his production
                                excited attention by reason of its witty ridicule of the abolition
                                movement of that day. But it was not long until he himself embarked
                                on the sea of abolition. He became editor of the "Antislavery
                                Standard," and later in life was the author of the celebrated
                                "Bigelow Papers" which was a caustic and telling satire on slavery
                                and the Mexican war. His productions were always effective but free
                                from bitterness. Before his death he gave out strong intimations
                                that his course would have been somewhat different, if he had had
                                his life to live over again. Mr. Howells, his literary contemporary,
                                says:</p>
                            <p>"Lowell had a great tenderness for the broken and ruined South, whose
                                sins he felt that he had had his share in visiting upon her, and he
                                was willing to do what he could to ease her sorrows in the case of
                                any particular Southerner."</p>
                            <p>Senator Hoar of Massachusetts, whose long term of service in the
                                senate reflected honor not only upon his own state but upon the
                                whole country, expresses his opinions of the Southern people and
                                their representative men. The high estimate placed upon Mr. Hoar by
                                his contemporary Mr. Blaine, will receive the hearty concurrence of
                                the people of all sections of the country.</p>
                            <p>"Eminent in his profession, successful in his political career, Mr.
                                Hoar superadds accomplishments which neither the practise of law nor
                                participation in public <pb id="VAA3932-217" n="209"/> affairs can
                                give. * * * He is independent without self-assertion, courageous
                                without bravado, conscientious without Pharisaism."</p>
                            <p>The expressions of the great senator from Massachusetts are alike
                                creditable to him and to those of whom he speaks.</p>
                            <p>Referring to the Southern people and Grant the senator says:</p>
                            <p>"The Southern people, even the white Democrats always had a kindly
                                feeling for Grant. They did not resent what he had done as a
                                soldier, as they resented what Greeley had said as a politician.
                                They knew too, in spite of their strong differences with Grant, the
                                innate modesty, justice and courage of the man."</p>
                            <p>Speaking of the Southern people and the carpetbaggers Mr. Hoar
                                says:</p>
                            <p>"In general it was impossible not to feel a certain sympathy with a
                                people, who whatever else had been their faults never had been
                                guilty of corruption or meanness, or the desire to make money out of
                                public office, in the intolerable loathing which they felt for these
                                strangers who had taken possession of the high places in their
                                states. * * * When the support of the national administration was
                                withdrawn, the negroes and carpet-bag majority was powerless as a
                                flock of sheep before a pack of wolves to resist their brave and
                                unscrupulous Democratic enemy, however inferior the latter in
                                numbers."</p>
                            <p>Again: "With the departure of Senator Butler from the Senate, and
                                that of his colleague, General Wade Hampton, ended the power in
                                South Carolina of the old <pb id="VAA3932-218" n="210"/> gentry who,
                                in spite of some grave faults, had given to that state an honorable
                                and glorious career."</p>
                            <p>Hoar on the Southern people: "My long conflict with their leaders has
                                impressed me with an ever increasing admiration of the great and
                                high qualities of the Southern people, yet as I grew older I have
                                learned, not only to respect and esteem, but to love the great
                                qualities which belong to my fellow-citizens of the Southern states.
                                They are a noble race. We may well take pattern from them in some of
                                the great virtues that make up the strength, as they make the glory
                                of Free States. Their love of home; their chivalrous respect for
                                woman; their courage; their delicate sense of honor; their
                                constancy, which can abide by an opinion or a purpose, or an
                                interest, of their states through adversity and through prosperity,
                                through the years and through the generations, are things by which
                                the people of the more mercurial North may take a lesson. And there
                                is another thing&#151;covetousness, corruption, the low
                                temptation of money has not yet found any place in our Southern
                                politics."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hoar's estimate of Senator Beck of Kentucky is interesting:</p>
                            <p>"We had an intense dislike of each other for the first few years of
                                our service. He hated everything I believed. He thought the New
                                England Abolitionists had neither love of liberty nor care for the
                                personal or political rights of the negro. He maintained that the
                                forefathers of the New England Abolitionists were guilty of bringing
                                slavery into this continent. He hated the modern New England
                                theological heresies with all the <pb id="VAA3932-219" n="211"/>
                                zeal of his Scotch Presbyterian forbears. He hated the
                                reconstruction policy, which he thought was inspired by a desire to
                                put the white man in the place where the negro had been. * * * He
                                hated New England culture and refinement, which he deemed a very
                                poor crop coming from a barren intellectual soil. * * * He had a
                                powerful and vigorous frame, and a powerful and vigorous
                                understanding. * * * Anybody who undertook to debate with him found
                                him a tough customer. He knew the Bible&#151;especially the
                                Psalms of David&#151;and the poems of Burns, by heart."</p>
                            <p>Senators Hoar's delineation of the character and charming attributes
                                of Justice Lucius Q. C. Lamar of Mississippi is fascinating in the
                                extreme. The style and subject-matter are equally captivating:</p>
                            <p>"Mr. Justice Lamar always underrated himself. This tendency plainly
                                sprang from a vivid imagination. With him the splendid passions
                                attendant upon youth never faded into the light of common day, but
                                they kept before him as an ideal, the impossibility of whose
                                realization, as borne in upon him from time to time, oppressed him
                                with a sense of failure. Yet the conscientiousness of his work was
                                not lessened, nor was the acuteness of his intellect obscured by
                                these natural causes of his discontent; nor did a certain oriental
                                dreaminess of temperament ever allure him to abandon the effort to
                                accomplish something that would last after his lips were dumb."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hoar, referring to the assertion of Mathew Arnold in one of his
                                essays that, in general, Americans lack distinction, but allowing
                                this quality to Grant and denying it for all the world to Lincoln,
                                continues:</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-220" n="212"/>
                            <p>"With some rare and delightful exceptions, we are eminently
                                commonplace. The men who are sent to congress do not escape the
                                wearing quality. * * * Some of the best, most attractive men I have
                                known were from the South. * * * One of them, perhaps, on the whole,
                                the most conspicuous, is Lucius Q. C. Lamar. * * * Lamar was one of
                                the most delightful of men. His English style, both in conversation
                                and in public speaking, was fresh and original. * * * He had taken
                                the part of the South with great zeal. He told me shortly before he
                                left the Senate that he thought it was a great misfortune for the
                                world that the Southern cause had been lost. * * * Lamar was a
                                delightful man in ordinary conversation. He used to tell delightful
                                stories of queer characters and events that had come within his own
                                observation. * * * When I made a motion excepting Jefferson Davis
                                from the benefit of the bill to pension the soldiers of the Mexican
                                war, Mr. Lamar compared him to Prometheus, <hi rend="i">and me</hi>
                                to the vulture preying upon his liver. * * * He had a delightful and
                                original literary quality which, if the lines of his life had been
                                cast amid other scenes than the tempest of a great revolution and
                                civil war, might have made him a dreamer like Montaigne; and a
                                chivalrous quality that might have made him a companion of Athos and
                                D'Artagnan."</p>

                            <p>The meeting of President Taft and President Diaz at El Paso on the
                                18th day of October, 1909, is a notable event in the history of the
                                two republics. It was not so gorgeous and spectacular an occasion as
                                the historic interview between Henry VIII, and Francis I, on "The
                                Field of the Cloth of Gold." The great Cardinal Wolsey with his
                                elegant manners, gay conversation, insinuating address and love of
                                magnificence, was not present to give eclat to the meeting. The
                                illustrious Cardinal in whom was concentrated at this time (1520)
                                all secular and religious power in his own country, was notably
                                absent. He was not there to have his appetite appeased, and his mind
                                and temper conciliated, by the choice viands from which, on the
                                former occasion, he derived such exquisite delight and satisfaction.
                                Nor was the Duke of Buckingham present, he having been executed on
                                Tower Hill for the venial offense of expressing his opinion freely
                                about the expense and absurdity of the whole business of the Field
                                of the Cloth of Gold. The meeting at El Paso was not a dress
                                occasion as was that of the <pb id="VAA3932-222" n="214"/> two
                                sovereigns; at the meeting of the latter, as the impartial historian
                                informs us, many of the knights and gentlemen were so superbly
                                dressed that it was said they carried their whole estates upon their
                                shoulders. It was, indeed, a gala day at El Paso. Foregathered there
                                were many thousands of people. Excursion trains came from hundreds
                                of miles away. The American and Mexican military display was
                                strikingly impressive. The cannons roared, the people cheered, and
                                the flags of the two nations were everywhere entwined. For the
                                purpose of the meeting, the entire international bridge spanning the
                                historic Rio Grande was guarded as neutral territory. This permitted
                                the Mexican troops to accompany their president to the American end
                                of the bridge, while similarly the escort of the regular army
                                attending President Taft was permitted to proceed directly to the
                                border line of Mexico. The cities of El Paso and Juarez were
                                gorgeously decorated. President Taft arrived in El Paso shortly
                                after nine o'clock in the morning. His train was met at the city
                                limits by an escort of cavalry and the soldiers galloped along
                                behind it as it was drawn slowly into the very center of the city.
                                Soon after his arrival the president was escorted into the St. Regis
                                hotel to be the guest of the El Paso Chambers at breakfast.
                                Breakfast ended, President Taft proceeded to the Chamber of Commerce
                                to await the coming of President Diaz, the latter having arrived the
                                day before at Juarez.</p>
                            <p>The coming of the Mexican executive, whose temporary quitting of his
                                own territory required the sanction of the congress of the republic,
                                was signalled by the <pb id="VAA3932-223" n="215"/> booming of
                                twenty-one guns as President Diaz arrived at the American border
                                line. He was attended by a military escort in full dress uniform.
                                The salute was fired by the American forces.</p>
                            <p>General J. Franklin Bell, chief of staff of the army, met President
                                Diaz as the personal representative of the president of the United
                                States. President Diaz, gray and grizzled, looking every inch a
                                soldier and a fighter, alighted from his gold-trimmed carriage of
                                state and entered an American equipage, plainly simple. The
                                welcoming party consisted of General Bell, Brigadier General Meyer,
                                Governor Campbell of Texas and the Mayor of El Paso. They shook
                                hands with the distinguished visitor, while the American band played
                                the Mexican national air, "La Paloma."</p>
                            <p>The escorts of the United States troops then proceeded to conduct
                                President Diaz to President Taft at the Chamber of Commerce. The
                                streets through which the Mexican executive and escorts passed were
                                lined with thousands of cheering people.</p>
                            <p>After the meeting and a light luncheon had been served, President
                                Diaz withdrew in the same manner he had come being escorted back to
                                the portals of the city, where the same courtesies as marked his
                                arrival attended his departure.</p>
                            <p>The American troops returned to the Chamber of Commerce building and
                                escorted President Taft over the same route President Diaz had
                                traveled. President Taft and the invited guests accompanying him
                                entered carriages allotted to them by the Mexican authorities and
                                proceeded to the Juarez custom house where they met <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-224" n="216"/> the Mexican president and here the
                                simple ceremonies ended.</p>
                            <p>When President Taft alighted from his carriage on Mexican soil it was
                                the second time in the history of the United States that a president
                                of the United States had left its borders. Mr. Roosevelt set the
                                precedent when he attended a dinner given by the President of Panama
                                on Panamanian territory.<ref id="ref_38" rend="super"

                            <p>There was nothing perfunctory or insincere in the meeting of the
                                presidents of the two great republics, but its purpose was to make
                                it an informal celebration of the most cordial relations existing
                                between the two countries.</p>
                            <p>The meeting of the two monarchs on the "Field of the Cloth of Gold"
                                was characterized by the utmost perfidy and bad faith. Henry coveted
                                France and Wolsey coveted no less a prize than the papacy itself;
                                and, notwithstanding the solemn treaty then and there entered into,
                                its provisions were rendered nugatory and inoperative, by reason of
                                the fact that Henry as he returned from the meeting with Francis,
                                sought an interview with Charles V, which ended in a secret
                                confederacy of these sovereigns and the promise of the Emperor
                                Charles to marry Henry's only daughter. If it has not been done
                                already, a tablet should be erected upon the site of the Field of
                                the Cloth of Gold as a memorial to the perfidy of Kings.</p>
                            <p>On the 24th of October following the meeting. President Diaz
                                expressed his impressions of his reception at <pb id="VAA3932-225"
                                    n="217"/> El Paso, and his estimate of President Taft, in an
                                interview at Chapultepec Castle. He said:</p>
                            <p>"As for my personal opinion of President Taft, I can say that he is a
                                man of charming personality, frank and sincere, whose features carry
                                the unmistakable stamp of a man with high consciousness of duty,
                                unmarred by a touch of remorse. The interview which I had with
                                President Taft was of the most cordial character, and it is clear
                                that it will redound to the benefit of both countries, owing to the
                                perfect understanding existing between the two governments and which
                                was realized precisely, through an interview in still further
                                tightening the bonds of their friendly and commercial relationship.
                                From the commercial standpoint, and politically, both countries will
                                be greatly benefitted because of a better business understanding
                                between the two peoples, and the investment of capital for the
                                development of our industries will be accomplished under very
                                favorable circumstances.</p>
                            <p>"We Mexicans have plenty of raw material in our country&#151;rich
                                natural resources. The Americans have capital, talent, energy and
                                they will come to the aid of our own enterprising men in the
                                establishment and development of useful and important industries.
                                Therefore, with the good understanding between the governments of
                                the two countries, men of business can carry to successful issue
                                their great enterprises."</p>
                            <p>Many of us may not realize the marvelous resources and the vast
                                territorial extent of our sister republic. Mexico stretches 1,950

                                south-southeast with a mean breadth of 400 miles, varying from 1,000
                                in 26 degrees north to 130 at the narrowest parts of the Tehuantepec
                                isthmus.</p>
                            <p>It has a coast line of nearly 6,000 miles, about 4,200 on the Pacific
                                and 1,600 on the Atlantic. Mexico has every variety of climate.</p>

                                degrees Fahr., and oscillating between such moderate extremes as 50
                                degrees and 86 degrees, this region enjoys one of the finest

                            <p>When the subject of Mexico is under consideration one's mind
                                naturally reverts back to the condition of Mexico prior to the
                                Spanish invasion made under the leadership of Hernando Cortes in
                                1519. This period is known as the era of the Montezumas. While it is
                                characterized by barbaric ostentation yet in many respects it was
                                beyond the European level of the time. One of their principal
                                amusements was dancing, and a sport called the bird dance excited
                                the admiration of foreigners for the skill and daring with which
                                groups of performers dressed as birds let themselves down by ropes
                                wound round the top of a high mast, so as to fly whirled in circles
                                far above the ground. The magnificence of the palaces of the
                                Montezumas with their columns of porphyry and <pb id="VAA3932-227"
                                    n="219"/> jasper, supporting marble balconies, and their
                                beautiful surrounding gardens would be considered marvelous in any
                                age or in any country. One of the companions of Cortes describes a
                                palace visited by him. It consisted of hundreds of rooms and halls
                                ranged round three open squares, with women's apartments, granaries,
                                store houses, menageries, aviaries, of such extent that he wandered
                                about four times on as many separate visits, without seeing the
                                whole. Their cultivation of natural history was indeed remarkable.
                                It is said that in the palace garden flowers were transplanted, and
                                water fowl bred near fresh and salt pools fit for each kind, that
                                all kinds of birds and beasts were kept in well appointed zoological
                                gardens where there were homes even for alligators and snakes.</p>
                            <p>It goes without saying that the subject of courtship and marriage is
                                regarded everywhere as one of vital interest. In Mexico, under the
                                reigns of the Montezumas, the important question whether a marriage
                                should be consummated was determined by the <hi rend="i">ipse
                                    dixit</hi> of an astrologer who, for his guidance, compared the
                                horoscopes of the pair to ascertain whether their birth signs were
                                compatible. The horoscope was an observation made of the aspect of
                                the heavens at the moment of a person's birth, by which the
                                astrologer claimed to foretell the temperament and disposition of
                                the individual as well as the events of his life. The most important
                                part of the sky in the astrologer's consideration was that part of
                                the zodiac which rose at the moment of the child's birth. An
                                accurate record of these observations was <pb id="VAA3932-228"
                                    n="220"/> made at the time and was preserved for future use and
                                reference.</p>
                            <p>It is a matter of history that the belief in astrology was almost
                                universal as late as the middle of the 17th century; and that, for
                                five centuries previous to that time, astrology and divination
                                exercised an influence not only over the uneducated, but over the
                                greatest minds, over kings and queens and wealthy people; and was
                                received and admitted by Lord Bacon himself. Even so late as the
                                early part of the 19th century astrology retained an influence over
                                the general mind sufficient to constitute the main spring of
                                romance, as witness Scott's charming novel "Guy Mannering, or the
                                Astrologer."</p>
                            <p>Returning to Mexico and the Montezumas.</p>
                            <p>If the astrologer's report was favorable to the compatibility of the
                                pair, the next important step was to engage the services of an old
                                woman to act as an intermediary or go-between.</p>
                            <p>It is plain to be seen that this courtship by proxy, and marriage by
                                horoscopy, would practically eliminate from life the ante-nuptial
                                association of the sexes.</p>
                            <p>We live in an age of progress and innovation, and old customs, old
                                fashions, old conventionalities, are constantly being revamped and
                                brought to the front again; but I have grave doubts whether this old
                                custom, which was in vogue in Mexico during the reigns of the
                                Montezumas, will find a foot-hold in North America; certainly not
                                during the next year or two. Of this I am quite sure, that if the
                                Astrologer and his old woman intermediary should appear at this time
                                with the avowed purpose of <pb id="VAA3932-229" n="221"/> planting
                                on our soil this nefarious system, that they would be received with
                                but scant courtesy.</p>
                            <p>A profound anatomist of the human heart has declared that the most
                                delightful period of courtship is that which precedes a formal
                                declaration and proposal, but during which each is conscious of the
                                other's regard. It is during this period when a sunshine seems to
                                prevail which fills the heart full of radiance; when one feels that
                                to love and to be loved is the greatest happiness of existence; a
                                time, when the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young man's
                                mind cause the most delicious excitement, and when the mere sound of
                                the rustling of a dress excites indescribable emotions. It is an era
                                of profound, and sometimes prolonged, silences, even when the
                                buzzing of a fly or the fall of a pocket handkerchief may be
                                distinctly heard&#151;when, if the silence be broken for a
                                moment, the words are as gentle as the moan of a wounded dove; a
                                time when conversation, animated or otherwise, is not essential to
                                happiness. It is a period when a gesture asks a question and an
                                expressive look gives the answer. "When one can infuse into the eye
                                the power of the soul, to give it the full value of speech and throw
                                a poem or a drama into a single flash"; a time when tears may dim
                                the eyes but do not fall, being absorbed by the heart. Shall all
                                these things cease and be no more at the behest of the cold and
                                merciless astrologer?</p>
                            <p>An incident which I am going to relate could never have occurred in
                                Mexico in the times of the Montezumas. A young gentleman had been
                                paying assiduous attention to a young lady for more than two years
                                and, not-withstanding <pb id="VAA3932-230" n="222"/> his arduous
                                wooing, she had not consented to become his wife. The case seemed
                                almost hopeless; but he made a prolonged call on her one Sunday
                                evening, and before he left she accepted his proposal. Though a
                                decade has elapsed since the charming young lady became his bride,
                                he still relates, with much enthusiasm and satisfaction, an account
                                of the return to his home by moonlight, at twelve o'clock on that
                                memorable night. This was the supreme occasion of his life. He was
                                so thrilled and overwhelmed with delight that he found himself in a
                                profound revery, and, with uplifted hand, declaiming aloud, "I have
                                nothing against any man, woman or child in this world."</p>
                            <p>Native history and the reigns of the Montezumas came to an end with
                                the Spanish conquest. In the early years of the sixteenth century
                                the Spaniards discovered Mexico but had made no attempt to effect a
                                settlement. Hernando Cortes, a lad of fifteen, was sent to the
                                University of Salamanca; but study was distasteful to him, and he
                                returned home in 1501, resolved to enter upon a life of adventure.
                                During a brief service in St. Domingo and Cuba he displayed great
                                ability on several trying occasions, and the conquest of the newly
                                discovered country was intrusted to him. Cortes, young, brilliant
                                and courageous, and remarkable for a graceful physiognomy and
                                amiable manners, as well as for skill and address in all military
                                exercises, accepted the herculean task. On the 18th of November,
                                1518, he set out from Spain, with ten vessels, six hundred Spaniards
                                and some pieces of cannon, and on the 4th of March, 1519, he landed
                                on the coast of Mexico, taking possession of <pb id="VAA3932-231"
                                    n="223"/> the town of Tabasco. He proceeded to burn his vessels
                                to cut off the possibility of retreat, and to show his soldiers that
                                they must either conquer or perish. He here learned that the native
                                sovereign was called Montezuma; that he reigned over an extensive
                                empire, which had lasted for three centuries and that his riches
                                were immense and his power absolute. No more was necessary to
                                inflame the ambition of the invader who did not hesitate to
                                undertake the conquest of this great empire, which could only be
                                effected by combining stratagem and address with force and
                                    courage.<ref id="ref_40" rend="super" target="note_40"

                            <p>Nothing in romance is more fascinating than a detailed account of his
                                career and service, his battles and brilliant exploits, in effecting
                                the conquest of this vast empire; but it is no part of our purpose
                                in this paper to enter into those matters of detail. Suffice it to
                                say that on the 7th of July 1520, Cortes gained a victory which
                                decided the fate of Mexico. The historian declares<ref id="ref_41"
                                    rend="super" target="note_41" targOrder="U">12</ref> that his
                                uniform success was entirely owing to his genius and valor, and his
                                profound but unscrupulous policy, and the account of his success,
                                which he transmitted to Spain excited the admiration of his
                                countrymen, and Charles V, then emperor of Spain, appointed him
                                governor and captain-general of Mexico. The Mexicans were everywhere
                                forced to yield to the ascendency of European discipline and
                                    valor.<note id="note_41" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                            </p>
                            <p>Meanwhile the court of Madrid, dreading the ambition and popularity
                                of the victorious chief, sent commissioners to watch his conduct and
                                thwart his proceedings; and whilst he was completing the conquest of
                                New Spain <pb id="VAA3932-232" n="224"/> his goods were seized and
                                his retainers imprisoned and put into irons. Indignant at the
                                ingratitude of his sovereign, Cortes returned in person to Spain to
                                appeal to the justice of the emperor and appeared there with great
                                splendor.</p>
                            <p>The emperor received him with every mark of distinction. Cortes
                                returned to Mexico with new titles but diminished authority, a
                                viceroy having been entrusted with the administration of civil
                                affairs, whilst the military department, with permission to push his
                                conquests, was all that remained to Cortes. Controversies arose and
                                Cortes, tired of struggling with adversaries unworthy of him, he
                                returned to Europe hoping to confound his enemies.</p>
                            <p>We read that upon his return to Spain "he was received coldly; he
                                fell into neglect, and could scarcely obtain an audience. One day,
                                however, having forced his way through the crowd which surrounded
                                the emperor's carriage, and mounted on the doorstep, Charles,
                                astonished at an act of such audacity, demanded to know who he was.
                                'I am a man,' replied the conqueror of Mexico proudly, 'who has
                                given you more provinces than your ancestors left you cities.' This
                                haughty declaration of important services ill requited could
                                scarcely fail to offend a monarch on whom fortune had lavished its
                                choicest favors; and Cortes, overwhelmed with disgust, withdrew from
                                court, passed the remainder of his days in solitude, and died near
                                Seville on the 2nd of December, 1554.</p>
                            <p>But it would seem that ingratitude for patriotic service is not the
                                exclusive prerogative of emperors and <pb id="VAA3932-233" n="225"/>
                                kings. That of Charles V has almost a parallel in our own country in
                                the case of Admiral Dewey. His splendid and heroic performance with
                                his fleet in Manila Bay in the early morning of that memorable 1st
                                day of May, entitles him to the profoundest gratitude of his own
                                countrymen, as it has justly excited the admiration of the whole
                                world. We all remember with shame the attempt made by unscrupulous
                                politicians and some of the newspapers of the country, upon a
                                miserable pretext, and for selfish and unworthy purposes, to mar the
                                fame and detract from the glory of the great admiral. The offense
                                they committed was no less despicable than that of arson or grand
                                larceny, and in its enormity, is in-dissolubly associated in one's
                                mind with the atrocious and revolting crime of Burking, which was
                                first committed by the Irishman Burke in 1829.</p>
                            <p>The historian of the future will say of Dewey as was said of another
                                great commander centuries ago, that he was "in war a whirlwind, in
                                peace a zephyr." His name is already inscribed high in the temple of
                                fame and there it will remain forever.</p>
                            <p>In reading an account of the cordial meeting of Presidents Taft and
                                Diaz at El Paso, on the border line between the two republics, one's
                                mind naturally reverts back to the time when the relations of the
                                two countries were not so cordial and harmonious. We are reminded of
                                the fact that Mr. Polk, the Democratic President, declared that "war
                                exists by the act of Mexico"; and that there was a very formidable
                                opposition to the war made by the Whig party and many of its great
                                leaders. Mr. Corwin, the celebrated Ohio orator and statesman,
                                declared <pb id="VAA3932-234" n="226"/> in substance that, "If I
                                were a Mexican as I am an American I would welcome the American
                                invader with bloody hands to a hospitable grave." Rufus Choate, the
                                eminent advocate, expressed profound sympathy with the Mexican
                                people on account of the alleged aggressive and unwarranted action
                                of the United States, and his sympathy was even extended to them in
                                the most tender and delicate relations of life. In a voice like a
                                sweet, yet powerful flute, he declared that "The Mexican maiden, as
                                she sits with her lover among the orange groves, will sing to her
                                guitar the story of these times. 'Ah, woe is me, Alhama!' for a
                                thousand years to come."</p>
                            <p>The war with Mexico, which followed closely the annexation of Texas,
                                was of short duration, and resulted in the treaty of Guadalupe
                                Hidalgo, February 2nd, 1848, by which New Mexico, California, Utah
                                and Arizona were ceded to the United States.</p>
                            <p>The two countries are to be congratulated upon the cordial and
                                fraternal relations that now exist between them&#151;and also
                                the Mexican maiden so delightfully situated amongst the orange
                                groves. She no longer sings to her guitar "doleful ditties," but
                                rather a song expressive of undying affection for the dear lover who
                                sits beside her. We turn for a moment to the brief and unfortunate
                                reign of the emperor Maximilian. Nothing in history nor romance has
                                ever painted anything more tragic than the fate that awaited the
                                emperor and his wife, the beautiful and accomplished Carlotta.</p>
                            <p>One of the fondest dreams of Napoleon III was a universal fusion of
                                the Latin races and, in furtherance <pb id="VAA3932-235" n="227"/>
                                of this end, he offered the Mexican imperial crown to the Austrian
                                archduke, Ferdinand Maximilian. The latter had already been tendered
                                the crown by a deputation of notables from Mexico who spoke of the
                                "fecundity of the soil, the excellence of the fruits, the mildness
                                of the seasons, the beauty of the landscape, in a land where nature
                                is one perpetual smile." Maximilian finally acepted the crown in
                                1863.</p>
                            <p>No more propitious time could have been selected by Napoleon for
                                consummating his cherished scheme in respect to Mexico, as
                                interference by the government at Washington was absolutely
                                impracticable, on account of the Civil War which was then in
                                progress, and the result of which was at that time decidely
                                problematical.</p>
                            <p>Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, was a second son of Archduke Francis
                                Charles, and was born in Vienna on July 6th, 1832. He was trained
                                for the navy, and ultimately attained a high command in that branch
                                of his country's service. In 1857, he married the Princess Carlotta,
                                daughter of Leo I, King of the Belgians.</p>
                            <p>It was on the 28th of May 1864, that Maximilian and Carlotta landed
                                at Vera Cruz, a city at that season ravaged by yellow fever, and
                                they found the inhabitants unfavorably disposed toward the empire.

                                    >13</ref> that from the commencement of his reign he found
                                himself involved in difficulties of the most serious kind, which in
                                1866 made it apparent to every one outside of Mexico the necessity
                                for his abdicating. The Civil War in the United States being now a
                                thing of the past, and the French government, in obedience to
                                importunate <pb id="VAA3932-236" n="228"/> demands from Washington
                                for the repatriation of the French troops in Mexico, having yielded,
                                Maximilian was left to his fate. He declined to abdicate, however,
                                but on May 15th, 1867, he resolved to attempt an escape through the
                                enemy's lines. He was arrested before he could carry out his
                                resolution, and after trial by court-martial, was condemned to
                                death. The sentence was carried out on June 19th, 1867. His remains
                                were conveyed to Vienna, where they were buried in the imperial
                                vault early in the following year.<note id="note_42"

                                trained to anything but what gave him pleasure. That he knew nothing
                                of the luxury and divine exaltation of being useful to anybody but
                                himself; but the same writer adds that he was refined, accomplished,
                                handsome and in a way educated, but had never known what it was to
                                bear any responsibility. It may, with propriety, be suggested that
                                inasmuch as Maximilian had been trained for the navy, and had
                                ultimately attained a high command in that branch of his country's
                                service, that his life had not been entirely devoid of

                            <p>The widowed Carlotta laments that Maximilian was induced to accept
                                the proffered crown. Her letters, written after her husband's
                                execution, are strangely and beautifully pathetic. She writes:</p>
                            <p>"Ambition kindles in the eyes of a man a diabolic luster, and
                                converts an angel into a devil. The man who wishes to become a king
                                turns into a demon. * * * The deputation spoke of the fecundity of
                                the soil, the <pb id="VAA3932-237" n="229"/> excellence of the
                                fruits, the mildness of the seasons, the beauties of the landscape
                                in a land where nature is one perpetual smile."</p>
                            <p>Again she writes: "There are two kinds of fever, Maria
                                Victoria&#151;that of the body and that of the spirit. That of
                                the body <hi rend="i">kills.</hi> That of the spirit <hi rend="i"

                            <p>Mexico has had a chequered history, but during the period of more
                                than forty years that has elapsed since the execution of Maximilian,
                                she has enjoyed a peace and prosperity such as she had never enjoyed
                                before. With her boundless natural resources, and a continuance of
                                the present wise administration of her governmental affairs, Mexico
                                has, indeed, a most brilliant future.<ref id="ref_44" rend="super"

                                        forth. When the foregoing essay was written, judging from
                                        surface indications, Mexico bid fair to enjoy a long period
                                        of peace and prosperity. Now Diaz is an exile, Madero is
                                        president, and chaos and confusion reign supreme throughout

                            <p>During one of our numerous sojourns in Asheville, North Carolina, I
                                had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Lea McLean Renshaw of New Orleans. I
                                found him to be a gentleman of much intelligence and refinement. He
                                gave me a very full account of the stirring and excitng events that
                                occurred in his city on the 14th of September, 1874. His father,
                                then a very young man, was an active participant in those scenes and
                                ranked as lieutenant in Company G, Captain Kilpatrick's command. <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-238" n="230"/> I was intensely interested in his
                                narrative largely on account of my vivid boyhood experience as a

                                1861-2; the former operating on the Mississippi river and the latter
                                on Lake Pontchartrain and adjacent waters.</p>

                            <p>Many fine things have been said of the Republican party, but it seems
                                now to be generally agreed that the reconstruction policy during the
                                "dark decade," is an indelible stain upon that party&#151;one
                                that all ocean's waters can never wash out.</p>
                            <p>I had a personal friend who visited New Orleans during the
                                Reconstruction era and at a time when the negro and carpet-bag
                                legislature was in session. He had been a brigade surgeon in the
                                Union army during the entire war. This gentleman assured me that his
                                observations on this visit were the severest test his Republicanism
                                ever had. That this delectable legislature <pb id="VAA3932-240"
                                    n="232"/> made all manner of silly, grotesque, and extravagantly
                                wild appropriations; that property in New Orleans at that time would
                                not sell for enough to pay the taxes; that the members of this
                                unique body jumped over chairs and tables, like monkeys in the
                                forests of Sumatra, in their wild scramble to get their hands in the
                                public treasury.</p>
                            <p>It was about this time that Horace Greeley advised and declared that
                                when these people used the word "pray" they should spell it
                                "prey".</p>
                            <p>Even Senator Hoar of Massachusetts, all of whose principles and
                                predilections had been ultra anti-southern, declared, <hi rend="i"
                                    >in articulo mortis,</hi> "That it was impossible not to feel a
                                certain sympathy with a people, who whatever else had been their
                                faults never had been guilty of corruption or meanness, or the
                                desire to make money out of public office, in the intolerable
                                loathing which they felt for these strangers who had taken
                                possession of the high places in their states." The senator further
                                declared that "When the support of the national administration was
                                withdrawn, the negro and carpet-bag majority was powerless as a
                                flock of sheep before a pack of wolves to resist their brave and
                                unscrupulous Democratic enemy, however inferior the latter in
                                numbers."</p>
                            <p>Mr. Blaine, the brilliant, aggressive Mephistopheles of the
                                Republican party, and an ardent advocate of his party's
                                reconstruction policy, at last discovered, using his own words,
                                "that the American people have an instinctive hostility against the
                                use of troops at elections; and he finally deduced and enunciated
                                the great philosophical truth that "The task of enforcing obedience
                                to <pb id="VAA3932-241" n="233"/> laws, when obedience is not in the
                                hearts of the people, is the most difficult undertaking ever imposed
                                upon the governing power."</p>
                            <p>Eminent foreigners who were sincere friends of the Union, and in full
                                sympathy with the government at Washington in its efforts to
                                preserve it, were not oblivious of the horrors of reconstruction.
                                The Conte De Monta-lambert in a letter addressed to Mr. Bigelow, the
                                distinguished American Ambassador to France, declared:</p>
                            <p>"I cannot conceal from you that there still remains one shadow, not
                                so say one stain, on the flag of your glorious country&#151;the
                                consequences of that confiscation which has been denounced against
                                the conquered. I know not what great statesman it was who said that
                                one incurred less danger in killing people than in despoiling them.
                                Nothing is more true. You can find confirmation of it in the modern
                                history of France. It is by confiscation far more than by its
                                scaffold that the French revolution has deposited in the soul of our
                                country those deadly germs of discord which time has not even yet
                                extirpated."</p>
                            <p>Goldwin Smith attributes the failure and shame of the policy of
                                reconstruction to two causes: the exclusion of the Southern leaders
                                from the work and the death of Lincoln. Mr. Smith says: "How Lincoln
                                would have dealt with reconstruction is a secret buried in his
                                grave; more wisely, it may be safely assumed, than did Charles
                                Sumner and the other fiery and revengeful politicians into whose
                                hands, after his death, the question passed. His character, whatever
                                his theory, would have guided him and the state aright."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-242" n="234"/>
                            <p>The people of the South were goaded to desperation and it became
                                absolutely a question of self-preservation. To the devastation and
                                desolation resulting from the prolonged war was added the horrible
                                crime of spoliation &#151;comparable in wickedness to the worst
                                of the Italian banditti, who, whenever they robbed, were sure to
                                murder.</p>
                            <p>It was at New Orleans on the memorable 14th of September, 1874, that
                                the backbone of negro and carpet-bag domination in the South was
                                broken. On this day occurred the overthrow by the Crescent City
                                White League of the power of the Metropolitan Police, the armed
                                strength of the carpet-bagger rule of Louisiana under the Republican
                                party. In the battle between the police composed of 1,200 well armed
                                men, and the Citizens' League, numbering two hundred and fifty,
                                twelve citizens were killed and over fifty of the police. The
                                accounts of the battle and the events leading up to it published in
                                the local newspapers are thrilling in the extreme.</p>
                            <p>The battle took place in Canal street, between the Custom House and
                                the river, a monument now standing on the spot which was in the
                                thickest of the fray. On this monument are the names of the citizens
                                who lost their lives in the revolt against negro and carpet-bagger
                                rule.</p>
                            <p>Those who were in the city's streets that day recall its unparalleled
                                incidents vividly. The South was in the throes of reconstruction.
                                The Republicans and carpet-baggers ruled the state, placing negroes
                                in office, on the bench, and in the police force. For years this <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-243" n="235"/> condition had existed, and conditions
                                were well nigh intolerable. White men were jostled on the sidewalks
                                by negroes, and white women were openly insulted by the uniformed
                                negro policemen. The city had the appearance of a stronghold in the
                                hands of the enemy. There were three regiments of negro militia, two
                                regiments of the United States army, and worst of all there was the
                                heavily armed Metropolitan Police force of twelve hundred men, one
                                hundred mounted, the best equipped body of men in the world.</p>
                            <p>Police were everywhere armed with Winchester rifles. In Canal street
                                each night about one hundred were stationed in the distance from
                                Rampart street to the river. Then there were the mounted patrolmen,
                                carrying eight-shot carbines, revolvers and sabers. General A. S.
                                Badger, who had been a Federal officer in the Civil War, was in
                                command of the police. So far as drill, equipment and appearance
                                were concerned they gave the impression of regular soldiers.</p>
                            <p>Leading white citizens resolved to rid themselves of the yoke, if
                                need be at the cost of their lives. So, secretly, the Crescent City
                                White League was formed. Gen. W. J. Behan, Fred M. Ogden, C. H.
                                Allen, Col. John Anzell and Archibald Mitchell were the moving
                                spirits.</p>
                            <p>They chose their men carefully, and the organization was drilled
                                thoroughly, but in absolute secrecy. The police suspected a movement
                                of the kind, but were unable to track it down.</p>
                            <p>When all was ready arms were ordered from New York, to come on the
                                steamship Mississippi of the Cromwell <pb id="VAA3932-244" n="236"/>
                                Line. The steamship arrived at her wharf September 11th, the arms on
                                deck. The police and the big detective force became aware of the
                                shipment of the arms and declared the citizens never should have
                                them, Feeling was high, and it was plain there soon must be a
                                clash.</p>
                            <p>Brands in power, therefore were the speeches of Thomas J. Semmes and
                                others to a great mass meeting of probably fifteen thousand people,
                                called together in front of the Crescent Hall, at St. Charles and
                                Canal streets, on the morning of September 14th 1874. Judge R. H.
                                Marr made the last speech of the day. His parting advice was that it
                                was the duty of every white man to go to his home, procure arms, and
                                hasten to Poydras street to obtain the arms on the Mississippi by
                                force, if necessary.</p>
                            <p>A regatta of the Carrolton Rowing Club was set for that afternoon,
                                and thousands, believing there would be no trouble prepared to
                                attend, and after securing their noonday meal at their homes,
                                proceeded to Canal street to take the excursion boats to
                                Carrolton.</p>
                            <p>When they came to Canal street they found the entire twelve hundred
                                of the Metropolitan Police lined up in battle array from Magazine
                                street to the Louisville and Nashville station.</p>
                            <p>They were in four ranks, with two twelve-inch Napoleon guns near the
                                river, two one-inch Gatling guns sweeping the levee, two
                                twelve-pound howitzers in the center, and two twelve-pound Napoleon
                                guns at the right. The police stood silent, awaiting the inevitable
                                battle.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-245" n="237"/>
                            <p>General Fred N. Ogden was in command of the White League, and
                                displayed much strategical ability. In fact, it was his strategy
                                which won the day. His force gathered at Poydras and Tchoupitoulas
                                streets. Company C, under the command of Capt. Samuel Buck, and
                                Company G, under the command of Capt. Douglas M. Kilpatrick, moved
                                out Poydras street to the levee.</p>
                            <p>Company B under the command of Capt. Horace Shropshire, and a Company
                                under the command of Capt. Columbus Allen went down Tchoupitoulas
                                street, and Capt. John Anzell's battalion came down Peters street.
                                Capt. Archinard Peck commanded two pieces of artillery, and Capt.
                                Guibet, with a large company, stood ready to protect the arms on the
                                Mississippi, taking his stand at St. Louis and Decatur streets.</p>
                            <p rend="center">STRATEGY USED.</p>
                            <p>The command was given to march. Gen. Ogden led the way. Company C
                                proceeded down the levee. A Louisville and Nashville train pulled
                                along slowly into Canal street and the company marched under its
                                protection, by prearrangement. Suddenly, at Canal street, a signal
                                was given and the freight train moved out rapidly, disclosing to the
                                astonished gaze of the police the whole company drawn up in battle
                                order in Canal street.</p>
                            <p>"Commence firing!" was the command of Gen. Badger, and the citizens
                                took this as their command also, and poured four volleys into the
                                ranks of the police. It was a flank fire and deadly. A score or more
                                toppled over <pb id="VAA3932-246" n="238"/> and the day was won, for
                                the negroes and declared whites who made up the organization were
                                demoralized completely and began to flee. At this moment the other
                                companies poured out from Magazine, Tchoupitoulas and Peters
                                streets, and also began firing.</p>
                            <p>Gen. Behan was by this time in command, as Gen. Ogden's horse had
                                been shot from under him, and as the horse fell he was pitched
                                headlong onto a Tchoupitoulas street banquette, the fall knocking
                                him insensible.</p>
                            <p>The police, as they fled, discarded guns, hats, coats, ammunition,
                                everything which would hamper their speed. They fled into the Custom
                                House and down the streets, many taking refuge in the Third Precinct
                                Police Station, then the state arsenal. Their arms were picked up
                                where they dropped them and were used by their pursuers.</p>
                            <p>Gen. Badger, it is remembered, was really brave, and stood his ground
                                until he toppled over, shot many times and severely wounded. The
                                crowd which had watched the battle, unmindful of its danger, was for
                                killing him, but Capt. Kilpatrick, revolver in one hand, sword in
                                the other, stood with one foot on each side of the General's
                                prostrate body and promised to kill the first who attempted to touch
                                the wounded man. The General escaped, but narowly, for it was
                                remembered that in 1871 he had ordered his police to fire upon an
                                unarmed mass meeting in Jackson Square.</p>
                            <p>When the police had been driven from the field the White League was
                                drawn up in battle line on the neutral ground in Canal street for
                                roll call. Here it was that Toledano was killed, shot from behind,
                                and ap- <pb id="VAA3932-247" n="239"/> parently by some one who had
                                taken refuge in the Custom House.</p>
                            <p>The League then marched to the police stations and turned out the
                                police, took charge of the City Hall and of the government.</p>
                            <p>One of the most astonishing things about the whole battle was the
                                behavior of the crowd. Cheering thousands watched the conflict from
                                every vantage point. They crowded every window, doorway and balcony
                                which offered a view of the scene, and they filled the street at the
                                very edge of the lines of fighters. No one apparently ever thought
                                of danger, but gazed on the battle as if it were a panorama arranged
                                for some great holiday.</p>
                            <p>The newsboys were recklessness personified. They darted in and out
                                between the lines of men and in front of the very guns. When the
                                police fled the newsboys were close behind them, themselves picking
                                up the Winchesters which the frightened constabulary were throwing
                                    aside.<ref id="ref_45" rend="super" target="note_45"

                                    <p>For the detailed account of the stirring events of September
                                        14, 1874, we are indebted to the New Orleans
                                        Times-Democrat.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Thus was broken the backbone of negro and carpetbag rule in the
                                South; and it was not long till Nicholls was installed as Democratic
                                Governor, succeeding Kellogg the carpet-bag Governor. Of the story
                                of September 14th 1874, but little is known to the present
                                generation; indeed, we are advised that the textbooks in the public
                                schools are strangely silent on the subject. The fall of carpet-bag
                                government in the South is an event of as much historical importance
                                as the demolition of <pb id="VAA3932-248" n="240"/> the French
                                Bastile in 1789, and its lesson should be impressed upon the minds
                                of the young, thus inculcating not only a love of liberty but a
                                hatred of oppression.</p>
                            <p>On the spot where the battle took place a monument was erected, some
                                years ago, commemorating the event that gave to Louisiana and the
                                South their political liberty. On the monument is inscribed the
                                names and deeds of the valiant citizens that died for the cause of
                                home government. Annually, on the 14th of September, the people
                                congregate at the monument and, with floral decorations and
                                appropriate ceremonies, indicate to the world that they have
                                forgotten neither the event, so important in its consequences, nor
                                those who perished there.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Webster speaking of England declared, "that her morning drum-beat
                                circles the earth with an unbroken strain of her martial airs," and
                                it has been said of our own country that before the sun sets upon
                                Alaska he has risen upon Maine.</p>
                            <p>This indicates the vast extent of the United States, but gives no
                                adequate conception of the immensity of Alaska alone. It exceeds in
                                its entire area a half million square miles. Its extreme length is
                                about eleven hundred miles; its extreme width about eight hundred.
                                It stretches three hundred and fifty miles beyond Behring <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-249" n="241"/> straits; and borders upon the Arctic
                                ocean for more than a thousand miles. In 1876 it was ceded to the
                                United States for a money payment of seven million two hundred
                                thousand dollars, and, in the month of October of that year, the
                                possession of the country was formally made over to a military force
                                of the United States at New Archangel.</p>
                            <p>Many years ago, sometime in the seventies, I believe, in the midst of
                                a very exciting political campaign, it was announced in the
                                newspapers that on a certain day Daniel W. Voorhees, Thomas A.
                                Hendricks and former governor William Allen, would address a great
                                Democratic rally at Loveland, Ohio. A party of us from Shelbyville
                                decided to attend. We were full to the brim with Democratic
                                enthusiasm and, it was our unanimous conclusion, that no other trio
                                of Democratic statesmen could at any time be found, more capable
                                than this one, of working the complete theoretical demolition of the
                                Republican party. Indeed, we all felt that the majestic oratory of
                                Voorhees, the persuasive eloquence of Hendricks, and the
                                sledge-hammer blows of Rise-up-William Allen&#150;in
                                combination&#151;would leave nothing remaining of the Grand Old
                                Party&#151;save the cellar and the well.</p>
                            <p>It was a beautiful autumn morning when we boarded the train for
                                Loveland via Cincinnati. Our journey the ther was devoid of incident
                                or excitement, except that the enthusiasm increased as we were
                                joined on the train by others whose destination and patriotic
                                purpose were the same as our own. However, there was one exhibition
                                of beautiful irony that I must not omit to mention. There were
                                several ladies in our party, among them a <pb id="VAA3932-250"
                                    n="242"/> charming girl of eighteen summers. She was so
                                exquisitely fascinating in appearance and bearing, that the sight of
                                her could not fail to quicken the pulse of any young gentleman,
                                regardless of his political predilections. When the train stopped at
                                the village of Adams, in Decatur county, she put her head out of the
                                window to see the crowd at the station. Three young men about her
                                own age were standing not far away from the train. One of them,
                                addressing the other two, declared in an audible voice, "Look at the
                                girl with her head out of the window. She is the ugliest girl I ever
                                saw in all my life."</p>
                            <p>We arrived at Loveland in due time&#151;the great crowd had
                                assembled and were waiting to hear the Democratic gospel expounded
                                by three of the party's greatest advocates. The speakers finally
                                arrived and the speaking began. The meeting from a Democratic
                                standpoint was a glorious success, our fondest hopes having been
                                more than realized.</p>
                            <p>The power of Hendricks over a popular audience was marvelous. I have
                                said in another place, referring to Hendricks in the practice of his
                                profession, that he, like Bush, the great Irish lawyer, could "hand
                                up a point of law to the court with as much grace and pliancy of
                                gesture as if he were presenting a court lady with a fan"; it may be
                                said, with truth, that he presented to a popular audience, with
                                equal grace and propriety of gesture, the great truths of
                                Democracy.</p>
                            <p>Hendricks owed much of his power to the charm of his personality. His
                                appeals to the passions and the understanding were equally
                                effective. So magnetic was <pb id="VAA3932-251" n="243"/> he, that
                                he could not open his lips or lift his hand, without instantly
                                engaging the rapt attention of his audience. He possessed in a
                                higher degree than any one I ever heard what might be termed the
                                power of interrogative oratory, bringing forth numerous responses
                                from his audience, after the manner of the old fashioned Methodist
                                camp meeting. For example, Hendricks would say after making an
                                impassioned statement, "I appeal to you, my countrymen, is not that
                                true?" with a response like this: "True as Gospel,
                                Tommy&#151;hit 'em again."</p>
                            <p>The ornate and majestic eloquence of Voorhees deeply stirred the
                                audience. After his merciless excoriations of the Republican party
                                and its leaders, he, like the eagle, "with crimsoned beak and bloody
                                talons, soared aloft and bathed his plumage in the clouds."</p>
                            <p>Voorhees was aggressive. In a legislative body, in joint debate, or
                                in the face of any opposition, he would exhibit what John Randolph
                                called "a talent for turbulence."</p>
                            <p>Rise-up-William Allen portrayed in thunderous tones the inherent and
                                acquired wickedness of the Republican party. His indictment charged
                                that party and its leaders, especially Mr. Seward, with nearly all
                                the offenses known to the catalogue of crime. Among other things, he
                                asserted that the country was indebted to the Democratic party for
                                our vast and valuable territorial acquisitions, made since the
                                adoption of the Federal Constitution. That the Republican party,
                                through one of its leaders, William H. Seward, had expended a vast
                                sum of the people's money, more than seven millions <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-252" n="244"/> of dollars, in the purchase of
                                Alaska, an immense uninhabitable iceberg lying in the shadow of the
                                North Pole, and, at the same time were, and had been for years,
                                engaged in the flagitious occupation of giving as subsidies to
                                corporations, an enormous area of the valuable territory acquired by
                                and through the wisdom, statesmanship, and diplomacy, of the
                                Democratic party.</p>
                            <p>We all know, at this time, that Governor Allen's speech so far as it
                                related to Alaska was based upon a vast amount of misinformation. He
                                certainly had no conception of its enormous wealth in its mines, its
                                vast forests, in the furs of its wild animals, saying nothing of the
                                fish with which its rivers and seas abound. He was equally
                                misinformed as to its climate. That of the Southwest portion is
                                mild, considering its high altitude. The great warm current of the
                                Pacific, sweeping in a northeasterly circuit from the East India
                                Islands and corresponding very much in character and effects to the
                                Gulf stream of the Atlantic, washes its shores and greatly modifies
                                its temperature.</p>
                            <p>Neither in private nor public life did Mr. Seward ever make so good
                                an investment as he made when he purchased Alaska. Considering its
                                enormous wealth, the price he paid for it was, indeed, a mere
                                bagatelle.</p>
                            <p>But one untoward incident marred the pleasure of our day. After the
                                meeting, a very enthusiastic member of our party imbibed too freely
                                and became thoroughly intoxicated. I never heard of his being in
                                this condition before or since. He was an estimable gentleman of
                                intelligence and respectability, and I am quite sure it was an
                                accident. It was well that we were able to conceal <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-253" n="245"/> from the general public the fact of
                                his intoxication. In the then temper of the public mind, a
                                malevolent Republican toxicologist would have taken exquisite
                                delight in declaring that our companion did the best thing possible
                                when he imbibed so freely. He would have said, that as atropine,
                                extracted from the deadly nightshade, is a counter-poison to an
                                overdose of morphia, so whisky is equally efficacious as a
                                counter-poison to an overdose of democracy. But our Republican
                                friends never found it out.</p>
                            <p>It was indeed a glorious day for democracy, but I must frankly
                                confess that it was a cold day for Alaska.</p>

                            <p>Government and laws have much to do with the happiness of the
                                individual citizen. But it has been observed that the bulk of
                                mankind on their part are not excessively curious concerning any
                                theories, so long as they are really happy; and that one sure
                                symptom of an ill-conducted state is the propensity of people to
                                resort to them. We conceive it to be a question of primary
                                importance that there should be a clear and complete recognition of
                                the fact, that societies and laws exist only for the purpose of
                                increasing the sum of private happiness; and, using the wise and
                                sententious utterance of Edmund Burke, that "Governments are
                                practical things, not toys for speculists and demagogues to play
                                with."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-254" n="246"/>
                            <p>We all fully appreciate the absurdity of praising or condemning a
                                constitution in the abstract. We must have an exact and complete
                                knowledge of the people who are to be governed by it&#151;of
                                their intelligence, disposition, temperament and environment, before
                                we can pronounce a constitution to be good; and we may accept,
                                without question, Macaulay's definition of a good government as
                                being one that, like a good coat, fits the body for which it was
                                designed. He affirms what is obvious, that one who says a
                                constitution is good without an exact knowledge of the people to be
                                governed by it, judges as absurdly as a "tailor who should measure
                                the Belvidere Apollo for the clothes of all his customers." In the
                                same connection, he pronounces as equally ridiculous to all men of
                                sense and candor, the demagogues who wished to see Portugal a
                                republic, and the wise critics who revile the Virginians for not
                                having instituted a peerage. He declares that "From the despotism of
                                St. Petersburg to the democracy of Washington, there is scarcely a
                                form of government which might not, at least, in some hypothetical
                                case, be the best possible."</p>
                            <p>The Englishman boldly asserts that the English constitution is the
                                perfection of political wisdom, because it contains the virtues of
                                monarchy, aristocracy and democracy, without the faults which would
                                attend any of these varieties of government unmodified by the other.
                                Goldsmith in his day pronounced the English government the finest
                                model of civil society&#151;one "in which subordination and
                                liberty were blended in just proportions."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-255" n="247"/>
                            <p>The historian of the period declares that the form of government
                                instituted at Philadelphia is in its groundwork and principal
                                features a restriction and perfecting of the ancient constitutional
                                liberties of England.</p>
                            <p>We learn from "The Federalist," that inexhaustible reservoir of
                                political wisdom, that the ideal system is one which combines the
                                energy of government with the security of private rights. And where
                                should the student of the science of government turn, if not to the
                                Federalist? It was said of Alexander Hamilton, its principal author,
                                that his industry was marvelous, and his learning equal to the
                                creative faculty of his mind; that he possessed in the highest
                                degree the rare faculty of being able to see consequents yet dormant
                                in their principals.</p>
                            <p>It has been asserted by a high English authority<ref id="ref_46"
                                    rend="super" target="note_46" targOrder="U">17</ref> that his
                                writings exhibit an extent and precision of information, a
                                profundity of research, and an accurate-ness of understanding which
                                would have done honor to the most illustrious statesmen of ancient
                                or modern times&#151;that for comprehension of design, strength,
                                clearness and simplicity they have no parallel. Talleyrand called
                                the attention of European statesmen to the merits of the Federalist
                                as a "copious source of correct maxims and profound thought;" and
                                Guizot says, that in the application of elementary principles of
                                government to practical administration, it was the greatest work
                                known to him. Guizot adds, "There is not in the Constitution of the
                                United States an element of order, <pb id="VAA3932-256" n="248"/> of
                                force, of duration, which Hamilton did not powerfully contribute to
                                introduce into it and to cause to predominate."<note id="note_46"

                            <p>In government, durability is one of the chief elements of strength,
                                for it has been observed that it is the experience of mankind that
                                nothing is either feared or loved but what is likely to endure.</p>
                            <p>When Montesquieu declared that a republic was practicable only in a
                                small country with a very limited population, he doubtless used the
                                word as being synonymous with democracy. As now understood, there is
                                indeed a vast difference between a democracy and a republic. A pure
                                democracy is a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who
                                assemble and administer the government in person. Of such
                                democracies it has been said "that they have ever been spectacles of
                                turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with
                                personal security, or the rights of property; and have, in general,
                                been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their
                                deaths. Theoretic politicians who have patronized this species of
                                government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a
                                perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same
                                time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions,
                                their opinions, and their passions."</p>
                            <p>A republic is a government in which the scheme of representation
                                takes place; and the two great points of difference between a
                                democracy and a republic, as pointed out by the Federalist, are,
                                first, the delegation of the government, in the latter, to a small
                                number of citizens elected by the rest; secondly, the greater number
                                    <pb id="VAA3932-257" n="249"/> of citizens, and greater sphere
                                of country, over which the latter may be extended.</p>
                            <p>There are many words and phrases the meaning of which are by some
                                imperfectly understood. Among the number are "civil liberty" and <hi
                                    rend="i">"liberty"</hi> as contradistinguished from <hi rend="i"
                                    >license</hi> or <hi rend="i">licentiousness.</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>Liberty and authority are inherent enemies and constantly confront
                                one another. A free and good government has been defined to be that
                                in which the two are brought the most nearly into harmonious action;
                                "When there is as much liberty and as little restraint imposed on it
                                by authority as is compatible with the peace and safety of the
                                whole, and of each individual. When this practical balance is
                                obtained, it is designated by the phrase <hi rend="i">civil
                                    liberty.</hi>"</p>
                            <p>Bishop Butler, in a sermon preached before the House of Lords,
                                clearly defines <hi rend="i">licentiousness.</hi> He declares it to
                                be such an excess of liberty as is of the same nature with tyranny.
                                He inquires, "What is the difference between them but that one is
                                lawless power exercised under pretense of authority, or by being
                                invested with it; the other, lawless power exercised under the
                                pretense of liberty, or without any pretense at all? A people, then,
                                must always be less free, in proportion as they are more licentious;
                                licentiousness being not only different from liberty, but distinctly
                                contrary to it, a direct breach upon it."</p>
                            <p>Among the governments instituted among men, that of Lycurgus is
                                unique. He seems to have ignored the fact that governments were made
                                for men and not men for governments; and the observation is
                                obviously true <pb id="VAA3932-258" n="250"/> that instead of
                                adapting the constitution to the people, he distorted the minds of
                                the people to suit the constitution. His avowed purpose was the
                                conquest of luxury and the extermination of the love of riches, and,
                                to this end, he introduced the use of public tables where all were
                                to eat in common of the same meat, and such kinds of it as were
                                appointed by law. He divided the lands equally among the people and
                                said, "How like is Laconia to an estate newly divided among many
                                brothers?" He stopped the coinage of gold and silver and required
                                that they should make use of iron money only; and then to a great
                                quantity and weight of this he assigned but a small value.</p>
                            <p>It was evidently not known, in that age and generation, that the most
                                pernicious of all legislation is that which tampers with the
                                standard of value, whether it be in the interest of the debtor
                                class, or for any other purpose.</p>
                            <p>A great Englishman, in commenting upon the government of Athens,
                                refers inferentially to the laws established by the Spartan law
                                giver. He says:</p>
                            <p>"At Athens the laws did not constantly interfere with the tastes of
                                the people. The children were not taken from their parents by that
                                universal step-mother, the state. They were not starved into
                                thieves, or tortured into bullies; there was no established table at
                                which every one must dine, no established style in which every one
                                must converse. An Athenian might eat whatever he could afford to
                                buy, and talk as long as he could find people to listen. The
                                government did not tell the people what opinions they were to hold,
                                or what songs they <pb id="VAA3932-259" n="251"/> were to sing.
                                Freedom produced excellence. Thus philosophy took its origin. Thus
                                were produced those models of poetry, of oratory, and of the arts,
                                which scarcely fall short of the standard of ideal excellence.
                                Nothing is more conducive to happiness than the free exercise of the
                                mind, in pursuits congenial to it."</p>
                            <p>We can all agree that the eminent French political philosopher<ref

                                spoke the truth when he declared that the Americans had the chances
                                of birth in their favor, and that their forefathers imported that
                                equality of conditions into the country, whence the democratic
                                republic very naturally took its rise. He says: "When I reflect upon
                                the consequences of this primary circumstance, methinks I see the
                                destiny of America embodied in the first Puritan who landed on those
                                shores just as the human race was represented by the first man.<note

                                midst of hostile nations, which they were obliged to subjugate
                                before they could flourish in their place. * * * But North America
                                was only inhabited by wandering tribes, who took no thought of the
                                natural riches of the soil, and that vast country was still,
                                properly speaking, an empty continent, a desert land awaiting its
                                inhabitants."</p>
                            <p>To us, the grave and majestic style of this eminent philosophical
                                writer, is singularly enchanting. He continues:</p>
                            <p>"At that time North America was discovered, as if it had been kept in
                                reserve by the Deity, and had just risen from beneath the waters of
                                the deluge."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-260" n="252"/>
                            <p>After tracing the character of the American Indians and expressing
                                his positive conviction that another people, more civilized and more
                                advanced in all respects, had preceded them in the same regions, he
                                continues:</p>
                            <p>"How strange does it appear that nations have existed, and afterward
                                so completely disappeared from the earth, that the remembrance of
                                their very name is effaced; their languages are lost; their glory is
                                vanished like a sound without an echo; but perhaps there is not one
                                which has not left behind it a tomb in memory of its passage. The
                                most durable monument of human labor is that which recalls the
                                wretchedness and nothingness of man."</p>
                            <p>One need not be deeply versed in statecraft to see clearly that the
                                constitution of a state, and the due distribution of its powers, is
                                a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill; that it
                                requires a deep knowledge of human nature and of human
                                necessities.</p>
                            <p>We have already noted the observation that the government at
                                Washington in its groundwork and principal features is a restriction
                                and perfecting of the ancient constitutional liberties in England.
                                It is very doubtful, however, whether in all of its features our
                                government is an improvement upon the English system. In England,
                                there is no doubt where the real sovereignty lies. The actual
                                ministers of the day must possess the confidence of the House of
                                Commons. The real strength of popular government lies in the
                                ultimate supremacy of that body.</p>
                            <p>It is conceded that one of the most difficult <pb id="VAA3932-261"
                                    n="253"/> problems of government is how to provide for the
                                devolution of political power, and it is said that no other question
                                is so generally and justly applied as the test of a working
                                constitution. If the transmission works smoothly, the constitution,
                                whatever may be its other defects, may be at least pronounced
                                stable. The real change of power occurs on a change of ministry. A
                                British ministry must resign or dissolve when it is defeated in the
                                House of Commons, and if after a dissolution it is beaten again, it
                                must resign without alternative. The out-going premier names his
                                successor, who must be a recognized leader of his successful rivals.
                                We read that recent practice goes far to establish the rule that a
                                minister beaten at the hustings should resign at once, without
                                waiting for a formal defeat in the House of Commons.</p>
                            <p>The change of power in the United States is accomplished by a very
                                different and much more tardy process. The president is at once king
                                and prime minister. His crown is rigidly fixed for four years; after
                                four years he ceases to reign. No hostile vote can affect his power
                                as the head of the administration. But the day of his political
                                demise is known from the first day of his government, and almost
                                before he begins to reign the political forces of the country are
                                shaping out a new struggle for the succession. Further, a change of
                                government in America means a change of almost the entire
                                administration; in England, the change of power affects
                                comparatively few personal interests, and absorbs the attention of
                                the country for a comparatively short <pb id="VAA3932-262" n="254"/>
                                space of time. The commotion caused by a presidential election in
                                the United States is infinitely greater than that caused by a
                                general election in England.</p>
                            <p>In this country, the president is not obliged to abandon his supreme
                                power by so trivial a circumstance as an adverse vote in the House
                                of Representatives, or even by an overwhelming defeat at the
                                hustings.</p>
                            <p>It is evident that the English constitution is more democratic than
                                the American, in the sense that the popular will can more speedily
                                be brought to bear upon the government.</p>
                            <p>The general excellence of our system of government and our political
                                institutions is asserted by all patriotic Americans; but it must be
                                conceded that, at least in the matter of the devolution of power,
                                the English system is vastly superior to ours.</p>
                            <p>An eminent Englishman declared not long ago that the weak points of
                                the American constitution are beginning to appear, and he attributes
                                them to the "deference to the false diagnosis of Montesquieu which
                                entered into its construction, and is now interfering with its
                                working as a republican counterpart of the constitution of Great
                                Britain." We know full well that there are inherent defects in all
                                governments and in all constitutions&#151;that perfection in
                                them is unattainable, as it is in the individuals who devise and
                                construct them.</p>
                            <p>We conceive that one of the greatest curses to our country is class
                                legislation&#151;laws which either directly or indirectly are
                                meant to favor particular classes of the community. The doctrine of
                                protection which was <pb id="VAA3932-263" n="255"/> not recognized
                                or contemplated by the framers of the constitution, but had its
                                insidious birth long after the adoption of that sacred instrument,
                                is a striking example. There is something in a name. The word
                                "protection," at once gentle and emollient, was selected to cover
                                this nefarious scheme. Artifices of this kind have long been
                                practiced. The Athenians frequently qualified the harshness of
                                things by giving them softer and politer names&#151;for example,
                                they called harlots mistresses; and it was Solon, we believe, who
                                first distinguished the canceling of debts by the name of a
                                discharge.</p>
                            <p>This policy of protection has resulted in the accumulation of large
                                fortunes in the hands of a few individuals and, at the same time, in
                                the partial impoverishment of the masses of the people. The doctrine
                                has at last become so odious to a vast majority of the American
                                people that, in some quarters, it has become a subject of serious
                                consideration whether the word itself, "protection," should not be
                                ruthlessly stricken from all American lexicons. It would almost seem
                                as if the authors and promoters of this infamous doctrine had
                                adopted the dreadful maxim of Michiavelli, that in great affairs men
                                are not to be wicked by halves.</p>
                            <p>Protection has not only enabled a few individuals to suddenly acquire
                                large fortunes, at the expense of their neighbors, but it has been
                                the means of introducing baleful luxury&#151;a style of living
                                even beyond the means of those who adopt it, and spreading through
                                all classes. It is a fact, confirmed by the observation of every
                                one, that men who have accumulated wealth slowly, by <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-264" n="256"/> labor of mind or body, do not spend
                                it extravagantly. We are prone to disregard the lessons of history.
                                The luxury which corrupted and destroyed the republic of Rome was
                                the result of large fortunes suddenly acquired by the plunder of
                                provinces, the conquest of unjust wars.</p>
                            <p>A question now under consideration by the American people is an
                                amendment to the constitution, providing for the election of United
                                States senators by the people, instead of by the legislatures of the
                                respective states. We have grave doubts as to the propriety and
                                wisdom of the proposed amendment, notwithstanding the popular clamor
                                for it is largely from the political party to which we belong.</p>
                            <p>To the private citizen, who neither holds nor seeks to hold any
                                public office and who has no "ax to grind," it would seem that two
                                dangers confront this country; one is a vast consolidated power at
                                Washington, controlling the internal affairs of states, assuming
                                doubtful powers under the constitution, and even others on the
                                ground of inherent rights of sovereignty; the other, is a growing
                                tendency to convert our Federal Republic into a pure Democracy. Of
                                such Democracies we have already noted the historical fact "that
                                they have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have
                                ever been incompatible with personal security, or the rights of
                                property; and have, in general, been as short in their lives, as
                                they have been violent in their deaths." The opinion of Montesquieu
                                that such a government is practicable only in a small country, with
                                a limited <pb id="VAA3932-265" n="257"/> population, is confirmed by
                                the reason and observation of every reflecting man of ordinary
                                intelligence.</p>
                            <p>European statesmen declare that in the United States constitutional
                                progress is hampered by the necessity of having every amendment
                                ratified by the separate vote of three-fourths of the states. The
                                whole world has been electrified by the marvelous constructive
                                capacity and prescience, exhibited by the fathers of the republic.
                                It was said of some of them that they possessed in the highest
                                degree the rare faculty of being able to see consequents yet dormant
                                in their principals. Is it not a reasonable presumption that the
                                framers of the constitution made amendments difficult, in
                                anticipation of efforts that might possibly be made, by visionary
                                sophists or interested agitators, to tear down the very pillars upon
                                which the edifice rests? If the proposed amendment be adopted it
                                will amount to a fundamental change in the form and character of our
                                government&#151;in fact, to revolution; and will be a gigantic
                                stride in the direction of the obliteration of state lines ending,
                                perhaps, in a centralized despotism at Washington.</p>
                            <p>The autonomy and indestructibility of the states were insisted upon
                                as conditions precedent to the adoption and ratification of the
                                constitution&#151;and, without the assurance that these would be
                                preserved, the constitution would have failed. They were informed
                                that "the proposed constitution, so far from implying an abolition
                                of the state governments, makes them constituent parts of the
                                national sovereignty, by <hi rend="i">allowing them&#151;direct
                                    representation in the senate,</hi> and leaves in their
                                possession <pb id="VAA3932-266" n="258"/> certain exclusive and very
                                important portions of sovereign power."</p>
                            <p>The present method of electing senators has answered admirably the
                                purposes of government and society. Why pull down the edifice, why
                                destroy this ancient landmark, with the view of experimenting with a
                                system which is wholly untried and upon which great constructive
                                statesmen have placed the seal of their reprobation? We know how
                                easy it is to pull down and destroy. A mob can do this. It has been
                                well and truly said that the shallowest understanding, the rudest
                                hand, is more than equal to that task.</p>
                            <p>"Rage and frenzy will pull down more in half an hour, than prudence,
                                deliberation, and foresight can build up in a hundred years."</p>
                            <p>We are reminded of the solemn admonition of Burke upon a like
                                occasion: "No man should approach to look into the defects or
                                corruptions of the state but with due caution; that he should never
                                dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion; that he should
                                approach the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father, with
                                pious awe and trembling solicitude. * * * We are taught to look with
                                horror on those children of their country, who are prompt rashly to
                                hack that aged parent in pieces, and put him into the kettle of
                                magicians, in hopes that by their poisoned weeds, and wild
                                incantations, they may regenerate the paternal constitution, and
                                renovate their father's life."</p>
                            <p>We know that professional politicians, seeking political preferment
                                and fond of distinguishing themselves, cannot always be relied upon
                                to resist violent innovation.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-267" n="259"/>
                            <p>If they accomplish their purpose what do they care whether it be by
                                the "thunderbolt of despotism, or by the earthquake of popular
                                commotion?"</p>
                            <p>In this the year of our Lord 1912, occurs the quadrennial honey-moon
                                of the politician's fondness for the dear people. During this
                                delightful period, his love and tenderness are not excelled by those
                                of the bride-groom who takes to his bosom his young and blushing
                                bride. With many, his blandishments and cajoleries are effective.
                                With what unction and dramatic effect will he declare upon the
                                hustings: "It should be <hi rend="i">your</hi> province to determine
                                who shall be United States Senator; he should be elected <hi

                            <p>We have in mind one of the most illustrious statesmen of ancient or
                                modern times&#151;a man of large observation and profound
                                erudition. Note his words of wisdom:</p>
                            <p>"A dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of
                                zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidding
                                appearance of zeal for the firmness and efficiency of government. *
                                * * Of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the
                                greatest number have begun their career, by paying an obsequious
                                court to the people; commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants."</p>
                            <p>We all know how difficult it is to overcome what is known abroad as a
                                peculiar American superstition&#151;that the correctness of a
                                belief is decided by the number of people who can be induced to
                                adopt it&#151;in short, that the truth is a matter of
                                majorities, derived by a simple arithmetical calculation.</p>
                            <p>Will any one seriously contend that several hundred <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-268" n="260"/> thousand voters in the State of
                                Indiana are more capable than the one hundred and fifty members of
                                the General Assembly to select a proper person to discharge the high
                                and important duties of a United States Senator? To give a concrete
                                illustration: Suppose a senatorial election should be held
                                tomorrow&#151;a free for all contest if you please, who and
                                where is the individual that would receive more votes for that great
                                office than the redoubtable Lew Shank, now mayor of Indianapolis?
                                Can you conceive of a General Assembly, either Democratic or
                                Republican, that would elect him?</p>
                            <p>We are merely asking questions&#151;a mode much used in former
                                times, and still permissible, of stating the most decided
                                opinions.</p>
                            <p>A vast majority of the American people believe that no honest
                                employment is disgraceful; but, it is no less true, that each
                                individual has his own peculiar adaptation&#151;in other words,
                                it is every man to his trade. The lawyer, who would presume to
                                instruct a farmer of long experience, in the work and management of
                                his farm, would only make himself ridiculous; and no less so, was
                                the silly rhetorician who went all the way to Carthage to instruct
                                Hannibal in the art of war. We all respect the farmer and his
                                occupation, and well we may, for he is indispensable to our
                                existence; but it would be asking too much to demand that he should
                                also be an adept in state-craft and diplomacy. This principle is
                                corroborated, if indeed it needs corroboration, by the book of
                                Ecclesiasticus, presumably written by Solomon. We quote from chapter
                                28, verses 24 and 25: "The wisdom of a learned man cometh by
                                opportunity of leisure: and <pb id="VAA3932-269" n="261"/> he that
                                hath little business shall become wise. How can he get wisdom that
                                holdeth the plow, and that glorieth in the goad; that driveth oxen;
                                and is occupied in their labor; and whose talk is of bullocks?"
                                Again, verse 33: "They shall not be sought for in public counsel,
                                nor sit in the congregation: they shall not sit on the judge's seat,
                                nor understand the sentence of judgment; they cannot declare justice
                                and judgment and they shall not be found where parables are
                                spoken."</p>
                            <p>In some particulars other governments are in advance of our own.
                                Andrew D. White, the eminent publicist, who for many years
                                represented this country as ambassador at the courts of Europe, had
                                ample opportunities for observation and comparison. He declares that
                                as a result of such observance and reflection during a long life
                                which touched public men and measures in wide variety, he would
                                desire for our country three things above all others, to supplement
                                our existing American civilization: from Great Britian her
                                administration of criminal justice; from Germany her theatre; and
                                from any European country save Russia, Spain and Turkey, its
                                government of cities: He says that in Germany, the theater and its
                                surroundings are, in the main, free from the abuses and miseries of
                                the stage in English-speaking lands.</p>
                            <p>No fact is more conclusively established by history than that the
                                most common and durable source of controversy and contention has
                                been the unequal distribution of property. "Those who hold and those
                                who are <pb id="VAA3932-270" n="262"/> without property have ever
                                formed distinct interests in society. Those who are creditors and
                                those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination."</p>
                            <p>One of the most difficult problems that confronts our country is the
                                ever recurring controversy between capital and labor.</p>
                            <p>The same conditions exist in other countries. Emperor William
                                expresses his feelings on the subject with much emphasis. He
                                declared to an eminent American not so very long ago: "You in
                                America may do what you please, but I will not suffer capitalists in
                                Germany to suck the life out of the workingmen and then fling them
                                like squeezed lemon-skins into the gutter." No question can possibly
                                arise, the solution of which, requires greater wisdom and
                                forbearance. It is the plain, unvarnished truth that the fault is
                                not all on either side. Capital justly complains of the destruction
                                of property; labor pleads in mitigation, if not in justification,
                                the relentless demands and exactions of capital. We believe that an
                                absolutely perfect solution of this troublesome problem awaits,
                                either the recognition and practical application by both parties of
                                the Golden Rule, or the perfectibility of man.</p>
                            <p>There was a time in our early colonial history when the inhabitants
                                of America were contemptously regarded by Europeans. It is an
                                historical fact, that even men admired as profound philosophers did,
                                in direct terms, attribute to the inhabitants of Europe a physical
                                and mental superiority; and did gravely assert that all animals, and
                                with them the human species, degenerated <pb id="VAA3932-271"
                                    n="263"/> in America&#151;that even dogs ceased to bark

                                hardly necessary to say that this theory has long since been
                                abandoned. The prowess and physical endurance of Americans have been
                                illustrated on many battle fields. On the score of mental
                                inferiority it is sufficient to recite a single fact&#151;that
                                after the treaty of Ghent the British House of Lords solemnly
                                declared that the negotiations for peace bore the stamp of American
                                    superiority.<note id="note_48" place="unspecified"

                            <p>More than a century ago a great statesman declared that "To judge
                                from the history of mankind, we shall be compelled to conclude, that
                                the fiery and destructive passions of war reign in the human breast
                                with much more powerful sway, than the mild and beneficent
                                sentiments of peace; and that to model our political systems upon
                                speculations of lasting tranquillity, would be to calculate on the
                                weaker springs of the human character."</p>
                            <p>Peace conferences at The Hague, in which the great countries of the
                                world have participated, the pending Peace treaties, and other
                                circumstances, would, perhaps, warrant a modification of this
                                positive view.</p>
                            <p>The consideration of the subject of Peace and War naturally suggests
                                the name of one of the most famous men of the seventeenth
                                century&#151;Hugo Grotius. He was born at Delft April 10, 1583,
                                and died at Rostock August 28, 1645. Shortly after he attained <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-272" n="264"/> his majority he became an active
                                participant in the disputes between the Remonstrants and their
                                opponents and, in 1613, when these controversies were at their
                                height in Holland, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life. His
                                escape from imprisonment was marvelous. His wife managed to have him
                                carried out of the castle in a chest used for the conveyance of
                                books and linen, while she remained in prison in his stead. Her
                                devotion was applauded and she was finally set at liberty.</p>
                            <p>Grotius was a man of varied interests and accomplishments. To the
                                talents of a most able statesman, he united deep and extensive
                                learning. He was a profound and enlightened theologian, a
                                distinguished scholar, an acute philosopher, a judicious historian
                                and a splendid jurist. So great and varied was his learning that he
                                was characterized as a "monster of erudition."</p>
                            <p>His greatest work was his treatise on Peace and War which was
                                published at Paris in 1625. It was soon generally received as
                                authority by professors of the Continental Universities, having been
                                translated into all the languages of Europe. He was everywhere
                                treated with profound respect as the founder of the modern law of
                                nations which is distinguished from what formerly bore that name by
                                its more continual reference to that of nature. Hallam declares that
                                no one had before gone to the foundations of international law so as
                                to raise a complete and consistent superstructure. The motive
                                assigned for this great undertaking is the noblest. "I saw," he
                                says, "in the whole Christian world a license of fighting, at which
                                even barbarians might blush; wars begun on trifling pretexts, or
                                none at all, and carried <pb id="VAA3932-273" n="265"/> on without
                                reverence for any divine or human law, as if that one declaration of
                                war let loose every crime.</p>
                            <p>Our able and distinguished publicist Andrew D. White, who was the
                                President of the American delegation to the Peace Conference at The
                                Hague in 1899, declared that "More than ever it is apparent to me
                                that of all books ever written&#151;not claiming divine
                                inspiration&#151;the great work of Grotius on 'War and Peace'
                                has been of most benefit to mankind. Our work here (at The Hague
                                Peace Conference) at the end of the nineteenth century, is the
                                direct result of his, at the beginning of the seventeenth." Mr.
                                White declared that Grotius had long been to him almost an object of
                                idolatry, and his main works a subject of earnest
                                study&#151;that there were few men in history whom he so deeply
                                venerated.</p>
                            <p>It was indeed a most felicitous thought of Mr. White which impelled
                                him on the 6th day of June, 1899., to write a private letter to the
                                Secretary of State suggesting that the American delegation to The
                                Hague conference be authorized to lay a wreath of silver and gold
                                upon the tomb of Grotius at Delft, "not only as a tribute to the man
                                who set in motion the ideas which, nearly three hundred years later,
                                have led to the assembling of this conference, but as an indication
                                of our gratitude to the Netherlands Government for its hospitality
                                and the admirable provision it has made for our work here, and also
                                as a sign of good will towards the older governments of the world on
                                the occasion of their first meeting with delegates from the new
                                world, in a conference treating of matters most important to all
                                nations."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-274" n="266"/>
                            <p>On the 19th of June Mr. White received a hearty telegram from the
                                Secretary of State authorizing him to order the wreath of silver and
                                gold to be placed on the tomb of Grotius. He at once telegraphed and
                                wrote to Berlin giving full instructions on the subject, having
                                determined, as he said, that the tribute should be worthy of our
                                country, of its object, and of the occasion. After a conference it
                                was decided that the Grotius celebration should be had on July 4th
                                at Delft&#151;that the ceremony should occur in the great church
                                at eleven o'clock, with sundry speeches, and that at half past
                                twelve the American delegation should give a luncheon to all the
                                invited guests in the town hall opposite. On June 22 the American
                                delegation met and chose Mr. White for their orator at the
                                approaching Grotius festival. On July 2 Major Allen, military
                                attaché of the American embassy at Berlin arrived bringing the
                                Grotius wreath. It was most satisfactory. It is thus described by
                                Mr. White: "The wreath is very large, being made up, on one side, of
                                a laurel branch with leaves of frosted silver and berries of gold,
                                and, on the other, of an oak branch with silver leaves and gold
                                acorn, both boughs being tied together at the bottom by a large knot
                                of ribbon in silver gilded, bearing the arms of the Netherlands and
                                the United States on enameled shields, and an inscription as
                                follows: <q rend="block" direct="unspecified">
                                    <p rend="center">"To the Memory of Hugo Grotius;<lb/> In

                            <p>"It is a superb piece of work and its ebony cast, with silver clasps,
                                and bearing a silver shield with suitable inscription, is also
                                perfect; the whole thing attracts most favorable attention."</p>
                            <p>At the appointed time, July 4th the American delegation invited their
                                colleagues to celebrate our national anniversary at the tomb of
                                Grotius, first in the great church, and afterward in the town hall
                                at Delft. The duty of laying the wreath upon the tomb and making the
                                address with reference to it, was intrusted to Mr. White, the
                                president of the American delegation. Speeches were also made by
                                President Low of Columbia University, De Beaufort the minister of
                                foreign affairs of the Netherlands, Mr. Asser one of their leading
                                jurists, by the burgomaster of Delft, and by Baron de Bildt chairman
                                of the Swedish delegation and minister at Rome. The latter read a
                                telegram from the King of Sweden referring to Grotius's relations to
                                the Swedish diplomatic service. A very large audience was present,
                                embracing the ambassadors and principal members of the conference,
                                the Netherlands ministers of state, professors of the various
                                universities of the Netherlands, and a large body of the other
                                invited guests. The music of the chimes, of the organ, and of the
                                royal choir of one hundred voices, is said to have been most
                                impressive.</p>
                            <p>This beautiful and well deserved tribute to Grotius, paid nearly
                                three hundred years after he had passed away, indicates very clearly
                                that truly great men are not soon forgotten.</p>

                            <p>The subjects of the "Preacher in Politics" and "Church and State"
                                seem just now to be uppermost in the public mind.</p>
                            <p>We have a profound respect for the minister of the Gospel and the
                                great and holy cause which he is presumed to represent; but have
                                never been especially infatuated either with political theologians
                                or theological politicians.</p>
                            <p>Politics and the pulpit are absolutely incompatible.</p>
                            <p>Everyone has, or thinks he has, an understanding with God as to his
                                own particular case; but it will not be denied that, in the interest
                                of the cause of religion, the harmony and growth of the church are
                                of paramount importance. If the leader of his flock engages actively
                                in partisan politics, it works an injury to his church and the cause
                                of religion in two ways; it embitters those of his membership who do
                                not agree with him, and repels many outsiders from entering the
                                church who would otherwise do so. We are convinced that there are
                                myriads of people in the last named class.</p>
                            <p>The life and occupation of the minister are not such as would
                                naturally fit him for solving abstruse problems in Legislation and
                                Government, and being unacquainted with the world and inexperienced
                                in all its affairs, he has nothing of politics but the passions they
                                excite, which are usually characterized by intensity, and oftentimes
                                by acrimony.</p>
                            <p>From the very nature of the calling of the minister, he is subjected
                                to some disadvantages which are not <pb id="VAA3932-277" n="269"/>
                                encountered in other professions. He has not the benefit of the
                                wholesome and liberalizing effect which invariably results from the
                                attrition of mind with mind. "What he says goes." Occasionally, we
                                find one who becomes narrow, intolerant, and presumptuous, who can
                                exercise no patience with those who differ with him in opinion,
                                being thoroughly saturated with the doctrine that orthodoxy is my
                                doxy, and heterodoxy is your doxy. It was said that Dr. O. an
                                eminent clergyman, had an extraordinary way of asserting himself.
                                After his death a legend arose that on his arrival in the New
                                Jerusalem, being presented to St. Paul he said: "Sir, I have derived
                                both pleasure and profit from your writings, and have commended them
                                to my congregation."</p>
                            <p>The minister in discharging the duties of his office&#151;giving
                                consolation to the sick and dying, and those in bereavement and
                                distress, is indeed performing an holy office; but these duties do
                                not invest him with the ability to solve the varied and intricate
                                problems of government, and are alike remote from politics, law,
                                statecraft and diplomacy.</p>
                            <p>Some years ago, an incident occurred which illustrates the agility
                                with which a minister may pass from the domain of the church and
                                religion to that of partizan politics. In opening with prayer the
                                National Convention of one of the great political parties in this
                                country, he said:</p>
                            <p>"Grant, O Lord, that the ticket here to be nominated may command a
                                majority of the suffrages of the American people."</p>
                            <p>The dear brother did not yet know who would be <pb id="VAA3932-278"
                                    n="270"/> nominated, nor what principles would be enunciated in
                                the platform. Waiving the question of irreverence and impropriety,
                                he certainly exhibited great liberality, and a most accommodating
                                spirit.</p>
                            <p>It is the men who are most estranged by the political activities of
                                the minister. Women take politics less seriously, and the influence
                                of religion over their minds is generally supreme. The spiritual
                                necessities of the two sexes seem to be somewhat at variance.</p>

                                the destiny of life. Lavater, on the other hand, treated his Savior
                                as a friend, to be imitated lovingly and without envy, whose merits
                                he recognized and valued highly and whom from that very reason, he
                                strove to copy and even to equal."</p>
                            <p>The clergyman may in some sense be regarded as the terrestrial agent
                                or representative of the Savior, and it will require very little
                                perspicacity, indeed, to see the inevitable effect of his "getting
                                out in the district," or from his own pulpit, denouncing with
                                intense earnestness and sometimes with bitterness, the political
                                sentiments and beliefs of members of his own congregation, and of
                                those on the outside who under other circumstances would become
                                members.</p>
                            <p>The subject under consideration involves the same old question of the
                                separation of church and state. "When a religion founds its empire
                                upon the desire of immortality, which lives in every human heart,"
                                says De Tocqueville, "it may aspire to universal dominion; <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-279" n="271"/> but when it connects itself with a
                                government, it must necessarily adopt maixims which are only
                                applicable to certain nations. * * * As long as a religion rests
                                upon those sentiments which are the consolation of all affliction it
                                may attract the affections of mankind. But if it be mixed up with
                                the bitter passions of the world, it may be constrained to defend
                                allies whom its interests, and not the principle of love, have given
                                to it. * * * The church cannot share the temporal power of the
                                state, without being the object of a portion of that animosity which
                                the latter excites. * * * When religion clings to the interest of
                                the world it becomes almost as fragile as the powers of the earth.
                                It is the only one of them all which can hope for immortality; but
                                if it be connected with their ephemeral authority, it shares their
                                fortunes, and may fall with those transient passions which support
                                them for a day. * * * The unbelievers of Europe attack the
                                Christians as their political opponents rather than as their
                                religious adversaries; they hate the Christian religion as the
                                opinion of a party, much more than as an error of belief; and they
                                reject the clergy less because they are the representatives of the
                                Divinity than because they are the allies of authority."</p>

                                liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion by
                                this confusion of duties. Those who quit their proper characters to
                                assume what does not belong to them, are, for the greater part,
                                ignorant both of the character they leave, and the character they
                                assume. * * * Surely the church is a place where one day's truce
                                ought to be allowed to the dissensions and the animosities of
                                mankind."</p>

                            <p>William Maxwell Evarts was a great lawyer, orator, statesman and
                                diplomatist, developed during the Civil War period. As war forms the
                                soldier, so the art of oratory flourishes to most advantage in times
                                of war, turbulence and civil commotion. One essential requisite for
                                the exhibition of great oratorical power is that the subject of the
                                oration must be of adequate importance. Many subjects of this kind
                                arose during and for a number of years immediately succeeding our
                                Civil War. "If there was a government in the world free from
                                commotions and disturbances," says Tacitus, "the profession of
                                oratory would there be as useless as that of medicine to the sound,
                                and as the physician would have little practice or profit among the
                                healthy and strong, so neither would the orator have much business
                                where obedience and good manners universally prevail."</p>
                            <p>The great triumvirate, Calhoun, Clay and Webster (I name them
                                alphabetically) attained eminence during the thirty years
                                intervening between 1820 and 1850. It is true that our country was
                                engaged in actual war only <pb id="VAA3932-281" n="273"/> during a
                                small portion of this period, but the aggressive agitation of the
                                abolitionists on account of their real or pretended love and
                                sympathy for the Southern negro continued incessantly during those
                                three decades, thus keeping the country in a condition of constant
                                turmoil, excitement and commotion.</p>
                            <p>To what extent their hatred of the Southern white man contributed to
                                this prolonged controversy, has ceased to be an important
                                    inquiry.<ref id="ref_49" rend="super" target="note_49"
                                    targOrder="U">20</ref> If it so contributed, it was not the
                                first time in the history of the world that the reformer mixed his
                                love of man with the hate of men. This question arose from time to
                                time in protean shapes; and it was largely the discussion of this
                                subject, and the important legal and constitutional questions
                                growing out of it, that developed those three great statesmen and
                                    orators.<note id="note_49" place="unspecified" anchored="yes">

                                    <p>It is one of the marvels of the age in which we live, that
                                        the bitter and vindictive agitators of New England should
                                        have been so entirely oblivious of the fact, that their
                                        ancestors were responsible for bringing slavery to this
                                        continent, and that the pockets of some of them became
                                        plethoric with gold, derived from the unholy slave trade.
                                        Little did they anticipate that some of their descendants,
                                        inheritors of this filthy lucre, would in time become such
                                        ardent philanthropists.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Evarts was born in Boston, February 6th, 1818, educated at Yale where
                                he graduated in 1837. Three years later he was admitted to the New
                                York bar, where for nearly half a century he held a distinguished
                                place. His knowledge of the principles of law and of constitutional
                                government, led to his selection as counsel for President Johnson at
                                the impeachment trial in 1868. Differing in temperament and in
                                manner from Judge <pb id="VAA3932-282" n="274"/> Curtis, his
                                associate counsel in this case, it was said, "that the two seemed
                                perfectly adapted for professional co-operation, and united they
                                constiuted an array of counsel as strong as could be found at the
                                English-speaking bar."</p>
                            <p>After the close of the impeachment trial he served as Attorney
                                General, from 1868 to 1869, in President Johnson's cabinet.</p>
                            <p>In 1871, he and two other eminent lawyers were appointed by President
                                Grant to defend the interests of citizens of the United States,
                                before the tribunal of arbitrators who met at Geneva to settle the
                                Alabama claims.</p>
                            <p>In 1877 he represented the Republican party before the Electoral
                                Commission. He served four years as Secretary of State in Hayes'
                                Cabinet (1877-1878). He was United States Senator from the State of
                                New York for six years (1885-1891). I omitted to mention that he was
                                the senior counsel for Mr. Beecher in the celebrated Tilton
                                suit.</p>
                            <p>In his ability to discuss great questions of constitutional and
                                international law, he was the peer of any of the statesmen and
                                diplomatists of Europe. Cobden said of him: "He is a sedate, quiet,
                                able man, thoroughly master of his business, and not disposed to go
                                much beyond it. He is quite a match for our lawyers on questions
                                that arise."</p>
                            <p>Evarts writes to Bigelow our ambassador at Paris: "I shall, of
                                course, come to Paris and depend much upon you to introduce me to
                                its wonders and protect me from its perils."</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-283" n="275"/>
                            <p>He was considered by eminent men the foremost advocate in the world,
                                whether in this country or Europe. Many of his speeches and orations
                                have been preserved, but, as is well known, the highest efforts of
                                advocacy at the bar have no adequate memorial. Tacitus says of the
                                eloquent Haterius, "Whilst the plodding industry of scribblers goes
                                down to posterity, the sweet voice and fluent eloquence of Haterius
                                died with himself."</p>
                            <p>As an orator he was celebrated for the length of his sentences, but
                                they were free from involution and obsecurity, and seldom contain a
                                superfluous or misplaced word. Rufus Choate was also famous for long
                                sentences. So long, indeed, that some of them have been described as
                                sentences for life. Choate's eulogy on Webster, one of the finest
                                ever pronounced on any man, contains one sentence which stretches
                                over more than four pages; and it has been said that some of the
                                sentences of the abstruse Kant measure two feet, eight by six
                                inches. I think a close examination will disclose the fact that the
                                sentences of Evarts are characterized by brevity or
                                copiousness&#151;according to the subject under
                                consideration.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Evarts was not a politician in the ordinary signification of that
                                word, but his consummate ability and admirable fitness for that
                                great office, caused his name to be frequently mentioned in
                                connection with the Presidency.</p>
                            <p>Contemporary statesmen observed and appreciated his greatness as a
                                lawyer, orator, statesman and diplomatist, as well as his noble and
                                charming personal characteristics.</p>
                            <pb id="VAA3932-284" n="276"/>
                            <p>Mr. Blaine says, referring to Evarts: "He is an
                                orator&#151;affluent in diction, graceful in manner, with all
                                the rare and rich gifts which attract or enchain an audience." I
                                quote the tribute of Senator Hoar of Massachusetts:</p>
                            <p>"William M. Evarts, Secretary of State under Hays, was my near
                                kinsman and intimate friend." * * * He became the foremost advocate
                                in the world, whether in this country or Europe. * * * He was a man
                                of unfailing equanimity and good nature, never thrown off his
                                balance by any exigency in diplomacy, in political affairs, or in
                                the trial of causes. * * * He was always a delightful orator. He
                                rose sometimes to a very lofty eloquence, as witness especially his
                                argument in defense of President Johnson. * * * In the last few
                                years of his service in the senate, he had a very serious affliction
                                of the eyes. His physician in Paris told him there was not the
                                slightest hope. He thought that the darkness would certainly, though
                                gradually, shut down upon him. He received this sentence with

                            <head>BLAISE PASCAL.</head>
                            <p>We have had occasion more than once to quote from Pascal. He is
                                certainly one of the most striking characters known in history.</p>
                            <p>We know how difficult it is to convey to the reader precisely the
                                thought of the writer. The historian, <pb id="VAA3932-285" n="277"/>
                                Bancroft, fully appreciated this fact when he asserted that "There
                                is no end to the difficulty in choosing language which will awaken
                                in the mind of the reader the very same thought that was in the mind
                                of the writer." The weighty and vigorous thoughts of Pascal are
                                expressed with a force and perspicuity that enable the most ordinary
                                mind to grasp them. It was said that "the vividness and distinction
                                of his phrase, his singular faculty of inserting without any loss of
                                dignity in the gravest and most impassioned meditation what may
                                almost be called quips of thought and diction, the intense
                                earnestness of meaning, weighting but not confusing the style, all
                                appear in his writings."</p>
                            <p>Hallam declares that among those who sustained the truth of
                                Christianity by argument, rather than by authority, the first place,
                                both in order of time and of excellence, is due to Pascal. It seems
                                that he had not read very largely, which gave an ampler sweep to his
                                genius.</p>
                            <p>This distinguished philosopher and scholar was born in Auvergne,
                                France, June 19th, 1623. He died at the early age of thirty-nine, in
                                Paris, in the year 1662.</p>
                            <p>His precocity was marvelous. In his sixteenth year he produced a
                                treatise on conic sections, which extorted the almost incredulous
                                admiration of Descartes.</p>
                            <p>We have read that his "Provincial Letters" had great contemporary
                                popularity and we know that they have an enduring fame. In these
                                letters he addresses himself to the casuistry of the Jesuits; and
                                "in a stream of humorous irony which has seldom been surpassed, he
                                holds <pb id="VAA3932-286" n="278"/> up to ridicule their imputed
                                laxity of principle on the obligation of restitution, on simony, on
                                probable opinions, on equivocation and mental reservation."</p>
                            <p>It is "Pascal's Pensées," however, by which we have been most
                                profoundly impressed. The "Thoughts" of Pascal have been ranked as a
                                monument of his genius. "They burn with an intense light; condensed
                                in expression, sublime, energetic, rapid, they hurry away the reader
                                till he is scarcely able or willing to distinguish the sophisms from
                                the truth they contain." The "Thoughts" did not appear until eight
                                years after Pascal's death. The subjects dealt with concern more or
                                less all the great problems of thought on what has been called the
                                theological side of metaphysics&#151;"the sufficiency of reason,
                                the trustworthiness of experience, the admissibility of revelation,
                                free will, foreknowledge and the rest." They have been pronounced a
                                triumph of literary art of which no familiarity dims the splendor,
                                and which no lapse of time can ever impair. They have extorted the
                                admiration even of his unbelieving, and therefore unsympathetic
                                critics. "To sum up, the Pensées are excursions into the great
                                unknown, made with a full acknowledgement of the greatness of that
                                unknown. From the point of view that belief and knowledge based on
                                experience or reasoning, are separate domains with an unexplored sea
                                between and around them, Pascal is perfectly comprehensible, and he
                                need not be taken as a deserter from one region or the other."</p>
                            <p>From the notes of our reading we here reproduce a number of his
                                thoughts:</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="i">The two secret instincts of man. He seeks repose</hi>
                                <pb id="VAA3932-287" n="279"/>
                                <hi rend="i">through agitation:</hi> Man has a secret instinct that
                                leads him to seek diversion and employment from without; which
                                springs from the sense of his continual misery. And he has another
                                secret instinct, remaining from the greatness of his original
                                nature, which teaches him that happiness can only exist in repose.
                                And from these two contrary instincts there arises in him an obscure
                                propensity, concealed in his soul, which prompts him to seek repose
                                through agitation, and even to fancy that the contentment he does
                                not enjoy will be found, if by struggling yet a little longer he can
                                open a door to rest.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="i">An infinite sphere, of which the center is everywhere,
                                    the circumference nowhere:</hi> All this visible world is but an
                                imperceptible point in the ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches
                                it. In vain we extend our conceptions beyond imaginable spaces; we
                                bring forth but atoms, in comparison with the reality of things. It
                                is an infinite sphere, of which the center is everywhere, the
                                circumference nowhere. In fine, it is the greatest discernible
                                character of the omnipotence of God, that our imagination loses
                                itself in this thought.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="i">Principles are perceived, propositions are
                                    deduced:</hi> We know the truth, not only by reasoning, but by
                                feeling, and by a vivid and luminous power of direct comprehension;
                                and it is by this last quality that we discern first principles. It
                                is vain for reasoning, which has no share in discovering these
                                principles, to attempt subverting them. * * * The knowledge of first
                                principles, as the ideas of space, time, motion, number, matter, is
                                as unequivocally certain as any that reasoning imparts. * * *
                                Principles are perceived, propositions <pb id="VAA3932-288" n="280"
                                /> are deduced; each part of the process is certain, though in
                                different modes.</p>
                            <p>The proofs of our religion are not of that kind that we can say they
                                are geometrically convincing.</p>
                            <p>As they look upon truth through the medium of cheerful or gloomy
                                feelings, truth herself varies like a landscape, as seen in a bright
                                sunshine or on a cloudy day.</p>
                            <p>Reason, that vaunted guide of life, nowhere exists as a pure and
                                colorless light, but is perpetually tinctured by the medium through
                                which it passes; it flows in upon us through painted windows.</p>
                            <p>We cannot but feel that the spectacle of so ignorant a being refusing
                                to believe a proposition merely because it is above his
                                comprehension, is of all paradoxes the most paradoxical, and of all
                                absurdities the most ludicrous.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="i">Doubt distinguished from skepticism:</hi> Skepticism is
                                the adversary, not only of such or such a school, but of all schools
                                of philosophy. We must not confound skepticism with doubt. Doubt has
                                its legitimate use, its wisdom, its utility. It serves philosophy in
                                its way, for it warns her of her aberrations, and reminds reason of
                                its imperfections and limits. * * * But as soon as it is applied to
                                the faculty of knowing, if it contests with reason her power and her
                                rights, from that moment it is no longer doubt but skepticism. Doubt
                                does not flee truth; it seeks it, and it is the better to attain it
                                that it watches over and holds in check the often rash procedures of
                                reason. Skepticism does not seek truth, for it knows, or thinks it
                                knows, that there is none and can be none for man. Doubt is to
                                philosophy an inconvenient, <pb id="VAA3932-289" n="281"/> often
                                importunate, always useful friend; skepticism is to it a mortal
                                enemy.</p>
                            <p>We know truth not only through the reason, but through the heart; it
                                is from the latter source that we know its first principles, and it
                                is useless for reasoning, which has no share in them, to attempt to
                                oppose them. * * * The heart feels that there are three dimensions
                                in space, and that numbers are infinite; reason afterward
                                demonstrates that there are no two squares, one of which is double
                                the other. Principles are felt, propositions concluded; both with
                                certainty, though by different ways.</p>
                            <p>Religion and philosophy are two equally necessary powers, which,
                                thank God, can never destroy each other, but which may be easily
                                united for the peace of the world and the service of the human
                                race.</p>
                            <p>It is unquestionable that there is no good in this life but the hope
                                of another life.</p>
                            <p>The Christian faith goes mainly to the establishment of these two
                                things: the corruption of nature, and the redemption of Jesus
                                Christ.</p>
                            <p>Our whole dignity consists in thought. Our elevation must be derived
                                from this, not from space and duration, which we cannot fill. Let us
                                endeavor, then, to think well: this is the principle of ethics.</p>
                            <p>Two things instruct man in regard to his whole
                                nature&#151;instinct and experience.</p>
                            <p>It is doubtless an evil to be full of defects; but it is a still
                                greater evil to be full of them and to be unwilling <pb
                                    id="VAA3932-290" n="282"/> to acknowledge them, since this is
                                adding to them the further evil of voluntary illusion.</p>
                            <p>To speak the truth is useful to him to whom it is spoken, but
                                disadvantageous to those who speak it, because they make themselves
                                hated.</p>
                            <p>The tone of voice imposes on the wisest and alters the effect of a
                                discourse or a poem.</p>
                            <p>One never loves the person but only the qualities.</p>
                            <p>The power of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special
                                efforts, but by his ordinary doing.</p>
                            <p>The example of Alexander's chastity has not made so many continent as
                                that of his drunkenness has made intemperate.</p>
                            <p>Continued eloquence wearies.</p>
                            <p>I lay it down as a fact that, if all men knew what others say of
                                them, there would not be four friends in the world.</p>
                            <p>There are those who speak well, and do not write well. It is because
                                the place, the audience, warms them, and elicits from their mind
                                more than they find in it without this warmth.</p>
                            <p>Is it through reason that you love? It is the heart that feels God
                                and not the reason. This is faith: God is sensible to the heart, not
                                to the reason.</p>
                            <p>We know the truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart; it
                                is by the heart that we know first principles, and it is in vain
                                that reasoning, which has no part in it, tries to combat them.</p>
                            <p>Hence it is that those to whom God has given religion by sentiment of
                                heart are very happy and very legitimately persuaded. But to those
                                who have it not <pb id="VAA3932-291" n="283"/> we can give it only
                                by reasoning, until God gives it to them by sentiment of heart,
                                without which faith is but human, and useless for salvation.</p>

                                CONTEMPORARIES.</head>
                            <p>In our reading we confess to a very strong predilection in favor of
                                biography. The ancient biographer was content merely to narrate the
                                leading incidents of a man's life; modern biography is portraiture,
                                and frequently abounds in eulogy or censure, and disquisition more
                                or less profound. Again, biography is defined to be the artistic
                                representation in continuous narrative of the life and character of
                                a particular individual. The importance of some minuteness of detail
                                in biographical writing, as revealing the personality of the subject
                                of the sketch, is admirably put by an ancient biographer: "Nor is it
                                always by the most distinguished achievement that man's virtues or
                                vices may be best discerned; but very often an action of small note,
                                a short saying, or a jest, shall distinguish a person's real
                                character more than the greatest sieges or the most important
                                battles."</p>
                            <p>The life of a great man who has been conspicuously active in the
                                affairs of his government must, of necessity, throw much light on
                                contemporary history; indeed, it has been asserted that history is
                                nothing but an aggregation of the biographies of individuals.</p>
                            <p>The autobiography of a great man, eminent in any <pb id="VAA3932-292"
                                    n="284"/> department of the world's activities, when unmarred by
                                egotism or garrulity, is, to us, especially enchanting. We have read
                                with intense interest Senator Hoar's "Autobiography of Seventy
                                Years." A tribute to the senator by one of his most distinguished
                                contemporary statesmen is no doubt well deserved: "Eminent in his
                                profession, successful in his political career, Mr. Hoar superadds
                                accomplishments which neither the practice of law nor participation
                                in public affairs can give. * * * He is independent without
                                self-assertion, courageous without bravado, conscientious without
                                Pharisaism."</p>
                            <p>The senator's beautiful compliment to his mother, who is the daughter
                                of Roger Sherman, first attracted our attention: "If she were in the
                                company of a queen, it would never have occurred to her that they
                                did not meet as equals. And if the queen were a woman of sense, and
                                knew her, it would never occur to the queen."</p>

                                <head>DANIEL WEBSTER.</head>
                                <p>It seems that the course and utterances of Daniel Webster during
                                    the last few years of his life were a source of much discomfort
                                    and irritation to the abolitionists. On one occasion he declared
                                    that there was no North, and the South went clear up to the
                                    Canada line. He was the chief target for all antislavery arrows
                                    from March, 1850, till his death in the autumn of 1852. During
                                    this period he took no part in political affairs in
                                    Massachusetts. He lived to suffer the mortification of seeing
                                    General Scott nominated for the presidency by <pb
                                        id="VAA3932-293" n="285"/> his party, but died too soon to
                                    witness his overwhelming defeat by General Pierce.</p>
                                <p>Senator Hoar, when quite young, heard Webster make a speech. He
                                    says that the latter almost lifted his audience from their feet
                                    as his great organ tones rolled out his closing sentences. He
                                    declares that Webster was physically the most splendid specimen
                                    of noble manhood his eyes ever beheld&#151;notwithstanding
                                    he was only five feet nine inches, and weighed one hundred and
                                    fifty-four pounds. The senator adds: "But then, as on all other
                                    occasions that I saw him, I should have been prepared to affirm
                                    that he was over six feet high and weighed at least two hundred.
                                    The same glamour is said to have attended Louis Fourteenth,
                                    whose majesty of bearing was such that it never was discovered
                                    that he was a man of short stature until he was measured for his
                                    coffin."</p>
                                <p>He heard Webster conversing with some gentlemen on one occasion,
                                    but remembers very little of what he said; one thing, however,
                                    was that when the backwardness or forwardness of the season was
                                    spoken of, that there was a day&#151;June
                                    15th&#151;when, in every year, vegetation was at about the
                                    same condition of forwardness, whether the spring was early or
                                    late.</p>
                                <p>Webster is thus described by another: "He was not a handsome man;
                                    but he was tall, with a chest like a Hercules, a magnificent
                                    head with beetling brow, and cavernous melancholy black eyes of
                                    the most searching and significant expression. His mouth was
                                    sweet and mobile. His utterance was deliberate and
                                    dignified."</p>
                                <p>It is related of Webster that a vein of melancholy <pb
                                        id="VAA3932-294" n="286"/> tinged all his greatest
                                    utterances. This was pathetically exhibited in what he said of
                                    the changes in his birthplace: "The villagers are gone; an
                                    unknown generation walks under our elms. Unknown faces meet and
                                    pass me in my own paternal acres. I recognize nothing but the
                                    tombs! I have no acquaintance remaining but the dead." His
                                    biographer declares, however, that there was nothing morbid in
                                    his melancholy. "It was the sadness of a great intelligence who
                                    sees earth fading away and faces eternity."</p>

                                <head>CARL SCHURZ.</head>
                                <p>Bismarck was an ardent admirer of Carl Schurz. In a conversation
                                    with Ambassador White, he said, "As a German, I am proud of Carl
                                    Schurz." Mr. Blaine, however, did not participate in this
                                    feeling of pride and admiration; on the contrary, he detested
                                    Schurz, and had no appreciation whatever of his manly political
                                    independence. In his "Twenty Years of Congress" he gives a
                                    scathing analysis and estimate of the character and ability of
                                    the great German. The reading of it recalls the admirable and
                                    truthful observation of Pascal: "Reason, that vaunted guide of
                                    life, nowhere exists as a pure and colorless light, but is
                                    perpetually tinctured by the medium through which it passes; it
                                    flows in upon us through painted windows. * * * Truth herself
                                    varies like a landscape, as seen in a bright sunshine or on a
                                    cloudy day."</p>
                                <p>Mr. Blaine declares that the political career of Mr. Schurz was
                                    consistent only in the frequency and agility of its changes. He
                                    then proceeds:</p>
                                <pb id="VAA3932-295" n="287"/>
                                <p>"So deficient is he in the talent of extempore speaking, that he
                                    has been known to use a manuscript in an after-dinner response,
                                    a style of speech whose chief merit consists in its spontaneity,
                                    with apt reference to incidents which could not possibly be
                                    foreseen. * * * Schurz has not become rooted and grounded
                                    anywhere, has never established a home, is not identified with
                                    any community, is not interwoven with the interests of any
                                    locality or of any class, has no fixed relation to church or
                                    state, to professional, political, or social life, has acquired
                                    none of that companionship and confidence which unite old
                                    neighbors in the closest ties, and give to friendship its
                                    fullest development, its most gracious attributes.</p>
                                <p>"Nor is Mr. Schurz's independence of party more pronounced or
                                    more complete than his independence of true American feeling. He
                                    has taken no pride in appearing under the simple but lofty title
                                    of a citizen of the United States. He stands rather a
                                    representative German-American.</p>
                                <p>"To Mr. Schurz the republic is not great! 'This country,' said
                                    he, in his centennial lecture, 'is materially great, but morally
                                    small.'"</p>
                                <p>On the other hand, Senator Hoar, who is usually able to divest
                                    himself of those passions which cloud the intellects and warp
                                    the understandings of men, has much to say in commendation of
                                    Mr. Schurz:</p>
                                <p>"Carl Schurz was a very interesting character. * * * He was
                                    admirably equipped for public service. Although a native of
                                    Germany, he had a most excellent, copious and clear English
                                    style. No man in either house <pb id="VAA3932-296" n="288"/> of
                                    congress equalled him in that respect. He was a clear reasoner,
                                    and not lacking on a fit occasion in stirring eloquence. * * *
                                    Mr. Blaine says of Schurz, with some exaggeration, but with some
                                    truth, that he has not become rooted and grounded anywhere, has
                                    never established a home, and is not identified with any
                                    community.</p>
                                <p>"I do not agree with Mr. Blaine's estimate of Schurz as to
                                    extempore speaking. I have heard him make very effective speches
                                    in the senate, and elsewhere, that were undoubtedly extemporary.
                                    Mr. Blaine says that Schurz is so deficient in this respect that
                                    he has been known to use manuscript for an after-dinner
                                    response."</p>

                                <head>HENRY WARD BEECHER.</head>
                                <p>It is a well-known historical fact that during our Civil War the
                                    people of England, not only the aristocratic and wealthy
                                    classes, but the masses as well, sympathized with the South.
                                    Henry Ward Beecher was sent there with the hope that by his
                                    ability and persuasive eloquence a change in public sentiment
                                    might be effected. He delivered addresses in all the principal
                                    cities of England and was invariably confronted with a hostile
                                    audience. Senator Hoar relates that while Beecher was addressing
                                    a great crowd at Birmingham, he was constantly goaded with
                                    hostile interruptions, so that he had great difficulty in
                                    getting on. At last one fellow provoked the cheers and applause
                                    of the audience by crying out: "Why didn't you put down the
                                    rebellion in <pb id="VAA3932-297" n="289"/> sixty days as you
                                    said you would?" Beecher paused a moment until they became
                                    still, in the eagerness to hear his reply, and then hurled back:
                                    "We should if they had been Englishmen." "The fierce, untamed
                                    animal," says the Senator, "hesitated a moment between anger and

                                    prevailed, and the crowd cheered him and let him go on."</p>
                                <p>It has been said of Mr. Beecher that he was physically,

                                <p>"Nothing could exceed his bold brilliancy. He was a man of
                                    genius; even more a poet than an orator; in sympathy with every
                                    noble cause; and utterly without fear of the pew-holders inside
                                    of his church or of the mob outside. Heresy hunters did not
                                    daunt him. Humor played over much of his sermonizing; wit
                                    corruscated through it; but there was at times a pathos which
                                    pervaded the deep places of the human heart. By virtue of his
                                    poetic insight he sounded depths of thought and feeling which no
                                    mere theological reasoning could ever reach. He was a
                                    man&#151;indeed, a great man&#151;but to the end of his
                                    life he retained the freshness of youth. General Grant, who
                                    greatly admired him, once said to me, "Beecher is a
                                    boy&#151;a glorious boy."</p>

                                <head>WILLIAM H. SEWARD.</head>
                                <p>The most serious criticism of Seward has been on account of his
                                    undue prolixity. Cobden on one occasion declared that "Seward
                                    writes so much that he is in danger of being on every side of a
                                    subject." And John Bigelow affirmed that his prolixity is
                                    sometimes "more creditable to his physical vigor of composition
                                    and his love of scholastic dialectics than to his sagacity."</p>
                                <p>Mr. Blaine declared that few among the public men of the United
                                    States have rivaled Mr. Seward in the dignity, felicity and
                                    vigor which he imparted to an official paper; and that no one
                                    ever surpassed him. As an illustration, he gives the following
                                    extract from President Johnson's veto message written by Seward:
                                    "Experience, I think, has shown that it is the easiest, as it is
                                    also the most attractive, of studies to frame constitutions for
                                    the self-government of free states and nations; but I think
                                    experience has equally shown that it is the most difficult of
                                    all political labors to preserve and maintain such free
                                    constitutions of self-government when once happily
                                    established."</p>
                                <p>It was the opinion of Blaine that Seward possessed a
                                    characteristic rare among men who have been accustomed to
                                    lead&#151;he was a good listener. "He gave deferential
                                    attention to remarks addressed to him, paid the graceful and
                                    insinuating compliment of seeming much impressed, and offered
                                    the delicate flattery, when he came to reply, of repeating the
                                    argument of his opponent in phrase far more affluent and
                                    eloquent than that in <pb id="VAA3932-299" n="291"/> which it
                                    was originally stated." Mr. Blaine adds, truly, that in
                                    conflicts of opinion the superior mind, the subtle address, the
                                    fixed purpose, the gentle yet strong will, must in the end
                                    prevail.</p>
                                <p>No man was more capable of giving a just estimate of Mr. Seward
                                    than the venerable and distignuished John Bigelow, who recently
                                    died in his ninety-fifth year. There was a personal intimacy
                                    between them. Bigelow was our ambassador at Paris during the war
                                    between the states and Seward was secretary of state. Many grave
                                    and delicate questions of international importance arose during
                                    this trying period, the solution of which devolved upon them. In
                                    a letter to E. L. Pierce, written October 6, 1892, Mr. Bigelow
                                    gives the following estimate of Mr. Seward:</p>
                                <p>"It is an easy thing to point out many of Seward's limitations.
                                    Though college bred, he was not in any proper sense of the word
                                    an educated man. He was licensed to practice law, but he
                                    embarked in politics so early in life that he was never much of
                                    a lawyer. * * * This is not apt in our country, at least, to
                                    make an entirely symmetrical man. The necessity and the habit of
                                    deferring to popular opinion weakens a man in the inverse ratio
                                    to his native force. The weak it crushes; the strong it
                                    elevates, but not symmetrically. To this influence Mr. Seward
                                    was no exception. One thing in which he excelled all the men of
                                    his time that I knew was his sagacity in discerning the trend of
                                    public opinion. When he discovered it, he reverently bowed to
                                    it. * * * He had, like Lafayette and Sumner, <pb
                                        id="VAA3932-300" n="292"/> a "canine appetite for praise." *
                                    * * The world is not yet so good or so wise that it can afford
                                    to dispense with approbativeness as a native power.</p>
                                <p>"He never lost sight of the all-important fact that the time must
                                    inevitably come when the people of the free and slave states
                                    would have to sleep in the same bed or to both sleep their last
                                    sleep as popular sovereignties."<ref id="ref_51" rend="super"

                                        <p>It is a well-known historical fact that prior to the war
                                            between the states, Mr. Seward was the recognized leader
                                            of the anti-slavery men, and that it was from Seward
                                            they had learned their political creed. His defeat for
                                            the presidential nomination by an anti-slavery
                                            convention, led Senator Toombs, of Georgia, to make that
                                            exultant, historic declaration, that "Actæon had been

                                <p>Seantor Hoar is our authority for the statement that Charles
                                    Francis Adams was rather dull as a public speaker; that he was
                                    apt to announce commonplaces slowly and deliberately, as if they
                                    were something he thought his audience was listening to for the
                                    first time.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Adams was our ambassador to England from 1861 to 1868,
                                    covering the critical period of our civil war. He was certainly
                                    well equipped for the high, responsible, and delicate duties of
                                    that position. Goldwin Smith complains that England was
                                    unfortunate in having Lord Russell for her minister of foreign
                                    affairs at this time. He says that Russell's diplomatic manner
                                    was as bad as possible; that it was haughty, unconciliatory, and
                                    brusque; that he afterwards apologized for his want <pb
                                        id="VAA3932-301" n="293"/> of courtesy, but it was too late.
                                    Mr. Smith adds, however, that "we were lucky' on the other hand,
                                    in having, as the American ambassador, Mr. Adams, whose bearing
                                    throughout was excellent, and who, to the pride of aristocracy,
                                    could oppose the dignity of an illustrious line. Mr. Adams'
                                    temper must have been tried. He certainly was not exposed during
                                    those years to the social allurements, under the sweet but
                                    emasculating influence of which American ambassadors to England
                                    are apt to fall."</p>
                                <p>It was said that Mr. Adams rarely betrayed any deep emotion on
                                    any public occasion, however momentous.</p>

                                    under Hayes, was a very interesting character, a man of great
                                    common sense, public spirit, with a wonderful memory, and a rare
                                    fund of knowledge of the political history of the Northwest.</p>
                                <p>He relates that at Secretary Sherman's dinner he asked Secretary
                                    Thompson across the table to which mast of a man-of-war the
                                    American flag should be attached. <pb id="VAA3932-302" n="294"/>
                                    Thompson coughed and stammered a little and said: "I think I
                                    shall refer that question to the attorney-general."</p>

                                    "What you want to do, Mr. Hoar, when you get back to Washington,
                                    is to suspend the what-do-you-call-it." He meant, of course, the

                                <p>The opinion prevailed at one time that Grant was a man without
                                    much literary capacity. Since the publication of his "memoirs"
                                    this notion has been discarded. "I can testify to his great
                                    readiness as a writer," says Senator Hoar. "I saw him write two
                                    messages to congress, both of a good deal of importance, without

                                <p>Grant made a visit to Worcester in the summer and the senator
                                    went with him in a special car to Groton in the afternoon. Grant
                                    was not very talkative, though interested in all he saw. One of
                                    his sons, a well-grown lad, was upon the train. "The general had
                                    not seen him for some time, and he sat with one arm around him,
                                    as one might with a young girl."</p>

                                    all-important. The senator affirms that it sometimes seemed as
                                    if Sumner thought the rebellion itself was put down by speeches
                                    in the senate, and that the war was an unfortunate and most
                                    annoying, though trifling disturbance, as if a fire-engine had
                                    passed by.</p>

                                <p>Senator Hoar placed a high estimate upon the ability and culture
                                    of John James Ingalls. He says that Ingalls was in many respects
                                    one of the brightest intellects he ever knew. That he had an
                                    excellent English style, always impressive, often on fit
                                    occasions rising to great stateliness and beauty. He was for a

                                    which position he maintained his stately dignity of bearing and
                                    speech. "I said to him one day," says the senator, "I think you
                                    are the best presiding officer I ever knew. But I do not think
                                    you know much about parliamentary law." To which he replied: "I

                                    far beyond that ordinarily implied by the possession of a
                                    college diploma. "His mind has been enriched by the study of
                                    books and disciplined by controversy at the bar and in the
                                    senate. As a speaker he is fluent and eloquent, but perhaps too

                                <p>The people of Indiana are justly proud of Benjamin Harrison. His
                                    superior ability as a lawyer, his versatility upon the hustings,
                                    his conscientiousness, and, above all, his spotless private
                                    character, far more than compensate for any alleged
                                    eccentricities of manner or bearing. We know that prominent
                                    public men, even of his own party, did not feel kindly toward
                                    him, which we believe is accounted for by his woful want of tact
                                    and austerity of manner.</p>
                                <p>Senator Hoar one day called on President Harrison to present a
                                    matter of considerable importance. In the senator's account of
                                    the interview he says: "The president was very unwilling,
                                    indeed, to take this view. He answered me at first in his rough,
                                    impulsive way, and seemed very unwilling even to take the matter
                                    into consideration."</p>
                                <p>Andrew D. White relates that when Senator Lodge, Roosevelt,
                                    himself, and their delegation reached the executive mansion at
                                    the time fixed by President Harrison, their reception was
                                    anything but cordial. Mr. <pb id="VAA3932-305" n="297"/> White
                                    says: "Mr. Harrison seemed, to say the least, not in good humor.
                                    He stood leaning on the corner of his desk, and he asked none of
                                    us to sit. All of us had voted for him, and had come to him in
                                    his own interest as well as in the interest of the country; but
                                    he seemed to like us none the better for all that.</p>
                                <p>"Courtesy was not generally considered Mr. Harrison's strong

                                <p>Referring to Cushman K. Davis, the senator declares that his mind
                                    was a marvelous storehouse of literary gems which were unknown
                                    to most scholars, but rewarded his diligent search and loving
                                    study at his books. He says that Davis had what Jeremy Taylor
                                    calls "the great endearment of prudent and temperate speech."
                                    That he had read and mastered Tacitus, and, in the senator's
                                    opinion, a man who has mastered Tacitus has had the best
                                    gymnastic training of the intellect, both in vigor and style,
                                    which the resources of all literature can supply.</p>
                                <p>He declares that Davis perpetrated "one of the most exquisite
                                    felicities of the literature of the senate," in his reference to
                                    Cleveland, Blount and the Queen of the Sandwich Islands. "His

                                <p>The senator's recollections of Lord Coleridge are interesting.
                                    The noble lord received fifty guineas every morning for his
                                    services in the Tichborn trial.</p>
                                <p>He asked the senator about an American judge with whom he had
                                    some acquaintance and was told that his reputation was rather
                                    that of a jurist than of a judge. "Oh, yes," said Coleridge, "a
                                    jurist is a man who knows something about the laws of every
                                    country but his own."</p>
                                <p>His lordship had a great admiration for President Lincoln and was
                                    eager to hear anything anybody had to tell about him. Senator
                                    Hoar told him the famous story of Lincoln's reply to a man who
                                    had left with him his poem to read when he gave it back: "If
                                    anybody likes that sort of thing, it's just the sort of thing
                                    they'd like." The senator overheard his lordship as he
                                    circulated about the room, a little while afterward, repeating
                                    the story to various listeners.</p>

                                    due to something other than mere talent and exertion. It was the

                                    to keep warm. It was said he prepared for a great jury argument
                                    by taking off eight great coats and drinking eight cups of green

                                    escaped our observation or is beyond our comprehension. In his
                                    first chapter he declares that early in life he became educated
                                    into that great truth, "so imperfectly understood, as yet, in
                                    our country, that stores, shops, hotels, facilities for travel
                                    and traffic are not the highest things in civilization."</p>
                                <p>Mr. White was the first president of Cornell University; American
                                    minister at Berlin, also at St. Petersburg; afterwards American
                                    ambassador at Berlin; and has held many other high positions. He
                                    is a man of the highest attainments and culture. He was on terms

                                    familiar with public events, not omitting, while abroad, to keep
                                    himself advised of public affairs in his own country.</p>

                                <p>Mr. White considered Bismarck the greatest German since Luther.
                                    Though an Israelite, he showed none of the grasping propensities
                                    so often ascribed to his race. <pb id="VAA3932-309" n="301"/>
                                    When he uttered the famous saying, "We Germans fear God and
                                    naught beside," our author declares that he simply projected
                                    into the history of Germany his own character.</p>
                                <p>Bismarck, when the occasion demanded, gave the most curious
                                    examples of the eloquence of silence; but Mr. White says: "I
                                    have known many clever speakers and some very powerful orators;
                                    but I have never known one capable, in the same degree, of
                                    overwhelming his enemies and carrying his whole country with
                                    him."</p>
                                <p>Louis Napoleon was for a while the arbiter of Europe. Bismarck
                                    pronounced him "a great unrecognized incapacity," and the world
                                    finally discovered that Bismarck was right.</p>
                                <p>It was Bismarck who said "in his slashing way" that Lord
                                    Salisbury was a reed painted to look like iron. Goldwin Smith
                                    declared that this was exaggeration, but confessed that he had
                                    more confidence in the judgment and rectitude of Salisbury than
                                    in his strength.</p>
                                <p>The world is indebted to Bismarck for the apothegm: "Revenge is a
                                    delicacy that should be eaten cold."</p>

                                <head>EMPEROR WILLIAM.</head>
                                <p>Mr. White says that the union of breadth and minuteness in his
                                    view of his empire and of the world is, perhaps, the emperor's
                                    most striking characteristic. Another attribute which he
                                    possesses in the highest degree is independence of
                                    thought&#151;"this quality should not be confounded,
                                    however, as it often is, with man's off-hand decision based upon
                                    prejudices or whimsies."</p>
                                <pb id="VAA3932-310" n="302"/>
                                <p>Our author describes what he terms "the occasional plaintive
                                    declarations" that the emperor does not love the United States
                                    or admire its institutions.</p>
                                <p>It was generally understood during the peace conference at The
                                    Hague that he did not favor arbitration because he considered it
                                    derogatory to his sovereignty.</p>
                                <p>Refering to the emperor's guests, Mr. White affirms that one
                                    class was conspicuous by its absence at all such gatherings
                                    large or small; namely, the merely rich. "Rich men were there,
                                    but they were always men who had done something of marked value
                                    to their country or to mankind; for the mere 'fatty tumors' of
                                    the financial world he evidently cared nothing."</p>
                                <p>Of course the doctrine of <hi rend="i">lese majesty</hi> can have
                                    no application in this country; it is contrary to the genius of
                                    our institutions. It is defined to be any crime committed
                                    against sovereign power; in this country sovereignty rests with
                                    the people. Mr. White considers the subject in its application
                                    to Germany.</p>
                                <p>"The simple fact is that German public opinion, embodied in
                                    German law, has arrived at the conclusion that it is not best to
                                    allow the head of the state to be the sport of every crank or
                                    blackguard who can wield a pen or pencil. The American view,
                                    which allowed Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley to be attacked in

                                    portrayed as tyrants, drunkards, clowns, beasts of prey, and
                                    reptiles, has not yet been received into German modes of
                                    thought.'</p>

                                <head>COUNT LEO TOLSTOI.</head>
                                <p>Mr. White affirms that for the first time in the history of
                                    Russia, a man of world-wide fame in literature and thought was
                                    abiding there&#151;Count Leo Tolstoi. He says, however, that
                                    of all distinguished men he ever met, Tolstoi seemed to him most
                                    in need of "that enlargement of view and healthful modification
                                    of opinion which came from meeting men and comparing views with
                                    them in different lands and under different conditions." He
                                    declared Tolstoi to be one of the most sincere and devoted men
                                    alive, a man of great genius and, at the same time, of very deep
                                    sympathy with his fellow-creatures. That as to the moral side,
                                    "The stream of his thought was usually limpid, but at times it
                                    became turbid and his better ideas seemed to float on the
                                    surface as iridescent bubbles."</p>
                                <p>Mr. White notes Tolstoi's keen thrusts at those who seek to hide
                                    the poverty of their ideas in the obscurity of their
                                    phrases.</p>
                                <p>Tolstoi remarked to Mr. White that women are not so
                                    self-sacrificing as men; that a man would sometimes sacrifice
                                    his family for an idea, but that a woman would not. Again,
                                    referring to women, he said that woman hangs upon the past; that
                                    public opinion progresses, but that women are prone to act on
                                    the opinion of yesterday or of last year; that women and
                                    womenish men take naturally to old absurdities, among which he
                                    mentioned the doctrines of the trinity, spiritism, and
                                    homeopathy. He said that education would not change women; that
                                    they are illogical by nature.</p>
                                <pb id="VAA3932-312" n="304"/>
                                <p>Mr. White affirms that as to French literature, Tolstoi thought
                                    Maupassant the man of greatest talent, by far, in recent days,
                                    but that he was depraved and centered all his fiction in women.
                                    For Balzac he evidently preserved admiration, but he cared
                                    little for Daudet, Zolo, and their compeers.</p>
                                <p>Upon being asked by Mr. White if he had formed a theory as to the
                                    future life, he said in substance that he had not; "but that as
                                    we came at birth from beyond the forms of space and time, so at
                                    death we returned whence we came." Mr. White inquired if he used
                                    the word "forms" in the Kantian sense. "Yes," he said, "space
                                    and time have no reality."</p>
                                <p>He declared religion to be the feeling which man has regarding
                                    his relation to the universe, including his fellow-man, and to
                                    the power which governs all.</p>
                                <p>Tolstoi related the story of a converted pagan who, being asked
                                    how many gods he worshiped, said: "One, and I ate him this
                                    morning."</p>
                                <p>Mr. White drew from him his views on various subjects: Tolstoi
                                    declared that one main obstacle in human progress is the
                                    suppression of the real thoughts of men; that he had no liking
                                    for verse, and acquiesced in Carlyle's saying that nobody had
                                    ever said anything in verse which could not have been better
                                    said in prose. Upon being asked about his manual labor, he said
                                    "his habit was to rise early and read or write till noon, then
                                    to take his luncheon and a short sleep and after that to work in
                                    his garden or fields." He thought this good for him on every
                                    account in which opinion Mr. White fully concurred.</p>

                                <p>Though allied to opposite political parties, Mr. White had great
                                    respect and admiration for Grover Cleveland. Prior to Mr.
                                    Cleveland's administration, the Monroe doctrine had been merely
                                    a beautiful and most fascinating theory. It was left to Mr.
                                    Cleveland to give it a practical application and to place the
                                    doctrine upon a solid and enduring foundation.</p>
                                <p>When Lord Salisbury, after some months' delay, returned an answer
                                    declining arbitration of the Venezuela question, accompanied
                                    with an emphatic declaration that international law did not
                                    recognize the Monroe doctrine, it was believed on both sides of
                                    the Atlantic that a crisis was at hand and that war was
                                    imminent. Mr. Cleveland was equal to the emergency and his
                                    statesmanship finally triumphed. Mr. White truly characterizes
                                    the settlement as a happy solution of the whole question, and a
                                    triumph of American diplomacy in the cause of right and justice.
                                    He adds:</p>
                                <p>"During my work upon the Venezuela commission, I learned to
                                    respect more and more the calm, steady, imperturbable character
                                    of Mr. Cleveland. * * * Mr. Cleveland and the state department
                                    gained one of the most honorable victories in the history of
                                    American diplomacy."</p>

                                    physiology should be taught at the beginning of every
                                    course&#151;that is to say, an account of the structure, <pb

                                    of the human body, on which so much depends for every human

                                <p>We are perfectly convinced of the truth of this statement.
                                    However it may be now, we know that fifty years ago this branch
                                    of study was not taught at one of our great institutions of
                                    learning, the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. It is to
                                    be hoped that physiology has long since been added to the
                                    curriculum.</p>

                                    "d&#151;d frigid respectable body that chilled his

                                <p>Our author, early in life, acquired an intense hostility to
                                    revivals and camp meetings; and, in later years there seems not
                                    to have been any abatement of this antipathy. He refers to the
                                    statement of the revivalists that "hell is filled with infants
                                    not a span long", and describes him as a "big, fleshy creature,
                                    storming and raging and claiming to announce a divine message."
                                    He then proceeds:</p>
                                <p>"The simplest and most harmless amusements were denounced, and
                                    church members guilty of taking part in them were obliged to
                                    stand in the broad aisle and be publicly reprimanded from the
                                    pulpit." Again he says:</p>
                                <p>"I have long regarded camp meetings as among the worst influences
                                    to which our rural youth are subjected&#151;Joe Miller jokes
                                    in the pulpit, hysterics in the pews, with an atmosphere often
                                    blasphemous and sometimes erotic. * * * The longer I live the
                                    more I am convinced that the professional revivalist and the
                                    sensation preacher are necessarily and normally foes both to
                                    religion and civilization."</p>
                                <p>Notwithstanding the objurgations of our author against revivals
                                    and camp meetings, we are constrained to remark that we know
                                    many excellent and conscientious <pb id="VAA3932-316" n="308"/>

                                <p>John Bigelow's "Retrospections of an Active Life," in three
                                    volumes, is another invaluable contribution to the literature of
                                    the period. He was United States minister to France during our
                                    war between the states and thus became familiar with the
                                    important public events of this critical period, and acquired a
                                    knowledge of the character and abilities of public men on both
                                    sides of the Atlantic. His recollections of men and events are
                                    intensely interesting.</p>

                                    and buffetings without complaint. He was not a learned man. He
                                    was not even one who would deserve to be called in our day an
                                    educated man. He had never been out of the United States nor
                                    seen much of the portion of them lying east of the Allegheny
                                    mountains. * * * In the ordinary sense of the word, Mr. Lincoln
                                    was not a statesman."</p>

                                    than a producer. * * * He has nothing like the same capacity for
                                    discerning truths that he has for propagating them when
                                    discovered. * * * He has very moderate creative or constructive
                                    faculties, but his power, like that of a mill, consists mainly
                                    in his ability to convert and adapt the material put into it by
                                    others, to the use and convenience of society."</p>

                                <head>THE EMPEROR NAPOLEON.</head>
                                <p>Mr. Bigelow says that the Emperor's conversation was
                                    characterized by unusual rapidity of thought and marvelous
                                    conciseness of expression. On one occasion, with one of his
                                    incomprehensible smiles, the emperor remarked, "If the North is
                                    victorious I shall be happy; if the South is victorious I shall
                                    be enchanted."</p>
                                <p>It is quite evident that Goldwin Smith neither loved nor admired
                                    the emperor; indeed he is almost vitriolic in his
                                    characterization of him.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Smith is authority for the statement that had the French
                                    emperor chosen, in pursuance of his own designs, to intervene on
                                    the side of the South, England could not have been permitted to
                                    intervene on the side of the North, because the opposition would
                                    have been far too strong. It was his opinion that the North owed
                                    a good deal to the attitude of Russia, whatever the motive of
                                    that attitude may have been.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Smith proceeds to excoriate the emperor:</p>
                                <p>"Louis Napoleon, like his putative uncle, wanted the consecration
                                    of glory for his usurped throne, and a <pb id="VAA3932-318"
                                        n="310"/> recognized place for himself, an upstart of birth
                                    not unquestioned, among the crowned heads of Europe, which he
                                    gained by being allowed publicly to embrace the queen of
                                    England. * * * He was a political cracksman who with his legs
                                    under your table would be meditating a raid upon your strong
                                    box. His friend and confederate, Palmerston, at last awakened to
                                    his real character and bade the nation stand upon its
                                    guard."</p>
                                <p>Again, Mr. Smith says:</p>
                                <p>"I have alluded to the French emperor's birth. I once asked the
                                    best authority I knew on social France whether Louis Napoleon
                                    was the son of his reputed father, and whether the prince
                                    imperial, on whose birth also doubt was cast, was the child of
                                    his reputed parents. The first question was answered decidedly
                                    in the negative; the second not less decidedly in the
                                    affirmative. There seems to be little doubt that Louis Napoleon
                                    was the son of the Dutch Admiral Verhuel. Court painters and
                                    sculptors struggled in vain to give him the Napoleonic brow.
                                    Perhaps his Dutch phlegm and reticence gave him some advantage
                                    over the volatile Frenchmen with whom he had to deal."</p>

                                <p>Dumas expressed to Mr. Bigelow a desire to visit the United
                                    States. The latter suggested that if he could witness the
                                    election of the next president in November and his inauguration
                                    in March, "it would give an epic completeness to his visit,"
                                    which it might be worth his taking some trouble to secure.
                                    However, Dumas never <pb id="VAA3932-319" n="311"/> made the
                                    contemplated visit. Bigelow declares that he was always
                                    impecunious, and doubtless expected our government would
                                    "lubricate his mission to America with a generous

                                    asked him if he spoke English, "No," he replied, "I read it and

                                    and I shall pick it up very soon."</p>

                                <p>It has been said that one of the essential requisites of a
                                    gentleman is to know how to pass a compliment. Measured by this
                                    standard, Sir Henry Bulwer was a gentleman in the most
                                    comprehensive sense. He declares: "I can say with truth that
                                    three of the most eminent statesmen I ever knew were American
                                    statesmen; three of the greatest orators I ever knew were
                                    American orators; three of the most agreeable men of letters I
                                    ever knew were American men of letters; three of the most
                                    charming women I ever knew were American women."</p>
                                <p>Sir Henry did not enjoy the best of health. In a letter to Mr.
                                    Bigelow he says: "My health is better. I have left off smoking,
                                    drink little tea or coffee&#151;but do not lead a healthy
                                    life. * * * For myself, I live with myself and my memories." We
                                    here reproduce some of his apothegms:</p>
                                <p>"One of the greatest arts in the conduct of affairs <pb
                                        id="VAA3932-320" n="312"/> is to avoid extreme conclusions;
                                    and no victory is perfect unless it is pardoned by the
                                    vanquished.</p>
                                <p>"Everything about man is progressing, but man himself is, in my

                                <p>"One does not find repose in finding idleness."</p>
                                <p>Referring to Sir Henry, Mr. Bigelow makes the following pertinent
                                    comments: "Unhappily, he was content to make his own pleasure,
                                    his own interests, and his own ambition, the aims and ends of
                                    his life; seemingly not aware that history measures the
                                    greatness of a statesman more by what he does for others than by

                                <p>The successful laying of the Atlantic cable was one of the great
                                    events of the nineteenth century. We remember quite well the
                                    universal delight and satisfaction that prevailed on the
                                    occasion of its completion. Cyrus W. Field sent a cablegram to
                                    Mr. Bigelow in Paris that the cable had been successfully laid.
                                    It was received July 28th, 1866, at twenty-eight minutes past
                                    five in the morning. Mr. Bigelow sent the following cablegram in
                                    reply:</p>
                                <p>"I trust the umbilical cord with which the old world is reunited
                                    to its transatlantic offspring may never transmit intelligence
                                    less welcome than this to patriotic Americans."</p>

                                <head>BIGELOW'S RETIREMENT.</head>
                                <p>Mr. Bigelow having ably and faithfully discharged the high and
                                    important duties of American minister to <pb id="VAA3932-321"
                                        n="313"/> France from 1861 till the autumn of 1866, he
                                    expressed to Secretary Seward his ardent desire to return to
                                    America and to private life. He writes Mr. Seward:</p>
                                <p>"You know it was my intention, when I left my profession, to
                                    betake myself to my books and to private life. * * * I have no
                                    longer the ambition of youth which might have found in the
                                    honors of my present position a compensation for its cares, and,
                                    in a word, I am homesick. I wish to go back to the country in
                                    which I was reared, and to those surviving friends who, of
                                    course, grow more precious to me as their numbers diminish." On
                                    the 14th of October, 1866, he again writes: "I left my library
                                    and its tranquil joys very reluctantly in 1861, and I have long
                                    yearned to get back to them."</p>
                                <p>We have always entertained the highest respect and admiration for
                                    Mr. Bigelow. Judged by his writings, he evidently possessed that
                                    deep sagacity that may be acquired by long habits of thinking
                                    and study. That he had a vastness of comprehension, a maturity
                                    of judgment, and a critical discrimination cannot be questioned.
                                    He had high literary and scholastic attainments, and his ardent
                                    desire to return to his library and its "tranquil joys"
                                    indicates very clearly his fondness for the elevating and
                                    refining pursuits of literature.</p>
                                <p>We have been captivated by Bigelow's style of composition. It was
                                    said of Burke that "in his youth he wrote on the emotions
                                    produced by mountains and cascades; by the masterpieces of
                                    painting and sculpture; by the faces and necks of beautiful
                                    women, in the style of a parliamentary report. In his old age,
                                    he discussed <pb id="VAA3932-322" n="314"/> treaties and tariffs
                                    in the most fervid and brilliant language of romance." Bigelow's
                                    style is always appropriate to the subject under
                                    consideration&#151;but always perspicuous&#151;always
                                    forcible&#151;always fascinating.</p>
                                <p>The services which he rendered his country as minister to France,
                                    during the most critical period of its history, were no less
                                    valuable and important than those of any general in the field or
                                    any statesman in the cabinet.</p>

                        <p>Occasionally we find a man who is singularly perverse in his opinions.
                            The fact that no one agrees with him does not deter him for a moment. He
                            has no intention of going with the multitude in the advocacy of either a
                            good or a bad cause.</p>
                        <p>It is said that Senator McDougal of California, a brilliant and able man,
                            made the best defense of drunkenness ever made. It is probable, however,
                            that in his case, it was the love of liquor, and its immediate effects,
                            rather than a love of singularity that induced him to make this
                            marvelous effort. He was a man of convivial tastes and habits, and
                            imagined, no doubt, that he had a keener and more exquisite appreciation
                            of the beauties and delights of this world, when under the influence of
                            intoxicants. He said:</p>
                        <p>"Mr. President, I pity the man who has never viewed the affairs of this
                            world, save from the poor, low, miserable plane of ordinary
                            sobriety."</p>

                            equipped for the discharge of the duties of his great office; and we

                            scurrilous in controversy. These attributes would be entirely
                            unbefitting the executive of a great nation. He will not, like the
                            Justicia of ancient Aragon, assume that his opinion is of "equal

                            indubitable evidence of the fact is the circumstance that a great

                        <head>SENATOR VEST ON THE DOG.</head>
                        <p>The late Senator Vest of Missouri, was loved, respected and admired, not
                            only by his own immediate constituents, but by the people of the country
                            at large. He was one of the leaders of his party in the senate and an
                            orator of more than national reputation. He was formidable in debate;
                            his speeches always logical and forcible, was quick at repartee, and had
                            a keen appreciation of humor. It was at the close of an elaborate and
                                <pb id="VAA3932-326" n="319"/> eloquent address made by an eminent
                            New England senator highly eulogistic of the Pilgrim fathers, that
                            Senator Vest arose and said: "Yes, the Pilgrims landed and fell on their
                            knees, and then fell on the Aborigines." This sally caused much
                            merriment, and had a tendency to mar the fine effect of the eloquent
                            speech that had preceded it.</p>
                        <p>No stronger proof of the love and fidelity of the canine race can be
                            given than the fact that they have been known to pine away and die of
                            grief, on account of the death of their masters&#151;an intensity of
                            feeling seldom displayed by human beings upon the death of their loved
                            ones. Indeed, the fidelity of the dog has at all times been so
                            universally recognized and admitted, that a reiteration of the fact
                            would seem trite and superfluous. However, Senator Vest's beautiful and
                            impressive tribute to the dog is worthy of preservation. It is related
                            that some years ago he was traveling through Missouri on business. One
                            day he came to a town that was greatly excited over a dog case that was
                            on trial in the local court. The senator visited the courtroom and found
                            the lawyers for the plaintiff to be warm friends of his. They invited
                            him to join them in prosecuting the slayer of their client's dog, and he
                            consented. When the evidence was all in the senator was asked to make
                            the speech to the jury, and this is what he said:</p>
                        <p>"The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him and become
                            his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may
                            prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we
                            trust with our happiness and our good <pb id="VAA3932-327" n="320"/>
                            name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he
                            may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most. A man's
                            reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The
                            people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success
                            is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure
                            settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend
                            that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts
                            him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is his dog. A
                            man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in
                            sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow
                            and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side.
                            He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will lick the sores
                            and wounds that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He
                            guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all
                            other friends desert he remains. When riches take wings and reputation
                            falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey
                            through the heavens. If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in
                            the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher
                            privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard against danger, to
                            fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and
                            death takes the master in its embrace, and his body is laid away in the
                            cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by
                            the grave side will the noble dog be found, his head between his <pb
                                id="VAA3932-328" n="321"/> paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert
                            watchfulness, faithful and true even in death."</p>
                        <p>Mr. Vest sat down. He had spoken in a low voice, without a gesture. He
                            made no reference to the evidence or the merits of the case. When he
                            finished the judge and jury were wiping their eyes. The jury filed out,
                            but soon entered with a verdict of five hundred dollars for the
                            plaintiff whose dog was shot.<ref id="ref_52" rend="super"

                            rhyme to be "the jingling sound of like endings," and alliteration has
                            been defined to be the jingling of like beginnings. It seems, however,
                            that this last definition is hardly sufficiently comprehensive as, in
                            practice, the alliterative "jingle" is not confined to beginnings.</p>

                        <p>I am not at all familiar with the laws of alliterative verse, but poets
                            have at all times availed themselves of its use. We read in
                            Shakespeare:</p>

                        <p>Whipple, the essayist, gave special attention to alliterative
                            composition; and it is said that one of his best sentences was that in
                            which he truly described the mental processes of the three great

                        <p>Even the word has an especial charm for me. It suggests the aroma of the
                            freshness of the early morning. If I were a public man I should desire
                            above all things else to be best known as the "apostle of moderation."
                            Think of the calamities that might have been averted in this world if
                            the principle of moderation had been recognized and acted upon. If it
                            had not been for the radicalism of the Chandlers and the Yanceys, the
                            great civil war in America would not have occurred, and the lives of
                            scores of thousands would not have been sacrificed, to say nothing of
                            the vast expenditure of millions of money. The thought has an admirable

                        <p>It is very doubtful whether political joint discussions result in
                            conversions from the one political party to the other; but the attrition
                            of mind with mind, the quick repartee, and the tart replies of the
                            contestants, frequently furnish much amusement to the audience.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bryan was addressing a vast assemblage on the side of a mountain near
                            Asheville. While in the midst of one of his great flights of eloquence,
                            when the people about him and all nature were profoundly silent, a mule
                            brayed, exhibiting extraordinary powers of vociferation. Mr. Bryan
                            paused and, looking seriously at the vast audience, said: "My

                            discussion."</p>
                        <p>I read not long ago of a joint debate between a Democratic <pb
                                id="VAA3932-331" n="324"/> and a Whig politician in the state of New
                            York. The Democrat spoke with much eloquence and power in favor of
                            Martin Van Buren, and, in the course of his speech, he referred to Mr.
                            Van Buren as "the Curtius of the republic." His Whig opponent, not being
                            himself a classical scholar, passed out into the audience and inquired
                            of a gentleman, "Who in the thunder is this Curtis that this man is
                            talking about?" "It isn't Curtis, it's Curtius," was the reply. "Well,
                            now," said the Whig orator, "what did Curtius do?" "Oh," said his
                            informant, "he threw himself into an abyss to save the Roman republic."
                            When the Democratic speaker had finished, the Whig orator arose and
                            said:</p>
                        <p>"I deny the justice of the gentleman's reference to Curtius and Martin
                            Van Buren. What did Curtius do? He threw himself into an abyss to save
                            his country. What did Martin Van Buren do? He threw his country into an
                            abyss to save himself."</p>

                        <p>The great statesmen developed during our Civil War period seem to have
                            been almost entirely forgotten. Not so, however, with the great captains
                            of that generation; on many occasions they are eulogized and in some
                            instances almost deified.</p>
                        <p>William Pitt Fessenden, of Maine, was one of the intellectual giants of
                            that era. He was chosen United States senator from Maine in 1854, and
                            held this exalted position almost continuously until his death in 1869.
                            For a brief period, however, he was secretary of the <pb
                                id="VAA3932-332" n="325"/> treasury, having succeeded Mr. Chase in
                            1864. His intellectual supremacy was conceded, and his public character
                            has been described as of the highest type of patriotism, courage,
                            integrity, and disinterestedness. He was the acknowledged leader of the
                            Republican party in the senate, but this leadership was imperiled by his
                            vote to acquit Andrew Johnson in the impeachment trial; and for this
                            vote he was subjected to a torrent of insolence and scurrility from
                            members of his own party, almost without a parallel in the history of
                            modern politics.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Fessenden was described by one of his colleagues in the senate as
                            "towering in mind above those around him, like Saul in form among his
                            countrymen."</p>

                            puerile it may be. On an occasion of this kind, it is intensely
                            diverting to be interrogated by a young lady who asks you six questions,
                            in rapid succession, as to whether you have read the six latest novels,
                            naming them. Your answers being all in the negative, it would seem that
                            two facts are conclusively established: your own stupidity, and her

                        <p>At a social function when the time to separate had arrived, the musicians
                            played the signal for parting, which was well known throughout

                            sympathy of his audience; and, in years gone by, in order to obtain this
                            sympathy, he sometimes referred to his advancing years; however, in this
                            age and generation, it very rarely occurs that an advocate introduces
                            himself with a tedious preface about the infirmities of his
                            constitution.</p>
                        <p>Henry Clay, addressing the senate on the compromise measures of 1850,
                            most effectively referred to his great age and failing strength, and to
                            his purpose to retire from public life. He assured the senators that if
                            they would pass the pending bill and tranquilize the country (a desire
                            ever dear to his heart), he would go home to Ashland and renounce public
                            life forever, and there remain during the brief remnant of his life.
                            That he would there find amidst his flocks and herds, and in the <pb

                            public life.</p>
                        <p>On another occasion when Mr. Clay was addressing the senate on the
                            subject of the pacification of the country, he again referred to his
                            advancing years. The venerable Senator Smith, of Maryland, arose and
                            said: "Though twenty years the senior of the senator from Kentucky I can
                            still stand erect and correct his errors. When the senator spoke of his
                            great age I heard a lady declare: 'Indeed, he is very pretty.'"</p>
                        <p>When a boy I heard Major John C. Mason, who for several years represented
                            the ninth Kentucky district in congress, relate to some gentleman an
                            interview between Mr. Clay and himself, in respect to these pacificatory
                            measures. Mason was a Democrat. He said: "Mr. Clay came and urged me to
                            support the pending bill to the end that civil war and bloodshed might
                            be averted. I asked him if he felt thoroughly satisfied that his bill,
                            if enacted into a law, would have that effect. He replied that it would
                            have that effect during his day at least. I told him that if war and
                            bloodshed must come, it had as well come during his day as mine."<ref

                                    sometimes regarded as both the sign and the refuge of "advancing

                        <p>It was the habit of Coleridge to make long-winded prefatory apologies for
                            his youth and inexperience. He was cured of this habit, however, by Home
                            Tooke, one of his literary contemporaries. It was said that Tooke <pb
                                id="VAA3932-335" n="328"/> had a thorough knowledge of the manners
                            of a man of the world, with marvelous scholastic resources, a rare
                            union, indeed! On one occasion, when Coleridge was making his usual
                            introductory apology, Horne Tooke abruptly called out, "Speak up, young
                            man." Coleridge, completely disconcerted, took his seat, and it is
                            nowhere recorded that he ever again committed the offense.</p>
                        <p>Edward Everett, the great New England orator, was not averse to dramatic
                            effect in some of his orations. Senator Hoar relates that on one
                            occasion Mr. Everett turned in the midst of his speech to the seat where
                            Amos Baker and Jonathan Harrington sat, and addressed them. They were
                            veterans of the war of 1812. At once they both stood up, and Mr. Everett
                            said, with fine dramatic effect, "Sit, venerable friends. It is for us
                            to stand in your presence." After the proceedings were over, old Amos
                            Baker was heard to say to somebody, "What do you suppose Squire Everett
                            meant? He came to us before his speech and told us to stand up when he
                            spoke to us, and when we stood up, he told us to sit down."</p>
                        <p>The historian of the period declares in reference to the great trial of

                            strike a highly cultivated, a reflecting, an imaginative mind. The
                            curiosity of the public to hear Sheridan's speech was unbounded. "When
                            he concluded he contrived, with a knowledge of stage effect which his
                            father might have envied, to sink back, as if exhausted, into the arms
                            of Burke, who hugged him with the energy of generous admiration."</p>

                        <p>Judge David Davis, of Illinois, who was a national figure at the time of
                            the electoral dispute in 1876, was a man of enormous proportions,
                            weighing several hundred pounds. He was proverbial for the agility of
                            his movements. At Chicago on one occasion, however, it was only with
                            great difficulty that the hackman, assisted by the gathering crowd,
                            succeeded in getting him out of the hack; once out, he marched with
                            elastic step into the hotel. The hackman, gasping for breath after his
                            great struggle, stared after Davis, saying, "By G&#151;, I should

                        <p>An aged and esteemed minister of the gospel recently died at
                            Indianapolis. Reading his obituary in the Indianapolis papers, one would
                            be led to believe that his highest claim to the love and veneration of
                            posterity was his active and incessant efforts to precipitate the late
                            civil war upon the country. It therein appears that he frequently
                            declared that "war is desirable." That a meek and humble follower of the
                            "Prince of Peace" should possess so strong a predilection for war is
                            certainly anomalous. In a country where conditions are perfectly normal
                            and healthy, and forty years after the bloody conflict had ended, this
                            sentiment would not be regarded worthy of toleration, much less of
                            commendation. This perverse public sentiment can only be accounted for
                            upon the theory that there yet remains <pb id="VAA3932-337" n="330"/> in
                            the country a lingering modicum, if no more, of the virus of sectional
                            hate.</p>

                        <head>APOTHEGMS.</head>
                        <p>I learned many years ago that the <hi rend="i">Novum Organum</hi> of Lord
                            Bacon was wholly written in apothegms or aphorisms. I subsequently read
                            that a copy of this philosophical treatise was presented to King James,
                            who, after a careful reading of the book, returned the same with the
                            comment, "Like the peace of God, it passeth all understanding." I have
                            so far succeeded in steering clear of the <hi rend="i">Novum
                                Organum,</hi> and must confess to a feeling of some trepidation in
                            approaching apothegms in general.</p>
                        <p>We have been induced to believe that the value and importance of an
                            apothegm, in public estimation, depend in many instances more upon the
                            celebrity and renown of its supposed author than upon the intrinsic
                            merit of the apothegm itself. The authorship of many of them has been
                            ascribed to the user, rather than to the originator of the apothegm. To
                            Chamfort, not Talleyrand, we are indebted for the terse remark,
                            "Revolutions are not made with rose-water." John Adams declared there
                            was nothing original in man but original sin. The real author of the
                            saying was the poet Campbell, who, when asked to write something
                            original in a lady's album, said there was "nothing original in him
                            except original sin." Calhoun was many times complimented for being the
                            author of the expression "masterly inactivity;" whereas Sir James
                            Mackintosh had long before used this "fine <pb id="VAA3932-338" n="331"
                            /> original expression." Cowper took his "God made the country and man
                            made the town" from the Latin poet Verro; and Webster's "sea of upturned
                            faces" owes its origin to Sir Walter Scott.</p>
                        <p>The following apothegm has been worn to a frazzle in our own day:</p>
                        <p>"You may fool some of the people all the time, and all of the people some
                            of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." Its
                            authorship has been generally attributed to Abraham Lincoln. Presidents,
                            senators, ministers of the gospel and others, down to the red-nosed
                            politician declaiming to his companions in the village inn, have
                            iterated and reiterated this maxim as originating in the brain of the
                            great president. How exceedingly puerile and commonplace it becomes,
                            when it is known that its author was not a great statesman, but a great
                            showman, one Phineas T. Barnum. It seems that Mr. Spofford, the
                            assistant librarian of congress, investigated the matter and could find
                            no trace of it in any of the speeches, papers, letters or recorded
                            sayings of Lincoln. That neither Mr. Hay nor Mr. Nicolay, the joint
                            authors of the standard biography of Lincoln, knew anything about it.
                            Mr. Spofford's investigation led him to conclude that Barnum was the
                            author of this much-quoted sentence.</p>
                        <p>This apothegm, the origin of which has been so erroneously attributed to
                            the great Lincoln, is in the nature and form of what lawyers call a
                            "negative pregnant," the negation of one thing and the affirmance of
                            another; and the negative clause is admirably adapted for the peroration
                            of the bucolic politician, whose principal <pb id="VAA3932-339" n="332"
                            /> stock in trade is to pay obsequious court to the people. With
                            uplifted hand, and his "eye in a fine frenzy rolling" he may proclaim,
                            with marvelous effectiveness and power, "that you cannot fool all the
                            people all the time."</p>

                        <head>GARIBALDI'S SUPREME COMMAND OF THE UNION ARMY.</head>
                        <p>In the early part of 1861, the report became current in the great
                            capitals of Europe, and was generally believed, that Garibaldi had been
                            invited by the government at Washington to take the supreme command of
                            the union army. Garibaldi came from Nice and was a child of the people,
                            and in early life had acquired an unquenchable hatred of despotism. He
                            had gained a reputation throughout the world for his dash and brilliancy
                            as a military leader, and, on account of his achievements, was idolized
                            by those who fought with him. It was said "that Mazzini was the prophet,
                            Garibaldi the knighterrant, and Cavour the statesman of Italian
                            independence." Garibaldi was called the hero of Montevideo, on account
                            of the effective aid that he gave the Montevideans against Buenos Ayres.
                            It was he who sent the famous telegram, "Complete victory along the
                            entire line," after he had driven back the royalists in disorder to
                            Capua. He died June 2, 1882, having spent the latter part of his life at
                            Caprera in his beautiful island home.</p>
                        <p>Garibaldi addressed a pompous note to the king in which he said, "The
                            Americans wish me to take command of their armies: does your majesty
                            need me here, <pb id="VAA3932-340" n="333"/> or shall I go?" He was
                            given to understand that he might go.<ref id="ref_54" rend="super"

                        <p>Lord Lytton made a speech in which he declared, "We can form some
                            conception of the utter demoralization of the government at Washington,
                            when we see an American president so bewildered by his own armies, or so
                            despairing of the skill of his own generals, that he offers to the
                            Italian Garibaldi the command of American patriots." Later in the same
                            year, the Confederate commissioners, Mason and Slidell, were seized on
                            board the British mail steamer, Trent. Mr. Bigelow, the American
                            minister at Paris, declared that after this seizure one could have
                            counted on his fingers about all the people in Europe not Americans who
                            still retained any hope or expectation of the perpetuity of the
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>The final culmination of the negotiations with Garibaldi was, that our
                            government through Sanford, the American minister at Brussels, offered
                            him a major-generalship and the payment of the expense of himself and
                            his companions. Garibaldi rejected the proposal; said he was good for
                            nothing to work under any one else&#151;that he must have the
                            supreme command.<ref id="ref_55" rend="super" target="note_55"

                        <p>The effect of Garibaldi's assuming the supreme command of the Union army
                            at the beginning of the Civil War, opens a wide field for speculation.
                            Would the result have been different?</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of Count Tolstoi, a man of worldwide fame in literature
                            and thought, that there is no such thing as military genius, and he
                            declares that he <pb id="VAA3932-341" n="334"/> has never been able to
                            understand what is meant by the term. Being asked how he could account
                            for the amazing series of Napoleon's successes he answered, "By
                            circumstances." He then went on to say that battles are won by force of
                            circumstances, by chance, by luck.<ref id="ref_56" rend="super"
                                target="note_56" targOrder="U">28</ref> Tolstoi has been declared to
                            be "a man of great genius" but it is very doubtful whether this view

                            of this or any other country.<note id="note_56" place="unspecified"

                        <p>It must be evident to any unprejudicel mind, that to have engaged the
                            services of Garibaldi as supreme commander of the Union armies would
                            have proven disastrous to the Union cause. We have no evidence that he
                            excelled as a strategist, and he had only commanded small armies. It
                            required something more than "dash and brilliancy" to command the great
                            armies of the Union during a prolonged war of four years' duration; and
                            he would have been no match for the great strategists of the
                            Confederacy.</p>
                        <p>Grant, patient, self-reliant, imperturbable&#151;possessed many of
                            the qualities of a great military leader. He was asked on one occasion
                            what he considered the most important qualification of a military
                            commander. After reflection he replied, "Patience." His own military
                            career was a verification of this opinion. Grant's self-reliance was one
                            of his most pronounced traits. If necessary he was willing to assume
                            grave responsibilities, and he was calm and patient under all
                            circumstances, never unduly elated by victory nor depressed by defeat.
                            His moral and physical courage were unquestioned. His rapidity of <pb
                                id="VAA3932-342" n="335"/> thought and action in the field were as
                            much to his credit as his ability to effect extraordinary combinations
                            and his skill and boldness in moving large armies into position.</p>

                            valuable asset of the orator; but no kind of power is more formidable
                            than the power of making men ridiculous. Pitt was most effective when he
                            treasured up in his memory "some detached expression of a hostile
                            orator, even an unguarded word, a laugh or a cheer, and made it a text
                            for sparkling ridicule or burning invective."</p>
                        <p>On the 30th of May, 1878, on the occasion of the celebration of the one
                            hundredth anniversary of the death of Voltaire, Victor Hugo declared, "A

                            what was his weapon? That which has the lightness of the wind and the
                            power of a thunderbolt. A pen."</p>
                        <p>When in the mood, Voltaire was past grand-master of conciliatory and
                            laudatory speech, and, in writing, there were times when his pen seemed
                            to have been dipped in manna. In addressing his friends he sometimes
                            exhibited the most extravagant affection. "My dearest friend" is too
                            cold for him. It is "My dear and adorable friend;" "My guardian angel."
                            When Franklin presented his grandson and asked a blessing, "God and
                            Liberty," said Voltaire, "is the only one fitting for <pb
                                id="VAA3932-343" n="336"/> Franklin's children." Those two great men
                            met again at a public sitting of the French academy. Voltaire was all
                            graciousness and urbanity. When they took their places side by side and
                            shook hands together a burst of applause involuntarily rose from the
                            great assembly.<ref id="ref_57" rend="super" target="note_57"

                        </p>
                        <p>But there was another side to Voltaire. He told Rousseau, with blunt
                            severity, that the former's "Ode to Posterity" would never reach its
                            destination. His ruthless sarcasm, when he chose to be sarcastic, was
                            merciless and ferocious. It was said<ref id="ref_58" rend="super"
                                target="note_58" targOrder="U">30</ref> that the constitution of his
                            mind resembled the constitution of those bodies in which the slightest
                            scratch of a bramble, or the bite of a gnat, never fails to fester; and
                            Macaulay declares "that of all the intellectual weapons which have ever
                            been wielded by man, the most terrible was the mockery of Voltaire.
                            Bigots and tyrants who had never been moved by the wailing and cursing
                            of millions, turned pale at his name."<note id="note_58"

                        <p>An incident occurred in our own country which illustrates the
                            effectiveness&#151;I might say the destructiveness&#151;of
                            ridicule as an intellectual weapon. It was not a case where the person
                            against whom the shaft was hurled was merely overwhelmed with derision
                            and contemptuous laughter&#151;but it was one resulting in his utter
                            and complete political annihilation. Many years ago Isaac M. Crary, of
                            Michigan, was a member of congress from that state. Before going to
                            congress he had some connection with the western militia, and had
                            obtained the honorary title of "General." He made a long and tedious
                            speech in the house in an attempt to prove that <pb id="VAA3932-344"
                                n="337"/> William Henry Harrison was a military ignoramus. Tom
                            Corwin, the celebrated Ohio orator, rose and began an off-hand speech,
                            taking for his subject "The Military Services of Isaac M. Crary." For
                            ridicule and humor it has been declared to be the most successful speech
                            ever made in congress. It was long afterwards declaimed in the public
                            schools. "Thurlow Weed, in his article on scenes he had witnessed in
                            congress, referred to this event as the most vivid of all. Corwin's
                            delineation of Crary's brilliant exploits, his portrayal of the valiant
                            charges made by Crary's troops, on muster days, upon the watermelon
                            patches of Michigan, not only convulsed his audience, but were echoed
                            throughout the nation."<ref id="ref_59" rend="super" target="note_59"

                        <p>It is altogether probable that the impartial historian of the future,
                            when he wishes to characterize the civil war in the United States, will
                            call it a Northern revolution, rather than a Southern rebellion.</p>
                        <p>As a result of that conflict no intelligent person will deny that the
                            powers of the central government have been changed and immeasurably
                            augmented. This fact is indubitably proven, not only by the addition of
                            the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, but by the more
                            latitudinarian construction of the constitution, <pb id="VAA3932-345"
                                n="338"/> as it existed before the addition of those amendments.
                            This change may have the salutary effect of prolonging the duration of
                            the government, if it does not assure its perpetuity.</p>
                        <p>While there has been an added potency given to the government by the
                            revolution of 1861, yet the diversity of interests between the different
                            states and sections is all the time increasing.</p>
                        <p>I think that foreigners have been unduly pessimistic in discussing the
                            question of the permanency of our institutions; and it is possible that
                            we have exhibited an undue optimism upon the subject. The opinions of
                            eminent men of other countries, renowned for their learning and
                            sagacity, are interesting, even though we are convinced that those
                            opinions are based upon insufficient or inaccurate information, not only
                            in respect to our governmental machinery, but also as to the characters,
                            temperament and disposition of our people. An eminent French philosopher
                            and statesman<ref id="ref_60" rend="super" target="note_60"
                                targOrder="U">32</ref> who remained in this country several years
                            studying our government, its institutions and its laws, as well as the
                            manners, customs, temperament and disposition of our people, has
                            expressed some very positive opinions on this subject. His book was
                            written with a view to enlighten European opinion in relation to
                            democratic government, and has been translated into many languages. It
                            is everywhere regarded as a political classic. His style of writing is
                            said to be an imitation of that of Montesquieu; however this may be, it
                            certainly has a magic charm. He says:<note id="note_60"

                        <p>Again he says: "I am of opinion that where there are a hundred millions

                            embezzlements, and rogueries, in federal, state and county offices. If
                            they deny it, prove it on them if you can. Say nothing against Abraham
                            Lincoln, for he was a great and good man; but avoid all idiotic
                            adulation and rhapsodies about him, such for example as, "In all that
                            constitutes true greatness, John the Baptist alone is comparable with

                        <p>"In some future day the most distant star in the heavens will bear the
                            name of Washington, and the city which he founded will be the capitol of

                        <p>I have the highest respect for the followers of æsculapius. A physician
                            who passed away several years ago was one of my dearest friends. He was
                            not only skilful and conscientious in his profession, but he was above
                            criticism in every relation of life. The voice of the physician whom you
                            have called to your home, in a case of real sickness, is the most
                            delightful of music; and the relations between him and his patient are
                            of the most sacred and confidential character.</p>
                        <p>It is my deliberate opinion, however, formed from reading, observation
                            and reflection, that the physician is called too often, and that the

                        <p>It is said that the skill of æsculapius, the god of medicine, enabled him
                            to cure the most desperate diseases, but that moral or dietetic remedies
                            were more often prescribed than drugs. The manner of diagnosis was
                            unique. The sick person after ablution, prayer and sacrifice, was made
                            to sleep on the hide of the sacrificed animal, and in his sleep the
                            malady was indicated by a dream. The record of the cure was inscribed on
                                <pb id="VAA3932-349" n="342"/> the columns of the temple; and it has
                            been thought that in this way was introduced the custom of "recording

                        <p>We read that "To Plato the science of medicine appeared one of very
                            disputable advantage. He did not indeed object to quick cures for acute
                            disorders, or for injuries produced by accidents. But the art which
                            resists the slow sap of a chronic disease, which repairs frames

                        <p>Medicine is not an exact science. Victor Jacquemont, the eminent French
                            traveler and naturalist, upon a long ocean voyage was greatly shocked by
                            the condition of the ship's medical stores. He says there were
                            twenty-four drugs, all in confusion, and no scales to weigh doses. The
                            system of administering those medicines was not regulated by the malady
                            to be combated, but by the quantity of drugs in store. Whatever the
                            ailment, the rule was to administer the drug of which the stock was
                            greatest. He declares that the sailors had the most perfect confidence
                            in this system which seemed to have answered admirably.<ref id="ref_65"

                        <p>Count Munster, in a conversation with Ambassador White, when the subject
                            of bacteria and microbes was casually mentioned, declared that they were
                            "all a modern humbug." It is hardly necessary to add that this
                            circumstance would not be reproduced here, if the distinguished <pb

                            jurisdiction by extradition or otherwise. The count merely gives an
                            opinion, but without a reason. It is very evident, however, that one
                            effect of this modern hue and cry about bacteria and microbes is to make
                            the science of medicine more and more an esoteric science.</p>
                        <p>Montaigne, in one of his essays, has much to say in respect to the use of
                            medicine. Of him, it has been averred that, take him all in all, no
                            other man of his time had read so much or pondered so deeply; and Mr.
                            Hallam declares that Montaigne is the first French author whom an
                            English gentleman is ashamed not to have read. Montaigne, in speaking of
                            another author (Tarenco), says: "That the beauty and perfection of his
                            style makes us lose the appetite for his plot. His elegancy and delicacy
                            captivate us in every scene and he is pleasant throughout. 'Running
                            smoothly, like a liquid stream, and so possesses the soul with his
                            graces of diction, that we forget those of the fable.'" The quaintness
                            and eccentricity of his own style must, of necessity, attract attention,
                            apart from the subject-matter of the essay. He says:</p>
                        <p>"Let the physicians a little excuse the liberty I take; for it is by this
                            same infusion and fatal insinuation that I have received a hatred and
                            contempt of their doctrine. The antipathy I have against their art is
                            hereditary to me. My father lived seventy-four years, my grandfather
                            sixty-nine, my great-grandfather almost four-score years, without
                            tasting any sort of physic: <pb id="VAA3932-351" n="344"/> and with
                            them, whatever was not ordinary diet was instead of a drug. Physic is
                            grounded upon experience and examples, so is my opinion. * * * I do not
                            know that they can find me, in all their records, three that were born,
                            bred, and died under the same roof who have lived so long by their own
                            conduct. * * * It has been two hundred years, save eighteen, that this
                            trial has lasted in our family; for the first of them was born in the
                            year 1402. * * * My ancestors had an aversion to physic by some secret
                            and natural instinct; for the very sight of a potion was loathsome to my
                            father. * * * So in physic I very much honor that glorious name, and the
                            end it is studied for, and what it promises to the service of mankind;
                            but its prescriptions I neither honor nor esteem. In the first place,
                            experience makes me dread it; for, amongst all my acquaintance, I see no
                            race of people so soon sick, and so long before they are well, as those
                            who are slaves to physic. Their very health is altered and corrupted by
                            the regimen they are constrained to. Physicians are not content to deal
                            only with the sick, but they change health into sickness (in my opinion
                            instances of this kind are very rare H. H. D.), for fear men should at
                            any time escape their authority. * * * I have been sick often enough,
                            and have, without their aid, found my maladies as easy to be supported
                            and as short as those of any other, without swallowing their nauseous
                            doses. * * * I never disturb myself that I have no physician, no
                            apothecary, nor any other assistance, which I see most men more
                            afflicted at than they are with their disease."</p>

                        <p>I have been profoundly impressed by the circumstance that certain of our
                            Democratic statesmen have been voting with the Republicans in favor of
                            the "protective principle"&#151;a high tariff upon certain
                            commodities. God help the statesman who will subordinate a great
                            principle to the avarice and cupidity of an insignificant number of his
                            own constituents, engaged in a particular industry. It was hardly
                            necessary for them to so stultify themselves, because without their aid
                            the Republicans, "the friends of protection," had an overwhelming
                            majority.</p>
                        <p>We are here reminded of the declaration of Grattan, on a memorable
                            occasion, that there are instances where a great majority cannot
                            ultimately prevail; that a majority cannot overcome a great principle
                            and that "God will guard his own cause against <hi rend="i">rank

                        <p>At breakfast this morning a lady, somewhat advanced in years, related an
                            incident of her early life. It was this: She and other young ladies were
                            impressed by the grace and elegant manners of a young gentleman with <pb
                                id="VAA3932-353" n="346"/> whom they had danced. She afterwards
                            learned that he was the son of a candy manufacturer. They felt greatly
                            humiliated and almost disgraced. She added that the young man had since
                            amassed a large fortune and that his name and that of his family were
                            now occasionally mentioned in the society columns of the newspapers of
                            her home city, New Orleans. I ventured to inquire if personal worth,
                            refinement and cultivation should not be controlling factors under
                            circumstances of this nature, to which I received an evasive answer.</p>
                        <p>Each community has its own standard for estimating the respectability and
                            character of its members. It is said that in New England the pursuit of
                            humble occupations affects but little the character and social standing
                            of the individual; and there are localities in the United States where
                            the mere "fatty tumors" of the financial world have but little
                            recognition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Howells asserts that in Cambridge, since the capitalistic era began,
                            no one is proud of his riches and that money counts for little; and that
                            in New York money counts for more and goes for less than in any other
                            city in the world.</p>
                        <p>It appears to me that if we must have a stratification of society the
                            ideal standard would be personal worth.</p>

                        <p>In the affairs of our government there is nothing more important than to
                            get the right man on the bench. Above all things he should be capable,
                            conscientious and <pb id="VAA3932-354" n="347"/> fearless; he should
                            never "lay his ear to the ground," nor listen for the applause of the
                            multitude. He should rather have "his ear to the sky." He should scorn
                            the idea of settling questions of righteousness by a show of hands, or
                            with the view of receiving popular applause. This thought was uppermost
                            in the mind of Lord Eldon upon the trial of the queen when he said:</p>
                        <p>"I take no notice of what is passing out of doors, because I am supposed
                            constitutionally not to be acquainted with it. * * * It is the duty of
                            those upon whom a judicial task is imposed to meet reproach, and not to
                            court popularity."</p>
                        <p>The position of judge is, indeed, one of immeasurable power and
                            responsibility; and there are many recorded instances where, but for the
                            opportune intervention of the court, the verdict of juries would result
                            in flagitious wrong and injustice. For example: a jury in Pennsylvania
                            when Judge Grier was on the bench, brought in a very unjust verdict. The
                            judge said: "Mr. Clerk, record that verdict, and enter under it "Set
                            aside;" and turning to the jury said, "I will have you to know,
                            gentlemen of the jury, that it takes thirteen men in this court to steal
                            a man's farm."</p>
                        <p>Another instance where a young man discovered a drum on the sidewalk near
                            his own home. He carried it into the house and played upon it. He was a
                            fine young fellow of irreprochable character. The jury very reluctantly
                            brought in a verdict of guilty; "he was convicted as a thief and his
                            life seemed to be blighted and ruined past hope." The judge (Peters, of
                            Maine) said: <pb id="VAA3932-355" n="348"/> "Mr. Clerk, you may record
                            the verdict. I may as well sentence him now. I shall fine him one cent,

                            environment, and the customs of the particular community. There are many
                            requisites which are, in some measure, determined by caprice. Some one
                            has said that a gentleman should know how to lend a book, how to ask
                            after a relation, and how to pass a compliment. We all know that the
                            word gentleman is sometimes wofully misapplied. A man was convicted of
                            murder, the circumstances attending the homicide being characterized by
                            unusual atrocity. The judge was exquisitely and ridiculously polite when
                            addressing the prisoner. He said: "Will the gentleman be so kind as to
                            stand up and receive his sentence?"</p>
                        <p>The pretentious fellow, the pseudo gentleman, is justly an object of
                            animadversion and ridicule.</p>
                        <p>The ideal Southern gentleman of our day is admirably described by Senator
                            Williams, of Mississippi:</p>
                        <p>"The ideal gentleman was always honest; spoke the truth; faced his enemy;
                            fought him, if necessary; never quarreled with him nor talked about him;
                            rode well; shot well; used chaste and correct English; insulted no
                            man&#151;bore no insult from any; was studiously kind to his
                            inferiors, especially to his slaves; cordial and hospitable to his
                            equals; courteous to his superiors, if he <pb id="VAA3932-356" n="349"/>
                            acknowledged any; he scorned a demagogue, but loved his people."</p>

                        <head>THE ORIGIN OF CARDS.</head>
                        <p>I venture the assertion that many of even the most ardent and
                            enthusiastic devotees of the game, are not advised of the origin of
                            cards. It seems that they were invented for the amusement of an insane
                            king. They were resorted to during the intervals of his mental disorder
                            but were ignored and spurned by him during his lucid intervals. This
                            unfortunate ruler was Charles VI. It is said that the cards served
                            admirably the purpose of diverting his royal melancholy.</p>
                        <p>"The alleged origin of the invention of cards," said Sir Walter Scott,
                            "produced one of the shrewdest replies I have ever heard given in
                            evidence. It was made by the late Dr. Gregory, of Edinburgh, to a
                            counsel of great eminence at the Scottish bar. The doctor's testimony
                            went to prove the insanity of the party whose mental capacity was the
                            point at issue. On a cross-interrogation he admitted that the person in
                            question played admirably at whist. 'And do you seriously say, Doctor,'
                            said the learned counsel, 'that a person having a superior capacity for
                            a game so difficult, and which requires in a pre-eminent degree, memory,
                            judgment and combination, can be at the same time deranged in his
                            understanding?'</p>
                        <p>"'I am no card player,' said the doctor, with great address, 'but I have
                            read in history that cards were invented <pb id="VAA3932-357" n="350"/>
                            for the amusement of an insane king.' The consequences of this reply
                            were decisive."<ref id="ref_67" rend="super" target="note_67"

                        <p>It was an admirable conceit of the old Scotch butler to toll the dinner
                            bell when the cheer which he had provided was defective in quantity or
                            poor in quality. His master was thus notified, in advance, of the
                            meagerness of the meal. To a hungry man, especially if he have a keen
                            appreciation of the pleasures of the table, information of this kind is
                            of so grave and serious a character that it should be communicated to
                            the victim in as gentle and soothing a manner as circumstances will
                            permit. A moment's time is often sufficient to beget a feeling of at
                            least partial resignation. The interval between the strokes of the bell
                            might be greater or less, according to the degree of scantiness or
                            turpitude of the meal which had been provided. Would it not be well to
                            inaugurate a movement in favor of the universal adoption of this
                            admirable device?</p>

                        <p>To me, the compositions of Burke, even when the subject-matter is no
                            longer of vital interest, are enchanting, on acount of his exquisite and
                            copious diction and the completed roundness of his periods. He was
                            renowned not only for the amplitude of his understanding but for the
                            exuberance of his imagination. His style has been <pb id="VAA3932-358"
                                n="351"/> characterized as the most powerful, the most dazzling, the
                            most daring. "It has the solidity and sparkling effect of the diamond,"
                            says one. * * * "He rises with the lofty, descends with the mean,
                            luxuriates in beauty, gloats over deformity." And what a stanch friend
                            of the colonies! Read what he says. Referring to our Revolutionary War,
                            he declares:</p>
                        <p>"War is at present carried on between the king's natural and foreign
                            troops on one side and the English in America on the other upon the
                            usual footing of other wars.</p>
                        <p>"Whilst the liberal government of this free nation (England) is supported
                            by the hireling sword of German boors and vassals; and three millions of
                            the subjects of Great Britain are seeking for protection to English
                            privileges in the arms of France!</p>
                        <p>"I cannot rejoice that they (the colonists) have fallen under the sword
                            of strangers, whose barbarous appellations I scarcely know how to
                            pronounce. * * * And I fairly acknowledge that I have not yet learned to
                            delight in finding Fort Kniphausen in the heart of the British
                            dominions.</p>
                        <p>"As yet they, and their German allies of twenty hireling states, have
                            contended only with the unprepared strength of our own infant colonies.
                            But America is not subdued. Not one unattacked village has yet submitted
                            from love or terror. You have the ground you encamp on; and you have no
                            more. * * * You spread devastation, but you do not enlarge the sphere of
                            authority."</p>

                        <p>In his address to George III on the American war, Burke boldly
                            declares:</p>
                        <p>"To excite, by a proclamation issued by your majesty's government, an
                            universal insurrection of negro slaves in any of the colonies is a

                            neither to the practise of war nor to the laws of peace."</p>
                        <p>In his address to the British Colonists in North America, he recites:</p>

                        <p>It has always seemed to me that the duties of the speaker of the National
                            House of Representatives were of a <hi rend="i">quasi</hi> judicial
                            nature, and that it is a monstrous incongruity when he acts as the head
                            of a party instead of being perfectly impartial. Mr. Carlisle was an
                            ideal speaker, and I think that the country has failed to show an
                            adequate appreciation of his splendid intellectuality, and his fairness
                            and nonpartisan administration of the duties of the great office. The
                            powers of the speaker are prodigious; and, it is an axiomatic truth,
                            that the best test of real greatness is for one to be invested with
                            extraordinary power, without abusing it.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-360" n="353"/>
                        <p>Ambassador White visited the House while Mr. Carlisle was speaker.
                            Sitting by a member who was an ardent Republican, Mr. White inquired how
                            he liked the speaker and received this reply: "Mr. Carlisle is as
                            intense in his Democracy as I am in my Republicanism, but no one can
                            conceive of circumstances which could induce him to render a partial or
                            partizan decision."</p>
                        <p>The late Senator Frye was then a member of the House. One day a
                            Democratic representative impugned the fairness of a ruling made by
                            Speaker Carlisle. It was said that Frye was out of his seat in an
                            instant, his eyes flashing and his right arm in air.</p>
                        <p>"The imputation is unworthy," he cried. "On this side of the

                            Republicans&#151;"we consider the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.
                            Carlisle) the jewel of the Democratic party!"</p>
                        <p>It is related that the effect was electric. The great body of Democrats
                            joined with the Republicans, in drowning the generous outburst with
                            cheers, and the speaker's accuser was driven from the floor in
                            discomfiture.</p>

                        <p>I have recently read a speech of Henry Clay on the abolition of slavery.
                            It was of course delivered prior to the war between the states, and it
                            was at a period when congress was being flooded with petitions praying
                            for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. It is
                            interesting as a bit of ancient history, and on account of <pb
                                id="VAA3932-361" n="354"/> the illustrious career of the great
                            statesman who delivered it, I quote:</p>
                        <p>"I prefer the liberty of my own country to that of any other people; and
                            the liberty of my own race to that of any other race. The liberty of the
                            descendants of Africa in the United States is incompatible with the
                            safety and liberty of the European descendants. Their slavery forms an
                            exception&#151;an exception resulting from a stern and inexorable
                            necessity&#151;to the general liberty in the United States. We did
                            not originate, nor are responsible for this necessity. * * *</p>
                        <p>"I beseech the Abolitionists themselves solemnly to pause in their mad
                            and fatal course. Amid that infinite variety of the objects of humanity
                            and benevolence which invite the employment of their energies let them
                            select some one more harmless, that does not threaten to deluge our
                            country in blood. I call upon that small portion of the clergy which has
                            lent itself to those wild and ruinous schemes, not to forget the holy
                            nature of the divine mission of the Founder of our religion, and to
                            profit by his peaceful example. I entreat that portion of my
                            country-women who have given their countenance to abolition, to remember
                            that they are ever most loved and honored <hi rend="i">when moving in
                                their own appropriate and delightful sphere;</hi> and to reflect
                            that the ink which they shed in subscribing with their fair hands
                            abolition petitions, may prove but the prelude to the shedding of the
                            blood of their brethren."</p>
                        <p>It must be confessed that Mr. Clay's prophetic utterance as to the
                            shedding of the "blood of their brethren" was amply verified by
                            subsequent events.</p>

                            with that other wise saying that it was easier to pay a large debt than
                            a small one. However, reading, observation and reflection have convinced
                            me that Plutarch's observation is true.</p>
                        <p>It has been said, truly, I believe, that prosperity tries the human heart
                            with more powerful temptation&#151;that we struggle with adversity,
                            but success undermines our principles. Misfortune is a severe teacher
                            and in many people develops virtues, though Balzac insists that it only
                            does so in virtuous people. Gladstone declared that it is only by cruel
                            suffering that nations are sometimes born to a better life, and that so
                            it is with individual man. That adversity is the greatest of all
                            teachers will not be denied.</p>
                        <p>We recall the lines of the dramatic bard:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"Sweet are the uses of adversity:</l>
                            <l n="2">Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</l>
                            <l n="3">Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>Petrarch is regarded as one of the greatest names of modern Europe. Mr.
                            Knight observes that "his eminent services to mankind as one of the
                            restorers of learning, exhibit the union, which pertains to the highest
                            intellects <pb id="VAA3932-363" n="356"/> alone, of the imaginative with
                            the practical." Petrarch had strong convictions upon the subject under
                            consideration. After reciting that the vulgar, and even some
                            philosophers, have decided that adverse fortune was most difficult to
                            sustain, he says: "For my own part, I am of a different opinion, and
                            believe it more easy to support adversity than prosperity; and that
                            fortune is more treacherous and dangerous when she caresses than when
                            she dismays. Experience has taught me this, not books or arguments."</p>
                        <p>It is not a matter of surprise when Pascal declares, that there is no
                            more perilous ordeal through which man can pass&#151;no greater
                            curse which can be imposed on him, as he is at present
                            constituted&#151;than that of being condemned to walk his life long
                            in the sunlight of unshaded prosperity.</p>

                        <p>I have been urged to append to this volume a sketch of my own life. It
                            was no part of my original purpose to do so, but the request emanates
                            from a source which renders it equivalent to a command.</p>
                        <p>That the book is primarily intended for the perusal of my numerous
                            relations, especially those of the younger generation from whom an
                            account of the vicissitudes of life I have long been separated, is an
                            additional reason for appending this sketch.</p>
                        <p>The author is a native of Owingsville, the county seat of Bath county,
                            Kentucky. The town is located on a high hill five miles from Preston, a
                            station on the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio railway. The most indifferent
                            traveler cannot fail to be impressed by the beauty of the drive from the
                            town to the station&#151;with the regular alternation of hill and
                            dale. Having arrived in the town, the view from its streets, of hills
                            and valleys, and cultivated farms, is one of marvelous beauty. John C.
                            Breckenridge, who had traveled in many lands, and who, after the fall of
                            the Confederacy, selected southern France as his temporary abode on
                            account of its resemblance to his beloved central Kentucky, dilated with
                            much enthusiasm upon the exquisite beauty of this landscape. Though the
                            population of the town is less than two thousand, it has furnished to
                            Indiana two of her illustrious <pb id="VAA3932-366" n="360"/> Governors,
                            Henry S. Lane and Claude Matthews. The birthplace and home of the famous
                            Confederate general, John B. Hood, situated on its principal street, is
                            still intact.</p>
                        <p>The little town is not devoid of historic interest. Near the beginning of
                            the last century the original proprietor, Colonel Thomas Dye Owings, for
                            whom the town was named, erected an immense mansion of brick and stone,
                            much of the material for the structure having been hauled overland from
                            Baltimore. At the back end of the great wide hall is a circular stairway
                            running to the third floor, of easy ascent, with low broad steps, and
                            with balustrades of mahogany, hand carved. In the front hall is a large
                            open fireplace behind which is a secret stairway leading to a
                            subterranean passage. The immense thickness of the walls, and its
                            private stairways and subterranean passages would indicate that the
                            superstructure was originally intended for purposes of war rather than
                            as the peaceful abode of man.</p>
                        <p>In the mansion Colonel Owings entertained for a considerable period,
                            Louis-Philippe, the lineal descendant of a younger brother of the great
                            French monarch, Louis XIV. In his own country, Louis had been proscribed
                            along with Demouriez, and entered upon a period of twenty-one years of
                            exile from France, beginning in 1793 and ending with his return to Paris
                            in 1814. The time was spent partly in Switzerland and other European
                            countries, partly in the Spanish-American colonies and partly in the
                            United States. His sojourn with Colonel Owings was of long duration.
                            Subsequently, in 1830, he ascended the throne of France.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-367" n="361"/>
                        <p>This historic mansion is now used as a hotel with business rooms on the
                            lower floor. The barber shop, which I patronized during a recent visit
                            there, was one of the suite of rooms occupied by the distinguished
                            French exile.</p>
                        <p>The county derived its name from the numerous mineral springs within its
                            limits. The Olympian springs, eight miles south of Owingsville, was
                            frequented by Mr. Clay when he was not engaged in the discharge of his
                            arduous duties in Washington. The county has a diversified surface,
                            gently undulating, hilly and mountainous. It has been said that there
                            are certain finely strung and sensitive natures whose spirits are
                            affected not only by the climate, but by the scenery amid which they
                            live. In this historic old county of Bath will be found the hills and
                            the mountains in close juxtaposition; the latter to exercise a purifying
                            influence upon one's feelings, the former to calm and tranquilize one's
                            mind. Many of the world's celebrities have sincerely preferred wild
                            nature to a cultivated garden; an individual of this temperament and
                            with such predilections would be delighted with certain portions of the
                            county. We recall that Herbert Spencer, who was by many supposed to be
                            devoid of esthetic perception, affirmed that the sight of a mountain and
                            music heard in a cathedral were two of the things that moved him
                            most.</p>
                        <p>Too much cannot be said in commendation of the inhabitants of this
                            county. In general, they not only love their homes but also their
                            fields, their forests, and all inanimate objects about them; they have a
                            chivalrous respect for women; they are hospitable, kindly and courteous,
                                <pb id="VAA3932-368" n="362"/> but not deficient in courage; they
                            have a delicate sense of honor; covetousness, corruption, the low
                            temptation of money, have not yet found any place in their politics;
                            they have never pushed thrift to the loathsome excess of an inhuman
                            avarice; and you will look in vain for the miser whose eyes have the
                            yellow metallic glitter of the coin over which he broods.</p>
                        <p>At the time of which I write the county court in Kentucky convened once
                            each month; in our county on the first Mondays. The court had exclusive
                            probate jurisdiction and, in addition, exercised the powers which in
                            Indiana are vested in the board of county commissioners. The clerk of
                            this court was also authorized by law to take acknowledgement of deeds,
                            mortgages, and other instruments of writing. Notaries public were then
                            unknown in that section. When I was eleven years old I became deputy
                            clerk of this court and, upon a recent visit to the county, I called at
                            the clerk's office and examined deed record 58, which was written by me,
                            and made the discovery that my handwriting at that time was fairly good,
                            however much it may have since deteriorated. When the acknowledgement of
                            a deed was to be taken outside of the office it usually devolved upon me
                            to attend to the business. I have a vivid recollection of one of my
                            first official acts of this kind. It was in the country. The law then
                            required that the wife should be examined separate and apart from the
                            husband in order to learn for a certainty whether she executed the paper
                            of her own free will and accord, and without any coercion or compulsion
                            of her husband. After the husband and wife had signed the paper I <pb
                                id="VAA3932-369" n="363"/> asked the husband to step outside. He
                            turned to me and with a very serious expression of countenance he said
                            something like this: "I have been affronted several times in my life but
                            this is the first time that I have been ordered out of my own house."
                            Silence reigned for a moment, for it really seemed to me that the
                            gentleman had some ground for his indignation, but I had received strict
                            orders and explicit instructions as to my duties, and finally mustered
                            up courage to say to him: "I am very sorry, but you will have to go."
                            The serious aspect of his countenance at once gave way to a complacent
                            smile and he bowed himself out. I then proceeded to propound the
                            prescribed questions to the wife who, from her manner and countenance,
                            must have derived considerable amusement from the incident.</p>
                        <p>At the age of thirteen I was promoted to the deputy clerkship of the
                            circuit court. This court had the same jurisdiction as our circuit court
                            in Indiana. When court was in session it was my duty to be constantly by
                            the side of the clerk in the courtroom to render him any assistance
                            possible. In the light of my subsequent experience and observation I am
                            prepared to say that the local bar was of more than ordinary ability,
                            and many able lawyers from other counties practised in our court, some
                            of them afterwards attaining high distinction in the profession. The
                            late Solomon Claypool told me many years ago in a conversation had in
                            the courtroom at Shelbyville, that he had been called to Owingsville as
                            counsel in an important will case and that one of the opposing counsel
                            was one of the most brilliant and able lawyers he had ever met. The
                            lawyers traveled from <pb id="VAA3932-370" n="364"/> county to county
                            after the manner of the members of the Irish bar&#151;usually on
                            horseback. The brilliant Shiel with much pride and satisfaction declared
                            in the first sentence of one of the chapters of his book: "I am an Irish
                            barrister and go to the Leinster circuit."</p>
                        <p>Very soon after I became deputy clerk of the circuit court and when I was
                            in my fourteenth year, Mr. Turner, the clerk, sent me on a business
                            errand to Ashland, the home of Henry Glay, near Lexington. The distance
                            was fifty miles&#151;a long ride on horseback, and it was the
                            longest and most important journey I had made alone up to that time. My
                            steed was known throughout the community as "Travey Daniels' big mule."
                            It was immense in its proportions, being more than eighteen hands high.
                            Along the public road and in every town and hamlet through which I
                            passed, the big mule was the cynosure of all eyes, and the boy rider was
                            so completely ignored that he almost became jealous of the mule. It was
                            when I was passing through one of the main streets of the little city of
                            Mt. Sterling that my animal decided, presumably after mature
                            deliberation, that he would proceed no farther, for the present at
                            least. Finally, a very considerable portion of the population, young and
                            old, turned out and with boards and sticks and other instruments of
                            torture, pounded him until they became exhausted but he did not budge an
                            inch. Finally, after the pounding had ceased, and a sufficient period
                            had elapsed to convince the audience that he had not been intimidated,
                            my animal proceeded on his journey. In other words, he started when he
                            got ready and not before.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-371" n="365"/>
                        <p>I arrived at Lexington late that evening, stopped at the Ph&#156;nix
                            Hotel over night and very early in the morning rode out to Ashland. The
                            home was occupied by the descendants or relatives of Mr. Clay, who died
                            only a few years before. Breakfast was about over but the family
                            insisted, and would not take "no" for an answer, that I must eat my
                            breakfast there. I did so. After the purpose of my errand had been
                            accomplished and I was about starting on my return journey, I was
                            impressed by the kind solicitude of the ladies of the household as to my
                            comfort on my long ride, the morning being quite cool.</p>
                        <p>Young as I then was I appreciated the fact that I was on consecrated
                            ground; but of course I was not then familiar with the career of the
                            great pacificator&#151;how he, as a senator from Kentucky, a state
                            situated midway in the union, had sought to obliterate sectional
                            animosities and bring the sections together in bonds of amity and peace.
                            I did not then know of the great statesmanlike measure he proposed, that
                            would have accomplished the double purpose of extinguishing slavery and
                            averting civil war, and which met with the bitter opposition of the
                            extreme Abolition agitators&#151;an opposition based solely upon a
                            flimsy and hypocritical subterfuge. As a mere child, of course I was not
                            familiar with the plan that he offered, which was this: to buy the
                            slaves newly born until finally, by extinction of the older ones by
                            death and the freeing of the younger ones by purchase, slavery would
                            disappear. The estimated cost of carrying out this plan was twenty-five
                            million dollars&#151;while the civil war cost one million <pb
                                id="VAA3932-372" n="366"/> lives and ten thousand millions of
                            dollars. Of course I was not then familiar with his earnest and
                            patriotic adjuration to his brother senators to support his measure of
                            pacification, when he assured them that if they would adopt it, and
                            tranquilize the country, he would go home to Ashland and renounce public
                            service for ever&#151;that he would there find amidst his flocks and
                            herds and in the bosom of his family, sincerity and truth, attachment
                            and fidelity, that he had not always found in the walks of public
                            life.</p>
                        <p>Resuming the account of my journey&#151;I reached Mt. Sterling late
                            that evening and remained over night at the hotel. As I had only
                            fourteen miles to go I was not very early in starting next morning.
                            Accidentally I had for my traveling companion an eminent lawyer who was
                            going to the Owingsville court. He had already attained eminence in his
                            profession, and afterwards became chief justice of the Court of Appeals,
                            the highest tribunal in the state.</p>
                        <p>I have always had grave doubts of the wisdom and propriety of telling a
                            joke on oneself, but I cannot refrain from relating an incident of this
                            fourteen-mile journey that is still fresh in my memory. The
                            distinguished gentleman and myself rode leisurely along, side by side,
                            but of course my companion did most of the talking. I knew who he was,
                            as he had frequently attended our court. His conversation and his charm
                            of manner could not fail to impress a boy of fourteen. In the course of
                            our talk he said to me that he had observed my activity in the courtroom
                            and the efficient <pb id="VAA3932-373" n="367"/> aid I had rendered the
                            clerk&#151;in short, that he had a favorable impression of me. He
                            inquired my age and I told him I was just fourteen. He said he had a
                            daughter just one year younger than myself of whom he was very proud,
                            and proceeded in the most delightful way to enumerate her
                            attractions&#151;her charm of manner, her exquisite beauty, her
                            proficiency in her studies and many other things of a commendatory
                            nature.</p>
                        <p>Before the end of our journey he indicated to me very clearly that he
                            would be willing, when the proper time arrived, that his daughter should
                            become my wife. I do not remember what I said, but I do remember that
                            even at that early age of fourteen I was overwhelmed with delight that
                            so distinguished a gentleman should express a willingness that his
                            charming daughter might some day become my bride. I had never seen her,
                            but felt sure she must be fascinating. I at once became saturated with a
                            great wave of tranquillity and joy, and felt that I was at peace with
                            all the world "and the rest of mankind."</p>
                        <p>On the following day, while we were sitting at our desks during a brief
                            cessation of the business of the court, Mr. Turner, the clerk, remarked
                            to me: "So Mr. _____," referring to my traveling companion of the day
                            previous, "promised you his daughter yesterday." I did not deign to
                            reply, for I was amazed that a matter of so delicate a nature should so
                            soon reach the public ear. The clerk, who was a most genial gentleman
                            and excessively fond of fun, broke forth in a perfect <pb
                                id="VAA3932-374" n="368"/> gale of laughter. When his hilarity had
                            subsided he turned to me and said seriously, "My son, Mr._____has no
                            children."</p>
                        <p>We find unique characters in almost every community, and our county was
                            no exception. Being myself of a pacific disposition and temperament, it
                            is difficult for me to conceive how any man could have a natural and
                            inherent fondness for fighting; however, we had such an one in our
                            county. On county court days and other public occasions he was usually
                            in evidence on the streets of Owingsville. He was about the medium
                            height and compactly built, and his placid and benevolent expression of
                            countenance would indicate that he was either a minister of the gospel
                            or a philanthropist bent on doing good to human kind. He was agreeable
                            and affable, and his voice and manner suggested a serene mind and happy
                            disposition. The earmarks of the ruffian were nowhere to be seen. But
                            the observer was not long in finding out when this gentle individual was
                            on the warpath. Passing through the crowd, hat in hand, occasionally
                            bowing, first to the right and then to the left, and continually
                            uttering these words: "Gentlemen, it is an invariable rule of my life to
                            give no insults and take none." Before he finished his tour the fight
                            was on, sometimes ending in victory, sometimes in discomfiture. It would
                            seem that the principle, usually referred to the age of chivalry, that
                            sin loses half its evil by losing all its grossness, would have some
                            application here.</p>
                        <p>I will relate one other incident along this line. It was the case of a
                            man well advanced in years. He had <pb id="VAA3932-375" n="369"/> borne
                            a great reputation as a fighter, but for several years had been a quiet
                            and law-abiding citizen and respected by his neighbors. When he came to
                            town and was in a reminiscent mood he never lacked for auditors. He said
                            that at one time he had a grudge against a man who had moved from Bath
                            to the adjoining county of Nicholas, and having business in the latter
                            county he decided that while there he would look for his enemy and whip
                            him. He discovered him one day in the town of Carlisle, the county seat,
                            conversing with some men on the street corner. The old man said that he
                            approached and, having first asked the pardon of the other men for the
                            interruption, he soundly abused and denounced his ancient enemy, who
                            made no reply but walked away leisurely, stopping at the end of the next
                            block. Not to be thwarted in his purpose, the old man said that he
                            followed the object of his wrath and repeated his abuse and
                            denunciation. His enemy again moved on and stopped at another corner. He
                            again followed, having in the meantime thought of some additional ugly
                            things to say, and literally poured out the vials of his wrath, but his
                            enemy made no reply. "I finally filliped him on the nose with my
                            finger," said the old man. At this point he artfully paused in his
                            narrative. We were all intensely interested but said nothing. At last he
                            resumed, saying, "I was unconscious twelve hours and in bed for thirty
                            days." I note this incident as an additional illustration and
                            confirmation of the great truth that there are times when forbearance
                            ceases to be a virtue.</p>
                        <p>Major John C. Mason for a number of years represented <pb
                                id="VAA3932-376" n="370"/> our district, the ninth, in congress. He
                            had served with distinction in the Mexican war and was a man of striking
                            personality. He was tall with square shoulders, well-proportioned,
                            straight as an arrow, a Roman cast of features with a military aspect
                            and bearing. He was not a highly educated man and was not endowed with
                            great oratorical powers, but he had great force of character and an
                            indomitable will&#151;was thoroughly familiar with the political
                            issues of that day and was most formidable in debate. Our congressional
                            district was composed of a dozen or more counties and Major Mason was a
                            resident of our county. If I am not mistaken, Mrs. Mason was a daughter
                            of Colonel Thomas Dye Owings, to whom I have already referred.</p>
                        <p>In the summer of 1858, Major Mason, without solicitation on my part, or
                            on the part of my friends, so far as I know, tendered me the appointment
                            to the Naval academy at Annapolis from our district. I accepted the
                            appointment, but with some trepidation, as a friend of mine, whose
                            capabilities I conceived to be at least equal to my own, had just failed
                            to pass his examination for admission to West Point. Accompanying my
                            appointment was a printed list of defects and disabilities, any one of
                            which would warrant the rejection of the appointee. The list was of
                            almost interminable length and I was not at all surprised to learn that
                            each year a large proportion of the appointees were rejected on their
                            physical examinations.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, I passed both examinations, physical and academic. I entered
                            the institution in September; Admiral Dewey had graduated the preceding
                            June; <pb id="VAA3932-377" n="371"/> Admirals Schley and Watson and
                            Philip had been there two years, and Admiral Sampson one year. Admiral
                            Terry, who recently died, entered the institution when I did.</p>
                        <p>Would like to say here, lest I forget it, that I have always entertained
                            the opinion that the President of the United States should appoint an
                            able and experienced naval officer as secretary of the navy. He would
                            best know the needs of the service and the means of attaining the
                            highest degree of efficiency. A landsman, whatever his capabilities may
                            be in other directions, when appointed to this position, has everything
                            to learn. He is ignorant even of matters of smallest detail and will at
                            times necessarily become an object of commiseration.</p>
                        <p>It will be remembered that Richard W. Thompson, of Indiana, was appointed
                            by President Hayes Secretary of the Navy. It was said of Thompson,
                            truly, no doubt, that he was a very interesting character, a man of
                            great common sense, public spirit, with a wonderful memory, and a rare
                            fund of knowledge of the political history of the Northwest. But who
                            will assert that his appointment to this high and responsible position
                            was conducive to the best interests of the service.</p>
                        <p>Senator Hoar relates that at Secretary Sherman's dinner he asked
                            Secretary Thompson across the table to which mast of a man-of-war the
                            American flag should be attached. That Thompson coughed and stammered a
                            little and said, "I think I shall refer that question to the
                            attorney-general."</p>
                        <p>The appointment of a merchant or a doctor to the <pb id="VAA3932-378"
                                n="372"/> supreme bench would be no more incongruous and
                            inappropriate than the appointment of a politician to be secretary of
                            the navy.</p>
                        <p>This condition is no doubt owing in a great measure to the importunate
                            demands of the politicians. They are not content even with the sun, moon
                            and stars, and the whole planetary system, but they want everything that
                            is in heaven above, in the earth beneath and in the water under the
                            earth.</p>
                        <p>When I was at the academy Captain George S. Blake was the superintendent,
                            and Commander Thomas T. Cravens was commandant of midshipmen. The other
                            officers were Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Wyman, Lieutenants Wood,
                            Davidson, Simpson McGunnigle and Waddell&#151;and others.</p>
                        <p>In June of the next year, 1859, our class and the first class, one
                            hundred and seven of us in all, made our cruise for practice in the
                            United States sloop of war Plymouth, twenty-two guns&#151;visiting
                            England, France, Spain and the island of Madeira. Captain Cravens was in
                            command of our ship, and among our other officers were Wyman, Wood,
                            McGunnigle and Waddell. On our return we reached Hampton Roads about
                            September 20th. We were twenty-eight days in making the cruise from the
                            capes of Virginia to Plymouth, England, a long period indeed, when
                            compared with the time now made by our steamers.</p>
                        <p>On the fourth of July we boarded a French fishing vessel off the banks of
                            Newfoundland and bought some fresh fish. The Frenchman was alarmed when
                            he observed the formidable and belligerent appearance of our <pb
                                id="VAA3932-379" n="373"/> vessel, thinking that war had been
                            declared and that our visit was hostile in its nature rather than
                            commercial.</p>
                        <p>The recent Titanic disaster recalls to my mind the vigilance and care
                            exercised in taking the temperature of the water. Fortunately, we
                            encountered no iceberg and did not even see any floating ice, but the
                            fog was dense. When we consider the delightful climate of Newfoundland,
                            it is difficult to realize that its coast is a perpetual menace to
                            navigation. The climate is more temperate than that of most portions of
                            the neighboring continent. It is rarely, and then only for a few hours,
                            that the thermometer sinks below zero in the winter, while the summer
                            range rarely exceeds 80$$ Fahrenheit, and for the most part does not
                            rise above 70$$. For eight years the maximum at St. John's was 83$$ and
                            the minimum 7$$. Tornadoes are unknown and thunder-storms are very
                            rare.</p>
                        <p>The existence of icebergs in this vicinity is accounted for by the fact
                            that the banks of Newfoundland are swept by the cold Labrador current
                            and the icebergs are frequently stranded upon them. The gulf stream,
                            while it modifies the cold, creates fogs; the latter, however, are
                            confined to the shores and bays of the southeastern and southern
                            coasts.</p>
                        <p>After twenty-eight days at sea we were supremely happy when we arrived at
                            Plymouth. Our provender on the voyage had not been of the daintiest and
                            most luxurious character, and we were enabled to realize our fond
                            anticipations of ham and eggs and other delicacies. Fourteen miles off
                            Plymouth, at Eddystone Rocks, we passed the historic Eddystone
                            Lighthouse, which was <pb id="VAA3932-380" n="374"/> constructed more
                            than two centuries ago. Being fully exposed to the southwestern seas and
                            winds the buffetings of the winds and waves are terriffic, and the
                            frequent damage by storms has necessitated the rebuliding of the
                            lighthouse a number of times. For several years prior to 1878 its safety
                            had been a matter of anxiety and watchful care, owing to the great
                            tremor of the building with each wave stroke. In 1882 a new tower was
                            completed.</p>
                        <p>We also passed Mount Edgecumbe, the estate of the Earl of Edgecumbe. Its
                            beautiful grounds and wooded slopes are still fresh in my memory.</p>
                        <p>We learned that Plymouth, with a population of about sixty-five thousand,
                            held a leading position in the country as a naval station; and it was
                            from this port that the Pilgrim fathers sailed for America.</p>
                        <p>We went ashore and visited the city in squads of a dozen or more at a
                            time&#151;dressed in our uniforms, of course&#151;and in passing
                            through the streets we learned that the custom of squads of men
                            congregating on street corners for observation and social conversation
                            is not exclusively American. I distinctly remember hearing one man say
                            to his associates, referring to us, "They must be Austrians."</p>
                        <p>After remaining in Plymouth about ten days we crossed the English Channel
                            to Brest, France, which then had a population of about sixty thousand.
                            This city is also a great naval station. At the time of our visit it
                            possessed comparatively few buildings of importance with the exception
                            of those connected with the great naval establishment. One of the most
                            pleasing <pb id="VAA3932-381" n="375"/> incidents of our week's sojourn
                            in Brest was our meeting a number of French midshipmen. As a rule, they
                            were handsome and accomplished, and their manners fascinating.</p>
                        <p>Leaving Brest, our next destination was Cadiz, Spain.</p>
                        <p>In 1809 Lord Byron wrote to his mother: "Cadiz, sweet Cadiz!&#151;it
                            is the first spot in the creation. The beauty of its streets and
                            mansions is only excelled by the loveliness of its inhabitants. It is a
                            complete Cythera, full of the finest women in Spain; the Cadiz belles
                            being the Lancashire witches of their land."</p>
                        <p>The character and purpose of our visit, and its brevity, of course
                            precluded the possibility of verifying the truth of the foregoing
                            rhapsody.</p>
                        <p>To reach Cadiz we must encounter the inhospitable and turbulent Bay of
                            Biscay. I have read of a voyage where the writer declared: "The coast
                            was rocky, the night was dark, and the Bay of Biscay ran high." We had a
                            like experience. This vast gulf or bay is enclosed by the northern coast
                            of Spain and the western coast of France. In the Spanish portion the
                            water is about two hundred fathoms deep, while in the French portion it
                            is only about twenty. The strong westerly winds uniformly impede
                            navigation.</p>
                        <p>We had a regular ship's crew and the midshipmen were divided into four
                            watches. Our watch went on deck at four in the morning. We found Captain
                            Cravens on deck, a very unusual thing, as he appears there only in times
                            of emergency. The storm was still raging furiously but had abated
                            somewhat and at that hour we were returning to Brest for repairs. The
                                <pb id="VAA3932-382" n="376"/> bobstays of the ship had been carried
                            away or parted and perhaps some other damage was done. The bobstays are
                            chains to confine the bowsprit of a ship downwards to the stem or
                            cutwater. We remained in Brest two or three days and again sailed for
                            Cadiz, which we reached without any mishap.</p>
                        <p>The population of Cadiz at that time was about seventy thousand. Seen
                            from a distance off the coast it presented a magnificent display of
                            snowwhite turrets rising magnificently from the sea; and from the
                            uniformity and elegance of its buildings it ranked as one of the finest
                            cities of Spain. It is required that every house in the city shall
                            annually receive a coating of whitewash.</p>
                        <p>The most characteristic feature of Cadiz is the marine promenades,
                            fringing the city all round between the ramparts and the sea, especially
                            that called the Almeda.</p>
                        <p>Some conception may be had of the mildness and serenity of the climate,
                            when it is considered that the mean annual temperature is 64$$
                            Fahrenheit, while the mean summer and winter temperatures vary only
                            about 10$$ above and below that point.</p>
                        <p>We remained in Cadiz about ten days and then set sail for Funchal, the
                            capital of the Madeiras. This archipelago is a group of islands in the
                            North Atlantic ocean belonging to Portugal, consisting of two inhabited
                            islands named Madeira and Port Santo, and three uninhabited rocks, named
                            collectively the Desertas.</p>
                        <p>Madeira, the largest island, has a length of thirty miles, an extreme
                            breadth of thirteen miles, and a coast <pb id="VAA3932-383" n="377"/>
                            line of eighty miles. Its longer axis lies east and west, in which
                            direction it is traversed by a mountain chain. The inhabitants of the
                            island at the time of our visit numbered about eighty thousand, the
                            number of females being a little in excess of the males.</p>
                        <p>Funchal, the capital, lies on the south coast of Madeira, about 360 miles
                            from the coast of Africa, 535 miles from Lisbon and 1,215 miles from
                            Plymouth. It has a population of 18,000 and the immediate neighborhood
                            was inhabited by about as many more.</p>
                        <p>The town is seen to great advantage from the bay, lying on its curving
                            shore, and backed by an amphitheater of lofty mountains, some of them
                            4,000 feet in height. Numerous country homes with terraced gardens, and
                            surrounded by vineyards, adorn the slopes, and give an air of
                            cheerfulness to the landscape.</p>
                        <p>The remarkable mildness both in summer and winter of the climate of
                            Madeira, though it lies only 10$$ north of the Tropic of Cancer, is said
                            to be owing to its being surounded by a great ocean, from which the
                            atmosphere obtains a large amount of watery vapor. The thermometer has
                            never been known to fall as low as 46$$ at Funchal, hence frost and snow
                            are there wholly unknown. However, there is an occasional fall of snow
                            in the mountains above the altitude of 2,000 feet. Thunder-storms are
                            rare and scarcely ever violent.</p>
                        <p>Madeira has long had a high reputation as a sanitary resort for persons
                            suffering from diseases of the chest. Sir James Clark, in his work on
                                <hi rend="i">Climate,</hi> says: "When we take into consideration
                            the mildness of the winter and the coolness of the summer, together with
                            the remarkable <pb id="VAA3932-384" n="378"/> equality of the
                            temperature during the day and night, as well as throughout the year, we
                            may safely conclude that the climate of Madeira is the finest in the
                            Northern hemisphere." It has also been suggested that the island
                            possesses one great advantage over most other places frequented by
                            invalids in affording cool and comfortable summer quarters on the hills,
                            so that they have no need to make a long journey for the purpose of
                            escaping from the heat.</p>
                        <p>For one who is no longer engaged in the activities of life, and who
                            possesses in a fair degree the gift of meditation, and who can, in large
                            measure, live happily with himself and his memories&#151;and to whom
                            the breath of popular applause is not essential to happiness, I have
                            always regarded Madeira as an ideal place of abode.</p>
                        <p>As illustrative of the severity of naval discipline I wish to note this
                            incident. When we came to anchor and were shortening sail in Funchal a
                            sailor on the main royal yard, in furling, got astride the yard instead
                            of standing on the foot-ropes. Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Wyman had
                            charge of the deck and he sang out to the man through his trumpet: "Lay
                            down from aloft, you infernal soldier." I was informed that he was
                            placed in double irons. The warships of other nations were lying at
                            anchor in the harbor, which of course aggravated the offense.</p>
                        <p>We remained in Funchal about eight days. Very soon after leaving there,
                            in about 30$$ north latitude, we struck the trade winds, those most
                            valuable assets of the navigator. These are steady winds which blow <pb
                                id="VAA3932-385" n="379"/> from the same quarter throughout the
                            year. Their general direction is from northeast to southwest on the
                            north side of the equator, and from southeast to northwest on the south
                            side of the equator.<ref id="ref_69" rend="super" target="note_69"
                                targOrder="U">41</ref>

                                <p>Trade winds are so called because they are of great advantage to
                                    navigators and hence to trade. They are principally limited to
                                    two belts in the tropical regions, one on each side of the
                                    equator.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Our return voyage from Funchal was most delightful; the scenes and
                            incidents have never faded from my memory&#151;the steady trade
                            winds&#151;the soft and bewitching climate of the
                            tropics&#151;the beautiful moonlight nights&#151;the sailors on
                            deck singing in concert "We are homeward bound"&#151;to my mind form
                            a picture of perfect serenity and peace.</p>
                        <p>We arrived at Hampton Roads about September 20, coincident with the
                            arrival of the equinoctial storm. When we reached Annapolis we found
                            there the new fourth class just admitted. It is with much interest and
                            curiosity that the older classes observe and measure the new arrivals.
                            They come from the four quarters of the country, each one bringing with
                            him the manners, thoughts and provincialisms, idiosyncrasies, the tone
                            of voice and accent, peculiar to the community in which he was born and
                            bred. Their ages range from 16 to 20. We see Maine and Louisiana,
                            California and Virginia, in close juxtaposition. To the older classes
                            some of the new students are transparent, some translucent, some opaque.
                            Rude customs and manners and rough jokes are soon to be obliterated by
                            attrition and association with the older cadets; but during the three
                            years I was at the institution I do not remember a single <pb
                                id="VAA3932-386" n="380"/> instance of hazing. Such words as "fool,"
                            "liar," etc., uttered in jest, are soon eliminated from their
                            vocabularies. They cease using the phrase, "come on, boys," and in lieu
                            thereof say "come on, fellows." In short, they become, in outward aspect
                            at least, gentlemen in deportment and manners.</p>
                        <p>On the tenth of October, less than a month after our return to the
                            academy, the first guns of the war between the states were fired by John
                            Brown and his associates in their raid upon Harper's Ferry. We were
                            young and did not then fully appreciate the awful significance of this
                            event.</p>
                        <p>Our three months' leave of absence began in the following June (1860). In
                            due time the Baltimore tailors came to Annapolis to take our measures
                            for clothes to be worn while on leave. The uniforms which they made for
                            us were pronounced the perfection of tailoring&#151;and uniforms at
                            that time were exceedingly rare, and hence more highly appreciated. We
                            considered the question of dress one of primary importance; we have long
                            since learned, however, that clothes do not make the man. But it must be
                            admitted that a stranger of either sex is, as a rule, judged by his or
                            her attire, however unjust this may be.</p>
                        <p>It has been said by the highest masculine authority that the love of
                            becoming ornament in woman is not to be regarded in the light of vanity,
                            but that it is an instinct which she has received from nature to give
                            effect to those charms that are her defense, and that the choice and
                            arangement of dress is calculated to bestow an ineffable grace over
                            beauty. With man the <pb id="VAA3932-387" n="381"/> case is wholly
                            different; but upon our return to the academy in September, it was the
                            consensus of opinion that we were in some degree indebted to the
                            exquisite skill of the Baltimore tailor for the cordiality of the
                            reception given us by the young ladies whom it was our good fortune to
                            meet while on leave.</p>
                        <p>Late in 1860, and during the early period of 1861, the most intense
                            excitement prevailed among the cadets on account of the increasing
                            hostility between the North and South. The great newspapers, such as the
                            New York Tribune and the New York Herald, were carefully scanned each
                            day for new developments, and the editorials were provocative of much
                            discussion but of little or no acrimony. The almost universal expression
                            was that the Southern states had a constitutional right to secede, and
                            the wrong of coercion was by every one reprobated. For example, my
                            classmate and personal friend, Giles F. Appleton, of Vermont, proverbial
                            for his geniality and conservatism, would become thoroughly aroused with
                            indignation at the bare suggestion of the coercion of the Southern
                            states.</p>
                        <p>At the present day all true patriots must accept the doctrine that this
                            is an indissoluble union of indestructible states; but the actual
                            conditions at the beginning of the war have been misrepresented or
                            concealed by unscrupulous politicians, and the younger and rising
                            generation have thus far been deceived as to the real status of affairs
                            at that time. In what I may say my purpose is to tell the plain
                            unvarnished truth, not being either presently or prospectively a
                            candidate for office&#151;and being therefore wholly undeterred by
                            the <pb id="VAA3932-388" n="382"/> coquetries of public opinion. If I
                            were out in the district for votes I might, like some of my good
                            friends, tell, not what I believed, but what they, the voters, would be
                            most delighted to hear.</p>
                        <p>The younger generation in the North have been taught to believe, by
                            fulminations from the pulpit, the press, and the hustings, that
                            immediately preceding the beginning of the war between the states, the
                            South stood alone in the assertion of the doctrine of the right of
                            secession and the wrong of coercion&#151;that secession was a
                            criminal political heresy exclusively peculiar to the Southern states
                            and indigenous to that section. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
                            Down to the very time of the formation of the Confederate government
                            many of the leaders of public opinion in the North, of both parties,
                            admitted the right of secession and distinctly disclaimed any purpose of
                            coercion. Horace Greeley's paper, the New York Tribune&#151;the
                            leading organ of the party which triumphed in the election of
                            1860&#151;said, after the election and before the inauguration of
                            Mr. Lincoln:</p>
                        <p>"We hold, with Jefferson, to the inalienable right of communities to
                            alter or abolish forms of government that have become oppressive or
                            injurious; and, if the cotton states shall decide that they can do
                            better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in
                            peace. The right to secede may be a revolutionary right, <hi rend="i"
                                >but it exists, nevertheless.</hi> We must ever resist the asserted
                            right of any state to remain in the union and nullify or defy the laws
                            thereof: <hi rend="i">to withdraw from the union is quite another
                                matter.</hi> And, whenever a <pb id="VAA3932-389" n="383"/>
                            considerable section of our union shall deliberately resolve to go out,
                                <hi rend="i">we shall resist all coercive measures designed to keep
                                her in. We hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is
                                pinned to the residue by bayonets."</hi>

                            </note>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again Mr. Greeley says, in his paper, the New York Tribune: "If the
                            cotton states wish to withdraw from the union, they should be allowed to
                            do so; and any attempt to compel them to remain, by force, would be
                            contrary to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the
                            fundamental ideas upon which human liberty is based. As the Declaration
                            of Independence justified the secession from the British Empire of three
                            millions of subjects in 1776, it was not seen why it would not justify
                            the secession of five millions of Southerners from the Union in
                            1861."</p>
                        <p>The Albany Argus, about the same time, said in language which Mr. Greeley
                            characterizes as "clear and temperate:"</p>
                        <p>"We sympathize with and justify the South as far as this: their rights
                            have been invaded to the extreme limit possible within the forms of the
                            constitution; and, beyond this limit, their feelings have been insulted
                            and their interests and honor assailed by almost every possible form of
                            denunciation and invective; and, if we deemed it certain that the real
                            animus of the Republican party could be carried into the administration
                            of the federal government, and become the permanent policy of the
                            nation, we should think that all the instincts of self-preservation and
                            of manhood rightfully <pb id="VAA3932-390" n="384"/> impelled them to a
                            resort to revolution and a separation from the Union, and we would
                            applaud them and wish them Godspeed in the adoption of such a remedy."
                            Subsequently the same paper said: "If South Carolina or any other state,
                            through a convention of her people, shall formally separate herself from
                            the Union, probably both the present and the next executive will simply
                            let her alone and <hi rend="i">quietly allow all the functions of the
                                federal government within her limits to be suspended. Any other
                                course would be madness;</hi> as it would at once enlist all the
                            Southern states in the controversy and plunge the whole country into a
                            civil war. * * * As a matter of policy and wisdom, therefore,
                            independent of the question of right, we should deem resort to force
                            most disastrous."</p>
                        <p>The New York Herald, a journal which claimed to be independent of all
                            party influences, about the same period said: "Each state is organized
                            as a complete government, holding the purse and wielding the sword,
                            possessing the right to break the tie of the confederation as a nation
                            might break a treaty, and to repel coercion as a nation might repel
                            invasion. * * * Coercion, if it were possible, is out of the question."
                            These articles were reproduced, with approval by other journals
                            throughout the country.</p>
                        <p>On the thirty-first of January, 1861, after six states had already
                            seceded, a great meeting was held in the city of New York, to consider
                            the perilous condition of the country. James S. Thayer, "an old-line
                            Whig," made a speech, which was received with great applause.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-391" n="385"/>
                        <p>He said, among other things, "We can at least, in an authoritative way
                            and a practical manner, arrive at the basis of a <hi rend="i">peaceable
                                separation.</hi> (Cheers.) * * * If the incoming administration
                            shall attempt to carry out the line of policy that has been
                            foreshadowed, we announce that, when the hand of black Republicanism
                            turns to bloodshed, and seeks <hi rend="i">from the fragment of the
                                constitution to construct a scaffolding</hi> for
                            coercion&#151;another name for execution&#151;we will reverse
                            the order of the French revolution, and save the blood of the people by
                            making those who inaugurate a reign of terror the first victims of a
                            national guillotine!" (Enthusiastic applause.) These views seem to have
                            commanded the cordial approval of the great audience.</p>
                        <p>It was at the same meeting that ex-Governor Horatio Seymour asked the
                            question whether "successful coercion by the North is less revolutionary
                            than successful secession by the South?"</p>
                        <p>The venerable Chancellor Wolworth, respected, beloved and admired by
                            every one, also addressed this great metropolitan audience. He was
                            regarded as the artizan of our equity laws, and it was said of him that
                            he was the Bentham of America, without the bold speculations and
                            fantastical theories which to a certain extent characterized the great
                            British jurist. An eminent lawyer, in closing the argument of a case
                            before him, among other things, said: "It must be a source of
                            consolation to yourself, as it is of gratification to your friends, that
                            the white robe of justice transmitted from the illustrious men who have
                            gone before you has not, <pb id="VAA3932-392" n="386"/> since it fell
                            upon you, been soiled or rent." It was said of the great chancellor that
                            he "wore a conscience as well as a gown." Read what he said:</p>
                        <p>"It would be as brutal, in my opinion, to send men to butcher our own
                            brothers of the Southern states as it would be to massacre them in the
                            Northern states. We are told, however, that it is our duty to, and we
                            must, enforce the laws. But why&#151;and what laws are to be
                            enforced? There were laws that were to be enforced in the time of the
                            American revolution. * * * Did Lord Chatham go for enforcing those laws?
                            No, he gloried in defense of the liberties of America. He made that
                            memorable declaration in the British parliament, 'If I were an American
                            citizen instead of being, as I am, an Englishman, I never would submit
                            to such laws&#151;never, never, never!'" (Prolonged applause.)</p>
                        <p>It is a well-authenticated fact that "Rawle's View of the Constitution"
                            was used as a text-book at West Point at the time Robert E. Lee and
                            Jefferson Davis were cadets at that institution, and for a long period
                            thereafter. Mr. Rawle, in his work, clearly laid down the doctrine that
                            the Union was dissoluble and that if it should be dissolved, allegiance
                            reverted to the states. This is the pabulum upon which the government
                            fed those who were to command its armies.</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the late Senator Turpie, proverbial for his high
                            scholastic and linguistic attainments, was also well versed in
                            constitutional lore. In a published interview he declared, in <hi
                                rend="i">articulo mortis,</hi> that the construction of the
                            constitution upon which the Southern states based their action was
                            unquestionably correct.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-393" n="387"/>
                        <p>Nearly everywhere the idea of coercion met with the unqualified
                            reprobation of the people. While this sentiment generally prevailed
                            throughout the North there were many violent men appealing to passion
                            and the lust of power, with the view of inciting the multitude and
                            preparing Northern opinion to support a war against the Southern states
                            in the event of their secession. All propositions for peace were
                            contemptuously spurned and refused. The generally accepted construction
                            of the constitution was a formidable obstacle in the path of those who
                            thus sought to precipitate civil war&#151;and their violent
                            antipathy to this sacred instrument induced them finally, through one of
                            their leaders, to denounce the constitution as a "covenant with hell."
                            But they were fertile in expedients and, with much ingenuity, sought to
                            gratify their desire for blood under the delusive and ambiguous guise of
                            the "execution of the laws" and the "protection of public property." It
                            will be remembered that Chancellor Wolworth refers to this fact in his
                            address to the great meeting in New York.</p>
                        <p>During the closing months of his term Mr. Buchanan was divested of all
                            power of molding the future policy of the government. His irresolution
                            and seeming apathy were not the result of his indifference to his
                            country, but rather of his love and veneration for its constitution. It
                            is true that he was free from sectional asperity, but he had studied the
                            constitution and the history of its formation and he was convinced that
                            the federal government had no rightful power to coerce a state. It is
                            but natural that he should become irresolute <pb id="VAA3932-394"
                                n="388"/> and apathetic in exercising a power which, as executive,
                            he did not possess&#151;in violation of his solemn oath of
                            office.</p>
                        <p>He had rendered invaluable service to his country as statesman and
                            diplomatist. He served many years in the lower house of congress and was
                            for a long time in the senate as a contemporary of Calhoun, Clay and
                            Webster. During his diplomatic career he had served as envoy
                            extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to St. Petersburg. In 1845 he
                            was appointed secretary of state under President Polk. In 1853 he
                            accepted from President Pierce the appointment of minister to England.
                            It was while there that Lord Palmerston, referring to the fact that Mr.
                            Buchanan had one defective eye, remarked that he could see as much with
                            one eye as most Englishmen could with two. In 1854 he was the originator
                            and one of the three members of the Ostend conference on the subject of
                            the acquisition of Cuba by the United States, and with his colleagues
                            issued the celebrated Ostend manifesto which declared that on the
                            principle of self-preservation from dangers of the gravest kind, an
                            armed intervention of the United States and the capture of the island
                            from the Spaniards would be justifiable. Even at this late day, one may
                            occasionally hear derogatory remarks about Mr. Buchanan, flippantly made
                            by ignorant or thoughtless persons who have no knowledge or appreciation
                            of his illustrious career.</p>
                        <p>Without any change in the attitude of the seceding states, it was only a
                            few weeks until the conservative and patriotic feeling to which I have
                            referred was swept <pb id="VAA3932-395" n="389"/> away. The elements of
                            sectional hatred obtained complete control and insisted upon an
                            immediate armed invasion of the South. The suddenness and completeness
                            of this change in Northern public sentiment was regarded as marvelous.
                            An eminent man characterized it as a "strange phenomenon," and adds: "To
                            the student of human nature, however, it may not seem altogether without
                            precedent, when he remembers certain other instances on record of
                            mutations in public sentiment equally sudden and extraordinary. Ten
                            thousand swords that would have leaped from their scabbards&#151;as
                            the English statesman thought&#151;to avenge even a look of insult
                            to a lovely queen, hung idly in their places when she was led to the
                            scaffold in the midst of the vilest taunts and execrations. The case
                            that we have been considering was, perhaps, only an illustration of the
                            general truth that, in times of revolutionary excitement, the higher and
                            better elements are crushed and silenced by the lower and
                            baser&#151;-not so much on account of their greater extent, as of
                            their greater violence."</p>
                        <p>When I began this detour it did not occur to me that it would be so much
                            prolonged; but I have read what has been written and decided that to
                            eliminate any part of it would defeat my purpose of vindicating the
                            truth of history. I now resume my narrative.</p>
                        <p>It was during the months of March and April that many of the midshipmen
                            appointed from the Southern states resigned and returned to their homes
                            with the purpose of entering the Conference service. My resignation was
                            forwarded in March and was promptly accepted by the secretary of the
                            navy. Remained at my <pb id="VAA3932-396" n="390"/> home a few weeks and
                            then proceeded to Montgomery, fortified with a letter of introduction
                            and recommendation from Beriah Magoffin, then governor of Kentucky, to
                            Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States. Presenting my
                            application for appointment as midshipman, together with Governor
                            Magoffin's letter, I was assured that the matter would receive prompt
                            attention and returned to my home in Kentucky. In a week or two my
                            appointment was received with orders from the secretary of the
                            confederate navy to report for duty to Captain Gwathney, commanding the
                            confederate steamer, "Jackson," at New Orleans. This was in the month of
                            May. I lost no time, but proceeded at once to New Orleans and reported
                            for duty on board the "Jackson." The people of the South were now
                            convinced that war was inevitable and that their homes would be
                            desolated and their country devastated by the invasion of hostile
                            armies. That they would thus be furnished with an illustration and
                            verification of the truth of the utterance of Lord Bacon when he
                            declared, nearly three centuries ago: "It has seldom or never been seen
                            that the far Southern people have invaded the Northern, but
                            contrariwise."</p>
                        <p>No pen can adequately portray the intense excitement and enthusiasm of
                            the people. Along the route to New Orleans, at almost every station,
                            crowds had assembled, ladies usually predominating. The latter were
                            there to bid farewell to their sons, husbands, fathers and lovers, who
                            were enlisting in what they conceived to be the noblest
                            cause&#151;the protection of their homes and firesides. The
                            immaturity of youth and the tottering of <pb id="VAA3932-397" n="391"/>
                            old age were visible in many of those who were marching on to battle.
                            They conceived that everything worth living for was involved in the
                            contest. No conscription was necessary&#151;no demands for bounty
                            were made. They entered the service without a bounty and left it without
                            a pension; and during nearly a half century they have contributed,
                            without complaint and without repining, a large proportion of the
                            thousands of millions of dollars that have been paid in pensions to
                            those who invaded their country with fire and sword. And "Oliver still
                            holds up his plate for more." The contributions of the South to pensions
                            exceeds by far the enormous indemnity exacted by Germany of France at
                            the close of the Franco-German war.</p>
                        <p>Captain Gwathney, to whom I reported, was a Virginian, having resigned
                            from the federal navy and cast his fortunes with the confederacy. He was
                            a man of indomitable courage, and his conversation and manners were
                            those of an educated and refined gentleman.</p>
                        <p>Our duties during the year 1861 were, in part, to watch the blockading
                            fleet at the mouth of the Mississippi and we convoyed General Pillow's
                            army up the river to Hickman, Kentucky. Our armament consisted of two
                            forty-two pounders, one on the stern and the other on the bow of the
                            boat. The federal, gunboats, Lexington, Conestoga and A. O. Tyler, were
                            at Cairo, a short distance above Hickman. It was not long after our
                            occupancy of Hickman till the three boats mentioned were observed coming
                            down the river. As we were casting off our lines to meet the enemy, one
                            of General Pillow's aids rode up on a magnificent charger and with <pb
                                id="VAA3932-398" n="392"/> a wave of his hand sang out: "Give them
                            h&#151;l, boys," and instantly rode away, feeling, no doubt, that he
                            had discharged an important duty. This was early in the war, and our
                            engagement with the federal boats was greatly enjoyed by an immense
                            audience on shore composed of Pillow's army and the citizens. The
                            roaring of the cannon, the bands playing Dixie and other patriotic airs,
                            the cheering of the soldiers and citizens, gave the occasion a thrilling
                            and spectacular aspect. We received one shot just above the water line,
                            but were not disabled. After a sharp encounter, continued for some time,
                            the federal boats retired up the river. We received various reports that
                            the enemy were seriously damaged, but the precise extent of the damage
                            we never learned. It is probable that the fear of masked batteries on
                            shore had something to do with the enemy's retreat.</p>
                        <p>Early in 1862 I was ordered to the new gunboat, the "Corondolet," on Lake
                            Pontchartrain. Our small fleet consisted of three boats&#151;two
                            besides the Corondolet, the latter being the flagship, and all under
                            command of Captain Gwathney.</p>
                        <p>We learned that it was the purpose of the federals to approach the city
                            by way of the river, passing Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and also by
                            way of Lake Pontchartrain. Our orders were to sail out into the sound to
                            meet the enemy. Between two and three in the morning the lights from
                            their boats were plainly visible. It was a very dark night. We cleared
                            for action, our guns were loaded, run out, and the captains held the
                            lock strings in their hands expecting every moment for the commodore,
                            who was on the upper deck, to give the <pb id="VAA3932-399" n="393"/>
                            command "Fire!" We were steadily approaching the enemy and the deep
                            silence that prevailed was impressive. It became evident that our
                            engagement was to be at close quarters with unprotected wooden boats on
                            both sides. Captain Brand, the flag captain, called out, "Commodore,
                            shall I give the command 'fire?'"&#151;no answer. Presently he
                            repeated the question but received no answer. The third time the inquiry
                            was made the commodore replied: "Receive the enemy's fire first, Captain
                            Brand." It was but an instant until we saw the flash of their guns and
                            then we opened fire with a will. During the engagement we heard more
                            than once the crash of our upper works but were not disabled. I have no
                            means of determining the duration of the fight, but it continued until
                            the enemy retired. "We discovered that our upper works had been riddled
                            but fortunately no one was killed. Quite a number were wounded by flying
                            splinters. We were confident that we had done effective work, but have
                            never seen an official account of the enemy's losses. We were feeling
                            very much elated over our victory and returned to New Orleans for
                            repairs. Soon after our arrival we called a newsboy to bring the papers
                            aboard. He did so, and the headlines gave us the startling intelligence
                            that the federals had succeeded in passing the forts on the river. This,
                            of course, meant the fall of the city.</p>
                        <p>The Commodore's silence when repeatedly asked if the command "fire"
                            should be given is indissolubly associated in my mind with another
                            incident which occurred the summer before on the Jackson. It was on a
                            Sunday afternoon. Captain Gwathney was reading a newspaper <pb
                                id="VAA3932-400" n="394"/> and he read aloud to those of us who were
                            nearby this sentence: "Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, was born
                            insensible to fear." He commented on the absurdity of this statement,
                            and declared that no man was insensible to fear, quoting the lines:</p>
                        <lg>
                            <l n="1">"The brave man is not he who has no fear,</l>
                            <l n="2">But he whose noble soul its fear subdues."</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>I had now attained the age of twenty. Knighthood and chivalry were
                            presumed to be obsolete in the nineteenth century. The lover no longer
                            sighed away his soul in moonlight serenades under the balcony of the
                            empress of his affections, but it was still permissible for him to give
                            a mournful farewell glance at his lady love's window; and, as viewed by
                            a young man of twenty, there still remained a subtle, mysterious and
                            inexplicable relation between love and war. It is an age of intense
                            susceptibility, and the time when a young man conceives that a young
                            lady is most impressed by a lover whose eye melts in love and kindles in
                            war&#151;and whose voice is never sweeter and nobler to her than

                        <p>The federals having succeeded in passing the forts on the river, thus
                            assuring their occupancy of the city, <pb id="VAA3932-401" n="395"/> we
                            burned our boats and proceeded to a station on the Jackson railroad.
                            From there we started to Richmond by a circuitous route via Jackson and
                            Mobile, the only one then available. I was ordered to report at Richmond
                            for service on the Merrimac Number 2, which was then in process of
                            construction. Shortly after my arrival in Richmond I became seriously
                            ill and remained there many weeks without any material
                            improvement&#151;my illness being attributed to our long sojourn in
                            the malarial regions of Louisiana. An older brother made arrangements
                            for my removal to a farmhouse near Greenville, in East Tennessee. The
                            family occupants were the husband and wife and daughter, and to their
                            care and assiduous attentions I feel that I am indebted for my life. I
                            was advised to resign from the service on account of the strong
                            probability that my health was permanently impaired, and that I would
                            not again be physically able to resume my active duties. I accordingly
                            forwarded my resignation, which was duly accepted. After remaining with
                            this excellent family for several months, my health was sufficiently
                            improved to justify an attempt to visit my home in Kentucky. I did so
                            and in a short time began the study of law.</p>
                        <p>In the fall of 1864 I wrote to Judge Frederick Rand, of Indianapolis,
                            that on account of the chaotic condition of affairs in Kentucky, and
                            being physically unable to re-enter the service, I would be glad to
                            continue my legal studies, and expressed a desire to enter the office of
                            an Indianapolis lawyer or firm of ability and standing. He replied,
                            suggesting that I come to Indianapolis at once&#151;that he had such
                            a place for me as I desired.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-402" n="396"/>
                        <p>Upon my arrival, he conducted me to the office of the Hon. Martin M. Ray,
                            whom I afterwards learned to be one of the ablest members of the
                            Indianapolis bar. Mr. Ray and myself soon came to terms. I remained with
                            him as a student until he formed a partnership with the late Major
                            Jonathan W. Gordon and Judge Walter March, of Muncie, and then continued
                            in the office of the firm.</p>
                        <p>The older citizens of Indianapolis will remember Judge Rand.
                            Notwithstanding he was a Democrat the Republican Governor Baker
                            appointed him judge of the superior court. Judge Rand knew me as a boy
                            in Kentucky, he having formerly resided and practised in Owingsville,
                            Kentucky, my native town.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ray very kindly permitted me to live and board with him at his home
                            at the northwest corner of Pennsylvania and St. Clair, now known as the
                            Landers property.</p>
                        <p>I did not fail to observe on every hand exhibitions of the tempestuous
                            passions engendered by the Civil War. Having been in the confederate
                            service it was both discreet and proper that I should remain somewhat in
                            the background, and not seek any kind of conspicuity. I remained at the
                            office and my home except the occasional walks taken about the city for
                            exercise. Our office was in what was then known as the New and Talbott
                            building on Pennsylvania street, south of and adjoining the old
                            postoffice. Mr. John C. New informed me shortly before his death that
                            this was the first office building erected in Indianapolis.</p>
                        <p>On one of my walks on the Circle my attention was <pb id="VAA3932-403"
                                n="397"/> attracted by a noisy crowd of forty or fifty persons; as I
                            now remember, it was at the southeast corner of the Circle and Meridian,
                            where the Western Union offices are now located. I approached nearer and
                            arrived just in time to hear the peroration of the speaker who was
                            addressing the audience. One sentence shocked me greatly. It was this:
                            "D&#151;n Kentucky&#151;she ought to be tied to the tail of a
                            mule and kicked to death." Like a Swiss mountaineer, I had ever been mad
                            with partiality to my native state.</p>
                        <p>It is an historical fact that the Virginia country gentleman, especially
                            during the first half of the last century, was proverbial for his love
                            and veneration for his state&#151;and his favorite toast was that in
                            which Virginia was compared to the mother of the Gracchi. It was with
                            like feeling that I regarded my native state of Kentucky.</p>
                        <p>I would have considered the utterance of the speaker as the ravings of a
                            madman, had I not made the further observation that his audience, with
                            singular unanimity, seemed to be in accord with him, as evidenced by
                            their rapturous applause at the end of every sentence. What could I do?
                            I could only think what General Lee so often said when complaints of
                            outrages were made to him, "What a people!" I was thus furnished with
                            much food for reflection, and it was one of my earliest lessons in the
                            truth that, in this world, we must alternately chew the cud of sweet and
                            bitter fancies.</p>
                        <p>At the suggestion of Mr. Ray I located in Shelbyville, his former home,
                            and opened an office there. I had been there but a short time when two
                            serious charges were <pb id="VAA3932-404" n="398"/> preferred against
                            me. A young lady from Cincinnati, visiting relatives in Shelbyville,
                            positively declared that I was no less a personage than John Wilkes
                            Booth, the assassin of Lincoln&#151;that she had seen Booth several
                            times on the stage in her home city and could not be mistaken. The
                            newspapers at that time had given currency to various reports that as a
                            matter of fact Booth had not been killed, but was then at large. I knew
                            that I did not kill the president, but the question that troubled me was
                            "What would other people think?"</p>
                        <p>The other charge was also one of much gravity. A young lady of
                            Shelbyville, whom I then only knew by sight, avowed that the luxuriant
                            mustache with which I was then blessed, or cursed, was purely
                            artificial&#151;and was only kept in place by means of a cunningly
                            devised apparatus made of wire.</p>
                        <p>As time passed on these malevolent aspersions upon my character and
                            standing in the community were gradually forgotten.</p>
                        <p>On the twentieth of October, 1867, I married Miss Mary R. Wilson, a
                            daughter of Elias M. Wilson, of Shelby county. It would be both trite
                            and superfluous to enumerate her excellencies, as they are so well known
                            to all her friends and acquaintances. However, I may with perfect
                            propriety refer to her father and mother, as they will be remembered
                            only by the older citizens of the community. I greatly admired them both
                            for their many estimable qualities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson was a native of Loudoun county, Virginia, but moved to Central
                            Kentucky when quite a young man. He there married Miss Mary B. Cross, of
                            Richmond. <pb id="VAA3932-405" n="399"/> They subsequently moved to
                            Shelby county, Indiana. He was born in the first decade of the last
                            century and died in the month of December, 1886&#151;having lived
                            through the administrations of all our presidents since Jefferson down
                            to the first term of Grover Cleveland.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson had at all times been a close student and observer of public
                            men and public measures&#151;being not only familiar with current
                            issues and events, but also with those that had arisen or were subjects
                            of debate during the past history of the country. He could discuss with
                            ability, and with equal facility, the tariff, the Wilmot Proviso, the
                            Kansas and Nebraska bill, the Missouri Compromise, the compromise
                            measures of 1850 and the Ostend Manifesto. Few men, even of those in
                            public life, were more admirably equipped for the discussion and
                            elucidation of great public questions. He was the intimate friend and
                            associate of Thomas A. Hendricks and other public men of his time, and
                            frequently entertained them at his home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Wilson was one of the most conscientious men I ever knew and this
                            principle was extended and applied to every relation of life.</p>
                        <p>He was for a number of years postmaster at Shelbyville, and was elected
                            to the responsible office of county treasurer for two consecutive
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>He was an interesting and fascinating conversationist, not only in the
                            presentation of his views on public questions, but also in relating
                            reminiscences of his early life in Virginia and Kentucky. To young men,
                            especially, his conversation was also instructive.</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-406" n="400"/>
                        <p>Among the many pleasing recollections of my life none is more indelibly
                            impressed upon my memory than that of my long winter evenings in his
                            society at his own home&#151;in front of the big open fireplace
                            where the fire crackled and sparkled in apparent sympathy with his
                            interesting and fascinating conversation.</p>
                        <p>Much levity and jocularity have been indulged in at the expense of the
                            mothers-in-law of the nation. My mother-in-law was all right. I know of
                            no lady who was more universally popular than she. Her gentleness and
                            hospitality endeared her to old and young alike. She was born in 1819
                            and died in 1900 at the age of 81. It has been said that young people
                            are prone to ignore those much older than themselves. It was not so in
                            the case of Mrs. Wilson. Young people never ceased to love and respect
                            her. Her charm of manner and conversation made a lasting impression upon
                            all who were so fortunate as to be in her society.</p>
                        <p>I opened my office and, like many other young lawyers, had ample leisure
                            for study and meditation. But it was not long until I decided to write
                            and publish a work on the "Law of Sheriff in Indiana." The book made its
                            appearance in June, 1870, having been printed by The State Sentinel
                            Printing Establishment. I sold the entire edition of one thousand
                            volumes to Merrill &amp; Field. The purpose of the work was twofold:
                            to furnish the members of the bar with a convenient and useful book of
                            reference, and the executive officer of the court with a safe guide in
                            the discharge of his official duties. The book was favorably received
                            and its accuracy vouched for by leading members of the profession; <pb
                                id="VAA3932-407" n="401"/> among them were Thomas A. Hendricks,
                            Martin M. Ray and Judge Perkins, of the Supreme Court. Indirectly, I
                            derived much benefit from its publication, it having been the means of
                            my receiving important legal business. In the meantime, I was nominated
                            by the democrats for city clerk. Though the county was a Gibraltar of
                            democracy, the city was decidedly Republican, and no democrat had been
                            elected to a city office for many years. Fortunately, I was elected, but
                            it was by only the meager majority of seven&#151;and the remainder
                            of our ticket was defeated. Passing along the street about dark the next
                            evening after the election I overheard Robert Badger, a stanch
                            republican, in conversation with a number of friends, declare: "Joe
                            Martz and I had decided to vote for young Daugherty for city clerk, but
                            we were told the day before the election that he had been a d&#151;d
                            rebel and so we voted against him."</p>
                        <p>I recite these trivial happenings as indicating the spirit and temper of
                            the times. If the fact mentioned by Badger had been universally known in
                            the community I would have been defeated&#151;which is corroborative
                            of the view sometimes expressed that it is not always conducive to the
                            interest of a candidate to be too well known.</p>
                        <p>My term as clerk expired at the end of two years. The salary was only a
                            few hundred dollars, but it was a great boon to me as it served to
                            replenish an exhausted exchequer. Soon after the expiration of my term
                            as clerk the republican city council elected me city
                            attorney&#151;the emoluments of this office were about double those
                            of clerk. My Republican competitor before the council <pb
                                id="VAA3932-408" n="402"/> was a young lawyer of about my own age,
                            of excellent family, and a nephew of one of Indiana's most distinguished
                            governors. He afterwards abandoned the law and became a manufacturer, in
                            which business he accumulated five hundred thousand dollars.</p>
                        <p>While holding these two offices I was industriously at work making an
                            abstract of the titles to the real estate in Shelby county. If not the
                            very first, it was one of the first, compilations of this kind ever made
                            in Indiana. I did this work under many discouragements. The older
                            lawyers whom I consulted declared that it was impracticable, and the
                            recorder serving his second term assured me that I would not be able to
                            complete the work if I lived to be as old as Methuselah. The books were
                            completed in about four years, and, in a pecuniary sense, were a bonanza
                            to me. My business increased so rapidly that I was compelled to resign
                            as city attorney. Taking the cue from my abstract books, like
                            compilations were soon made in the counties of Rush, Decatur, Johnson,
                            Hancock, Clinton and Wabash. Warren Bigler, formerly auditor of state,
                            was in my office in Shelbyville for six months and went to Wabash, where
                            he made a set of books for that county.</p>
                        <p>The importance of this system in facilitating business and in the
                            avoidance of litigation can be fully appreciated only by those who
                            remember the tedious and very imperfect examinations of titles made by
                            resorting to the records in the various county offices.</p>
                        <p>I may add that the abstract books, though no longer owned by me, are
                            still intact, and are recognized as <pb id="VAA3932-409" n="403"/>
                            authority in respect to the title to real estate in Shelby county.</p>
                        <p>There were a number of eminent lawyers who then practiced in the Shelby
                            courts, but I write only of those who have passed away. Thomas A.
                            Hendricks was there. I have said in another place, referring to
                            Hendricks, that he, like Bush, the great Irish lawyer, could "hand up a
                            point of law to the court with as much grace and pliancy of gesture as
                            if he were presenting a court lady with a fan." With a popular audience,
                            he owed much of his power to the charm of his personality. So magnetic
                            was he, that he could not open his lips or lift his hand, without
                            instantly engaging the rapt attention of his audience. And it may be
                            said, with truth, that the graces of his person extended to his mind. In
                            his private intercourse, he was uniformly considerate, amiable and
                            courteous. To his profound knowledge of the law were superadded
                            unexcelled persuasiveness of tongue, and the most consummate tact.</p>
                        <p>As illustrative of the latter attribute I will refer to a case tried
                            before a jury in the Shelby circuit court in which Hendricks represented
                            the plaintiff and Benjamin Harrison the defendant. A man by the name of
                            Fitzgerald, who had been ejected from a train on the Vandalia road, sued
                            the railroad company for damages and the case was sent to Shelby county
                            on change of venue. The general impression was that Fitzgerald had no
                            case, but his best witness was a lady who was on the train at the
                            time&#151;returning to her home in Kentucky.</p>
                        <p>She was high-spirited, and her manner and conversation <pb
                                id="VAA3932-410" n="404"/> gave evidence of unusual intelligence and
                            refinement. She related with evident pride and satisfaction that her
                            home was in Central Kentucky. General Harrison, with all his skill in
                            cross-examination, failed to weaken her testimony, but rather made it
                            stronger. This was several years after the close of the war, but the war
                            spirit still prevailed in some sections of the country. Harrison, having
                            failed to accomplish his purpose by cross-examination, sought in his
                            argument to ridicule the lady because she said, with a triumphant air,
                            that she was a native of Central Kentucky, which state had always been
                            her home. When Hendricks replied, he emphasized the fact that no one
                            could determine where he should be born, and appealed to the jury to
                            know if the lady's nativity should be permitted to affect the force of
                            her testimony. "It is a well-known fact," continued Hendricks, "that
                            this good county of Shelby was largely settled by Kentuckians, and that
                            a large proportion of its inhabitants to-day are Kentuckians and sons of
                            Kentucky mothers. Indeed, I recognize several of them on this jury," and
                            turning to Harrison, declared "that Kentuckians stood shoulder to
                            shoulder with Indianians at the battle of Tippecanoe, under the
                            leadership of the distinguished ancestor of the gentleman, William Henry
                            Harrison&#151;and it ill becomes him to speak in disparagement of
                            the lady on account of her being a native of Kentucky." The jury was out
                            only a very little while and returned a verdict of twenty-five hundred
                            dollars for the plaintiff.</p>
                        <p>Hendricks and Martin M. Ray were about the same age and began the
                            practice in Shelbyville about the <pb id="VAA3932-411" n="405"/> same
                            time&#151;in the early forties. In important cases they were usually
                            on opposite sides. Ray, unlike Hendricks, had no fondness for public
                            life, but was content with his high standing in the profession. His
                            mental grasp of legal questions was great, and he was fully equal to
                            Hendricks in legal acumen and wealth of vocabulary. He was without a
                            rival in his inimitable humor and his ability to laugh a case out of
                            court. When the occasion demanded, he was bold, defiant, and fearless. I
                            heard him defend a man charged with killing his wife with an ax, the
                            defense being insanity. When Ray made his speech to the jury the
                            courtroom was crowded almost to suffocation. He faced an audience whose
                            manner and conduct indicated that they were ready to seize both Ray and
                            his client and massacre them on the spot. He turned upon that hostile
                            audience and, in defiant tones, declared that there was no power on
                            earth that could deter him from discharging his duty to his client.</p>
                        <p>It was an intellectual treat to the younger members of the bar to hear
                            Ray and Hendricks argue important legal questions. If those arguments
                            had been preserved, in book form, no more important or valuable addition
                            could be made to a law library. It is to be greatly deplored that the
                            ability and learning and eloquence of great lawyers are oftentimes lost
                            to history and memory for want of needful recordation. Tacitus
                            appreciated this great loss when he said of the eloquent Haterius:
                            "Whilst the plodding industry of scribblers goes down to posterity, the
                            sweet voice and fluent eloquence of Haterius died with himself."</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-412" n="406"/>
                        <p>I early learned to have great respect and admiration for Judge Stephen
                            Major, of the Shelbyville bar. He was my personal friend.</p>
                        <p>Judge Major had an imposing personality&#151;was very tall and well
                            proportioned and quick and graceful in his movements. He was dignified
                            and courteous and of a kindly disposition but, when the occasion
                            demanded, he could be austere. He was my ideal of a cultivated Irish
                            gentleman. His presence always suggested to me the "Hall of the Four
                            Courts," Dublin, so renowned for the galaxy of able and brilliant
                            lawyers assembled there, and of whom I had read so much.</p>
                        <p>Judge Major was a man with a conscience, and would frown upon any action
                            or conduct that savored of insincerity or duplicity.</p>
                        <p>He loved his family. In conversation he would speak of "My Charlie,"
                            referring to his son, the well-known author, who was then a mere
                            lad.</p>
                        <p>Long before the Civil War he was on the bench, being judge of the circuit
                            courts of Marion and Shelby counties. I have been informed that many
                            cases of national interest and importance were tried before him, some of
                            them arising under the fugitive slave law.</p>
                        <p>Judge Major was not a criminal lawyer, but in civil causes his profound
                            legal knowledge and his long experience on the bench and at the bar
                            rendered his services of inestimable value to his clients.</p>
                        <p>He remarked to me on one occasion that legal erudition was not essential
                            to the success of a criminal lawyer&#151;that, so far as legal
                            knowledge was concerned, all that was necessary was the learning of a
                            few general <pb id="VAA3932-413" n="407"/> principles and the memorizing
                            of a few statutory definitions.</p>
                        <p>He was fond of a joke with his intimate personal friends. I was then
                            quite young myself. Knowing my loyalty to Kentucky, my native state, he
                            would frequently ask me, laughing at the same time, some such question
                            as this: "What kind of society have you in Kentucky? They seem to kill
                            each other over there on the slightest provocation." I finally said to
                            him one day, "Do you not admire some of her public men, Mr. Clay, for
                            example?" His countenance at once assumed a serious aspect and he
                            proceeded to pass a glowing eulogy upon Clay. I then reminded him of the
                            great statesman's idolatrous love of Kentucky, and that, in one of his
                            great speeches, having presumably exhausted the vocabulary of encomium
                            upon that commonwealth, reached the grand climax when he solemnly
                            declared, "Yes, my countrymen, Kentucky is, indeed, the Ireland of
                            America." This seemed to greatly please the judge and he did not again
                            refer to the homicidal predilections of my native state.</p>
                        <p>Eden H. Davis was another prominent member of the Shelbyville bar. He was
                            not an educated man and took no delight in letters, but his arguments
                            were forcible, logical, convincing&#151;but entirely unadorned. If
                            the opposing counsel had said in a grandiloquent manner, "It is written
                            in the large volume of nature," it would have been like Mr. Davis to
                            gravely inquire, with pen in hand, "At what page?" He gave his entire
                            attention to the law, refusing to accept the doctrine that it is better
                            a man should know somehing of all things than all of one thing. It was
                            Davis who succeeded in <pb id="VAA3932-414" n="408"/> convicting, by a
                            jury, a respectable citizen, charged with burning his own building to
                            obtain the insurance, by giving nineteen separate and independent
                            reasons, with appropriate amplification, why he was guilty. The
                            defendant was promptly granted a new trial. Upon the second trial Davis
                            did not appear as counsel for the prosecution and the defendant was
                            triumphantly acquitted.</p>
                        <p>Benjamin F. Love was at that time an able but unique member of the
                            Shelbyville bar. Mr. Love was not over-fastidious in his attire and was
                            criticized for being some-what slow and tedious in the examination of
                            witnesses; but before a jury he was a most formidable antagonist. He
                            would seize his subject with the comprehension and vigor of a giant. His
                            sallies of wit and sarcasm frequently convulsed with laughter court,
                            jury and spectators.</p>
                        <p>My own specialty was that branch of the law relating to real estate, and
                            cognate branches. My time was fully occupied with these and I declined
                            other business. No miser ever counted his gold with greater delight than
                            I experienced in my efforts to unravel a complicated title. During my
                            thirty-two and one-half years in Shelbyville I became well acquainted
                            with the people of the city and county&#151;learned to appreciate
                            them&#151;and my social and business relations with them were most
                            agreeable. While I am no longer a citizen of the county, we occupy our
                            cottage in Shelbyville in the summer, and the first intimation of spring
                            suggests to us that it will not be long until we will again have the
                            pleasure of greeting our old acquaintances and friends. I have grave
                            doubts <pb id="VAA3932-415" n="409"/> whether there is any community
                            where the sanctity of contracts is more highly respected and
                            appreciated, and where the habit of punctuality, so important in every
                            vocation, more generally prevails.</p>
                        <p>During my business career in Shelbyville, many instances of unselfishness
                            and generosity came under my observation. At this moment I have two
                            cases in mind: one was a wealthy farmer who loaned a very considerable
                            amount of money on real estate mortgage at the current rate of interest.
                            He came to my office one day and said: "Mr. Daugherty, the times are
                            changing, and I think the rate of interest should come down. When they
                            pay their interest I wish you to return to them one-fifth of the
                            amount."</p>
                        <p>The other instance was where a man purchased a sheriff's certificate of
                            sale made under a decree of foreclosure of mortgage on a farm. The year
                            expired without the land being redeemed and the sheriff executed to the
                            holder of the certificate a deed for the land. After becoming the owner
                            it was quite natural that he should go to see his farm. The premises
                            were still occupied by the debtor. He found the debtor, his wife, and
                            several little children in the house, and there were evidences of
                            extreme poverty. It was but a little while until a purchaser was found
                            for the land and it was sold. After the sale he sent word to the husband
                            and wife to meet him at a certain time in Shelbyville. They came. A
                            calculation disclosed the fact that the land had been sold for seven
                            hundred and fifty dollars in excess of its cost, including interest. He
                            made a check for that amount and handed it to the wife.</p>

                        <p>In 1907 I published, at my own expense, a small edition of the "Young
                            Lawyer and Another Essay" and distributed them among my professional and
                            other friends as souvenirs. It was written during an interval of
                            relaxation from business and I derived much pleasure from the
                            preparation of the work. I have received many evidences of appreciation
                            of the book, not only from those to whom it was presented, but from
                            others in whose hands it had accidentally fallen. I received, on the
                            same day, two commendatory letters, one from a Methodist minister in
                            Texas and another from a Catholic clergyman in Montreal, inquiring where
                            copies of the book could be obtained. I regretted my inability to
                            accommodate them, the small edition having been exhausted. I have been
                            frequently urged, both orally and in writing, to place the book upon the
                            market and thus give it a wider circulation. I have not done so.</p>
                        <p>We live in a capitalistic age. Wealth is taken as the almost universal
                            standard, and, in some degree, is regarded as the measure of public
                            capacity. I am a man of my time; I love money; but have long since been
                            convinced that when commerciality is the sole or principal incentive to
                            authorship, the production is marred, especially when viewed from an
                            aesthetic or purely literary standpoint.</p>
                        <p>While on a visit to Kentucky in May, 1878, my mother placed in my custody
                            an antiquated instrument of writing, purporting to be the last will and
                            testament of James Keemer, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It bears date
                            March 28, 1784. It is a unique document-written <pb id="VAA3932-417"
                                n="411"/> on one piece of paper four feet long, discolored by age,
                            and a little tattered and torn. I still have it in my possession and,
                            considering its antiquity, it is in an excellent state of preservation.
                            It was evidently copied from the record very soon after the death of the
                            testator. My great-grandmother, Mrs. Lydia Davis, was one of the
                            beneficiaries under the will. When my mother handed me the document I
                            made the following indorsement thereon in writing:</p>
                        <p>"This old will was given to me by my mother in May, 1878. The testator,
                            James Keemer, was my grandmother's grandfather.</p>
                        <p>My mother's name is Louisa Daugherty.</p>
                        <p>My grandmother's name was Mary McGowen.</p>
                        <p>My great-grandmother's name was Lydia Davis, one of the devisees named in
                            the will.</p>
                        <p>My great-great-grandfather's name was James Keemer&#151;James Keemer
                            being the person who made this will.</p>
                        <p>May 18, 1878. (Signed) H. H. D<hi rend="sc">AUGHERTY.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>Under the provisions of this ancient document, the testator disposed of a
                            vast estate consisting of lands, personal property and money.</p>
                        <p>That my remote ancestor was in such affluent circumstances is a source of
                            much satisfaction, somewhat modified, however, by the reflection that at
                            least one of his lineal descendants has been less fortunate.</p>
                        <p>The document is interesting on account of its quaint phraseology, but it
                            also has an historic value. I shall not encumber this chapter with the
                            will in its entirety, but will recite only such portions as relate to
                            the testaor's <pb id="VAA3932-418" n="412"/> disposition of his slaves.
                            It will no doubt be quite a revelation to some to learn that
                            Pennsylvania was formerly a slave state in good standing.</p>
                        <p>The introductory paragraph reads as follows: "In the name of God, amen,
                            I, James Keemer of Earl Township, County of Lancaster, and Commonwealth

                        <p>"I also give to my said wife my negroe girl Nell during her natural life,

                            behaving himself as he ought to do in the mean time."</p>
                        <p>I have learned during a residence of forty years in the North that the
                            opinion generally prevails in that section, even among men of
                            intelligence, that African slavery was exclusively a Southern
                            institution, and that the odium of it belongs entirely to the South.
                            That human slavery was a crime and the Southern people were alone the
                            criminals. This erroneous belief is largely attributable, no doubt, to
                            the monstrous perversion <pb id="VAA3932-420" n="414"/> of the truth by
                            unscrupulous and frenzied politicians.</p>
                        <p>A half century having elapsed since the Civil War, it is high time that
                            we relegate to the rear those passions which it engendered, and which
                            have for so long clouded the reason and warped the understanding of men.
                            We should now give attention to the cold facts of history and determine,
                            if we can, where the odium of human slavery in this country belongs.</p>
                        <p>It is an historical fact that African servitude among us existed in all
                            the original states and that it was recognized and protected by the
                            federal constitution. It is true that subsequently, for "climatic,
                            industrial, and economical&#151;not moral or
                            sentimental&#151;reasons," it was abolished in the Northern, while
                            it continued to exist in the Southern states; however, it continued in
                            some of the Northern states for fifty years after the adoption of the
                            constitution. The foregoing quotation from the will of my remote
                            ancestor illustrates the truth of the statement.</p>
                        <p>In the North the labor of the negro race was found to be unsuited to the
                            climate and productions of that section, and therefore unprofitable to
                            the master. Morality and sentimentality certainly could not have induced
                            abolition in these states because some of them at this very time were
                            actively engaged in the slave trade; procuring cargoes on the coast of
                            Africa, and transporting them for sale to those parts of the Union where
                            their labor was found to be profitable and suited to the climate and
                            productions.</p>
                        <p>This infamous traffic made slavery possible on this <pb id="VAA3932-421"
                                n="415"/> continent; without it, slavery would never have gained a
                            foothold in the United States. It was carried on almost exclusively by
                            New England merchants and Northern ships. The people of New England seem
                            to have regarded it not only as a highly remunerative, but also as a
                            laudable and legitimate industry. In illustration of this it may be
                            noted that James D. Wolf, one of her most prominent citizens, was long
                            and largely concerned in the slave trade. He was sent from the state of
                            Rhode Island to the senate of the United States as late as the year
                            1821. In 1825 he resigned his seat in the senate and removed to Havana,
                            where he lived for many years, actively engaged in the same pursuit, as
                            president of a slave-trading company. The story is told of him that on
                            being informed that the "trade" was to be declared piracy, he smiled and
                            said, "So much the better for <hi rend="i">us</hi>&#151;the Yankees
                            will be the only people not scared off by such a declaration."</p>
                        <p>The constitution expressly forbade any interference by congress with the
                            slave trade&#151;or to use its own language, with the "migration or
                            importation of such persons" as any of the states should think proper to
                            admit&#151;"prior to the year 1808." During the intervening period
                            of more than twenty years, the matter was exclusively under the control
                            of the respective states; and it is an historical fact that every
                            Southern state, without exception, either had already enacted, or
                            proceeded to enact, laws forbidding the importation of slaves. Virginia
                            was the first of all the states, North or South, to prohibit it, and
                            Georgia was the first to incorporate such a prohibition in her organic
                            constitution.</p>

                        <p>So eager and avaricious were those engaged in this nefarious business
                            that in some instances they succeeded in evading the state law. "The
                            geographical situation of our country," said Mr. Lowndes, of South
                            Carolina, in the house of representatives on February 14, 1804, "is not
                            unknown. With navigable rivers running into the heart of it, it is
                            impossible, with our means, to prevent our <hi rend="i">Eastern
                                brethren</hi> engaged in this trade from introducing the negroes
                            into the country. The law has been completely evaded."</p>
                        <p>We read that in 1807 congress, "availing itself of the very earliest
                            moment at which the constitutional restriction ceased to be operative,
                            passed an act prohibiting the importation of slaves into any part of the
                            United States from and after the first day of January, 1808. This act
                            was passed with great unanimity. In the House of Representatives there
                            were one hundred and thirteen (113) yeas to five (5) nays; and it is a
                            significant fact, as showing the absence of any sectional division of
                            sentiment at that period, that the five dissentients were divided as
                            equally as possible between the two sections: two of them were from
                            Northern and three from Southern states."<ref id="ref_72" rend="super"

                            almost exclusively by the forefathers of the New England

                        <p>We read that thousands, year after year, were stowed <pb id="VAA3932-423"
                                n="417"/> together in the hold of a slave ship, without air, without
                            light, without food, without hope. That the practise prevailed of
                            suspending contumacious negroes in cages to have their eyes picked out
                            and to be devoured alive by birds of prey; and one instance is recorded
                            where the cargo of sick slaves were thrown overboard as so much <hi
                                rend="i">live lumber</hi> by direction of the captain of the
                            ship.</p>
                        <p>We have read in the newspapers of the country, and heard from the pulpit
                            and the hustings, much in denunciation of the crime of slavery in the
                            South. Have you ever read or heard, from either of these sources, even
                            the mildest censure of the infamous slave trade, without which the
                            institution of slavery in the South would never have existed? Why is
                            this so?</p>
                        <p>In this age and generation any form of human servitude is absolutely
                            indefensible; but it will not be denied that African slavery as it
                            existed in the Southern states was the mildest and most humane of all
                            institutions to which the name "slavery" has ever been applied. That the
                            sensibilities of the descendants of those who were engaged in this
                            unholy and brutal traffic should be unduly shocked by Southern slavery,
                            is, indeed, marvelous, and unmistakably indicates a suspension or
                            reversal of all the laws of heredity.</p>
                        <p>Is it possible that hatred of the Southern white man, and a desire for
                            sectional aggrandizement, commingled, in some degree, with his love and
                            sympathy for the Southern negro?</p>
                        <p>I can conceive of no reading more interesting than the impartial views of
                            an intelligent and highly cultivated <pb id="VAA3932-424" n="418"/>
                            foreigner, upon our institutions, our people and our laws. In 1831,
                            DeTocqueville was sent by his government to the United States upon a
                            comparatively unimportant mission. He remained several years, which he
                            occupied in gathering material for his great work "Democracy in
                            America." The book appeared in several languages and created a profound
                            impression. The great political philosopher did not omit to express his
                            views upon the subject of slavery based upon his observations while
                            here. They are presumably impartial. His style of writing has a magic
                            charm:</p>
                        <p>"The most formidable of all the ills which threaten the future existence
                            of the United States, arises from the presence of a black population
                            upon its territory. * * *</p>
                        <p>"Whoever has inhabited the United States must have perceived that in
                            those parts of the union in which the negroes are no longer slaves, they
                            have in no wise drawn nearer to the whites. On the contrary, the
                            prejudice of the race appears to be stronger in the states which have
                            abolished slavery than in those where it still exists; and nowhere is it
                            so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never been
                            known.</p>
                        <p>"The habits of the people of the South are more tolerant and
                            compassionate to the negro than in the North. * * *</p>
                        <p>"I do not imagine that the white and the black races will ever live in
                            any country upon an equal footing. * * *</p>
                        <p>"In every picture of the future there is a dim spot <pb id="VAA3932-425"
                                n="419"/> which the eye of the understanding cannot penetrate. * *
                            *</p>
                        <p>"When I contemplate the condition of the South, I can only discover two
                            alternatives which may be adopted by the white inhabitants of those
                            states, viz: either to emancipate the negroes, and to intermingle with
                            them; or, remaining isolated from them, to keep them in a state of
                            slavery as long as possible."</p>
                        <p>My father, John C. Daugherty, lived in Owingsville all his life. It has
                            been said that a man's character will take care of his reputation. In
                            his case no care or guardianship of the one for the other was necessary.
                            They were both good. His word was equivalent to his bond and he was
                            universally respected and esteemed by the people amongst whom his lot
                            was cast. He preceded my mother to the grave several years and died at
                            the age of 69.</p>
                        <p>To the mothers of sons in the border states, the ordeal of the civil war
                            was exceptionally severe. Kentucky was in the United States one day and
                            in the Confederate States the next&#151;the state being alternately
                            occupied by the opposing armies. They were of course deeply concerned
                            for their sons who were in the service and, in addition, were subjected
                            not only to many inconveniences, but oftentimes to indignities and
                            insults. The utmost chaos and confusion prevailed. People in affluent
                            circumstances were reduced to poverty, and, in many instances, the poor
                            suffered for the necessaries of life. No adequate description can be
                            given of the conditions which then prevailed. Throughout all these <pb
                                id="VAA3932-426" n="420"/> trials and tribulations my mother, who
                            was a delicate woman with a large family, exhibited the utmost patience
                            and fortitude. I know something of human character and have a profound
                            admiration for hers. My last conversation with her was on the eve of
                            going away. When I talked with her at the bedside she looked so frail
                            and emaciated that one would not have been surprised if the moonlight of
                            death should pass over her countenance at any moment&#151;but she
                            was brave to the last, and a smile of resignation illumined her face. My
                            love and veneration for her are so great that I am oftentimes seized
                            with an almost irresistible impulse to lift my hat to any aged lady that
                            I chance to meet, stranger though she be.</p>
                        <p>An eminent Englishman who contemplated a visit to America asked Cobden,
                            the British statesman, if it would be worth while to visit Niagara.
                            Cobden replied: "Do so by all means; there are two sublimities in
                            nature; one of rest and the other of motion; the sublimity in rest are
                            the distant sunset Alps, the sublimity in motion is Niagara." But how
                            completely do all other sublimities pale into insignificance when
                            compared with the sublimity of death!</p>
                        <p>In the last week of September, 1911, the people of Owingsville and Bath
                            county celebrated the Centennial Anniversary of the town and county.
                            Mrs. Daugherty and myself received a hearty invitation to be present. We
                            went, and met with a most cordial reception and were delightfully
                            entertained. On account of the vicissitudes of life and business, I had
                            been separated from my numerous relatives there for many years. A new
                                <pb id="VAA3932-427" n="421"/> generation had grown
                            up&#151;nephews and nieces without number&#151;the nephews
                            intelligent and handsome young fellows to whom life seemed full of
                            promise&#151;the nieces, charming on account of their youth and
                            beauty and striking femininity. I was never more thoroughly impressed
                            with the truth that nothing tends more to the rejuvenescence of one who
                            has passed the meridian of life than the fascinations of youth and
                            beauty.</p>
                        <p>Many natives and former residents of the town and county were there from
                            a distance. The venerable widow of Henry S. Lane, of Crawfordsville,
                            Indiana, had hoped to be there, and it was fondly expected that she
                            would grace and honor the occasion with her presence, but at the last
                            moment she found it impossible to come. Though eighty-seven years old,
                            it is said that she is active and alert, both physically and mentally.
                            It will be remembered that her distinguished husband had, in early life,
                            removed to Indiana, and that he became one of the founders of the
                            Republican party, having presided over the first national convention of
                            that party, fifty-six years ago, when John C. Fremont was nominated for
                            the presidency.</p>
                        <p>Our visit, however, was not without its melancholy aspect. The friends
                            and associates of my youth and young manhood were nearly all gone. Our
                            favorite haunts remained, but the actors were no more. I visited the
                            beautiful cemetery situated in the environs of the town, where many of
                            them were buried. I could only read the inscriptions on their tombs! I
                            was forcibly reminded of Webster's account of the visit to his
                            birthplace which he made near the close of his life:</p>
                        <pb id="VAA3932-428" n="422"/>
                        <p>"The villagers are gone; an unknown generation walk under our elms.
                            Unknown faces meet and pass me in my own paternal acres. I recognize
                            nothing but the tombs! I have no acquaintance remaining but the
                            dead."</p>
