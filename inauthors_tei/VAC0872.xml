        <p>M<hi rend="sc">OST</hi> of the poems contained in this little volume were written and
          published in the newspapers as early as the years 1833 and 1834. Some of them have been
          republished in books and periodicals, and others appear for the first time in print.</p>
        <p>The dates of the composition of several pieces are given for reasons that will appear
          obvious to the reader, and the dates of others to show their appropriateness at the time
          of their composition.</p>
        <p>I trust the few flowers I have gathered from the foot of Parnassus, will be allowed an
          humble place with the brighter and more gorgeous chaplets plucked by abler hands from the
          top of the classic hill.</p>

        <milestone unit="typography" n="-----o-----" rend="center"/>
        <p>V<hi rend="sc">ARIOUS</hi> definitions have been given of poetry. It has been called the
          language of passion&mdash;the divine art&mdash;scintillations of a fruitful and glowing
          imagination&mdash;the mirage of fancy&mdash;the love of the bright and beautiful in
          nature, and in the moral and social world.</p>
        <p>Wild flowers blooming in the desert&mdash; pearls glittering in ocean caves&mdash;the
          rainbow spanning the heavens after a storm&mdash;the aurora borealis streaking the
          northern sky from the horizon to the zenith with bars of lurid light&mdash;the myriads of
          stars that glow in the nocturnal sky&mdash;bright clouds, tinged with gold and purple,
          that gather around the rising and setting sun, are all full of poetry. Wood-birds with gay
          plumage caroling amidst green arbors&mdash;bees, butterflies, and bright-winged insects
          reveling in sunlight&mdash;meadows <pb id="VAC0872-008" n="8"/> carpeted with flowers of
          every lovely tint and delicious fragrance&mdash;music with its magic tones, and echo which
          repeats the sweet harmony&mdash;brooks mirroring the landscape, or reflecting the
          moonbeams as they ripple along through verdant valleys, are subjects of poetry, firing the
          imagination and gilding the fancy with their inherent charms and brilliancy. Every emotion
          and impulse of the heart&mdash;hope, fear, joy, sorrow&mdash;is a fountain of poetry in
          the human soul. The earthquake and the volcano, whirlwind, and the lightning and the
          thunder, awaken sublime and terrible emotions in the human bosom, calculated to elicit the
          most grand and lofty strains of the poet, whose harp is strung in unison with the voice of
          the tempest that strews desolation in its path.</p>
        <p>Poetry was the first language of the nations of the earth. When words were few, and
          language in a rude state, metaphors and apt figures of speech, taken from physical objects
          that surrounded mankind, were abundant. The laws, philosophy, learning, and religious
          ceremonies of the ancients were originally <pb id="VAC0872-009" n="9"/> written in poetry.
          Isaiah, Jeremiah, David, Solomon, and the writer of the Book of Job, made poetry the
          honored vehicle of the sublime and momentous truths of the Bible. Homer, and his great
          rival, Hesiod, who lived and wrote in the same century with Solomon, recited their poems
          at the great games, in the presence of assembled Greece. They contended for the palm of
          poesy in strains which have descended to the present time, and will continue to echo down
          the cycles of coming ages until<q rend="blockquote"><lg>
              <l>"Time shall remove the keystone of the sky,</l>
              <l>Heaven's roof shall fall, and all but virtue die."</l>
            </lg></q></p>
        <p>The Arabians and Greeks were the first to construct poetry into metrical numbers. They
          did so to accommodate music, which they considered as the essence and soul of poetry.
          Indeed, in all the early nations of the earth, poetry and music were combined, and their
          union tended to their mutual refinement and elevation. Odes and hymns of various kinds
          were sung by the bards to their entranced countrymen, who were delighted at the recital of
          the daring deeds and exalted <pb id="VAC0872-010" n="10"/> patriotism of their ancestors,
          who were represented as being on social terms with the gods, who often left their empyreal
          employments to aid some earth-born hero, who was struggling to kill a sphinx or centaur,
          or overthrow some tyrant who was trampling upon the liberties of his country.</p>
        <p>At first history, philosophy, eloquence, and poetry were all the same. Poetry had not
          then been divided into the different regular forms, and distinguished as pastoral,
          elegiac, epic, heroic, didactic, and dramatic. The genius and inspiration of the poet are
          divine gifts, and not the result of intellectual culture. Homer, the inventor of epic
          poetry, stands without a rival. Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, who may be regarded as
          the first dramatic poets, still remain masters of that class of composition. Virgil,
          Horace, Ovid, Anacreon, and Pindar are names that will ever live in the annals of song.
          Here we would like to advert to the galaxy of modern poets, in Europe and America, whose
          immortal numbers will echo down the stream of time until it mingles with the ocean of <pb
            id="VAC0872-011" n="11"/> eternity; but the jar and jostle of this actual, bustling,
          bread-and-butter world admonishes us to come back to terra-firma, and take part in the
          more practical yet absolutely necessary pursuits of every-day life.</p>

            <p>[T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> Christian is the highest style of man, and the <hi rend="i"
                >Evangelist</hi>, who proclaims the truths of the Gospel, occupies a higher position
              than any other human being. Earthly governments with all their grandeur and glory soon
              pass away; but the immutable truths of the Gospel are eternal. The patriot and
              statesman labor for our temporal happiness and prosperity as one of the families of
              nations. The Christian Minister labors for the eternal happiness of all mankind in
              that purer and better land, <q rend="blockquote"><lg>
                  <l>"Where rivers of pleasure unceasingly roll,</l>

                </lg></q></p>
            <p>The following Poem was suggested on hearing an able and eloquent sermon preached by
              the Rev. R<hi rend="sc">ICHARD</hi> H<hi rend="sc">ARGRAVE</hi>, at a Camp Meeting
              near Shawnee Prairie in July, 1834. I have heard many able evangelical sermons from
              eminent and pious ministers of the various Christian denominations, and find they all
              speak the same "language of Canaan," advocate the same cardinal doctrines of
              Christianity, and are seeking the same heavenly inheritance, which is incorruptible,
              undefiled, and fadeth not away.]</p>

            <l>Where forests rear their towering heads;</l>
            <l>Where hills, and vales, and flowery meads</l>

            <l>He speaks to none, but looks ahead,</l>

            <l>He recks not the tempest&mdash;his stalwart form</l>
            <l>Towers 'midst the gleam of the lurid storm:</l>
            <l>Vultures and ravens mix in the blast,</l>

            <l>And croaking frogs line the gloomy shore,</l>

            <l>Was when he landed our brother Abel.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>At first this Ferry was not so throng,</l>

            <l>Few trips were made o'er the Stygian flood,</l>
            <l>And the staple freight was from fields of blood;</l>
            <l>All ages and sexes he tumbled in,</l>
            <l>The man of God with the man of sin,</l>
            <l>The slave and his master, side by side,</l>
            <l>The Moor and the fair Circassian bride;</l>
            <l>Child and grandsire, grave and gay,</l>

            <l>From where the eternal pyramids stand,</l>
            <l>To the distant confines of the West</l>

            <l>When man resigned his fleeting breath,</l>
            <l>But a flood of light burst through the gloom&mdash;</l>
            <l>It springs from the Savior's opening tomb,</l>

            <l>The Stygian flood soon sunk away,</l>
            <l>And Jordan in its channel lay&mdash;</l>
            <l>A narrow stream, with pebbly shore,</l>

            <l>Old Charon's Boat is laid aside,</l>
            <l>Salvation's galleys now swiftly glide</l>
            <l>Athwart the narrow, turbid stream,</l>
            <l>Guided by the Day-star's gleam,</l>
            <l>Which like a thread of golden light,</l>
            <l>Girdles the sable folds of night;</l>
            <l>And drives death's Gorgon terrors far</l>
            <l>Before the light of Bethlehem's star.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>When I across that stream shall go,</l>
            <l>Sweet star, thy mildest radiance throw,</l>
            <l>And let me by thy gentle beam</l>
            <l>See far across the sluggish stream,</l>
            <l>Angelic cohorts thickly stand</l>

            <l>Whose Lydian notes oft fill'd this place?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>They're gone! Time rudely scatter'd the band&mdash;</l>
            <l>Has wither'd the cheek and palsied the hand;</l>
            <l>And many who here the play have led</l>
            <l>Are numbered now with the sleeping dead,</l>
            <l>And the rest are scattered o'er the world</l>
            <l>Like the leaf from its parent tendril hurl'd.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O, Ellen, no more shall thy guitar's strain</l>
            <l>Ring witchingly through this bower or plain,</l>
            <l>And Orlando's sweet and blithesome lute</l>
            <l>Has ceas'd to echo&mdash;lies still and mute;</l>
            <l>Yet thy guitar's strain and his charming note</l>
            <l>Shall in fancy's nice ear often float.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The only music that wakes this grove</l>
            <l>Are the wood-bird's artless lays of love,</l>
            <l>And the honey-bees humming round the flower,</l>
            <l>With the breeze that rustles through the bower,</l>
            <l>Or the whippowil at the close of day,</l>
            <l>Or the screech-owl from the time-scath'd bay.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Though the band is gone, and the lov'd one's dead,</l>
            <l>And the cypress waves above her head,</l>
            <l>Yet on memory's page the scene is enroll'd</l>
            <pb id="VAC0872-060" n="60"/>
            <l>In brighter characters than gold,</l>
            <l>And shall last till the fatal shafts of death</l>
            <l>Shall pierce this bosom and steal my breath.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Adieu! to the wild and sacred shade,</l>
            <l>Where I so often in childhood played,</l>
            <l>To the soothing murmurs of the rill;</l>
            <l>To the fragrant garlands on the hill,</l>
            <l>To the violet wreath; to the sacred grove,</l>
            <l>To the notes of cheerfulness and love.</l>

              written at the times indicated by their dates, for the amusement of the writer, and a
              few special friends. Care has been taken to promote the general welfare of society,
              although satire is sometimes employed against the more reprehensible follies and vices
              of the times.</p>
            <p>The verses on the R<hi rend="sc">EBELLION</hi>, and those composed during the
              progress of the War, are intensely patriotic; so much so, that perhaps they would
              sound better North than South of Mason and Dixon's Line.</p>
            <p>Whether they possess poetic merit or not, they will doubtless be regarded as faithful
              historical annals of the times.</p>

            <lg>
              <l>L<hi rend="sc">OOK</hi> back, kind reader, through my humble rhymes,</l>
              <l>And take a glimpse of good old-fashioned times,</l>
              <l>When our good Fathers wrote with goose quill pen,</l>
              <l>And only grown-up gentlemen were men;</l>
              <l>When Mothers taught their daughters how to spin,</l>
              <l>And preachers North and South made war on sin;</l>
              <l>Ere telegraphs into our borders came</l>
              <l>To whisper messages with tongues of flame;</l>
              <l>Or steamboats on our lakes and rivers ran;</l>
              <l>Or railroads their triumphant course began;</l>
              <l>Ere blooded cattle left their native shore;</l>
              <l>Or Shanghai chickens had been peddled o'er:</l>
              <l>When female chicken sat upon its nest</l>
              <l>To hatch her eggs (that method seemed the best,)</l>
              <l>For then no furnaces were built for hatchers,</l>
              <l>And mother hens were deemed the better scratchers.</l>
              <pb id="VAC0872-064" n="64"/>
              <l>Law then had reason, Justice for its guide,</l>
              <l>And Judges then on merits would decide,</l>
              <l>They searched for <hi rend="i">facts</hi>, nor did they once incline</l>
              <l>To try the cause by <hi rend="i">Mason and Dixon's line</hi>.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>The Doctor, too, (for people then were ill,)</l>
              <l>Was always careful how he mixed his pill;</l>
              <l>Careful he was of patient's limb and life,</l>
              <l>And rarely used the amputating knife&mdash;</l>
              <l>Quack nostrums then were seldom made,</l>
              <l>Medicine was termed a science, not a trade.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>From morn till night mechanics plied their tools&mdash;</l>
              <l>Nor squared their labor then by ten hour rules,</l>
              <l>And if they made a bureau, chair, or reel,</l>
              <l>Or put new felloes in a wagon wheel,</l>
              <l>It was a matter plainly understood</l>
              <l>The article and maker's warranty was good;</l>
              <l>For pine and linn, by way of crafty joke</l>
              <l>Were never put in axle-tree, or spoke;</l>
              <l>Worm-eaten timber then was seldom used,</l>
              <l>Though daubed with putty, still it was refused;</l>
              <l>A cow-skin boot would wear a year or more;</l>
              <l>A good fur hat, well used, would last for four,</l>
              <l>For <hi rend="i">Fashion</hi>&mdash;spruce and fickle jade&mdash;</l>
              <l>Not often showed her freaks to help on trade,</l>
              <l>The father's great-coat with its ample cape</l>
              <l>Was like <hi rend="i">his</hi> father's, both in hue and shape;</l>
              <l>Young men wore box-coats, and huge bell-crown hats,</l>
              <l>Plain swan's-down vests, and black silk cravats&mdash;</l>
              <pb id="VAC0872-065" n="65"/>
              <l>No fourteen dollar jacket then was seen</l>
              <l>On a boy-man just entering on sixteen.</l>
              <l>These robin-redbreasts are of later date,</l>
              <l>'T is lately only they have grown so great&mdash;</l>
              <l>Cigars and brandy nine times in a day,</l>
              <l>In other times 't was hinted would not pay&mdash;</l>
              <l>Mustache and goatee then was never seen,</l>
              <l>And neat trimm'd whiskers had a face between:</l>
              <l>But should a boy train'd in our higher schools</l>
              <l>Be cramped and fettered by old fogy rules?</l>
              <l>And girls from boarding-schools be hurried home&mdash;</l>
              <l>(Why not be sent to learn to paint, to Rome?)</l>
              <l>And thus be thwarted in their darling wishes&mdash;</l>
              <l>Brought home to spin, and cook, and wash the dishes!</l>
              <l>Pianos, Polkas, quadrilles, all adieu!</l>
              <l>The Bank has broke, and <hi rend="i">Pa</hi> is ruined too!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>All at the Concert, or the Church would sing,</l>
              <l>Without an organ, flute, or fiddle-string;</l>
              <l>But Giles Mellifluous&mdash;leader of our choir,</l>
              <l>Whose vocal talents half the town admire&mdash;</l>
              <l>Has often said with an indignant sneer,</l>
              <l>Holding his polished tune-fork to his ear&mdash;</l>
              <l>That such rude music was a sad disgrace,</l>
              <l>To Church or Concert, or to any place&mdash;</l>
              <l>Such harsh, discordant notes were sung,</l>
              <l>Half through the nose, the other half by tongue&mdash;</l>
              <l>That Patent buckwheat notes would never do,</l>
              <l>(He sung the <hi rend="i">do, ra, me's, and round notes too,</hi>)</l>
              <l>'T was his opinion in the realms above</l>
              <l>Where all is music, harmony, and love,</l>
              <pb id="VAC0872-066" n="66"/>
              <l>No common Angel is allowed to sing,</l>
              <l>To touch a lute, or strike a sweet harp string,</l>
              <l>Gabriel, and Archangels only dare aspire</l>
              <l>To join the ranks of the Celestial Choir!</l>
              <l>But Giles may be mistaken, for that rule</l>
              <l>Would knock to flinders Giles' singing school!</l>
              <l>For who would learn such dulcet strains below</l>
              <l>If such sweet strains could never higher go?</l>
              <l>Must we condemn the wise Creator's plan</l>
              <l>To suit the nice, fastidious taste of Man?</l>
              <l>Then not a bird's nor insect's voice we'd hear</l>
              <l>That did not chime harmonious on the ear;</l>
              <l>The jay, the black-bird, and the little wren,</l>
              <l>Would flit in silence through the shady glen;</l>
              <l>And in the moonlight, on the distant hill,</l>
              <l>No Owl we'd hear, nor plaintive Whippowil;</l>
              <l>The <hi rend="i">Katydid</hi> in twilight hours no more</l>
              <l>Would chirp as cherrily as it did of yore,</l>
              <l>Kingfishers flying up and down our rivers</l>
              <l>Should never trill their demi-semi-quavers,</l>
              <l>The Cuckoo, Thrush, and gentle Turtle Dove</l>
              <l>Alone might warble their sweet notes of Love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Hoops then encircled hogsheads, barrels, tubs,</l>
              <l>(Now I've offended Miss Jerusha Stubbs,</l>
              <l>Arid other women who affect to frown,</l>

              <l>Since Satan strove upon the plains of Heaven,</l>
              <l>And with his rebel hosts from thence was driven,</l>

              <l>No war so wicked, cruel, and unjust,</l>

              <l>To defend which their blood was freely spilt.</l>
              <l>O! Revolutionary Fathers! can it be</l>

              <l>The glorious star-gemmed Banner of the Free,</l>

              <l>Why not divide, to number ninety-three?</l>
              <l>And then if malcontents should still be found,</l>

            <l>The Sycamore-tree stood near the Mill,</l>
            <l>The grapevine swing was on the hill;</l>
            <l>The canoes still in the mill-pond lay</l>
            <l>Where I moor'd it often in childhood's day,</l>
            <l>And the Elm that stood near our cabin door,</l>
            <l>Sway'd in the wind as it did of yore.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The old log school-house with clapboard roof,</l>
            <l>For years 'gainst the weather had been proof&mdash;</l>
            <l>The same oak pin made fast the door,</l>
            <l>The same hewed puncheons formed the floor&mdash;</l>
            <l>The windows&mdash;long logs half chopp'd away&mdash;</l>
            <l>The chimney was built of cat-an-clay.</l>

            <l>The wild deer bounded athwart the lea,</l>
            <l>And wood-birds warbled from bower and tree&mdash;</l>
            <l>The Indian's wigwam as ever stood</l>
            <l>Half hid 'midst a thicket of hazelwood;</l>
            <l>And near the bridge that spann'd the rill</l>
            <l>Still plash'd, and paddled my flutter mill.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I heard afar the hunter's horn</l>
            <l>O'er the distant hills at early morn;</l>
            <l>And along the river's winding shore</l>
            <l>Plied the Keel-boat's slowly sweeping oar,</l>
            <l>And the Pirogue suddenly hove in view,</l>
            <l>With its merry, rowing, singing crew.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>My dream then changed. I sought again</l>
            <l>Our verdant play-place on the plain,</l>
            <l>But, lo! an orchard was blooming there,</l>
            <l>Where erst sweet blossoms scented the air&mdash;</l>
            <l>Our cabin was gone, and the cut-down hill</l>
            <l>Had swept away the old grist-mill.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No school-house, or Wigwam could I espy,</l>
            <l>But a Locomotive went thundering by,</l>
            <l>The Telegraph passed where the hunter trod,</l>
            <l>Strange, transverse, talkative lightning rod!</l>
            <l>The Steamboat had taken the Pirogue's place,</l>
            <l>And the Indian reluctantly left the chase.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A Town with its hum and bustle stood near,</l>
            <l>And its bells were ringing in my ear&mdash;</l>
            <pb id="VAC0872-100" n="100"/>
            <l>Tall steeples were glittering in the sun</l>
            <l>Where often I'd seen the wild deer run.</l>
            <l>The harsh, rattling Gong my slumber broke,</l>
            <l>And I from my childhood dream awoke!</l>

          <p>[A <hi rend="sc">YOUNG</hi> Indian Prince, previous to going to battle, returned to his
            betrothed, a rich and beautiful Wampum Belt which she had woven with her own hands, and
            presented to him as a token of her constancy. Considering the approaching battle as
            extremely doubtful as to its results, and desiring that the precious keepsake should not
            fall into the hands of a victorious enemy, he persuades her to keep it for him while he
            goes to the conflict. She reluctantly consents. Her gallant young brave soon plunged
            into the thickest of the fight, and fell on the gory battle-field within less than a
            league of the lodge of his swarthy but true-hearted maiden.]</p>

            <l>S<hi rend="sc">IR</hi> W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> at his Mansion door,</l>
            <l>Being skill'd in every kind of lore,</l>
            <l>Began to plan what course to take,</l>
            <l>For <hi rend="i">Love</hi> had caused his heart to ache;</l>
            <l>The archer boy had hurl'd a dart</l>
            <l>Which pierc'd him through his valiant heart;</l>
            <l>There, like some stricken deer he stood&mdash;</l>
            <l>When all at once from the dark wood</l>
            <l>A frightful yell broke on his ear,</l>
            <l>Which caused him momentary fear;</l>
            <l>But thinking of his mule and gun,</l>
            <l>He then could either fight, or run,</l>
            <l>As the occasion might require,</l>
            <l>And as instructed by his Squire;</l>
            <l>For faithful was that chosen page,</l>
            <l>In all his Master did engage;</l>
            <l>And often by his good advice,</l>
            <l>They'd gain a victory in a trice.</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And as the frightful yell still rung</l>
            <l>Like the hoarse Clarion's brazen tongue,</l>
            <pb id="VAC0872-105" n="105"/>
            <l>The valiant Knight thought it was best</l>
            <l>To have his Squire up and drest;</l>
            <l>For it was then the noon of night,</l>
            <l>And <hi rend="i">Love</hi>, with its soft, glimmering light,</l>
            <l>Which burns as well by night as day,</l>
            <l>Had kept the drowsy god away;</l>
            <l>Nor had the Knight once clos'd his eye</l>
            <l>In slumber, when he heard the cry,</l>
            <l>"Up, Sudo, up, strange sounds I hear,</l>
            <l>Our enemies are doubtless near!</l>
            <l>And from the noise across the glen,</l>
            <l>There must be threescore armed men!"</l>
            <l>Forth in an instant sprang the Squire,</l>
            <l>And soon had on his full attire;</l>
            <l>And at this time the Knight was seen</l>
            <l>Plunging his legs in Beaverteen;</l>
            <l>For, until then, his Squire has said,</l>
            <l>He was just as he'd gone to bed;</l>
            <l>His coat around him next he threw,</l>
            <l>And to his trusty fire-lock flew;</l>
            <l>And Sudo, blundering o'er a stool,</l>
            <l>Lanch'd forth to rig his Master's mule:</l>
            <l>Next for his sword the Knight dash'd round,</l>
            <l>Until the deadly blade he found;</l>
            <l>And buckling it upon his thigh,</l>
            <l>While marshal fire flash'd from his eye&mdash;</l>
            <l>Thus to his waiting Squire he spoke,</l>
            <l>"Let the mean cravens howl and croak,</l>
            <l>And steal upon us in the night,</l>
            <l>They'd cower to view me in the light:</l>
            <pb id="VAC0872-106" n="106"/>
            <l>This blade will take us safely through&mdash;</l>
            <l>Be brave and cautious now my <hi rend="i">Su</hi>."</l>
            <l>But Sudo thought it best to stay,</l>
            <l>And fight them just at dawn of day;</l>
            <l>But W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> to this plan demurred,</l>
            <l>Saying, "I'm your lord and must be heard!</l>
            <l>Shall <hi rend="i">Emma Seaton</hi> ever hear</l>
            <l>That <hi rend="i">William</hi> shunned a fight through fear?</l>
            <l>Shall blushes mantle her sweet face,</l>
            <l>On hearing of her Knight's disgrace?</l>
            <l>No, sooner let this throbbing heart</l>
            <l>Be pierc'd by every deadly dart</l>
            <l>That bristles thick in yonder wood&mdash;</l>
            <l>To die in such a cause is good.</l>
            <l>We must immediately prepare,</l>
            <l>I think P<hi rend="sc">HILANTHROPOS</hi> is there;</l>
            <l>And if he is, he soon shall feel</l>
            <l>The terrors of my vengeful steel;</l>
            <l>His marshaled clan shall bleed or fly,</l>
            <l>Before the dawn shall gild the sky."</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And as he ended this short speech,</l>
            <l>Forward he thrust his hand to reach</l>
            <l>The rein that curb'd the fiery mule,</l>
            <l>And ordered <hi rend="i">Su</hi> to bring the stool;</l>
            <l>Then mounting on his battle steed,</l>
            <l>Cried, "Hurry, Sudo, hasten, speed!</l>
            <l>And let us wind across the glen,</l>
            <l>And meet those fierce and warlike men;"</l>
            <l>And spurring up his charger, then</l>
            <l>Plung'd headlong through a miry fen;</l>
            <pb id="VAC0872-107" n="107"/>
            <l>And Sudo stumbling o'er a log</l>
            <l>Fell "neck and heels" into the bog;</l>
            <l>The Knight then fearing for his Squire</l>
            <l>Got down, and dragg'd him from the mire&mdash;</l>
            <l>Poor Sudo, covered o'er with mud,</l>
            <l>Being addled, asked if it was blood;</l>
            <l>W<hi rend="sc">ILLIAM</hi> informed him it was not,</l>
            <l>And on his dripping charger got;</l>
            <l>Then told his Squire to mount behind,</l>
            <l>And they the foe anon would find:</l>
            <l>Thus up the hill the mule then run,</l>
            <l>The Knight with sword, and <hi rend="i">Su</hi> with gun;</l>
            <l>They scour'd the forest round and round,</l>
            <l>But not a foe could there be found;</l>
            <l>And <hi rend="i">William's</hi> marshal rage grew high,</l>
            <l>And then he shouted "Rascals fly!</l>
            <l>You dare not meet a single man&mdash;</l>
            <l>This blade can thin your murderous clan!</l>
            <l>Fly! base assassins! would you steep</l>
            <l>Your blades in valor when asleep?"</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">And as he ended this shrill shout</l>
            <l>They heard the noise that brought them out;</l>
            <l>And a sound pelt upon the head,</l>
            <l>Laid Knight and Squire on earth for dead:</l>
            <l>Hard was the blow, and long they lay,</l>
            <l>And the scared charger moped away.</l>

            <l>"Plague on that Owl," then Sudo said,</l>

            <l>And feeling for his sword around,</l>

            <l>Not from this knot upon my head,</l>

            <l>Now, Sudo, let us cross the glen</l>

            <l>And always <hi rend="i">stick to it</hi>, my lark,</l>

            <l>With anger and with shame they burned.</l>

          <p>L<hi rend="sc">ITTLE</hi> is known of the history of the people who lived before the
            Flood. All we know concerning them may be found recorded in a few of the first chapters
            of Genesis. This Poem opens with the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.
            Allusion is made to their forlorn condition after their expulsion from
            Paradise&mdash;the Earth cursed on account of man's transgression&mdash;Sin hereditary,
            and is transmitted to Adam's Offspring&mdash;Cain slays Abel&mdash;Physical
            Phenomenon&mdash;Earthquakes, Tornadoes, and Tempests deform land and sea&mdash;A
            belligerent Spirit seizes beasts, birds, fishes, and insects&mdash;Idolatry&mdash;War,
            and Crimes of the Antediluvians&mdash;Noah Preaches Righteousness&mdash;Longevity
            favorable to the increase and spread of Crime&mdash;Enoch translated to
            Heaven&mdash;Noah's Sermon after entering the Ark&mdash;His audience&mdash;After the Ark
            is closed the Polar storms are let loose, and the Earth is soon covered with water,
            drowning every living thing except those within the Ark&mdash;The drifting
            Ark&mdash;Noah's Astronomical speculations&mdash;Geology bears evidence of the
            Flood.</p>

            <l>Wild, horrid screams of drowning men and beasts</l>
