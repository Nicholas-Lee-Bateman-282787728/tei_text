          THE TRAIL TO BOYLAND
          
            Where the maple leaves are yellow 
            And the apples plump and mellow,
            And the purple grapes are bursting with their rich autumnal wine,
             And the oak leaves redly flaming--
            All the blaze of sunset shaming-- 
            Is a trail that wanders idly to a land of yours and mine.
          
          
            It goes through the grassy hollows 
            And across the hills; it follows 
            All the playful turns and curvings of the ever-singing streams;
            Overgrown with tangled grasses,
            All the olden haunts it passes
             Till it fades into a vista that is cherished in our dreams.
          
          
            Past the pokeweeds and their berries
            And the dance-halls of the fairies,
            Over field and through the forest it goes ever on and on, 
            With the thrush and killdee singing; 
            And the redbird madly winging
            Far ahead of us to somewhere, where the sunset meets the dawn.
          
          
          
            Up and down, the hillside hugging,
             With the hazel bushes tugging
            At our arms, and blushing sumach holding spicy berries out;
             And the haw-trees and the beeches,
            Hickories and plums and peaches--
            Just as young and just as plenty--all our thoughts of age to flout!
          
          
            So it stretches and it glistens,
            Far away--and he who listens 
            Hears the echo of the hailings and the murmur of a song
             That comes through the silence throbbing--
            Half with laughter, half with sobbing--
             Till it clutches at the heart-strings and would hold them overlong.
          
          
            'Tis the trail--the Trail to Boyland-- 
            How it spans the miles to joyland!
            Passing leafy lane and blossom-tangled vine, and bush and tree,
            Coaxing bees till they, in coming,
             Fill the hush of noon with humming-- 
            And the wondrous way to Boyland stretches fair for you and me!
          
        

        
        
          THE OLD WELL
          
            It seems just like 't'uz yesterday 
             An' me a younker o' thirteen-- 
             One-gallused, freckled, full o' play, 
             Th' boy-est boy you ever seen! 
             A-rompin' over all th' town 
             An' gettin' het up fit to kill, 
            Then takin' time to simmer down 
             At that ol' well by Mitchell's mill.
          
          
            Remember it? Th' shaky pump 
            'Ith water drippin' from th' spout,
            Or gushin' when--kalump! kalump!--
            We'd almost pull th' handle out.
            We'd catch a cupful an' we'd drink, 
            An', say, but it was cold an' sweet! 
            It makes me young again to think 
            How it 'ud spatter on my feet.
          
          
            W'y, Kil Dunlap, one time he said
            That water wuz th' best on earth
             An' any man whose thirst 'uz fed 
            On it 'ud get his money's worth.

            
             Yes, sir--the best! W'y, even yet
            I hear him sayin' it as plain--
             An' he had traveled, don't forget,
            F'om Californy plumb to Maine!
          
          
            Well-water nowadays-- But, pshaw!
            They ain't none now 'at fills th' bill. 
            I never drunk an' never saw
            As good as that at Mitchell's mill.
            An' when I think o' how I used 
            To let it run an' go to waste,
             My thirstiness is all unloosed
            An' I fair shrivel for a taste!
          
        


        
        
          THE BOY-DAYS
          
            As I was in the days of my youth.
            --Job. 
          




          
            The boy-days--the boy-days--they were the best of all!
            Through all the hushes of the years the boy-days ever call;
            Out of the darkness of the night resplendently they shine,
            And what a wreath of memories for one and all they twine!
            No matter what of baser stuff the later years may hold,
            We may look up and back and see the boy-days all were gold.
          
          
            The boy-days--the boy-days--when come the threads of gray,
            You may live in To-morrow, but you dream of Yesterday;
            You may look in the mirror, but the only face you see
             Is one that has the semblance of the boy you used to be;
            And, musing, you may stumble on a broken bit of song
             That wanders from the boy-days in a cadence sweet and strong.
          

          
          
            The boy-days--a picture with not a hue to fade;
            The glamour of the grasses where the summer sunshine played;
            The sparkle of the ripple in some jolly little stream
            Whose song was built of jewels of a never-dying gleam;
            The nodding of the roses; and the whiteness of the snow--
             They blend across the picture of the long and long ago. 
          
          
            The boy-days--the boy-days--we never lose them all;
            The best of all the memories, they come at fancy's call.
            Somehow they are made perfect by the alchemy of years,
            Which keeps alive the smiles they held and never finds the tears.
             The heart is but a treasure chest our precious things to hold,
            And chiefest of the goodly store is all the boy-days' gold.
          
        

        
        
          THE FIFTH READER 
          
            "McGuffey's New Fifth Reader"--
             Found in some dusty nook;
            Dog's-eared and worn and tattered-
            A yellowed, faded book
            With checkered cotton cover
            Of careful stitch and fold. 
            Let's turn the ragged pages
            And see what it may hold. 
          

          
          
            They've raised the school-room window--
            My, but the sky is blue! 
            And there's a pigeon strutting,
            With melancholy coo; 
             And over there a hillside 
            Where leafy, spreading trees 
            Wave arms in useless summons
            With every passing breeze.
          
          
            Off yonder is an orchard--
             Don't you catch the perfume
            And hear the teacher thank us 
            For that big bunch of bloom? 

            
            The buzzing sounds of study
            And writing--can't you hear?
            And see where all the bad boys
            Have good seats at the rear?
          
          
            Now, let your head drop slowly 
            And look away--away-- 
            Straight through the open window,
            Through all the miles of day, 
            Across the sighing meadow,
            And down the merry brook,
             Which babbles of its travels 
            Through tempting field and nook.
          
          
            The old school bell! You hear it? 
            Does it not bring to you
            The lazy early mornings
            When flowers dripping dew
             Smiled knowingly, and flaunted 
            Their banners in your way? 
          
          
          
            It's all in this Fifth Reader
             Which you have found to-day.
          
        
        
          
          HICKORY NUTTIN' 
          
            The bes' time in the year for boys is when it's hickory nuttin'--
            There's been a frost an' all the hulls is openin' an' shut-in'
            An' winkin' at the squirrels that just jumps round an' chatters
             An' scoots about a mile away when "plop!" a big nut clatters.
             Us boys is glad on Saturdays--we're off of all our studies.
            I wouldn't trade my fun that day for yours or anybody's!
          
          
            You get a good two-bushel sack an' sling it on your shoulder
             An' wear your mittens an' your scarf--ma says it will get colder--
            An' then you strike out on the pike until you cross the river--
            We use to go in swimmin' there. Ooh! Makes a fellow shiver!
             From there you cut acrost the fields; it doesn't take a minute 
            Until you see a shaggy tree, an' then--why, then you're in it!
          
          
          
            The shaggy tree's the shellbark kind; there ain't a nut that beats it,
             I don't care where you get it at, nor when a fellow eats it.
            But butternuts is purty good; it ain't so hard to shake 'em,
             An' then there's hazel-nuts around an' us boys always take 'em. 
            So purty soon you get your sack filled plumb up to the middle,
             An' when you shake it there's a tune that's better than a fiddle.
          
          
            You don't go home the way you come; you cut acrost by Tucker's, 
            An' strike a ripe pe'simmon tree, an' fill your lips with puckers; 
            An' mebbe there's some dried-up grapes--the wild kind --still a-clingin' 
             But then you haf to climb a fence; that sack sets you a-reelin', 
            It bumps you in the back, an' where you have a hungry feelin'.
          
          
            So, you start home acrost the farms, the weeds an' stubble crackin'-- 
            You playin' you're a Injun an' that it's a bear you're trackin';

            
            Afore you know how late it is the edge o' town you've sighted,
            An' get all empty inside when you see the street lamps lighted. 
            You never feel that heavy sack when you walk home, a-struttin'-- 
            The bes' time in the year for boys is when it's hickory nuttin'.
          
        

        
          
           THE BOY THAT YOU USED TO BE
          
            Would you know him again to-day,
            If, somehow, he should come to you,
            If he halted you on the way
             Would your memory serve you true? 
            With the air of the old boy-days,
            With the smile that was fair and free,
             Would you know, if he met your gaze, 
            Just the boy that you used to be?
          
          
            Ho! The boy that you used to be,
            Ere you wrinkled with care and fret!
            What a wonder if you could see 
            That boy! Isn't he living yet?
            Does he never come back in dreams 
            Made of memory's witchery?
             Straight and fair in the rosy gleams--
            Just the boy that you used to be!
          
          
            Do you never hold speech with him
            In that past, with its afterglow?
            See his figure, though blurred and dim--
             Ask him why did he ever go?

            
             Do you never go hand in hand--
            Wander back, till again you see
             All the charm of the lost Boyland
             With the boy that you used to be? 
          
          
            Does he know you, when oft he comes
            Where you dream all your dreams alone? 
            Is the melody that he hums
            But the one that to song has grown?
             Honest-hearted and white of soul--
            Do you know such a one as he? 
            Then you're reaching the greatest goal--
             Just the boy that you used to be.
          
        
        
          
          SORGHUM TIME
          
             I'm mighty glad when sorghum time is gittin' round again
             'Cause Uncle Silas allus sends a big jug of it nen
             An' ma she puts th' jug away behime th' cellar stairs 
            'Cause 'at's th' cooles' spot they is in our house anywheres.
            An' nen she gits a pitcher full for all us folks to use,
            An' when we're eatin' breakfas', pa he makes us curly-cues.
          
          
            My pa can take th' pitcher up an' let th' sorghum run 
            Out of it in a teeny stream--an' I tell you it's fun
             When he jest makes it whirl around mos' ever' which-away 
            An' w'ites my name wite on my plate--he makes th' big- ges' J 
            An' nen he whops th' sorghum 'round fer O, an' H, an' N-- 
            An' nen I'm purty tickled 'cause it's sorghum time again.
          
          
            Ma ain't th' same as pa--she sez molasses ain't as good
            As pencils is to w'ite things 'ith, 'at sorghum's made fer food. 
            
            But pa he laffs an' sez he 'lows as how it wouldn't do
             Fer wimmen-folks to w'ite 'ithout no handle fer to chew.
             Nen ma she says she pities men 'at never sees no jokes 
            I'thout it's somepin' 'at's made up about th' wimmen-folks.
          
          
             O' course they're only funnin'. Nen my ma sometimes she takes
            Th' pitcher in her hand an' makes me elephunts an' snakes 
            An' turkles, too--an' nen I wait until they run and spread
            An' nen I tell 'em all good-by an' dip in 'ith my bread.
            I like it bes' when pa whops out that J, O, H an' N, 
            But I'm as glad as anything it's sorghum time again.
          
        
        
          
          JOHNNY'S PA
          
            My pa--he always went to school,
             He says, an' studied hard.
            W'y, when he's just as big as me 
            He knew things by the yard!
             Arithmetic? He knew it all
            From dividend to sum;
             But when he tells me how it was, 
            My grandma, she says "Hum!"
          
          
            My pa--he always got the prize
             For never bein' late;
            An' when they studied joggerfy 
            He knew 'bout every state.
            He says he knew the rivers, an'
            Knew all their outs an' ins;
            But when he tells me all o' that,
            My grandma, she just grins.
          
          
            My pa, he never missed a day
             A-goin' to the school,
            An' never played no hookey, nor
            Forgot the teacher's rule;
            
             An' every class he's ever in,
            The rest he always led.
            My grandma, when pa talks that way,
             Just laughs, an' shakes her head.
          
          
            My grandma says 'at boys is boys,
            The same as pas is pas,
            An' when I ast her what she means 
            She says it is "because." 
            She says 'at little boys is best
             When they grows up to men,
            Because they know how good they was,
            An' tell their children, then!
          
        
        
          
          HONEY-HAUNTED
          
            Doc Stewart's bees--they knew the town
            As well as any boy of us.
             They searched the gardens up and down;
             They--bee-like--were industrious.
            Their honey--Oh, the tang it had!--
            As mellow as the richest wine 
            Which holds no dream that is not glad--
             A soothing sweetness, fair and fine.
          
          
            The old-time honey! Amber-hued
             And syrupy--and how it clung 
            As though the bees in sleepy mood
            Had loitered where the poppies swung!
            And how its pungent perfume filled
            The air, whenever it was spread,
            As if some jocund elf had spilled 
            The glory of a flower-bed!
          
          
            Why, you could shut your eyes and taste 
            The wild red roses by the mill,
            And mark the way the bees had traced 
            The clover blooms beyond the hill;
            
             And there were hints of violets 
            And honeysuckles; lilacs, too,
            Had paid their lavish honey-debts
             And left their fragrance floating through.
          
          
            The old-time honey! Who has sung
            Of sweeter memories than this? 
            A rarer morsel on the tongue
            Has never filled the heart with bliss.
             It held the songs of summer days,
             And whisperings of scented trees--
            Down boyhood's unforgotten ways 
            There comes the croon of Stewart's bees.
          
        
        
          
          "SH-H-H!"
          
             My ma--she's up-stairs in bed,
            An' It's there wif her.
            It's all bundled up an' red-- 
            Can't nobody stir;
            Can't nobody say a word 
            Since It come to us.
            Only thing 'at I have heard,
            'Ceptin' all Its fuss,
            Is "Sh-h-h!"
          
          
            I goed in to see my ma,
            Nen clumb on th' bed.
            Was she glad to see me? Pshaw!
            
              "Sh-h-h!"--'at's what she said!
             Nen It blinked an' tried to see-- 
             Nen I runned away
             Out to my old apple-tree
            Where no one could say
            
              "Sh-h-h!"
            
          
          
          
            Nen I laid down on th' ground 
            An' say 'at I jest wish
            I was big! An' there's a sound-- 
            'At old tree says "Sh-h-h!"
            Nen I cry an' cry an' cry 

            Till my pa, he hears
             An' comed there an' wiped my eye
            An' mop' up th' tears--
             Nen sez "Sh-h-h!"
          
          
            I'm go' tell my ma 'at she
            Don't suit me one bit--
            Why d' they all say "Sh-h-h!" to me
             An' not say "Sh-h-h!" to It?
          
        
        
        
          TUNING UP
          
            I reckon I'll be ready for the spring, when it gets here--
            The folks is huntin' up the yarbs an' boilin' 'em down clear; 
            The boneset an' the feverwort that's hung there in the loft
            Was put into the kittle just this mornin', when I coughed.
             Ma says m'laria's sure as death to settle in your bones,
            An' keeps her ears half-triggered for the first display o' moans.
          
          
            I reckon I'll be ready for the spring now, pretty soon-- 
            The sulphur an' molasses cure is gettin' me in tune. 
            I hardly like to take it, an' my backbone gets a sag 
            As soon as ma is mixin' it--an' oftentimes I gag!
            But if I swaller it right down, an' let it clear my skin,
            I'll be in shape to greet the spring when it comes rompin' in.
          
          
            I reckon I'll be ready for the spring, the way ma acts--
            She's soakin' me an' dosin' me with sweetened sassafrax,
            An' slipp'ry-ellum water for to keep away sore throat,
             An' pennyrile an' sage--another fever antidote--
            An' peppermint an' yaller root--I've got to take 'em all.
            Sometimes I wish, b'jing! that spring would stay away till fall.
          
        
        
        
          A FETTERED SOUL
          
            When people's souls is full o' rhyme, 
            I say it isn't right
            To make 'em plow jest all th' time 
             From early morn till night.
            Dad hasn't any feelin' fur
             A genius sech as me-- 
            Whoa, haw! Can't you go anywhur
            'Cept whur you shouldn't be?
          
          
            Yea, Buck! Confound mules, anyhow!
            That's right! Now bust a tug!
            You act as if this here old plow 
            Was more than you could lug.
            I wish you had to bear th' weight
            O' tryin' to show pa
             That you was born to better fate
            Than plowin' dirt. Whoa, haw!
          
          
            Whoa! Whoa, you lop-eared on'ry mule!
            It's hard enough to do
            Th' sums in sad affliction's school 
            Without endurin' you.

            
            I hear th' robin's chipper chirp
             An' see th' blossoms white--
            Why, even our old mongrel purp
            Is barkin', "Time to write!"
          
          
            But if I'd climb Parnassus' mount,
             My dad 'd come, I know,
            An' say th' place was no account 
            An' I should plow below.
            Us poets has a sorry lot 
            In this here vale o' tears--
            Yea, Buck! Whoa! Who told you to trot?
            Doggone your pesky ears!
          
        
        
        
          "AUCTION"
          
             Oh, this was long and long ago--a boy would trudge the street,
            And swing a bell in unison with what he would repeat.
            Somebody had an auction sale of stock or household wares;
             The boy would warn the town of it, delighted with the stares
            And curiosity he roused when he went clanging by,
            The bell a faithful second to his echo-raising cry: 
            "Auction! Auction!"
          
          
            Barefooted, flapping-trousered, not a care upon his heart; 
            Contented with the world he knew; contented with his part;
            He loitered by the orchard where the bees sought out the bruise
             That told them of the apple with the honey juice to lose;
             He shouted to the meadows where the birds went sailing by,
            And heard the dreaming forests wake and send him back his cry:
            "Auction! Auction!"
          
          
          
            Oh, that was long and long ago--but still to-day we see
            The glory of the sunset on the boy that used to be;
            And down the distance of the years the echoes faintly swell
            And bring a mellow murmur of his shoutings and his bell.
             Why did we auction off the wares we long to-day to hold?
            Why did we sell the happiness we did not know was gold?
            What is it comes rose-scented from the days that have gone by
            Upon the bosom of the breath that bears the boyish cry,
            "Auction! Auction!" 
          
        
        
        
          THE BOYHEART 
          
            The boyheart! The boyheart! It lies within your breast,
            All ready to go leaping when your soul is at its best--
            When on the street there comes to you a whistle or a call,
            Or but the echo of a song whose happy measures fall
            Upon the chords of memory, and rouse them into life
            Until they send a surging thrill as rich as drum or fife!
          
          
            The boyheart! The boyheart! It may be but a rose 
            That nods in careless glee at one as idly on he goes;
             But instantly he sees a street that wanders up and down
            Between the sleepy fences of the quiet little town;
            Or maybe 'tis a country road where swaying branches spread 
            And build an arching canopy of beauty overhead.
          
          
            The boyheart! The boyheart! The embers in the grate 
            May paint for one the picture that will bring the thoughts elate--
            A picture of the meadowlands which reach beside the brook 
            And blend into a forest where there's many a leafy nook,
            Where every tree that waves its arms, and swings and sweeps and sways 
            Is wafting shouts and laughter from the boytime summer days!
          
          
          
            The boyheart! The boyheart! Pray that you have it yet!
            A-many times its tugging thrills will leave your eyelids wet;
            A-many times its sudden beats will set your blood aflame 
            When out of all the other years will come a whispered name;
             A-many times you'll walk the ways you wandered when a lad, 
            If God has but been good to you and left the heart you had.
          
        
        
        
          THE HARVEST APPLE-TREE.
          
            The old harvest apple-tree--
            Haunt of boy, and bird, and bee-- 
            With its arms held wide to welcome all the breeze's revelry!
            You remember where it grew;
            And remember how we knew 
            All the goodness and the gladness that it held for me and you.
          
          
            When the wind was soft and low,
            How the leaves swayed to and fro
             With the sunshine sifting through them to the dappled grass below;
            And the shimmer and the shade 
            Were an endless cavalcade
             Of the fairy troops of summer to attend us as we played!
          
          
            In the branches waving high,
            We were sailors, and we'd cry 
            An Ahoy! to all the argosies of clouds a-scudding by.
            On the grass below we'd weave
            All the fancies that deceive
            And convince us of the trueness of the land of make-believe.
          
          
          
            And the yellow apples, too--
            Sweetened by the dripping dew,
            Faintly blushing at the kisses that the teasing sunshine threw--
             Oh, the famed Hesperides
            Never yielded such as these, 
            With a winy tang that coaxed us till we sipped it to the lees!
          
          
            The old harvest apple-tree--
            Haunt of boy, and bird, and bee--
             With its arms that waved a welcome every day to you and me!
            Clear in memory's dim haze,
             Happily it swings and sways, 
            Wafting us a thousand echoes of the cherished yesterdays!
          

          
          
             
          
        
        
        
        
          THE GOOD EXAMPLE
          
             Homer Campbell never gets 
             No dirt on his hands er face
            Ner his clo'es--he never sets
             On th' grass, er any place
             Where there's leaves, er mud er dust,
            An' his pants is never tore--
             He's afraid 'at he 'ud bust
             If he slid a cellar door!
          
          
             "Do like Homer Campbell does!"
            'At's th' on'y thing I hear.
             Seems as if it al'ays wuz
             Hollerin' right in my ear. 
            Homer Campbell's in my class-- 
            Al'ays has his lessons right,
            Never gives no one no sass;
             Al'ays answers up polite.
          
          
            "Notice Homer Campbell, boys,"
            Says th' teacher, ever' day.
            "Homer never causes noise,
            Ner disturbs in any way."
            
             Ma says Homer is so good-- 
            If all other childern here
             Would jest do like him it would
            Fill their parunts full o' cheer.
          
          
            One time in the Sunday-school
            Teacher ast us all what wuz
            Give us fer our golden rule. 
            I says: "Do like Homer does!" 
            She jest smiled an' looked at me,
            Nen said we should all take pride
            An' be good as we could be, 
            Havin' Homer as our guide.
          
          
            "Do like Homer Campbell does!"
             Pa an' ma an' ever' one 
            Says so much, it seems to buzz 
            All aroun', an' spoil my fun.
            Sometimes I jest sneak away,
            Nen they think 'at I'm ashamed.
            But I go 'way off, an' say:
            "Homer Campbell be dadblamed!"
          
        
        
        
          THE "ROOKIE" EXPLAINS
          
            It ain't that I'm sick; but I want to see 
            All the ramblin' streets of the good old town,
             With the grassy curbs like they used to be
            An' the swayin' fences, half-way down.
             The old school-house, an' the depot, too,
            With the baggage truck where we used to sit
             An' watch the trains while they hurried through--
            An' war? I had never heard tell of it!
          
          
            It ain't that I'm sick, just exactly, yet 
            I'm a-fightin' hard to keep back the blues
            When I think of things that I can't forget--
            You know how a fellow '11 sometimes muse
            Of folks an' the place where he used to be. 
            An' see things? See 'em! Now, listen. Say!
             There's an old town pump, always drippin' free--
            I can hear those drops just as plain as day!
          
          
            It ain't that I'm sick. If I only could 
            Get among them scenes for an hour or so,
             To show that I loved an' I understood
             All the good old times of the long ago.
            
            If I only could-- Don't you understand?
             Or is it a baby soldier's talk?
             But there ain't no way to go there by land,
            An' home 's too far when a man can't walk.
          
          
            It ain't that I'm sick. But by night an' day
            I can see the stretch of the little street,
             An' I hear the shouts of the boys at play,
            An' the dusty swish of the runnin' feet;
            I can hear the call of the old school bell 
            An' the bang an' blare of the old home band;
             An' I get a whiff of the roses' smell-
            But I ain't sick! Can't you understand?
          
        

        
        
          IN THE ATTIC 
          
            Up in the attic where mother goes
             Is a trunk in a shadowed nook--
             A trunk, and its lid she will oft unclose
            As if it were a precious book.
            She kneels at its side on the attic boards
             And tenderly, soft and slow, 
            She counts all the treasures she fondly hoards--
             The things of the long ago.
          
          
            A yellowing dress, once the sheerest white
            That shimmered in joyous pride--
             She looks at it now with the girl's delight
            That was hers when she stood a bride.
             There is a ribbon of faded blue
            She keeps with the satin gown; 
            Buckles and lace--and a little shoe; 
            Sadly she lays that down. 
          
          
            One lock of hair that is golden still 
            With the gold of the morning sun; 
            Yes, and a dolly with frock and frill-- 
            She lifts them all, one by one. 
            
             She lifts them all to her gentle lips,
            Up there in the afternoon; 
            Sometimes the rain from the eaves-trough drips 
            Tears with her quavered croon.
          
          
            Up in the attic where mother goes
            Is a trunk in a shadowed place--
            A trunk--with the scent of a withered rose
             On the satin and shoe and lace.
             None of us touches its battered lid,
            But safe in its niche it stays
            Sacred to all that her heart has hid--
             Gold of the other days.
          
        
        
        
          THE ROAD TO YESTERDAY
          
            There is a road to yesterday--
            A wondrous thoroughfare,
             Where wanton breezes idly play
            And blossoms scent the air.
             It stretches long and far and straight; 
            It wanders up and down;
             It passes many an open gate
             And many a little town.
          
          
            There is a road to yesterday; 
            The grasses grow beside,
            And trees that spread and swing and sway,
            And shade the pathway wide.
            Its flowers are a goodly sight,
            And it goes on and on
            And leads to many a starry night
            And many a cloudless dawn.
          
          
            There is a road to yesterday, 
            And we may trace its gleam 
            In flecking shade or dancing ray 
            Upon some little stream;

            
            Or we may see it, when, with eyes
            Half-closed, we hear a song 
            That calls up many a glad sunrise
            And many a twilight long. 
          
          
            There is a road to yesterday,
             And each one knows its start--
            The portal to this wondrous way
            Is held within the heart;
            From there the pleasant courses lead
            As far as one can see--
             It rests on many a golden deed
            And many a memory.
          
        
        
        
          SOMEWHERE
          
            Somewhere the roses are brave and red;
            And apple blossoms are sweet, and spread 
            A wistful perfume that scents the day
            And clings to zephyrs that croon away
            When night comes slowly and bids them stay.
             A wondrous fragrance the blossoms bear--
             And wouldn't you like to be there? 
          
          
            Somewhere the meadows are stretching green,
            As clear as jewels, and soft and clean,
            With dandelions in spangled show 
            That nod and beckon when breezes blow.
            Somewhere the meadows-- But don't you know 
            The tone and tang of the bracing air? 
            And wouldn't you like to be there?
          
          
            Somewhere there reaches a country road, 
            With crickets chanting a twilight ode;
            And bending branches to paint a shade
             Where moonbeams glimmer and gleam and fade,
             And will-o'-the-wisps in the distance wade.
            Somewhere the fireflies flash and flare--
             And wouldn't you like to be there?
          
          
          
             Somewhere--you know it; oh, who but holds 
            A memory that his heart enfolds--
             A memory of the leaning trees 
            And soothing song of the honeybees 
            And all of the boy-day melodies!
            Somewhere you lived in it all--somewhere--
            And wouldn't you like to be there? 
          
        
        
        
          BORROWIN' THE BABY 
          
            Good mornin'. My ma sent me
            To ast you how you was,
             An' hope you're well--you know 'at is
            Th' way she allus does.
            My ma, she sez you're strangers,
            But then she kind o' thought
            She'd like to borry th' baby 
            'At you folkses has got.
          
          
            My ma sets by th' window 
            An' watches you an' him,
             An' kind o' smiles an' cries to oncet, 
            'Cause he's like baby Jim.
            Who's Jim? He was our baby--
             We named him after pa.
             Say, can we borry your baby 
            A little while for ma?
          
          
            My ma, she sez she wouldn't
             Mind if your baby cried-- 
            She sez 'at's music in her ears
            Sence little Jim has died.
            
            She sez she'll be good to him,
            An' she'd like a whole lot 
            If we can borry th' baby 
            'At you folkses has got.
          
        
        
        
           "WHY?" 
          
            "Why?" He asked it all th' time-- 
            In th' mornin', soon as he
            Was awake, he use' to climb
            'Crost th' bed an' pester me.
             Asked it; asked it! Seemed as though
            He could make th' questions fly.
            When he went to sleep, a low 
            Whisper faded into "Why?"
          
          
             All th' whole endurin' day
            He kep' up his questioning,
             Runnin' up to me to say
            "Why was this?" an' ever'thing!
            Why did people have to work?
             Why did trees grow up so high?
             Looked like we must hire a clerk
             To keep up 'ith ev'ry "Why?"
          
          
            "Why?" I mind th' times I've laughed,
            Half-way puzzled, half-way vexed,
             Vowin' he 'ud drive me daft--
            Him a-thinkin' up th' next! 

            
            Bet they ain't a stone or limb,
            Or a star that's in th' sky,
             But one time it's started him
            On his never-endin' "Why?"
          

          

          
             No, he doesn't ask no more.
             Sometimes, nights, when mother draws
             Down th' blinds an' locks th' door,
             I, unthinkin', say: "Because."
            Then she turns an' tries to smile 
            But she breaks it 'ith a sigh;
             An' we sit th' long, long while
            Wonderin' an' askin' "Why?"
          
        
        
        
          A VEEK PEHINT CHRISTMAS 
          
             'Tis a veek pehint Christmas undt all droo der house
            Der chiltrens iss keebing so shy like a mouse;

          THE MOTHER-LOOK

          
             As one whom his mother comforteth.
            --Isaiah.
          



          
            You take the finest woman, with th' roses in her cheeks,
            An' all th' birds a-singin' in her voice each time she speaks;
            Her hair all black an' gleamin', or a glowin' mass o gold-- 
            An' still th' tale o' beauty isn't more th'n half-way told.
             There ain't a word that tells it; all description it defies--
             Th' mother-look that lingers in a happy woman's eyes. 
          
          
            A woman's eyes will sparkle in her innocence an' fun,
            Or snap a warnin' message to th' ones she wants to shun.
            In pleasure or in anger there is always han'someness,
            But still there is a beauty that was surely made to bless-- 
            A beauty that grows sweeter an' that all but glorifies--
            Th' mother-look that sometimes comes into a woman's eyes.
          
          
            It ain't a smile, exactly--yet it's brimmin' full o' joy,
            An' meltin' into sunshine when she bends above her boy,
            
             Or girl, when it's a-sleepin', with its dreams told in its face;
            She smooths its hair, an' pets it as she lif's it to its place.
            It leads all th' expressions, whether grave, or gay, or wise--
            Th' mother-look that glimmers in a lovin' woman's eyes. 
          
          
            There ain't a picture of it! If there was, they'd have to paint
            A picture of a woman mostly angel an' some saint,
             An' make it still be human--an' they'd have to blend the whole. 
            There ain't a picture of it, for no one can paint a soul! 
            No one can paint th' glory comin' straight from paradise--
            Th' mother-look that lingers in a happy woman's eyes.
          
        

        
        
          THE EMPTY CHAIRS
          
            I tell her it is foolish--but each Thanksgiving Day
            She's bound to have the table set in the old-time way,
             The little cup and saucer that Henry always had-- 
             That handle has been broken since he was just a tad--
             The plate we got for Mollie--the brim is A, B, C's--
             I tell ma it is foolish, but her eyes, they look "Please!"
            And then somehow or other I've got no more to say
             When she gets out the dishes for our Thanksgiving Day.
          
          
             She gets the little high chair--I've vowed 'most every year
             I'd sell it to somebody, but still it's always here--
            The baby used to use it; the baby--that was Rose-- 
            It's always for her children our fattest turkey goes.
            We send one to the others; it isn't much to give,
            But it's a home touch for them away off where they live.
            But I tell ma it's foolish, with us both old and gray,
            To set the children's places on each Thanksgiving Day.
          
          
            I ask a blessing always; there's lots I'd like to ask, 
            But with those empty places the blessing is a task. 
            I tell ma not to do it--I'm thinking all the while
            How Henry used to argue that handle was in style;
            
             And ma says she remembers the way that it was broke.
             Both of us laugh about it, but I 'most always choke.
            I tell her that it's foolish to set the things that way--
            And think we've got the children back home Thanksgiving Day.
          
          
            We never eat that dinner. We don't get half-way through 
            Till ma is in some story of how they used to do; 
             Of how they used to chatter, and beg for this and that--
            And all the time a-looking at each place where they sat.
            And then--and then--she's trying to hide a sudden tear
             And saying she is thankful that one time they was here. 
             But still I say it's foolish to have things fixed this way--
            To set the children's places on each Thanksgiving Day.
          
        
        
        
           HIS FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL 
          
            She lost her little boy to-day;
             Her eyes were moist and sweet
            And tender, when he went away
             To hurry down the street.
            She stood there for the longest while
            And watched and watched him; then
            She said--and tried to force a smile--
            "He'll not come back again."
          
          
            Inside the house, her tears would come.
            She sank into a chair
            And sobbed above the battered drum
             And trumpet lying there.
             The sunshine stole into the place-- 
            It only made her sad
            With thinking of the pretty grace
             His baby tresses had.
          
          
            She minded all his little ways;
             She went to see his crib
             Up in the attic; then to gaze
             At platter, spoon, and bib,
            
            And all the trinkets he had thought 
            So fair to look upon--
            Each one of them this murmur brought:
             "My little boy has gone."
          
          
            She wandered through the house all day,
            To come on things he'd left,
            And Oh, she missed his romping play
             And felt herself bereft!
            When he came home, with shining eyes,
             To tell of school's delight, 
            She kissed and held him mother-wise
            With something of affright. 
          
          
            This is the pain in mothers' hearts
            When school-days have begun; 
             Each knows the little boy departs 
            And baby-days are done;
            Each mother fain would close her ears 
             And hush the calling bell 
            For, somehow, in its tone she hears 
            The sounding of a knell.
          
        
        
        
          HER CHRISTMAS PRAYER
          
            Mary Mother, be good to him;
             Be kind to him that day--
            'Twill be the only Christmas time
            That he has been away!
          
          
            I promised him a world of toys
            If he would only stay--
            Sure, Heaven's full of little boys
             That sing and laugh and play.
            But you would know the smile of him 
            Among a thousand more; 
            His smile will make all else seem dim
             When you call him "Asthore."
          
          
            Sure, you will know him by his eyes,
             That are so sweet and blue,
             And deep and clear and very wise--
             They read the heart of you.
             His hair is golden as the sun; 
            His curls they are so quaint
             They mind you of the halo on
             An angel or a saint.
          
          
          
             I promised him a splendid tree,
             With candles all aglow.
             O Mary Mother, you can see
            'Twas me that loved him so.
             And surely, surely, you will see
             My boy, so sweet and slim--
            His eyes are hungering for me 
            As my eyes are for him.
          
          
            Mary Mother, be good to him; 
            Be kind to him that day.
             'Twill be the only Christmas time 
            That he has been away.

            The common kind o' flowers! Lord, you make a lot o' them! 
            The daisy in the medder is as clean as any gem;
            The wild rose in the thicket is the ripest kind o' red--
            It's purty, and it's happy--look at how it holds its head!
          
          
            Them little dutchman's-breeches is a favorite o' mine;
            I like to stumble on 'em with my eyes, an' catch their shine;
             An', then, the johnny-jump-ups, noddin' soft when I go by,
            An' as blue an' glad an' helpful as the ca'm midsummer sky.
          
          
            The blazin' dogwood blossoms! How they flash along the road-- 
            Come a-bloomin' in a minute, till a feller thinks it's snowed! 
            
             Lord, the haw-tree holds a sermon that is sent direct from you;
            An' the bendin' cherry branches, an' the elder bushes, too.
          
          
            There's the perky dandelion bobbin' up so fresh an' bold,
             Till the whole endurin' hillside has its polky-dots of gold;
             An' the blossomin' May-apple, hidin' underneath the trees,
             Sends a tinglin' sort o' flavor till it coaxes out the bees.
          
          
             The common kind o' flowers! Lord, I guess they like to grow 
            An' to fill the air with gladness just because you love them so.
             Lord, I try to understand them an' my heart beats in accord 
             When I bend an' whisper to 'em: "For this blessing, thank the Lord!"
          
        

        
        
          DREAMIN' WHILE THE BAND PLAYS 
          
            Oh, when the old home band turns out, and plays its ripplin' airs,
             I'd rather listen to the tunes than be 'most anywheres; 
            I'd rather let my fancy go, and drift into a daze
             A-listenin' to that old band, and dreamin' while it plays!
             When they bring out some ringin' march that's full o' fire and vim,
             Where the bass drum keeps a-throbbin' in a cadence gruff an' grim,
            An' the trombone 's just a-roarin' till the tuba's drownded out,
            I dream that I'm a soldier, an' I hear the battle shout!
          
          
            Dreamin' while the band plays! If they try a serenade,
             Or a liltin' sort o' love song, where the music seems afraid
             To come right out an' sing its piece, but sort o' hangs its head
             An' whispers low an' mellow till you can't tell what it said;
            
             When the cornet player twists his horn an' puts the tremolo
             On every note he draws out long, an' makes it sob--you know,
            I get to dreamin' of a girl an' holdin' of her hand, 
            An' kind of actin' foolish--but I blame it on the band!
          
          
             Dreamin' while the band plays! When the program's nearly done,
            An' the leader holds his pointer up an' says, "Play number one," 
            Then they play a piece that's purtier than any song or pome,
             For they're tuggin' at your heart-strings when they bring out Home,
                Sweet Home. 
            An' the bass drum sort o' rumbles, an' the tenor drum replies
             With a tender little tappin' like the rain-drops from the skies,
            An' all the other players puts a tear in every note--
            I wake up from my dreaming' an' I have to clear my throat!
          
        
        
        
          "CROOKED JAKE"
          
            Used to call him "Crooked Jake"
             When he come here first.
            My! You'd think his back 'u'd break--
            He was bent the worst!
            Legs was crooked; arms was, too; 
            Mouth was in a twist
            Like a grin stuck on 'ith glue;
            Hand tied in a fist. 
            Laws! Us fellers 'u'd tantalize 
            "Crooked Jake" an' his solemn eyes.
          
          
             Solemn eyes? Say, that was queer.
            Wa'n't no laugh in them;
            They was peaceful like, an' clear--
            Clear as any gem. 
            Us boys use' to tag along
             When he'd wabble past,
            Jokin' him. I know 'twas wrong-- 
            Found it out at last. 
            Yes, it give us a good su'prise-- 
            "Crooked Jake" an' his solemn eyes.
          
          
          
            Gen'ral Sherman one day went 
            Through here on the cars.
             "Crooked Jake," all warped and bent,
            He was there. My stars!
            Sherman, he reached for his hand,
             Give it one long shake;
            "Best man was in my command! 
            Glad to see you, Jake!" 
            All th' glory o' Paradise
            Seemed to shine in them solemn eyes. 
          
          
            Seems 'at Jake in some big fight 
            Where they took our flag
             Sailed right in 'ith all his might--
            Fetched it back--a rag! 
            Shot to pieces--been crooked since;
             Wabbles in his gait--
            Not a step but makes him wince,
             But his fame's on straight.
          
          
          
            Some of us tried to apologize,
            But Jake just looked, 'ith his solemn eyes! 
          
        

        
        
          THE ALBUM 
          
            Yes, sir, it's kind o' heavy--it's a hefty sort o' book,
             An' I get pestered often when I try to work this hook,
            Or clasp, or snap, or thingumbob 'at holds the covers shet--
             It bothered me when it was new, an' I hain't learnt it yet. 
            There, now! You'd never pick that one for me, in all th' worl',
            An' this one here is mother like she was when jest a girl.
          
          
            That's Sallie--married, le' me see, th' fall o' sixty-eight,
            A feller name o' Bemus Potts 'at sold a patent gate; 
            An' this is Amos Ransum--'course you've heard a heap o' Ame,
            He's been three times in Congress an' took on a lot o' fame. 
            Them's Mollie's twins--she knows 'em both apart by that there curl--
            An'--well, back here is mother like she was when jest a girl.
          
          
            Then here's a passel of 'em-lots o' uncles, aunts an' friends,
            But I ain't like these people that jest fools aroun' an' spends
            
            Their time a-scannin' photygrafts to see who favors who; 
            Oh, yes, I mos' forgot this one--right here there's one o you.
             But here it opens easiest--I like this one, you see, 
            This picture here o' mother--jest the girl she used to be.
          
          
             A old-time lookin' picture, with her hair fixed up that way-- 
            A waterfall, they called it--but 'twas on'y yesterday
            That I was jokin' mother--it's a way I have, you know,
             An' told her that th' wrinkles was th' laughs o' long ago,
             An' that her eyes--I 'member how they set my heart a-whirl--
             Yes, this one here is mother like she was when jest a girl.
          
        
        
        
          "TIDDLE-IDDLE-IDDLE-IDDLE-BUM! BUM!" 
          
            When our town band gets on the square
            On concert night you'll find me there.
             I'm right beside Elijah Plumb,
            Who plays th' cymbals an' bass drum; 
            An' next to him is Henry Dunn,
             Who taps the little tenor one. 
             I like to hear our town band play,
             But, best it does, I want to say,
            Is when they tell a tune's to come
            With
            "Tiddle-iddle-iddle-iddle-
             Bum-Bum!"
          
          
            O' course, there's some that likes the tunes 
            Like Lily Dale an' Ragtime Coons;
            Some likes a solo or duet 
            By Charley Green--B-flat cornet--
            An' Ernest Brown--th' trombone man. 
            (An' they can play, er no one can);
            
             But it's the best when Henry Dunn
            Lets them there sticks just cut an' run,
            An' 'Lijah says to let her hum
            With 
            "Tiddle-iddle-iddle-iddle-
            Bum-Bum!" 
          
          
            I don't know why, ner what's the use
            O' havin' that to interduce
            A tune--but I know, as fer me
            I'd ten times over ruther see 
            Elijah Plumb chaw with his chin,
            A-gettin' ready to begin,
            While Henry plays that roll o' his
             An' makes them drumsticks fairly sizz,
            Announcin' music, on th' drum, 
            With
            "Tiddle-iddle-iddle-iddle-
            Bum-Bum!" 
          
        
        
        
          SAREPTY BROWN
          
             Th' purtiest woman in this town
             Is little old Sarepty Brown.
          
          
            I know she's wrinkled, gray an' bent--
            An' some folks sez she gossips, too;
             She knows who's come an' knows who's went 
            An' what they did or didn't do--
            But, say, when ma was sick that spring 
            With typhoid fever, S'repty Brown,
            She come an' shouldered ever'thing.
            When ma got up, w'y she was down.
          
          
            An' when Mort Peters' little girl
            Got sick that time, an' like to died-- 
            (Yes, sir, Mis' Peters'd clipped a curl
            To 'member her, an' cried an' cried)--
            Sarepty Brown, she nursed all night
            An' day, an' night an' day again, 
            An' never rested, when she might 
            'A' sort o' idled now an' then.
          
          
          
            An' that's the way, where folks is sick
            Or sorrowful, or in distress,
            Sarepty Brown, through thin an' thick 
            Can find some way their lives to bless.
            An' people sez 'at when she bends
             An' holds her hand against their brow
             It seems like when a angel sends
             A healin' balm to cure, somehow.
          
          
            I ain't no preacher; got no creed;
            Ner articles o' faith; but, say,
            God knew what all us folks 'd need
             An' sent Sarepty Brown this way.
             I can't see any wrinkled face
             Or faded hair; when I see her 
            I see th' golden glow o' grace
             Right straight f'um glory, I do, sir!
          
          
            Th' purtiest woman in this town
            Is little old Sarepty Brown.
          
        
        
        
          THE OLD-TIME FIDDLER
          
            The old gray hoss is dead in the wilderness,
            Dead in the wilderness,
            Dead in the wilderness;
            The old gray hoss is dead in the wilderness,
            Down in Alabam'.
          
          
            He used to take his fiddle with a loving sort of touch,
             And hold it with caresses where some other folks would clutch; 
            He pressed it to his shoulder and it nestled at his chin;
            He stroked the strings with tenderness before he would begin.
            "The Old Gray Hoss!" He'd pat his foot and bend and sway and bow 
            The while you wound the figures of the dances to and fro.
          
          
            "The Monkey Chased the Weasel," "Captain Jinks," and "Money Musk," 
            And "White Gal Up the Mountain"--how they echoed through the dusk!
            He knew no pizzicato grace--he only "picked the strings"--
            But even yet the melody in soft remembrance sings.
            
             We see his jolly smile again, and shaking, frosty head
            When he would romp the measures of "The Old Gray Hoss is Dead."
          
          
            Sometimes--you mind how he would sit, and look away-- away--
            And sweep the bow across the strings and let the music stray
             Until it held the gladness of a dreamy afternoon--
            The vagrant chirpings of the birds, and bees' idyllic croon; 
            The murmurs of the little brook that plashed its way along 
            And never kissed a pebble without breaking into song!
          
          
            >The gray-haired fiddler! Ignorant of rules or pose or art--
             And yet his was the magic that could reach around your heart;
            His was the mystic mastery of touch and time and tone
            That made you hear the fairy horns at evening gaily blown. 
            And Oh, the swooping swing of his; and how the music swam
            When he would play "The Old Gray Hoss that Died in Alabam'!"
          

          
          
             
          
        

        
        
        
          "GOOD MORNIN'"
          
            He always said "Good mornin'" 
            An' emphasized the "Good,"
             As if he'd make it happy
            For each one if he could. 
            "Good mornin'!" just "Good mornin'" 
            To every one he met;
             He said it with a twinkle 
            Nobody could forget.
          
          
            He always said "Good mornin',"
            An' people use' to say
            That one o' his Good-mornin's
             Clung to you all the day,
             An' made you always cheerful 
            From thinkin' of the sound--
            It always was "Good mornin'"
             Long as he was around.
          
          
            He always said "Good mornin'"--
            An', glad an' happy-eyed, 
            Them were the words he whispered
            The mornin' that he died.
            Them were the words he whispered
            As cheerful as he could-- 
            An' I believe the angels 
            They emphasized the "Good."
          
        
        
        
          "SINCE I CAME OVER"
          
             "Since I came over"--
             Oft she stood
             Her red, rough hands in straining clasp
            As though in some strange way she would
             Find some rich treasure in her grasp;
            Find something tangible to clutch 
            And hold, and know it for her own-- 
            Out of the things she had loved much, 
            Out of the days that she had known.
          
          
            "Since I came over"--
             And she smiled;
             A light came to her listless eyes 
            When, like a joyous, care-free child-- 
            In whose heart naught of sorrow lies,
             She told us of the paths she knew
            And sang small fragments of a song--
            Some little strain of "eyes so blue"
             That in her mind had lingered long.
          
          
          
            "Since I came over"--
            She would tell
             Of days that were before she came;
            Of broad fields that she loved so well;
             Of roses bursting into flame;
            Of sunny day and starry night--
            Then, as a song in silence dies, 
            The gleaming of the happy light
            Went swiftly from her wistful eyes.
          
          
             Since she "came over"--
            Ah, and you 
            And I, and all of us have known
            The heartache in the farewell view 
            Of some land that we called our own. 
            We know how many isles there be 
            Of which for aye we are bereft.
            Across the sea of memory
            What happy lands we all have left!
          
        
        
        
          A CRY FROM THE CONSUMER
          
            Grasshoppers roam the Kansas fields and eat the tender grass--
             A trivial affair, indeed, but what then comes to pass?
            You go to buy a panama, or any other hat;
            You learn the price has been advanced a lot because of that.
            A glacier up in Canada has slipped a mile or two--
            A little thing like this can boost the selling price of glue. 
            Occurrences so tragic always thrill me to the core; 
            I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more.
          
          
            Last week the peaceful Indians went a-searching after scalps, 
            And then there was an avalanche 'way over in the Alps;
            These diametric happenings seem nothing much, but look--
            We had to add a dollar to the wages of the cook.
            The bean-crop down at Boston has grown measurably less,
             And so the dealer charges more for goods to make a dress.
            Each day there is some incident to make a man feel sore,
            I'm on my knees to ask that nothing happens any more. 
          
          
          
            It didn't rain in Utah and it did in old Vermont--
             Result: it costs you fifty more to take a summer's jaunt;
             Upon the plains of Tibet some tornadoes took a roll-- 
            Therefore the barons have to charge a higher price for coal.
             A street-car strike in Omaha has cumulative shocks--
            It boosted huckleberries up to twenty cents a box.
            No matter what is happening it always finds your door--
             Give us a rest! Let nothing ever happen any more.
          
          
            Mosquitoes in New Jersey bite a magnate on the wing--
             Result: the poor consumer feels that fierce mosquito's sting:
            The 'skeeter's song is silenced, but in something like an hour
            The grocers understand that it requires a raise in flour.
             A house burns down in Texas and a stove blows up in Maine,
             Ten minutes later breakfast foods in prices show a gain.
             Effects must follow causes--which is what I most deplore;
            I hope and pray that nothing ever happens any more.
          
        
        
        
          AN ODYSSEY OF K'S
          
            I've traveled up and down this land
             And crossed it in a hundred ways,
             But somehow can not understand 
            These towns with names chock-full of K's.
             For instance, once it fell to me
             To pack my grip and quickly go--
             I thought at first to Kankakee 
            But then remembered Kokomo.
            "Oh, Kankakee or Kokomo," 
            I sighed, "just which I do not know." 
          
          
            Then to the ticket man I went--
             He was a snappy man, and bald,
             Behind an iron railing pent--
             And I confessed that I was stalled.
             "A much K'd town is booked for me,"
            I said. "I'm due to-morrow, so 
            I wonder if it's Kankakee
            Or if it can be Kokomo." 
            "There's quite a difference," growled he,
            "'Twixt Kokomo and Kankakee."
          
          
          
            He spun a yard of tickets out--
            The folded kind that makes a strip
             And leaves the passenger in doubt
             When the conductor takes a clip.
             He flipped the tickets out, I say,
            And asked: "Now, which one shall it be?
            I'll sell you tickets either way-- 
            To Kokomo or Kankakee."
             And still I really did not know--
            I thought it might be Kokomo.
          
          
            At any rate, I took a chance;
            He struck his stamp-machine a blow
             And I, a toy of circumstance, 
            Was ticketed for Kokomo. 
            Upon the train I wondered still
            If all was right as it should be.
            Some mystic warning seemed to fill
             My mind with thoughts of Kankakee. 
            The car-wheels clicked it out: "Now, he 
            Had better be for Kankakee!"
          
          
            Until at last it grew so loud,
            At some big town I clambered out
             And elbowed madly through the crowd,
             Determined on the other route.
            
             The ticket-agent saw my haste; 
            "Where do you wish to go?" cried he.
            I yelled: "I have no time to waste--
             Please fix me up for Kankakee!"
            Again the wheels, now fast, now slow,
             Clicked: "Ought to go to Kokomo!"
          
          
            Well, anyhow, I did not heed
            The message that they sent to me.
             I went, and landed wrong indeed--
            Went all the way to Kankakee.
            Then, in a rush, I doubled back-- 
            Went wrong again, I'd have you know.
             There was no call for me, alack!
            Within the town of Kokomo.
          
          
            And then I learned, confound the luck,
            I should have gone to Keokuk!
          
        
        
        
          "WHERE A ROSE IS AT"
          
            Deep in the slums, one hot, hot day
             A little girl was at her play--
             A little girl with tousled hair
             And grimy hands, and feet all bare. 
            There, in the baking, barren street, 
            She sang--and oh, her voice was sweet,
            To one who, halting where she sat,
             Heard: "I know where a rose is at!"
          
          
            She pointed down an alley dim 
            Where slattern women, coarse and grim,
            Were bandying strange laugh and call-- 
            And there, close to the blackened wall,
             A brave, brave rose was clambering. 
            What wonder that the tot could sing--
            That she in accents shrill and flat
            Sang: "I know where a rose is at!"
          
          
            The stranger caught the rare perfume
             That floated from the ruddy bloom--
             The one lone blossom with its cheer--
             And sighed: "There are two roses here.
            
            Each plays its good, unconscious part,
            And one rich rose is in your heart."
            The child, not understanding that,
             Crooned: "I know where a rose is at."
          
          
            'Tis so. We may be walled about
             With fretting fear and clinging doubt,
             But somewhere in the wreck and ruck 
            A rose of hope, with sturdy pluck,
            Is climbing, climbing through the night
             To show us which way comes the light.
            There may be gloom--but what of that 
            If we "know where a rose is at"? 
          
        
        
        
          MAIN STREET 
          
            It's none of your crowded city streets,
            Where the rush and bustle are,
            And the wave of constant movement beats 
            Through the dust and smoke afar.
            It saunters in with a peaceful air 
            And it slowly passes through--
            This cheerful, hurryless thoroughfare
             With its seeming "Howdy-do."
          
          
            It stops where the roses blandly nod 
            Through the quaint old garden gate, 
            Then goes with a placid, patient plod
            Where the sidewalks hold it straight. 
            It halts again at the public square
            For an unbegrudging rest
             And a friendly chat with the corners there,
             For each cross-street is a guest. 
          
          
            Then lazily to the blacksmith shop, 
            Where it has to pause once more
            To see the blazing cinders drop 
            From the forge just by the door.
            
            From there to the bridge across the brook,
             To hear what the ripples say;
            Then on to the walnut-shaded nook
            Where the sages sit all day.
          
          
             Main Street goes on with a calm content 
            To the summit of the hill,
             Then yields to the soothing blandishment
             Of the country-side, all still.
            It rambles out where the meadows spread 
            And the soft green grasses creep,
            And there, on a blossom-spangled bed,
            Main Street has gone to sleep.
          
        
        
        
          SHO'LY! SHO'LY!

          A SONG FOR FLAG DAY 
          
            Your flag and my flag,
            And how it flies to-day
             In your land and my land 
            And half a world away!
            Rose-red and blood-red
             The stripes for ever gleam;
            Snow-white and soul-white--
             The good forefathers' dream;
            Sky-blue and true blue, with stars to gleam aright-- 
            The gloried guidon of the day; a shelter through the night.
          
          
            Your flag and my flag!
             And, oh, how much it holds--
            Your land and my land-- 
            Secure within its folds! 
            Your heart and my heart
            Beat quicker at the sight;
            Sun-kissed and wind-tossed--
            Red and blue and white. 
            The one flag--the great flag--the flag for me and you--
            Glorified all else beside--the red and white and blue!
          
          
          
            Your flag and my flag!
             To every star and stripe
             The drums beat as hearts beat 
             And fifers shrilly pipe! 
            Your flag and my flag--
             A blessing in the sky;
             Your hope and my hope--
             It never hid a lie! 
            Home land and far land and half the world around,
            Old Glory hears our glad salute and ripples to the sound!
          
        
        
        
          THE CALL OF THE DRUM
          
            All faint and far-away I hear 
            The calling of the drum.
            Its rhythmic thrumming, drawing near,
             Is ever pleading: "Come!"
            The colors are waving--
            My heart throbs with craving--
            As nearer
             And clearer,
            And louder 
            And prouder,
             Its melody grows as the sound comes and goes: 
            "Come! Come!"
             Is the call of the drum.
          
          
            Now brave and grand, and near at hand, 
            I hear the calling drum.
            The flag, by gallant breezes fanned,
            Is beckoning: "Oh, come!
            We'll rush to the clamor 
            Of strife, with its glamour!"
            
            And swelling,
            And telling 
            The story
             Of glory, 
            The drum sings in glee as it passes by me.
            "Come! Come!"
            Is the call of the drum.
          
          
            Still faint and far-away I hear 
            The ever-calling drum;
            Now singing low, now ringing clear
            Is its insistent "Come!"
             With tones sweet and hollow 
            It lures me to follow.
             Far away,
             Through the day
            It calls me-- 
            Enthralls me--
            The lilt of its beating my heart is repeating.
            "Come! Come!" 
            Is the call of the drum. 
          
        
        
        
          BEYOND THE HILLS
          
            "I can hear the drums as the army comes
            From beyond the hills," he said,
            And he leaned and smiled like a happy child
             As he shook his snowy head.
            And he clutched his cane while the far refrain
            Came in murmurs to his ears;
             But they whispered low: "He has dreamed it so,
             And it is no drum he hears."
          
          
            "I can hear the fife as it leaps with life,
            And the drums roll madly, too,"
            Was the old man's sigh, as with kindling eye
            He would hum the war-songs through. 
            "It is Jimmy Shea--that is how he'd play
             When the road was hard and long;
            And it's Billy's drum that is calling, 'Come!'
            As it keeps time with the song."
          
          
            And his fingers slim beat a tattoo grim 
            On the stout arm of the chair,
            While his lips grew stern and his eyes would burn 
            With the fire that once was there.
            
             "Oh, the bugle-call, and the drums and all!"
             He would say. "Their music fills
            All the night and day; I can hear them play 
            In the march beyond the hills.
          
          
            "I can hear the drums, and the army comes 
            From beyond the hills," he said.
            With his eyes aglow he saluted slow
            As he touched his snowy head.
            Then his eyes were closed as if he but dozed,
            And his day of days had dawned, 
            For the low drum-beat had lured his feet
            To the hills--and far beyond.
          
        
        
        
          THE WOUNDED FLAGS
          
            The wounded flags! They bear them
             Aloft to-day in pride--
            The living ones, who share them 
            Alike with those who died.
            The flags that faintly flutter 
            In cadence with the drum,
            As though they sought to utter
             Their joy that peace has come.
          
          
            The wounded flags! We hold them
            Far dearer than the rest;
             Close to our hearts we fold them--
             These flags by tatters blest;
            The flags with shot-holes gaping
             That tell their tales of strife--
             To-day they're gently draping 
            The ones who cling to life.
          
          
            The wounded flags! We hail them
            And revel in each hue.
            Though age and time may pale them 
            And red blend into blue-- 
            Though all grow dark and duller,
            Yet still in every part
            We see the living color 
            That thrills the nation's heart.
          
        
        
        
          A STREET INCIDENT
          
             He came with lagging step along the busy, crowded way;
            His eyes were wan and weary, and his hair was thin and gray;
             His shoulders bent beneath the weight of years of patient toil;
            An armless sleeve and badge of bronze told of war's grim turmoil.
            He came with lagging steps until he heard a lively thrum--
            The rattle of a war-tune from a busy fife and drum.
          
          
            He stopped to watch the players as they marched along the street--
            The shrilling of the fife was coaxing out the drum's swift beat.
            
              The Girl I Left Behind Me was the swinging song they played,
            And as he stood and listened, from his eyes went all the shade;
             His shoulders straightened quickly; his head rose firm and proud,
            And he looked far and far away beyond the heedless crowd.
          
          
          
             He turned and went his way again with steady, sturdy stride--
             In tune and time to that old song his soldier-feet replied;
            His hand swung gallantly, as though it rested on a sword--
             Ah, who can know what memories were in those drum-beats stored!
             What vibrant echoes of the past came rushing to his brain
             When he walked "with the boys" again to that old war-refrain!
          
        
        
        
          THE MAKING OF AN ARMY 
          
            Men are not born to the fighting; men are not bred to the sword;
             Only for God and their country have men to the battlefront poured.
             Not in the clanging of armor; not in the lilt of the drum,
             But in the call of their country do men hear the terrible "Come!" 
            Then rise the men of a nation, men of a purpose and will--
             Then do they rise with a light in their eyes, but not as men go to the kill.
          
          
            Men are not led with a halter, like to a reasonless beast;
            Men are not lured by a bauble to add to the carrion feast; 
            Only when home and their country speak in the thunder of God
             Men walk, with faces illumined, the paths that their fathers have trod.
            Then, in the shrill of the bullet; then, in the war-trumpet's song,
            In the pipe of the fife leap the soldiers to life--ready and gallant and strong.
          
          
          
            Let but an enemy's cannon threaten the strength of our walls;
            Let but the hand of a traitor scatter disgrace in our halls--
            Then will the clamor of bugles over the nation be dinned,
            Then will the banners of battle snap in the hiss of the wind,
            Then will the hearth be deserted, then will the marts all grow bare--
            For the call will have pealed through the town and the field, and the men that are
              wanted are there!
          
          
            Men are not born to the fighting! Tell it again and again. 
            Men who go down to the killing--pawns they may be, but not men.
            Only when God and the country sound us the long rally roll,
            Thrill us with drummings of conscience-comes then the blazing of soul! 
            Comes then the knowledge of duty; come all the purposes high-- 
            Then come the men from the hill and the glen to put on their armor and die!
          
        
        
        
           THE OLD BUGLE
          
            There on the wall it hangs, with dented curves and battered mouth,
            As though it fought the song of war it shrilled across the South, 
            As though the blasts of wrath it blew had clutched it in a grasp
            That left the lasting finger-prints ere it released the clasp. 
            There, on the wall, it hangs to-day--a token of Time's lapse--
            For now it knows no other song than that sweet one of "Taps." 
          
          
            The bent and battered bugle that has sent its thrilling call
             Until a thousand men have hurled themselves against a wall--
             Against a wall of bayonets--of bayonets and flame-- 
            And leaped into the charge as if the bugle called each name!
             There, on the wall, it hangs to-day between the soldier caps,
            And in its rusting throat there is no other song than "Taps."
          
          
          
            Once, sharp and shrill, it burnt and blared from mouth-piece out to bell
             With strident sound and stinging strains, the startling song of hell!
            Oft, ringing rampantly, it sang in tone and voice elate
            In clearest, keenest melody, the rhapsody of hate.
            Yet now it hangs there peacefully, and sings but when the gaps 
            In thinning ranks call for the sad and sweet old song of "Taps." 
          
          
            And when they take the bugle down to play above the mound,
             No soldier heart but quicker beats when comes the well-known sound;
            No soldier mind but travels once again the distant ways
            That loom anew in memory, though dimming in the haze.
             There, on the wall, it hangs to-day--a token of Time's lapse--
            And now it knows no other song than that sweet one of "Taps."
          
        
        
        
          JUST A SOLDIER 
          
            Just a soldier lying dead, with a medal on his breast;
             Just a boy who kept his courage to the ending of his quest.
             And the bugle-song is mellow with the melody of sleep
            While the muffled drum is thrumming in a measure slow and deep,-- 
            For it's honor for the soldier, and it's laurels for his head,
             And it's praises for his daring--when the soldier's lying dead.
          
          
            Just a soldier lying dead--and the carpings have an end; 
            When he fell upon the altar every critic was his friend.
            With the folded flag about him, and the medal gleaming there, 
            Then the praise is quick in coming, and the soldier has his share-- 
            For it's honor for the soldier when he dies beside his gun,
             And it's medals for his coffin--when the soldier's work is done.
          
          
          
            Just a soldier lying dead--with his trappings at his side;
            And we come to look upon him, slow of step and heavy-eyed;
            Come to clasp the badge of honor on his faded service coat;
            Come to hear the bugle sighing in its saddest, softest note;
            And it's honor for the soldier, with a medal brightly new, 
            And it's eulogy and plaudit, when he's done what he can do.
          
          
            Just a soldier lying dead--honor rushes to him then; 
            Come the men with brush and chisel; come the pencil and the pen.
            Yet the comrades of the soldier hold the country in their debt--
            While they live, the praise and medal are so easy to forget.
            Where the flag of glory ripples in the whisper of the breeze,
            Where the clamoring of battle sends an echo o'er the seas,
             We may find the living reasons for a country's hope and pride
            Just as we have found the medal for the soldier who has died. 
          
        
        
        
          HIS LAST MARCH
          
             "Bring the good old bugle, boys, we'll sing another song!"
            He heard the far-off chorus as his comrades marched along;
            He heard the clank of saber, and the jangling bit and spur,
             The rumbling of the cannon where his shouting messmates were;
             He heard the hurried hoofbeats of the horses mettlesome; 
            And high above he saw the flag that beckoned him: "Oh, come!"
          
          
            He saw them swing along the road--not graybeards slow and bent.
            Ah, no! He saw the boyish ranks of his old regiment.
             With rhythmic tread it held its line, with fifers piping shrill;
             He saw the ragged colors, that were waving to him still; 
            And calling--calling--calling, came the rolling of the drum: 
            "Fall in! Fall in for dress parade! The ranks are waiting. Come!" 
          
          
          
            The line wheeled when it neared him, and as in the light of noon 
            He saw the forms of comrades who across the South were strewn;
             He saw the brave companion who had battled by his side--
            The tears welled up again just as they did the day he died.
            Then, "Halt!" the bugles sounded, and he heard his war-time chief
            Call in his kindest, clearest tones: "This is the last relief!"
          
          
            "March on!" The flag was waving and the soldiers marched away; 
            And he went singing with them, far beyond the Gates of Day,
            The bugles pealing gladly and the line with no more gaps--
             The bugles singing sweetly in that benison of "Taps".
             And fifes were mad and merry, and the drums were laughing too,
             For he marched beside the colors as he led the grand review!
          
        
        
        
          THE PRAYER OF THE KING
          
             And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord.
            --Book of Kings.
          

          
            Lord, let me lay the tinsel down--
            The senseless scepter and the crown
             That I must bear;
             The ermined robe of purple hue,
            The gauds and rings and jewels, too,
             That I must wear.
          
          
            Let me but cast them in a heap--
             All these; each is but poor and cheap--
            An idle thing.
             The robe, the scepter, crown and all 
            But form a covering and pall 
            To hide a king.
          
          
            I know the people bend the knees
            And bare their heads. It is to these-- 
            To this--this stuff; 
            To ermine, velvet and to gold,
             To jewels glittering and cold,-- 
            'Tis not enough.
          
          
          
            'Tis not enough that they should deem
             The crown and trappings, with their gleam,
            A royal thing.
             Lord, were these piled upon the throne
             The cry would be for them alone: 
            "This is the king!"
          
          
             Lord, let me lay the tinsel down--
             Be more than a mere gilded clown,
             Or jeweled sham. 
            Let me aside these baubles throw
             That me they all may see and know
             For what I am.
          
          
             Let them but see my mind and soul
            For ever striving to the goal!
             But let me fling 
            Away the purpled pomp, the throne,
             And hear them hailing me, alone: 
            "Behold, the king!"
          
        
        
        
          THE DAY OF A THOUSAND YEARS
          
            For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a
              watch in the night.
            --The Psalms.
          

          
             And one star calls to another
             The rich strains of a song
            Till the deeps of space glow with its grace
             And echo it full strong;
             And whirling out of the silence
            A world of worlds appears
             In an onward rush through the endless hush--
            And a day is a thousand years.
          
          
            And one star sings to another,
             And sun holds speech with sun,
            While the drifting veil of a vapor pale
            Shows another world begun.
            But we count time by a dawning
            Or mark by a twilight fall-- 
            Yet the stars sing on when the years are gone,
             And what are we, after all?
          
          
            The words and the hopes and doubtings, 
            The joy and the dreams and dread, 
            And the puny lives in the puny hives 
            Where toil is done for bread;
            
             A day, a night, and another--
            A round of the spinning ball; 
            A sigh and a smile for the briefest while--
             And what are we, after all?
          
          
            And one star calls to another 
            A song we may not know;
            Calls a distant sun to a dying sun 
            As the ages come and go.
            And we mark time by a minute,
            And croon over smiles and tears-- 
            But the stars sing on when the worlds are gone, 
            And a day is a thousand years.
          
        
        
        
          THE LOOM OF TIME
          
             My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle.
            --Job.
          
          
            Swift as a weaver's shuttle 
            Truly and quickly cast,
             Every day is woven
             Into the silent past;
            Into the wondrous fabric 
            Go all the love and hate--
            All in a fadeless pattern,
             Lasting and intricate.
          
          
            Here there are strands of beauty--
            Kindness has lent its gold;
             There we see barren places,
            Sullen and dull and cold.
            All of our clouds and sunshine,
            All of our joy and pain, 
            Leap from the flying shuttle,
             Full to the waiting chain.
          
          
            Thus do the days go from us, 
            Thus does the weaver bind 
            Into a blended picture
            All that we leave behind;
            
            Ready with flying shuttle,
            Lever and loom and thread,
            For all the coming actions-- 
            For all the days ahead.
          
          
            So may we look behind us
            Through all the web of days,
            Seeing our good and evil
             Blent in its endless maze.
            Purple and gold and crimson
            Vie with the sodden black--
             Whether of pride or sorrow,
            We may not have it back.
          
          
            Swift as a weaver's shuttle
             Day hastens on to day--
            Always the fabric changes,
            Always the colors play;
            Now with a gloomy shadow,
            Now with a glow sublime--
            So go the deathless records
            Into the loom of Time.
          
        
        
        
           THE LOG OF LIFE 
          
            They that go down to the sea in ships.
            --The Psalms.
          
          
            Now you set sail and I set sail upon the sea of life,
             And times there are when comes a gale that cuts us like a knife--
            When comes a blast that shudders past and shrivels up our souls-- 
            It blows from off the barren rocks where sorrow spreads her shoals,
            Where bitterly the billows break and chatter of defeat;
            Long after we have struggled by, their echoes hoarsely beat.
          
          
             Some of us sail but where the sea in silver spray is curled; 
            Some of us beat beyond the rim that bounds the rounding world;
            Some of us ride upon the tide that in the moonlight gleams
            And sighs of peace and happiness within the port of dreams;
            And some go blindly up and down across the silent sea
             To find the vanished harbor in the land of used-to-be.
          
          
          
            But everywhere and anywhere our ships may moor or sail 
            There is a call for one and all--a wholesome, friendly hail.
            It may be in the port of dreams, or off of sorrow's shoals,
            Or when in mid-sea's placidness the vessel calmly rolls;
            Wherever, on or off our course, we will but pause to hear,
             There comes to us a hail that rings with fellowship and cheer.
          
          
            So you go down and I go down into the sea of life,
            To feel the bite of angry winds along the reefs of strife, 
            To hear the strains of dim refrains from off some singing coast--
             But through it all the friendly call is what we count the most.
             The sea of life is long and wide, but we sail to the end--
             Through shine and fog we write the log: "This day we hailed a friend."
          
        
        
        
          NIGHT
          
            As a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night.
            --Jeremiah.
          
          
            When you have walked the weary way--
            The weary way that leads by noon
             And takes you to the end of day,
            You know there waits for you a boon;
             You know that on ahead is rest, 
            For roses drip with twilight dew
            And all things seem but for the best
            When Night holds out her arms to you.
          
          
            When Night holds out her arms to you,
            You know your cares have found release; 
            That what stern battling you must do
            Is for the time bid pause by peace; 
            For down the slopes the shadows drift 
            And singing breezes falter through
             The silence where the hills uplift-- 
            And Night holds out her arms to you.
          
          
            When Night holds out her arms, it seems
            As though she brought each one a crown--
            A crown of happiness and dreams.
            She comes to countryside and town 
            
            With poppies in her dusky hands
            And poppies on her garments, too; 
            All gracefully she comes and stands
            And holds her soothing arms to you.
          
          
            Just so when you are through with strife,
             And, all world-weary on your way, 
            You reach the ending of this life--
            For life is but a little day--
             There will be naught to make you sad,
            But all will be fair to your view,
            You will be comforted and glad
             When Night holds out her arms to you.
          
        
        
        
          "TO THE HILLS"
          
            I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.
            --The Psalms.
          
          
            "I to the hills will lift mine eyes"--I've heard 'em sing the psalm,
            An' thought of how, close to the skies, the hills rose grand an' calm;
             How peacefully they raised their heads an' stood serene an' still,
             A-blazin' with their greens an' reds--each hope-inspirin' hill.
            I like the sober hush they've got--it's just as if they meant 
            To send to me this gentle thought: "Oh, poor man, be content!"
          
          
            The hills! God made 'em every one, an' freshens 'em with dew, 
            An' makes 'em golden with the sun to gladden me an' you.
             Down here there's bitterness an' strife; an' lots o' things seem vain;
            An' we make our complaints at life here on the noisy plain.
            
             But there, the hills lift up their heads, an' we can look an' see 
            Where brooks play in their gleamin' beds an' sparkle in their glee.
          
          
            I've watched the hills when just at dawn the sun swept up the slope,
            An' knew my night of doubt had gone an' left a day of hope.
             I've watched the hills at evenin' time, all silvered by the moon,
             When from their sides in tones sublime the breezes brought a croon,
            An' all the world grew good to me--an' all the world was still. 
            Oh, them's the times a man can see the glory of a hill!
          
          
            I reckon David must 'a' been a man like me or you,
            That had his own sore fights to win, just as all humans do;
            An' he looked to them hills of his that breathed of quiet peace--
            Just like our hills, where comfort is, an' all our troubles cease.
             "I to the hills will lift mine eyes"--I've heard 'em sing the psalm; 
            An' in each mellow note there lies a blessin' pure an' calm.
          
          
          
             
          
        
        
        
        
          LABOR
          
             What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?
            --Ecclesiastes.
          
          
            Where the sullen desert slept
            There came a king to rule; 
            Where the sluggish river crept 
            Through shallow and through pool;
            Came a spirit swift and strong
             The silences to break
             With a ceaseless, humming song: 
            "Oh, ye who sleep, awake!"
          
          
            Night was day--an endless dawn-- 
            All at this king's command;
             Still his work swept on and on 
            And into every land;
             Deserts blossomed as the rose
             And wondrous cities grew.
            But this king unresting goes
             In search of deeds to do.
          
          
            Bare of arm and brown of hand 
            And clear and keen of eye,
             Knowing that beneath the sand
             Uncounted countries lie; 
            
             Knowing that the drowsing plain
             He may awake at length
            To the life of golden grain,
             He chants his song of strength.
          
          
            At the thrilling of his call
            The forest and the field,
            City street and city wall 
            A chiming echo yield. 
            Of it all, what is his gain? 
            What profit has he won? 
            This: he has beneath his reign
            The Kingdom of Things Done.
          
        
        
        
           THE GOD OF THE UNAFRAID 
          
            Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
            --The Psalms.
          
          
            Now there are new religions. Many the codes and creeds;
             Many the quibbling changes to fit with our fancied needs;
             All of them waxing milder, waning in strength and tone;
            None of them stern and sturdy; none of them stands alone--
            None like the old religions, those that the fathers made-- 
            Built on the fearless basis--the God of the Unafraid.
          
          
            Mind you the old-time people? Questioning naught and stern;
            Knowing the lifelong lesson ere they were set to learn;
            Seeing the line was rigid, marking for ill or good--
             Holding to step beyond it led where the sinners stood.
            Mind you the old-time people? They who the law obeyed,
            Fearing and finding and praying the God of the Unafraid.
          
          
            Life was a constant battle into which they were flung; 
            Thoughts were of old time sinful ere they were given tongue.
            Aye, if a hand offended, straightway it must be cut,
            Else would the gates of Heaven be to them ever shut. 
            
             That was an old-time picture, yet it will never fade--
            Thus did the people worship the God of the Unafraid.
          
          
             Now there are new religions, fragile and flimsy things; 
            Soothing and soft and subtile in all of their fashionings. 
            Mind you ty old-time people? Never their fears could cease,
            But they were not as we are--theirs were the hearts at peace;
            Theirs were the souls complacent, knowing and undismayed;
            Theirs was the living master--the God of the Unafraid.
          
        
        
        
          BE A MAN
          
            Quit you like men; be strong.
            --Corinthians.
          
          
            If you walk your way with a fearless tread,
             You will find some shade on the weary road; 
            If you go your way, neither forced nor led,
            You may taste grim toil, but will feel no goad, 
            And will gather strength as you bear your load.
          
          
            If the cup is filled, it is yours to drink,
            Though the brim be touched by a bitter draft; 
            There are gibes for you if you seem to shrink, 
            And the taunting jest and the biting shaft 
            Are the meed of him with a cup unquaffed.
          
          
            And the word is this: that the man who whines 
            Or complains aloud of the cold or heat,
             Or the labor, falls in the hardest lines, 
            For he drowns the sound of the music sweet
             That is meant to time all the trudging feet.
          
          
            But the one who knows where the bitter is
             Will one day come to the cup again
             And find rare wine in that draft of his--
            That draft of his, which was bitter then--
             For he is of those who are quit like men.
          
          
          
            And the greatest deed that a man might do-- 
            Though he work with cunning thought and plan; 
            Though his acts be known all the ages through;
            Though he walk behind; though he lead the van-- 
            It is this, that he make himself a Man.
          
          
            If you quit yourself as a man is quit, 
            There will be no one who will wisely nod
             Or will wag the tongue with a waspish wit--
             But with head erect you may walk abroad 
            In the face of mankind and your God.
          
        
        
        
          THE CLUTCH OF CHANCE
          
            The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. . . . But time and chance
              happeneth to them all.
            --Ecclesiastes.
          
          
            For the man who wins, there is pomp and pride,
             And the laurel wreath, and the cheer, beside;
             And for him who fights, but in fighting falls 
            There are echoes still of the trumpet calls--
            But there is no balm in his bitter lot 
            If he meets defeat with his fight unfought.
          
          
            There are sore defeats that are all unknown,
            And they send their gloom to the proudest throne;
             And they plunge their shade on the humblest life--
            For they bring no stress and they bring no strife; 
            By a time or chance is the loser caught 
            And he knows defeat ere his fight is fought.
          
          
            There are singers mute--and their hearts are wrung
             And their souls are thrilled with the songs unsung; 
            There are men who dreamed of a picture fair-- 
            But the hand is still and the canvas bare;
            And the others, too, with their goals unsought--
            They have seen defeat with their fights unfought.
          
          
          
            If a man goes down with his sword aflash
             And has heard the lance and the armor crash--
            If he loses then, he will shed no tears;
             He has dealt his blows, he has heard the cheers;
             But his soul must shrink from he knows not what 
            When he meets defeat with his fight unfought.
          
        
        
        
          JONAH AT THE GATE
          
            And God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did
              it not. But it displeased Jonah exceedingly.
            --Jonah.
          
          
             A city filled with purple sin; 
            A mighty place of wickedness, 
            All white without and black within;
            Its virtues ever growing less. 
            The sound of dancing in the street
             And songs and curses in the hall;
             And, borne on slow, unwilling feet,
             A Jonah nears the city wall--
             A Jonah stands beside the gate 
            And chants the stern decree of fate.
          
          
            A Jonah calls the curses down, 
            There, where they listen open-eyed:
             Then hodden in his dusty gown 
            He turns and walks away with pride. 
            He climbs the low, embowered hill 
            And looks to see the city die--
            
            But God repents him of his will. 
            Then Jonah cries: "A fool was I!"
             A Jonah at the city gate,
             Full sorry at the change of late.
          
          
            To-day, how many men but look 
            At all the bad their brother does,
             And shout he shall be brought to book-- 
            If ever seeming sinner was!
             But God, he knows the heart of man,
             And ever has--and ever could
            With his all-comprehensive scan 
            Discern some little trace of good.
             Yet Jonah at the city gate,
            'Mid withered gourd-vines, rails at fate.
          
        
        
        
          JUDGE NOT
          
            Judge not; that ye be not judged.
            --St. Matthew.
          
          
            Who are you, to sit in judgment on the saying or the song,
            With a finger raised and ready to determine right or wrong? 
            Who are you, to weigh the motives of another's thought or act--
            In a solemn contemplation warping fancy into fact?
             Who are you, to scent the evil? Is your impulse free from grudge? 
            Is the world a tittle better for the judgments that you judge?
          
          
            Who are you, to take the measure of an erring fellow- man?
             Whence the power and precision of your comprehensive scan?
            How you hold the scales in balance! I have never understood 
            Why you shouted out the evil; why you whispered of the good.
            
             Who are you, to wait the moment, when with wink and smile and nudge
            You may call the world to witness of the judgments that you judge?
          
          
            Who are you? But who am I, to set you down a hypocrite?
             Who am I to doubt the justice of the judgments you have writ? 
            Who are you, to judge the others as they come across your view?
             Who am I, to sit and murmur of my discontent with you?
             How do we know--puny critics!--as the way of life we trudge
            How we wring the heart of justice with the judgments that we judge?
          
        
        
        
          THE GLORY OF THE NIGHT
          
            He made the stars, also.
            --Genesis.
          
          
            It may le as the wise ones say, 
            That all the stars which gleam for us
            Grew patiently, day unto day,
            From out a vapor nebulous--
             But this one thought: that they were thrown 
            Like jewels from the Master's hand 
            And over heaven's garden sown
             With one great sweep, is far more grand.
          
          
            What marvel could the heart desire,
             Could one have faltered through that night 
            Until it glowed with living fire 
            All pink, and emerald, and white? 
            But to have wondered at the dark 
            And doubted at the gloom which swung 
            Above, behind, before, then mark 
            The glory of the stars outflung!
          
          
            To have stood, cowed, within that night
             That seemed to reach, and fold, and clutch,
            And press grim hands to shut the sight; 
            To feel the darkness bend and touch, 
            
             And then, out of the unsolved hush, 
            To see uncounted blazing swirls
            That looped the sky in dazzling rush
             And decked the breast of time with pearls!
          
          
            To have seen this--to have stood there
            Where everything with fear was rife
            And terror brooded in the air--
             To see the night receive its life!
            It may be that the stars were made
            As reckoned by the wisest men,
             But to have seen this, thrilled, afraid,
            Were worth the being dead since then.
          
        
        
        
          THE LESSON OF GRIEF
          
            I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
            --Isaiah.
          
          
            "I shall go softly all my years"--
            Thus said a saddened king of old,
            When, through the mistiness of tears,
            He saw the grief his days must hold. 
            And he went softly. All his days
            Were days that glowed with gentleness,
            The paths of peace his chosen ways. 
            In time his grief he came to bless.
          
          
            There is an echo for each laugh--
            An echo from the ones who hear.
            But they have fellowship, who quaff 
            The bitter drink brewed from a tear.
            The man who knows of sorrow's weight 
            Is never in that woe alone;
            The mystic brotherhood of fate
            Gives him a thousand friends unknown.
          
          
            He knows the grief that others feel,
            By what is tugging at his heart;
            Of all the blows that life may deal
             To others, he would bear his part. 
            
            Grief has a wondrous softening:
            It betters every soul it sears-- 
             Though it touch commoner or king 
            He goes more softly all his years.
          
          
             A softer cadence fills his songs;
            A truer grasp is in his hand,
            For, out of seeming bitter wrongs,
            He comes at last to understand 
            The heart-beats of his fellow-men,
            The clinging of their hopes and fears.
            When grief brings him her message, then
             He goes more softly all his years.
          
        

        
        
          "GETHSEMANE"
          
            
              And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane.
              --St. Mark.
            
            Each one has his Gethsemane; for each there is a day
             When he shall halt, fear-stricken by the darkness in the way;
            When he, faint-hearted, weary of the griefs he yet must bear,
            Shall turn aside into the shade and soothing calmness there--
            Shall turn aside and bow his head, and on his bended knees 
            Pray that he may not take the cup and drain it to the lees.
          
          
            The garden called Gethsemane--we enter it alone,
             With sorrows that we only know, and griefs that are our own; 
            We hide among the shadows where no eye may see us shrink,
            And murmur at the hyssop in the cup that we must drink-- 
            The cup wherein all sadness and all bitternesses swim, 
            And ask why fate has poured the draft that fills it to the brim.
          
          
          
            A resting place--Gethsemane--a place for wearied souls 
            And aching hearts to heal the smarts that tell of unwon goals;
            A place serene and comforting; a spot of gentle calm,
            Where breezes whisper through the leaves a murmur sweet with balm,
             Where, all unseen, the naked soul may come to understand 
            The reason for the heavy cup that waits the tardy hand.
          
          
            Each one has his Gethsemane, where, stumbling, tired and worn,
            And bent with all the heavy load of sorrow he has borne,
             He may find rest, and know that now his night is almost gone,
            And see ahead the golden glint that marks a happy dawn.
            And then, content and fortified in heart, he takes his cup
            That brims with pungent bitterness, and bravely drinks it up.
          
        
        
        
          THE MOTHERS OF THE THIEVES
          
            Then were two thieves crucified with him; one on the right hand and another on the
              left.
            --St. Matthew.
          
          
            When it grew night on Calvary,
            When darkness trembled down, 
            It seemed no light again could be 
            On country-side or town. 
            The somber clouds shut out the sky 
            And flung themselves and swirled 
            Above the crosses reaching high--
            That sorrow of the world.
          
          
             When it grew dark on Calvary, 
            Two women, heavy-eyed, 
            And fearful lest a one might see,
             Crept up on either side.
            In halting dread they faltered on,
            Each battling with her fears-- 
            Their cheeks were sunken, pale and wan,
             And stained with many tears.
          
          
            When all was still on Calvary,
             Two women, torn with sighs,
             Would turn from what they knew should be 
             Held up before their eyes. 
            
            They bowed their heads in all their woe
             And sobbing there, each one 
            Turned, down the bitter way to go,
            And cried: "My son! My son!"
          
          
            When all was done on Calvary,
             The clouds beat back the stars;
             One cross was empty, of the three, 
            And two had weighted bars.
            There, dumbly asking whence and why
             This web that sorrow weaves, 
            Stood, questioning the leaden sky,
            The mothers of the thieves.
          
        
        
        
          AMBITION
          
            Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.
            --Ecclesiastes.
          
          
             Ambition is a circle where men run,
            Each hoping he the leading place may find,
            Each backward glance shows him the winning one; 
            Each forward look tells him he is behind.
             He quaffs betimes the red wine of success,
             And then aside he casts the empty cup--
            Another round, and, in his eagerness, 
            That which he flung away he would take up.
          
          
            Ambition is a circle where men run, 
            Each fancying himself may hold the lead--
            A race with prizéd guerdon never won;
             Where no one is contented with his meed;
            Where men go, striving ceaselessly, the round,
             And think at last their efforts are complete, 
            When, following, they hear the warning sound-- 
            The falling of a nearing rival's feet. 
          
        
        
        
          BALANCING 
          
            Cast up the sum of good resolves 
            With which we met the year; 
            Upon the lengthy debit side
             Let all the faults appear; 
            Write down the good we did not do--
            The goals we have not won-- 
            But write in sturdy characters
            The bad we have not done.
          
          
            Let all the merit we've acquired,
             In figures firm and fair,
            All luminous and fine to see
             Be boldly written there;
            Set down the good we meant to do--
            The good but half-begun--
            And write, high on the credit side, 
            The bad we have not done.
          
          
            'Tis hard to live in gentleness;
             'Tis hard to make the year
             A page--a blotless page of joy,
            And honesty, and cheer;
            
            'Tis harder yet the evil things
            That all beset, to shun--
             So write in brave and honest strokes 
            The bad we have not done.
          
          
            The good we meant to do--the deeds 
            So oft misunderstood;
            The thwarted good we try to do, 
            And would do, if we could;
            The noble deeds we set upon
             And have accomplished none--
            Write them--and with them credit all
             The bad we have not done.
          
        
        
        
          AT THE SIGN OF THE SMILE
          
            We're weary with walking the Highway of Life;
             We're fretted and blustered with worry and strife;
            Let us drop by the wayside the heavy old load 
            And rest at the inn at the turn of the road--
            Let us tarry a while
            At the Sign of the Smile.
          
          
            Ho, the Sign of the Smile is a jolly old inn,
            With gargoyles about it that do naught but grin; 
            There's always a laugh, and a shoulder to whack,
             And always an echo to answer us back! 
            Let us tarry a while 
            At the Sign of the Smile.
          
          
            At the Sign of the Smile--we will linger long there,
             For the strictest of rules is the ban upon care; 
            And the guests must forget there are such things as years,
            And never shed any but laughter-brought tears!
            Let us tarry a while
            At the Sign of the Smile.
          
          
          
            There'll be flagons of jollity for us to sip,
            And many and many a rollicking quip. 
            Though the jokes may be old, like the juice of the vine
            They mellow with age to the richest of wine.
            Let us tarry a while
            At the Sign of the Smile.
          
          
            Let us tarry a while at the Sign of the Smile--
            Forget all our griefs in the joys that beguile;
             Let us pleasure the noon till it changes to night,
            Then up with our loads--and we'll find they are light,
            If we tarry a while
            At the Sign of the Smile.
          
        
        
        
          A TOAST TO THE LOSING MAN
          
            Here's to the man that loses! That patient, luckless wight
             Who battles ever manfully, though in a losing fight;
             Who works away by night and day and ever meets defeat,
            Yet knows that, dim ahead of him, success--success is sweet!
            Drink to his health--the losing man!--commoner, prince or priest-- 
            Who has no hate for his hard fate--for he has tried, at least.
          
          
             Health to the man that loses! The one that works in vain;
            The one that struggles valiantly, and garners naught but pain.
             Down to the grave his heart is brave, his hope is ever high,
            For he has learned what we have spurned--that it is good to try!
            Drink to his luck--the loser's luck--skeleton at the feast!
            Sorrow and rue may be his due, but he has tried, at least.
          
          
          
            Here's to the man that loses!--loses and pays the price;
            Pays the price of the loser, unfavored of fortune's dice!
            Courage to dare a fate unfair--that is his goodly mark;
            Mettle and might to search for light, though groping in the dark!
            Drink to his health--the losing man!--soldier or slave or priest.
            What though he fall? He's best of all, for he has tried, at least.
          
        
        
        
           A WAYSIDE CONVERSATION
          
            Fame and Death, upon a day,
             Met and chatted by the way.
          
          
            "Greeting, friend," in cheery tones,
             Murmured Death, with happy smile;
            "Let us rest beside the way.
             Need we hurry all the while?" 
          
          
            "I must hurry," answered Fame.
            "Farther down this road I haste.
            One abides there whom I must
            Give my sweetest fruits to taste."
          
          
            "Rest you, rest you, brother mine,"
            Death insisted graciously.
             "But an hour ago that one 
            Answered to a call from me." 
          
          
            Fame and Death, upon a day,
            Chatted softly by the way.
          
        
        
        
          THE FOREFATHERS
          
            And I have given you a land for which ye did not labor, and cities which ye built
              not, and ye dwell in them.
            --Joshua.
          
          
            We quarrel of land and line;
             We bicker of work and wage; 
            We trouble our souls with a doleful sign, 
            Forgetting our heritage--
            Forgetting the tireless hands; 
            Forgetting the restless feet
            That fared undaunted through unknown lands 
            Till the path was made'complete.
          
          
            The fathers--the men who dreamed,
            And, dreaming, were strong to dare,
             To struggle ahead to the goal that gleamed,
            A prize that was rich and fair.
            The fathers--the men who thought 
            Of all that the future held,
            And, hearts uplifted, essayed and wrought 
            All the work their dreams compelled. 
          
          
          
            We pluck from the vines they set; 
            We walk in the ways they made;
            We harvest their fields; and their forests yet 
            Are giving us rest and shade.
            The fathers--the men of old
            Who builded a place for us,
             A country magnificent; brave and bold 
            In their faith all glorious.
          
          
            We quarrel and dread and doubt,
             Forgetting we only hold 
            The comfort within and the peace without
            By grace of the men of old;
            Forgetting the toil and stress, 
            Forgetting the bygone age
             When cities were planned in their comeliness 
            For a future heritage.
          
        
        
        
          IN THE INNER TEMPLE
          
            In the inner temple
             Of your heart there lies
            A secluded altar, 
            Sacred from all eyes.
            You the hidden image 
            Never will disclose,
            And the thing you worship
            Of it never knows.
          
          
            In the inner temple,
            Sacredly you hold-- 
            Holy, high, and hidden 
            Back of cloth of gold-- 
            Something of your dreaming,
            Something of your dread,
             Something of your living,
            Something long, long dead. 
          
          
            Times you go to worship;
             Times you go to pray; 
            Yet you never, softly, 
            Draw the veil away.
            You alone enshrine it--
             Know what it may be--
            Still you tremble, fearing
             All the world must see.
          
        
        
        
          THE GREAT UNSATISFIED
          
             The men who are not satisfied 
            Are they who set the pace-- 
            The men who do not meet defeat
             With calm, contented face.
             The men who labor on and on
            With minds and fingers skilled-- 
            They are the great unsatisfied
             Who plan, and fight, and build.
          
          
            The men who are not satisfied--
            They are the ones who lead;
             They force humanity ahead 
            With strident word and deed;
            They bring us out of bygone ways;
            They guide us through the dark 
            To where some man, unsatisfied,
             Has set a shining mark.
          
          
            The men who are not satisfied--
             They gird the world with wires;
             They belt the land with rails of steel
             And pierce the air with spires;
            They loose the leash of sweet content
            With which mankind is tied.
            We never pay the debt we owe 
            The great unsatisfied. 
          
        
        
        
           THE FOUR GUESTS
          
            A knock at the door--but he
            Was dreaming a dream of fame,
             And the one who knocked drew softly back, 
            And never again he came.
            A knock at the door--as soft,
             As soft, as shy, as a dove.
            But the dreamer dreamed till the guest was gone-- 
            And the guest was Love.
          
          
            A knock at the door--again
             The dreamer dreamed away,
            Unheeding, deaf to the gentle call
             Of the one who came that day.
            A knock at the door--no more 
            The guest to that door came.
            Yet the dreamer dreamed of the one who called, 
            For the guest was Fame.
          
          
             A knock at the door--but still
             He gave it no reply;
            And the waiting guest gave a cheery hail
             Ere he slowly wandered by.
            A knock at the door--in dreams
            The dreamer fain would grope 
            Till the guest stole on, with a humbled sigh--
            And the guest was Hope.
          
          
          
            A knock at the door--'twas loud,
            With might in every stroke;
            And the dreamer stopped in his dreaming thought,
             And suddenly awoke.
             A knock at the door! He ran
            With the swiftness of a breath;
            And the door swung wide, and the guest came in--
             And the guest was Death.
          
        
        
        
           UNFINISHED THINGS
          
            Unfinished things! The verse begun
             In ringing meter, strong and free,
             Yet laid aside, ere it was done,
            By some weak soul of poesy.
             The books--the books to help mankind, 
            To banish care and sorrow's stings,
             Abandoned in the daily grind-- 
            The pathos of unfinished things!
          
          
            The sentence broken all too soon,
             Before the kindly words were said;
             The words that might have been a croon
            Where sore affliction made its bed; 
            The plans unheeded--plans that might
            Have made of swineherds ermined kings-- 
            No day goes by but brings to light 
            The pathos of unfinished things.
          
          
            The songs unsung! What mellow strains
             Had lent their gladness to our life!
             What cadences to soothe our pains
            And hush our petty stress and strife, 
            Had some blithe measure faltered not
            When hands all careless swept the strings 
            With lilt and rapture now forgot.
             Ah, pathos of unfinished things!
          
        
        
        
           THE LEGEND OF LAUGHTER
          

             It is a legend, such, in sooth, 
             As pagans tell within the booth 
             Where there is any ware but truth: 

          
          
             That when the world was but begun
            And firstlings of all things were there--
            The first rose smiling at the sun 
            And lending glory to the air,
            The first dove soaring on its wings,
             The first man walking on the ground-- 
            'Twas then the Maker of All Things 
            Disposed of every sweet sound.
          
          
            That He within the garden sate
            And made division of them all;
             The song of one bird to its mate;
             The rhythm of the trumpet call;
            The diapason of the sea; 
            The singing of the ones who reap;
            The rustle of the leafy tree
            And whispers that through grasses creep; 
          
          
            That He from out his hand let fall
             The music of the straining sail,
             And melodies that men enthrall-- 
            The lyric of the nightingale; 
            
            The untraced murmurs of the night 
            That dreamily sigh from the west-- 
            All sounds He gave to give delight, 
            And one was sweeter than the rest.
          
          
            That those who stood about and heard
            The throbbing of the thrilling drum,
            And joyous caroling of bird 
            And honey-bee's contented hum,
             Were curious and marveling, 
            And wondered if there could be found
             A beast, or bird, or anything 
            That should receive the sweetest sound;
          
          
            That then the Maker of them all
             Said: "Lo, this fairest sound shall go,
             Not to the thrilling trumpet call,
             Nor to the love-song soft and low,
            Nor to the ever-singing sea,
            But it shall be"--the Maker smiled--
             "The richest of all melody 
            Shall be the laughter of a child!"
          
          

             It is a legend--pagan, too-- 
             That out of pagan dreamings grew-- 
             Yet, haply, it might well be true. 

          
        
        
        
          EDEN 
          
            So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims,
              and a. flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
            --Genesis.
          
          
            We have eaten the fruit, as decreed we should; 
            And we know of evil and know of good.
             We have walked our ways with our heads erect
            And we take the paths that the fates select;
            But many the times that we call to mind 
             The wondrous Eden we left behind.
          
          
            We remember now how we left the gate,
            And the road seemed pleasant and broad and straight; 
            But the hills were many and helps were few,
            And oh, how tardy our footsteps grew! 
            And we fain would turn to our Eden, then--
             Would fain go back to the joys again.
          
          
            We must earn our bread in our sweat, and eat 
            While forging on with unwilling feet;
             And the road is rough and the way is steep,
            And our dreams so fair that we fear to sleep--
            For we dream and dream how the flowers tossed
            In the Eden scorned; in the Eden lost.
          
          
          
            Sometimes--sometimes, on a lone, high hill, 
            When they give us rest, and the air is still,
             We gaze far back down the dwindling road-- 
            Far back where the scented roses glowed-- 
            Then a flaming sword we can see, in truth,
             And it bars the Eden we knew--our youth!
