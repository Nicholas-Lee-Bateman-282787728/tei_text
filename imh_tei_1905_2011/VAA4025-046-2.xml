            <p>The eighteenth century European world, noted for its religious apathy and agnosticism, had little
                    spiritual fervor to offer to the Atlantic Coast regions in America, let alone to the frontiers which
                    were rapidly merging into a united front along the Piedmont, soon to be breaking across the
                    mountains into the <geogName>Great Valley</geogName>. In like fashion, the spiritual heritage from
                    the established churches along the coast was not of the highest order, and if it had not been for
                    certain revivalist forces rising out of <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
               </placeName>, and perhaps western Europe, the Middle West of
                    America might well have become a region noted for its godlessness as many expected it to become. To
                    the contrary, however, this region to the westward emerged as a community conspicuous for its
                    spiritual foundations, with a moral code almost as puritanical as that of early <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>. Why this paradox; whence these foundations? Volumes have been written on this subject
                    within the last thirty years by Professors William W. Sweet, Colin B. Goodykoontz, and others. Maybe
                    a twenty-minute synthesis of their researches on the foundations of the early West can afford some
                    solace and inspiration to our troubled and disillusioned world of today.</p>
            <p>The frontier with its freer environment was a laboratory for a religious revivalism which gathering
                    form in the second third of the eighteenth century spread over America in the movement known as the
                    Great Awakening.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This evangelism <list type="footnotes">

                    invading not only the Anglican church in the South but rapidly moving northward to penetrate the

                    </placeName> and the Congregationalists, led by that great intellectual, Jonathan Edwards. The
                    revival which lasted from 1735 to 1745 had a most revolutionary effect upon the nascent Presbyterian
                    church, primarily confined to the newer parts of the middle colonies and already pushing to the
                    southwestward along the Piedmont. While most of the East was to gradually slip back into apathy and
                    secularism, the Presbyterians were to continue their revivalist movement into the newer frontiers,
                    establishing beachheads from which the cross was soon to be carried across the mountains into the
                    West.</p>
            <p>The Scotch-Irish, who were religiously more Scotch than Irish, brought their Presbyterian faith with

                    </placeName> had aided them with money, Bibles, and even ministers. The Scottish religious and
                    educational heritage cannot be underestimated, for <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>

                    dire-hearted religious enthusiasts; persecution in the Old World had fired them with a religious
                    freedom and spirit which they were determined above all else to keep aglow in the new. They had been
                    promised religious freedom in Penn's colony, and they expected it elsewhere. As one
                    authority has said: they were stubborn in their insistence on rights—‘they
                    kept the Sabbath and everything else they could get their hands on." And another authority
                    observes: the Ulster Presbyterians "made good frontiersmen, but they also stood in need of
                        prayer."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    been made, but for the Episcopalians it was going to be too little and too late.</p>
            <p>One would hardly expect religion to flourish during a great revolution, especially when the
                    prevailing philosophy of that revolution centered around the Lockian natural rights philosophy.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Time does not allow to deal with the movement for separation of church and
                    state or religious freedom, two great landmarks of the War for Independence which were to have
                    tremendous influence upon the development of the country west of the mountains. Indeed the
                    principles of the Revolution, planted and nourished in the New West, were to make that region more
                    republican than the East itself.</p>
            <p>But have not these great achievements obscured some significant losses? Many churches, schools, and
                    colleges were destroyed. Many youths who would have become religious leaders fell on the field of
                    battle. Moreover, it must be admitted that two wars within one generation did much to increase
                    apathy and deadness of spirit, already paralyzing the European world. Indeed, the young nation was
                    poorly equipped to bear the cross, let alone to carry it across the mountains to a wilderness region
                    which had been acquired by the Treaty of 1783.</p>
            <p>The Confederation period was characterized by a readjustment of religious institutions along national
                    lines. In spite of the new national organizations of the Episcopalians, Methodists, and
                    Presbyterians, the East was not able to help to any great degree the vast movements of peoples, many
                    of whom were still moving along the Piedmont while others poured over the mountains into western

                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> type, was hardly conducive to an effective religious advance. The Ordinance of 1787 and
                    the Federal Constitution were notable in their profession of religious freedom and encouragement of
                    religion, but material aid was notably absent. In <list type="footnotes">

                    have been inaugurated under more unfavorable religious conditions—and the French
                    Revolution with its infidelity was just ahead.</p>
            <p>In spite of the times, some progress was made. The Methodists seemed to have profited most from
                    adversity. What was the loss to the Episcopalians became the gain of the Methodists, particularly in
                    the Piedmont and across the mountains.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Here in the West the Baptists also grew

                    </placeName> had three resident Presbyterian ministers, though there was no church until 1782. In

                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> erected the presbytery of Redstone, and in 1786 the presbyteries of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> were established.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Academies and colleges were being founded in the
                    Piedmont which sought out the most promising youths and trained them for ministers, though <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> continued to furnish the bulk of the missionaries— a point which will be
                    given more adequate attention later. In 1793 the presbytery of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> was created for the territory west of the Monongahela, and in 1801 the presbytery of
                    Erie was created to the northward.</p>
            <p>But regardless of all this religious movement in the wilderness there was still much that was
                    discouraging. The pioneers were spreading out into so many directions at the same time that no
                    church, no matter how well-organized, could ever have kept pace. The reports of observers in the
                    West, nevertheless, were portentous; many places especially on the fringe of settlement were more
                    like the wilderness around them. Even <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the oldest of the trans-montane settlements, did not escape the censure even of
                    persons admittedly sympathetic with a secular way of life. Bishop Francis Asbury said of this
                    frontier town in 1789: "The people were very attentive, but alas! they are far from God,
                    and too near the savages in situations and manners."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In <list type="footnotes">

                    infidelity forces of the French Revolution which penetrated to the frontier of America, in fact,
                    finding perhaps more fertile reception in <placeName>

                    New West but fortunately it was a dark moment before a dawn.</p>
            <p>On the heels of these struggling beginnings occurred the Great Revival. This revival centered
                    primarily in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and the <geogName>Ohio Valley</geogName>. Here in this region the frontier had been
                    almost constantly harrassed by Indian raids since the Revolutionary War. Living in daily fear of the
                    Indian had seemingly increased the revivalist religious spirit. The Presbyterian minister, John
                    McMillan, had noted an "outpouring of the spirit," as he described it, in his
                    congregations in western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

            </p>
            <p>It was out of this Presbyterian beachhead that the missionary James McGready parted in 1796, headed

                    </placeName>. During the next three summers the torch of faith began to lighten up the surrounding
                    countryside; McGready's congregations got larger and larger and a revivalist spirit began
                    to break the bounds into the surrounding territory. A spiritual uplift had begun. This movement
                    similar to that of the Great Awakening has often been called the Second Great Awakening, but
                    generally it is known simply as the Great Revival.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> The Reverend Barton W.

                    </placeName> to see if what he had heard was true. He saw wondrous things with his own eyes, and
                    returning to his own congregations he determined to stir up a bigger and better fire. Thus at Cane
                    Ridge in August, 1801, Stone organized a camp meeting with twenty thousand people attending, some

            <p>The orthodox or "Old Side" Presbyterians were shocked at much of the Great Revival,

                    areas to remain without the gospel entirely, or to send them sound teachers who loved souls and knew

            <p>The clash between Eastern orthodoxy and Western liberalism inevitably led to schism. The first

            <p>A second revolt among the Presbyterians stemmed from about the same general locus and involved some

                    their intention to follow no creed, sectarian or denominational alignment, but rather to take the
                    Bible literally as the basis of their faith and practice." This new group was generally
                    referred to as "Christians," though they were also known as

                    Movement—of going back to the original scriptures for their faith.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                    In 1832, the Stonites and Campbellites, having similar doctrines, and, both united on the idea of
                    restoration, and using commonly the same name of "Christian," found it desirable
                    to form a union under the name of Disciples of Christ. The Disciples have the distinction of being
                    the only denomination created in the West and by a western environment during the period before
                        1830.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were many other momentous results stemming from the Great Revival. While its creation of
                    disaffections was particularly noteworthy, nevertheless, its promotion of a union among the
                    Calvinists should also be mentioned. Indeed, it is not surprising to find the Presbyterians and
                    Con-gregationalists effecting a union in the West in 1807. Many New Englanders themselves openly
                    admitted the inadequacy of their decentralized organization to provide for the westward movement, as
                    already noted, and many felt they had their hands full on the <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> frontiers. In the long run the Congregationalists viewed the union as one of mixed
                    blessings, for by the thirties many New Englanders, beginning to go to the West in large numbers,
                    preferred the more democratic government of the Congregational church. The union operated more
                    effectively in the Northwest than in the Southwest.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the War of 1812, the Presbyterians followed the movements of population into the Southwest,
                    perhaps becoming most conspicuous in the churches established in the towns. All and all, the
                    Presbyterian church in the period, 1800 to 1830, for its organization and trained effort, still
                    deserves first place in the contest to subdue the wilderness.</p>
            <p>As for other denominational sects, the Great Revival had an immediate effect of uniting the Baptist
                    church, but a long-range effect of almost hopelessly dividing it into seven different groups, all
                    the way from "Soft-Shell" to "Hard-Shell." Regardless of this
                    fact and also the limitation that they did not have any national organization behind them until

                    Methodists rose to great heights after the revival and particularly after the War of 1812 as the
                    waves of settlers rushed into the Southwest. In this section the sparse settlements were an ideal

                    that the parent school well deserves the title "Mother of Colleges." Of the seven
                    colleges that were established in frontier country in the period before 1800 all but two were
                    Presbyterian—the other two being Congregational in origin were, however, of the same
                    Calvinistic faith.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the period, 1800 to 1830, the Presbyterian educational advance continued, with most of the effort
                    being concentrated on the West. Nine Presbyterian and other Calvinist colleges were founded on the
                    frontiers of this second early period.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> The only other frontier denominational

            <p>Such is the record of those which survived; but there are many others which flourished and then

                    frontier colleges. Like William and Mary College, it represents the old Virginian culture at its
                    height, with a classical background somewhat modified by the French romantic influences and frontier
                    environment. By 1820 it had risen to such prestige in the country that it was called the "<placeName>

            <p>All in all, the western university movement before 1830 under the lead of the denominational college
                    was a movement in which the West, college for college, actually outnumbered the East. If time
                    allowed, one could also trace the academy or high school movement in the same manner. As you know,
                    many of these academies grew into colleges. Some authorities have contended that the number of
                    colleges and academies led to weakness rather than to strength, but the point is simply that they
                    had to be established in this manner or not at all. The American Education Society in 1823 declared
                    that "The multiplication of Literary Institutions is dreaded by some, as being in their
                    view, unfavorable to the substantial progress of our national literature. But for ourselves we can
                    say that it seems to be no inauspicious omen. We hail it as a token of a spirit in this community
                    that will not rest, till it has brought within the rank of every enterprising youth the means of a
                    liberal education."<hi rend="sup">24</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fact that there was almost a college to every community forming in the West, constituted a
                    contribution in democracy that was highly significant. In 1826 the Reverend Lyman Beecher averred
                    that, "Colleges and schools are truly intellectual manufactories and workshops of the
                    nation, and in their design and results are pre-eminently republican institutions. They break up and
                    diffuse among the people that monopoly of knowledge and mental power which despotic governments
                    accumulate for the purposes of arbitrary rule, and bring to the shelves of the humblest families of
                    the nation a full and fair opportunity of holding competition for the learning, and honor, and
                    wealth, with the ablest and most affluent families … giving thus to the nation the select
                    talents and powers of her entire population."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> They were known as
                    "peoples' colleges," and all were open on equal terms to any who would
                    attend. And as President Philip Lindsley of the University of <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>Inasmuch as social and class distinctions were almost nonexistent in the West, the privilege of
                    higher education came to be regarded as a right of all, which was quite a contrast to the select
                    English college and even to the Eastern college to a lesser degree.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The
                    curriculum too underwent change in the newer environment to the westward. At first, classical and
                    formal, it became modified to meet the needs of the new country. Such subjects as law, politics,
                    medicine, natural sciences, and trade came to challenge the pre-eminence of religion and the
                    classics.</p>
            <p>The American college in its western democratic environment became America's pride and glory.
                    What the East could not immediately establish because of tradition, the West could more readily
                    adapt and alter. The denominational college gave to the West a set of moral values which could never
                    have been obtained elsewhere. Likewise, it contributed its fair share along with the church towards
                    a higher, law-abiding type of community than could have otherwise developed. Furthermore, these
                    colleges not only trained the religious leadership of this region, but their graduates also became
                    leaders in the political life of their day. In truth these colleges formed a foundation stone of the
                    first order in the Valley of Democracy.</p>
            <p>Thus in conclusion, by 1830, it could not be said that the West was a godless country or a community
                    without a soul, though many <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> intellectuals were sorely concerned. The far-flung frontiers with all their lawlessness
                    had offered a great challenge to the forces of civilization, but the moral and religious forces were
                    triumphing to a greater degree than had been expected. It was a crusade of the first order and the
                    names of the saints, many of whom are now forgotten, lie hidden in the accumulating dust of
                    fast-crumbling records. But their contribution was tremendously important. As one authority has
                    said: "It is safe to say that no group of men exerted such a formative influence upon the
                    destiny of the western people as did these."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Professor <list type="footnotes">

               <hi rend="i">Charles B. Hirsch</hi>*</byline>
            <p>The attitude of the Indiana churches toward the actual support of the conscientious objectors varied
                    from almost complete indifference to the greatest of interest. Those churches which maintained a
                    more or less tolerant attitude of indifference were divided into two groups. The first group
                    included the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the African Methodist Episcopal church,
                    the First Church of the Nazarene, and the Roman Catholic church. There were no conscientious
                    objectors in the churches of these denominations in Indiana, although on the national level they had
                    a sprinkling in that category. Consequently, there were no problems of financial support, or of
                    church action in favor of or against the stand of conscientious objectors in these religious bodies.
                    Local churches usually handled their own problems if they had any pertaining to this group.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second group included the Protestant Episcopal church,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and the First Church
                    of Christ, Scientist. These religious organizations had conscientious objectors in their
                    congregations in Indiana, but did not recognize their status as such. The latter denomination stated
                    that a Christian Scientist could not be a conscientious objector, if he followed the beliefs of the
                    church. The Christian Scientists made no provision during the war to take care of those in that
                    classification but in 1946 their headquarters made a contribution of three thousand dollars to the
                    National Service Board of Religious Objectors. This amount was to cover any deficit sustained by the
                    historic peace churches because of a few Christian Scientists who were conscientious objectors
                    despite the counsel given by their church.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> While the Protestant <list type="footnotes">

                    their constituents who opposed active participation in the war. Further support was given by the
                    Episcopal Pacifist Fellowship which was a group formed from within the church without official
                    recognition. This group, at a meeting of the National Service Board of Religious Objectors in 1941,
                    stated that they would make every effort to support Episcopal members if the civilian public service
                    program was continued. Another suggestion made by their representative was to seek the establishment

                    Northwest Indiana Conference, a resolution was passed urging the government to supply food,
                    clothing, and shelter to the conscientious objectors.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Three years later,
                    however, the church reversed its position by a majority of one ministerial vote. The lay vote of 203
                    to 131 in favor of this action also voiced the opinion that "We are well within the
                    Christian position when we assert the necessity of the use of military forces to resist an
                    aggression which would overthrow every right which is held sacred by civilized men

                    the position of those opposed to war had been undermined. A ruling of the Methodist Judicial
                    Commission stated that the new stand taken by the church did not effect the status of such believers
                    in their denomination. The church would still "ask and claim exemption from all forms of
                    military preparation or service for all conscientious objectors who may be members of the Methodist
                        Church."<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It was further expressed that the civilian public
                    service program should continue not only for the honor of the church, but for the confidence of its

                    non-combatant position of the Seventh-day Adventists was recognized by President Abraham Lincoln
                    during the Civil War. Since that time, the church has maintained the doctrine of noncombatancy. Its
                    members do not belong to any pacifist groups, nor do they refuse to enter the services of the armed
                    forces. Their only opposition is to the taking of a human life. Prior to World War II, they
                    experienced difficulty in obtaining assignments to the medical service or other non-combatant
                    organizations. In the recent war there was much less difficulty in receiving noncombatant service in
                    the armed forces because the value of this type of service was recognized by military officials. One
                    of their representatives at a congressional hearing in 1940 said, "Seventh-day Adventists
                    as you know are non-combatants. We are not pacifists nor militarists nor conscientious objectors,

                    centers for this new training program. A training camp was set up at Grand Ledge, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, in October, 1940. Its purpose was to bring together the Seventh-day Adventist youth
                    from four nearby states, including Indiana, and to train some of these men as officers who would
                    then be able to organize similar units in their home states. Approximately one hundred men from
                    Indiana participated in this training program." Those who took part in the officer training
                    program were for the most part ministers, teachers, and other leaders of the young people's
                    work in the denomination. As a result of this training a unit was organized in Indiana.</p>
            <p>In December, 1940, a medical cadet corps training unit was formed at Indiana Academy, a
                    denominational secondary school, Cicero, Indiana. On Sundays, the students and others who came from
                    all over the state, received from eight to ten hours of special military and medical instruction,
                    which was continued for a period of twenty weeks. A hundred men received noncombatant training in
                    preparation for eventual military service. They furnished their own uniforms and paid for other
                    expenses including tuition and books. Other similar programs followed the initial one. There were
                    fewer trained in subsequent classes due to the fact that the medical training program was
                    incorporated as a regular study in the school curriculum with appropriate course credit. Some
                    Hoosier Seventh-day Adventists received their indoctrination at Emmanuel Missionary College, <placeName>

                    the Seventh-day Adventist servicemen, who conscientiously observed the seventh day or Saturday as
                    their day of worship.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>Camp pastors were assigned by the Seventh-day Adventist denomination to various sectors of the
                    nation. The duties of these pastors included looking after the spiritual welfare of their fellow
                    believers in the armed forces, and also aiding them in case of any difficulties that might arise, as
                    a result of their religious beliefs. One pastor, in reference to his work, wrote that he had
                    assisted several men at Camp Atter-bury, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. His chief responsibility was to contact the superior officers of the men
                    involved, and straighten out any misunderstandings due to the status of noncombatancy. Duties in the
                    medical units, where the majority of these men served did not generally interfere with the
                    observance of their Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>The pastor said further that while at times it was necessary to go over the heads of the lower
                    officers in order to obtain a proper hearing, he found that the higher he went, the more
                    approachable and understanding were the officials. It was due chiefly to this intercession on the
                    part of the pastor that there were no court-martial cases at Camp Atter-bury among Seventh-day
                    Adventists because of religious beliefs. In most instances the men received passes from sunset
                    Friday night until sunset Saturday night, in order to be free to observe their Sabbath day.<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

                    for a rather cold, monastic air he looks and acts like anyone else. He wears a uniform, salutes,
                    answers roll call and does routine duty in the medical department, but when it comes to picking up a
                    loaded rifle or pistol and pulling the trigger, his militarism ends abruptly.</p>
            <p>"So much is he like the rest of us, in fact, that I didn't know he objected to war
                    any differently than anyone else until our detachment was sent to Fort Harrison recently for
                    training with arms. Why the army sent him on such a mission is obscure—just one of these
                    things that could happen only in the army.</p>
            <p>"However he came in handy. While the rest of us marched with easy conscience into the lovely
                    summer countryside and blasted away at inoffensive bits of cardboard with our deadly weapons, this
                    man stayed behind as an orderly for the barracks, sort of housekeeper.</p>

                    an ordnance officer.</p>
            <p>"The most unusual thing about him is that he gets off duty on Saturday, which is Sunday to
                    him, and on Sunday he is available for duty. At Fort Harrison, while the rest of us were at ease on
                    the Sabbath, he cleaned up the entire barracks. On Saturday we cleaned it up while he took off

                    took this position instead of the more absolute stand of no compromise with any type of military

                    is only one of a number of ecclesiastical groups within the Mennonite family. The other divisions of

                    Old Order Mennonites, the General Conference of the Mennonite Church of North America, and the

                    accomplished by September 30, 1939, and presented to the churches. The course of action included the
                    following steps: all those who had to, should register and at the same time state their
                    conscientious objection to war; when called for service, each individual should state his inability
                    to accept induction into the army and at the same time offer himself for certain nonmilitary
                    service; the Mennonite church was to offer to the President a list of certain forms of service which
                    would be acceptable by the church; the church was also to endeavor to secure an arrangement whereby
                    conscientious objectors would be under a civilian board of control; and finally that the fundamental
                    position of the Mennonite church was to be presented to the President as soon as possible.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Thus, the Mennonites not only claimed exemption for their members from
                    military service, but also recognized the responsibility for providing an alternative for them. This
                    attitude was duplicated by the other peace churches.</p>
            <p>In January, 1942, the Mennonite Central Peace Committee was merged with the Mennonite Central
                    Committee. The latter was an older body and had had twenty years of experience in colonization and
                    foreign relief projects. It also became the operating organization of sixty civilian public service
                    camps, two of which were located in Indiana. One of the new functions of this committee now was to
                    look after the needs of Mennonite conscientious objectors.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> A special
                    educational training program for men in civilian public service camps was prepared and special

                    Spanish, current affairs and pacifism, reconstruction, and agriculture which was the most popular.

                    were in army camps. The pastors also visited those members who were on detached service, for
                    example, those working on farms and in state hospitals. They also appeared before appeal boards,
                    draft boards and courts, in behalf of their members who, because of their convictions, were having

                    is the youngest and the largest of the three historic peace churches. Its membership in Indiana
                    exceeded eighteen thousand and was divided among 112 churches.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> They have no
                    creed except the New Testament. Such principles from the New Testament as peace, temperance,

                    the names of any members who bore arms were taken off the church books. In World War II, a position
                    of tolerance and forebearance was noticed. Anyone going into full military service did so against
                    the advice of the church, but did not lose his church membership. Young men were further advised
                    that noncombatant service within the army was inconsistent with the teachings of the Bible and the
                    church. Noncombatancy could not be reconciled to their historic peace position. Yet, in spite of

            <p>In 1939, the Brethren Service Committee (BSC) was formed with the chief functions of dealing with
                    peace and relief. It approved and suggested certain types of alternate service as being suitable for
                    members of its churches. These services included reclamation and forestry, resettlement of refugees,
                    and farm service.<hi rend="sup">45</hi> Camp pastors were also used by the church to look after the
                    interests of their men not only in civilian public service camps, but also those who were in the
                    armed forces.<hi rend="sup">46</hi> The BSC recognized that the civilian public service program was
                    a limited instrument that was really inadequate for the achievement of all ends sought by pacifists.
                    They considered it as a working compromise between church and state in that the church had submitted
                    to an alternate plan for military service under conscription. The state, in turn, had recognized
                    conscience as a basis of exemption from military service.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aims of the civilian public service program were: (1) to provide for individuals and groups
                    conscientiously opposed to war a means of exercising their freedom of conscience and expressing
                    their beliefs through alternate service, (2) to render service which would conserve and develop
                    human and physical resources, (3) to develop and exemplify ways of co-operative, nonviolent, and
                    serviceable community living, and (4) to prepare for the service of reconstruction.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>

            <p>A poll taken among the Church of the Brethren camps showed that about one-half of the men in these
                    camps were Brethren, and that the majority of the assignees were in their early twenties. The
                    largest group according to occupation and training were those engaged in farming and agricultural
                    work, with the second largest group consisting of those from the professional level, as teachers and

            <p>The Quakers, or the Society of Friends, who since their origin in the seventeenth century have
                    adhered to their pacifist tradition, organized the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) in 1917
                    for the purpose of offering to their government any constructive work in which they could
                    conscientiously serve humanity. Along with its many functions, the AFSC also dealt with the civilian
                    public service program as it affected the Friends.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The Friends stressed the
                    idea that alternate service under conscription was a compromise based on the idea that if war was
                    wrong, so was conscription because it was a part of the whole; that conscription not only wasted
                    men, but that men deteriorated under it; and that if CPS did succeed, it would point the way to a
                    permanent peacetime labor draft. Nevertheless, the Friends also realized that alternate service was
                    an effective witness against war and conscription; that the pacifist could not separate himself from
                    the whole, but had to work alongside, through, and in the government; and finally that the best way
                    to improve the lot of the pacifist was to do a good job at the task assigned. During wartime, the
                    pacifist should emphasize not his rights, but the opportunity to serve. This participation of the
                    AFSC in the CPS program, however, did not imply its approval of conscription. By taking <list type="footnotes">

                    young men in CPS camps as well as those who had refused to register for conscription." Full
                    spiritual and financial support was to be given to these men and their families.<hi rend="sup">54</hi> The following year they passed two resolutions of historical significance, one of which
                    stated that "We do not censure Friends who conscientiously take part in the war effort
                    anymore than ourselves for failure to create conditions that might have done much to have avoided
                    this war."<hi rend="sup">55</hi> The peace section of the AFSC estimated that between
                    seventy-five and eighty per cent of the Quakers of draft age went into the army. As a result of this
                    the Friends found more affinity with pacifists of other denominations than they did with those
                    having the opposite view in their own faith. The failure of the individual <placeName>

                    denominations at this time drew up a statement which covered their peace positions. In case of war,
                    the plan of unified action recommended that each group urge their members to observe the peace
                    position of the particular church. This meant that they would not co-operate in the war effort or
                    the acceptance of any military service. It further stated that these churches should provide proper
                    counseling and spiritual care for conscientious objectors and financial support for their
                    dependents. Two years later, representatives of these sects called on President Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt at the White House and stated their views on war and peace, as well as reasons for their
                    opposition to the bearing of arms.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>When the Burke-Wadsworth Bill<hi rend="sup">58</hi> became a law in September, 1940, the historic
                    peace churches immediately pointed out that the bill contained almost the same provisions for
                    conscientious objectors as did the draft law of 1917. The result of their interest in the matter was
                    a clause, added shortly thereafter, which provided alternate service for conscientious objectors,
                    but no provision was made for the absolutist.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> Ways and means of administering
                    and financing an alternate service program were not mentioned. Questions as to the type of service
                    and assignment procedures were yet to be answered. In order to present a united front and to
                    co-ordinate their activities, the churches organized the National Service Board of Religious
                    Objectors (NSBRO)<hi rend="sup">60</hi> through which they continued further negotiations with
                    government officials. The NSBRO became the official organ not only of the historic peace churches,
                    but also of the other churches who had recognized the position of the conscientious objector.</p>

                    selective service officials and the historic peace churches. When the program was presented to the
                    President, he expressed "instant and aggressive opposition to the plan" without
                    stating his objections. The peace churches had expected a variety of alternatives and financial
                    support from the government, but the outcome was one of two alternatives; either the government or
                    the religious agencies would have to take over the whole responsibility of financing and
                    administering the program for alternate service. This would include all conscientious objectors
                    regardless of their affiliations.</p>
            <p>The agencies of those churches supporting members in class IV-E would meet the wishes of the greatest
                    number of conscientious objectors; <hi rend="sup">ei</hi> and, accepting the responsibility, they
                    agreed to finance the program for six months. After the end of the experimental period, a joint
                    meeting of selective service officials and representatives of the church agencies was held at <placeName>

                    discussed. Both groups agreed to an extension of time, and to a renewal of the CPS program on a
                    yearly basis. By March, 1946, the historic peace churches had expended six million dollars to
                    administer the CPS program. Contributions from other churches amounted to $1,040,410,
                    whereas the cost of administering the camps for conscientious objectors of these other churches

            <p>Much of the money raised by the historic peace churches for the support of the CPS program was

            <p>Indiana churches, as has been shown, varied in degrees by their attitude toward the conscientious
                    objector. Except in one or two instances where the church body adopted a more or less
                    "hands off" policy, the majority of churches recognized the conscientious
                    convictions of their members and supported them. A greater tolerance toward individual persuasion
                    was shown not only by denominations whose church tenets stipulated opposition to war, but also by
                    those sects whose beliefs included a favorable attitude in regard to participation in armed
                    conflict. Whether their members accepted active military service, noncombatant status, work in the
                    civilian public service camps, or had taken the stand of the absolutist, the churches for the most
                    part continued to keep their names on the church books, and supported them as much as was possible.
                    This support was to be expected, for where else could the person with conscientious convictions look
                    for aid, if not among the religious bodies?</p>

            <p>Postmaster General Jesse Donaldson has announced a commemorative stamp to mark the 150th anniversary
                    of the establishment of the Indiana Territory. It will be a blue three-cent stamp, featuring
                    pictures of William Henry Harrison, the first territorial governor, and the first capital building.

            <p>Although William Henry Harrison was appointed governor on May 13, 1800, the government of the new
                    territory was inaugurated by the secretary, John Gibson, who apparently did not arrive until July
                    22, 1800. Six months later Harrison took up his duties. The Territorial Hall, a picture of which

            <p>As prospective emigrants considered their choices of destination, it was only logical for them to
                    pick those sites which seemed to offer the best opportunities for speedy development. The natural
                    corollary was that unfavorable regions were largely ignored by home seekers while land in more
                    promising locations was still available. Because they suffered by comparison, eleven counties in
                    northern Indiana were largely by-passed in the development of a transportation and communication
                    system, a condition which resulted in slower growth and development. In general they were not far
                    from an important road or canal, but more than proximity was needed for them to benefit from such
                    improvements to the fullest extent. Many of these counties were traversed by rail lines in the
                    fifties, but on the whole the latter did not exert a profound effect before 1860.</p>

            <p>Despite the fact that only 4,761 residents were in the county in 1850, settlers and their families
                    utilized the extensive range land to herd cattle in the fifties and sixties. Herds of three hundred
                    were considered the easiest to handle, and each contractor was paid ten to twelve and a half cents a
                    month per head. Within six months each animal gained an average of two hundred to two hundred and
                    fifty pounds, and herds were occasionally kept over the winter for a variable charge that depended
                    on the quality of forage and water supply.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

                    praised the rich soil on which every common crop could be grown, although five yoke of oxen were

                    general disregard for Sundays, thirteen individuals, many of whom had never before heard a
                    Presbyterian minister, formed Cory's first congregation. Ravages of fever the previous fall
                    and a courthouse planned for the following summer also provoked his comment.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
                    Throughout the year 1834, Cory regretted the intemperance, profanity, Sabbath-breaking, and gambling
                    which were the "crying sins" of the region. By fall bilious fevers and ague had
                    seriously interrupted religious activity at <placeName>

                    </placeName> and other settlements in the area, but he hoped the projected drainage of an extensive
                    mill pond would alleviate the situation. Coupled with his other problems, Cory feared the actions of
                    what he called a "Roman Catholic spy." As for civic affairs, he criticized the
                    courts of justice as exceedingly deficient but noted that anticipation for completion of the
                    courthouse ran high. About twenty other new buildings were soon to be erected.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

                    suspended over the winter of 1834-1835, and attendance at all religious events declined. Cory hoped
                    that by spring occupation of the new courthouse would provide a more central and comfortable place
                    of worship. Although he stated once that better citizens were replacing the irreligious element of

                    in the county were soon countered by arrangements to form neighborhood temperance societies in every

                    summer of 1834 or 1835, the treacherous expanse of wilderness north of the river confused two
                    companions who got lost in a prickly ash swamp and had to cover themselves with foliage for

                    heavy snows and freezing weather exacted a heavy toll of livestock from lack of forage. In March a
                    freezing rain that encased trees in ice further decreased the cattle's food supply.

                    through the letters of Samuel Widney, who later became a county judge. A long list of the books in

                    homes. While a great many dealt with religion, secular authors like Milton, Homer, and Vergil were
                    represented; in addition, he possessed tracts on geography, history, grammar, and surveying. In
                    November, 1838, Widney wrote that despite a labor shortage due to sickness, crops were generally
                    good: corn and potatoes sold for fifty cents a bushel and wheat for $1.25. Within two
                    years five sawmills and four grist mills had been built within fifteen miles, and his brother was
                    earning $1.50 a day at a sawmill about seven miles distant. Three state roads planned for

            <p>By the following March, despite a scarlet fever epidemic in the winter during which four or five
                    children died, religious activity was encouraging, although the Campbellites had become a source of
                    concern to Widney. A temperance society was strongly supported, and this early settler particularly
                    praised the Yankee element for its support of school activities. Four months later crop prospects
                    were considered good, but Widney blamed a slackening of religious zeal on "the cares and
                    troubles of beginning [life] in the woods."<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

            <p>Most of the large harvest in 1839 was destroyed by raccoons and squirrels, but Widney's
                    brother sold about one hundred bushels of wheat in the fall at eighty-seven cents a bushel. Widney
                    himself planned to have twenty acres under cultivation by the next spring, and had already built a
                    larger and more comfortable cabin. His first one was so near the river that every spring freshet
                    flooded it. In the spring of 1840 part of the town of Newville had been laid out on land belonging
                    to his brother.<hi rend="sup">45</hi>

                    where on one occasion fifteen found shelter. After the county was organized on January 14, 1837,
                    Park's cabin became the site of all county business. About thirty families in the area by
                    the winter of 1836-1837 made the usual complaints against poor roads, especially since they had to

                    numbered only 1,237. From 1850 to 1860 that total increased from 5,190 to 10,730.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having surveyed conditions in the eleven counties which were comparatively isolated from 1830 to
                    1860, at least three general conclusions appear tenable. Probably the most obvious is that pioneer
                    conditions persisted into the fifties largely because of handicaps from the absence of adequate
                    transportation facilities. None of these counties were served by any large navigable river; no
                    important state or national roads passed through them; and railroad lines were either not built to
                    serve them until late in the fifties, or there were no major stations within those counties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although communication systems thus bypassed these areas, some fared better than others
                    because of proximity to such facilities. As was indicated above, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Newton counties</region>
                    </placeName> were too far south of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> Road to be greatly affected by it. That handicap, not compensated for by any other
                    factor of equal importance, was reflected in the low population totals for the two counties as late
                    as 1860. Of the three isolated counties nearest the Michigan Road, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kosciusko</region>
                    </placeName> showed the greatest development between 1830 and 1860. This can be explained partly
                    because it was larger than surrounding units, but in general <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Kosciusko</region>
                    </placeName> represented the major exception to the serious consequences resulting from the lack of
                    transportation facilities. Starke and Pulaski, the other two counties near the Michigan Road, both
                    entered the sixties with low populations. The five isolated counties in the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName> area—<placeName>

                        <region type="county">Whitley</region>
                    </placeName>, entered the sixties with similar population totals. In part, however, De Kalb was
                    aided by a section of the <geogName>St. Joseph River</geogName> which flowed through it. On the
                    whole, all five benefited from the far greater development of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Allen County</region>
                    </placeName>, without contributing positive influences of their own. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">White County</region>
                    </placeName>, larger in area than both nearby Cass and Carroll, lagged behind them in every census
                    period from 1830 to 1860, again largely because it suffered from the absence of any major

                    transportation were slow in coming. Early settlements in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> and Newton counties, for example, were all in the southern part, as far as possible
                    from the Kankakee marshes. Moreover, the first railroad also passed through their extreme southern
                    sections. Similarly, as indicated above, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Starke County</region>
                    </placeName> was largely covered with Kankakee marsh lands. Numerous complaints against travel

            <p>The Julia L. Dumont Club, one of the oldest existing literary clubs in the state, if not the oldest,
                    was organized in 1886 by Mrs. Estelle Dufour Barker, granddaughter of Jean Daniel Dufour, one of the
                    French-Swiss brothers that founded <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1801. The very first literary association of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> was formed by Jean Daniel, so it was particularly fitting that his granddaughter should
                    continue to inspire culture, but the club he organized was for men only as at that benighted time
                    men were supposed to have a "corner on brains."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Barker was a woman of unusual intellect. Married to Captain Edwin Barker, an easterner, she
                    spent much of her married life near <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>, but returned to her girlhood home
                    in the early eighties, when her husband became head clerk on one of the large <geogName>Ohio
                    River</geogName> steamers. She bought a pioneer house, which, although not built by the Du-fours,
                    had been occupied through the years by several branches of that family. She remodeled the large
                    edifice, making it one of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s most attractive residences. And this was the birthplace of the Julia L.
                    Dumont Club.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Barker was a leader in religious, civic, literary and social affairs and an early music teacher
                    of the community. Cousin Estelle had a broad vision of the future when she gathered a few of her
                    daughter's friends together in October 1886, and organized the first woman's
                    literary society in this Congressional District of this literary state. There were only seven
                    charter members of which the writer, the youngest, a school girl, was included, by virtue of the
                    fact that I was always a bookworm and a close relative of Mrs. Barker who was interested that I
                    should grow up in a cultural atmosphere.</p>
            <p>While Mrs. Barker remained in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> her commodious home was the weekly meeting place. The large attic was furnished as a
                    banquet hall and was the scene of many gay as well as profitable evenings. There Mrs. Barker served
                    the famous Yankee dinner with baked clams, imported by special order from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>. New names were rapidly added to our nucleus, the dignity of a written constitution was
                    reached, and Mrs. Barker was formally elected president which office she <list type="footnotes">

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. At the instance of Sallie Northcott, long deceased, the motto, "Plus
                    Ultra," suggestive of an intangible hope, was adopted, and has been adhered to ever since,
                    and a bow of orange ribbon was chosen as the insignia. A name was cast about for, and in a spirit of
                    mirth, the mystic symbols, H. &amp; P.L.S., were fixed upon, the hidden significance of which
                    was Hen and Pullets Literary Society. Cousin Estelle, the only matron, was the hen, who had gathered
                    us pullets under her wing. This was our club secret; to divulge which might mean to be hanged
                    "from the battlements at sunrise." Our initiation ritual was to hand the new
                    member a paper with the name in full thereon, and the looks she cast about her were as blank as an
                    envelope without address. The state secret leaked out at the Clam banquet, April 19, 1889, a double
                    anniversary of Cousin Estelle's birthday and Paul Revere's ride, when Miss Em
                    Patton read an original versified history of our society, meant for the ears, only, of the
                    initiated. But the visitors who were present thought the joke too good to keep and proclaimed it
                    from the housetops. Accordingly we deemed it necessary in order to support our increased years and
                    dignity, to change our cradle name to the Woman's Study Club, which after some two decades,
                    was discarded as not being sufficiently specific. Our present title, honoring our famous pioneer
                    educator, Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, was given us by Grace Stepleton.</p>
            <p>For some months after Mrs. Barker and her daughter, Ella, a talented, witty, and beautiful woman,
                    returned to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>, we were as sheep without a shepherd, and fell into a state of suspended animation, but
                    in October, 1890, we reorganized in the home of the Misses Hall and elected Mrs. Jenny Van Pelt
                    president, which office she very acceptably filled, off and on, for several years. She invited us to
                    make her home our permanent headquarters, where every Friday night, from seven until ten, the
                    council fires were kindled, and we inhaled knowledge by the cubic inch.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Van Pelt was also a wonderful leader; a woman of unusual intellectual attainments, and
                    consummate tact. She had been a successful teacher before her marriage to a pioneer doctor. We
                    continued to frequent her hospitable home until she moved to <placeName>
                  <region type="county">Montgomery</region>, <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>She was succeeded in leadership by her sister-in–law, Mrs. Florence Fiske, who bought her
                    home, and invited us to continue <pb n="167" id="VAA4025-046-2-047"/> making it our regular
                    rendezvous. Mrs. Fiske was a witty, vivacious person. She had the first victrola in town, and
                    through it taught us to become classical-music conscious. A stickler for grammatical precision, she
                    made us more careful of our diction by insisting on the importance of the critic's report
                    as a part of our regular program.</p>
            <p>We began our literary studies with Longfellow, Holland, and Hawthorne. Hiawatha was our cradle song.
                    This was followed by Evangeline and Miles Standish, and then we enjoyed Bittersweet, Katrina, Marble
                    Faun, Scarlet Letter, and Brooke Farm. From this rather modest beginning we swung out to more
                    pretentious mental pabulum, and in our sixty-four years we have, so to speak, carried a convincing
                    candle around the whole sky line, and, with a few trifling exceptions, everything in the sky above,
                    the earth below and the waters underneath, has come under our scalpel. Hampered by the small size of
                    the world, we may soon weep, like Alexander, for more fields to conquer.</p>
            <p>In examining our file of programs, I am rather astonished, myself, to look back over the amazing
                    amount of study we did and I mean STUDY. In those beginning years most of us were yet unmarried, and
                    thus free from the responsiblities of motherhood and home making, could devote our intellectual
                    energies to the weekly meetings. When there were still no movies, radio, auto, or telephone, and no
                    other women's organizations except Ladies' Aid and Mite societies, there was
                    plenty of time to study assignments. I really believe I got more from this club than I did from my
                    college courses later. My professors at Indiana University praised our programs, and expressed
                    surprise that a small town could produce such evidence of culture.</p>
            <p>Before we had a town library we bought our own reference books, and when the public library was
                    organized, in 1915, we donated our collection of some sixty-four volumes, the first gift from an
                    organized body.</p>
            <p>In 1892-1893 we began to have printed programs. We've always had a strong leaning towards
                    history and literature, supplemented with mythology, art, science, civics, and music, and
                    we've rather stressed book reviews. Of recent years the systematic arrangement of subjects
                    has often shifted to miscellany and visual entertainment through films. For those who may be
                    interested, a complete list of our scope of study is appended.</p>
            <pb n="168" id="VAA4025-046-2-048"/>
            <p>We spent two winters studying Shakespeare by dramatic readings with occasional attempts at costuming.
                    One year we concentrated on <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">London</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                    York</region>

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and when afterwards it was my good fortune to visit those cities, the work of that
                    year bore fruit. The time spent on the history and literature of our own country made our journeys
                    more informative, and in my travels abroad the study of many foreign lands prepared me for more
                    enjoyment of what I saw. Art galleries were like meeting old friends I'd been introduced to
                    in the Club.</p>
            <p>When we studied <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, Professor C. R. Melcher, Head of the Language Department at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, lectured on that country where he had spent two years in preparation for his teaching.
                    At another time Mr. Ben Wal-denmaier, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, gave us an interesting description of a recent tour of <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Both gentlemen were native sons, connected with our club through their sisters, the
                    latter also through his wife.</p>
            <p>When we studied Holland, Miss Janet Schenck, of that country, gave us a charming address, attired in
                    native costume, wooden shoes, <hi rend="i">et al.</hi> The daughter of a civil engineer, whose
                    family accompanied him to all parts of the world, she had many vivid experiences to relate of the
                    "far away places with strange sounding names" where she had been. She was brought
                    to us by our member, Elizabeth Brochschlager, a teacher in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Another evening the writer contributed her "two cents worth" in
                    giving her impressions of the land of windmills and dikes.</p>
            <p>One of the two winters we studied South America. Mr. and Mrs. Hal Adkinson of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Orlando</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
               </placeName>, just returned from a comprehensive tour of that country, gave an
                    illustrated lecture, and displayed a wonderful collection of souvenirs. This was a large guest
                    evening at the Schenck mansion on the hill.</p>
            <p>When our year's topic was our Island Possessions, the Ad-kinsons, world travelers, fresh
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName>, again favored us and invited guests with a lecture and an exhibit of moving pictures
                    of that colorful land. Mr. Adkinson was a former citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Major Sam Woodfill, designated by General Pershing, as the One-man–army of World War I,
                    now a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was guest of honor at a patriotic evening at Mrs. Helen <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-046-2-049"/> Danglade's, and by request, addressed us and modestly showed
                    his some thirteen or fourteen medals, among which is the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Croix de
                    Guerre, the French legion of Honor decoration, etc., etc.</p>
            <p>Our first appearance before the footlights was early in our career, when we gave a burlesque
                    operetta, "A Dress Rehearsal". Later we presented Goldsmith's
                    "She Stoops to Conquer" before some sixty-five invited guests. The necessary male
                    roles in these first theatricals, were taken by our most daring members, but trousers were sternly
                    taboo. As time went on and some sweethearts and husbands were acquired they were shanghaied into
                    taking these parts. We reached our dramatic peak in the farcical comedy "Arabian
                    Nights". We were drilled by Dwight Smith, a native son and actor, then on vacation. The
                    very satisfactory box-office receipts (this was a public performance in the nearest approach to a
                    theater we had at that time) were due to the fact Mr. Smith was the star, but the rest of the
                    dramatis personae were assured that we shone with at least a little reflected glory. We have never
                    attempted anything so ambitious since but have put on one or two one-act plays for parlor
                    consumption, such as, "When Women Rule," "Who won the
                    Revolution?" etc. In studying "Hoosier School Master" we presented three
                    very clever monologues in which those taking part showed considerable histrionic talent.</p>
            <p>In our earlier years music held a very prominent place on our programs. Professor James Pleasants,
                    returned from several years of musical study in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, had as pupils several of our members, trained pianists, only one of whom remains, Mrs.
                    Hazel Hines. Professor Jimmy was very gracious about furnishing entertainment, but he, also, has
                    passed on. We had a number of vocalists in those days—Mesdames Van Pelt, Fiske, and
                    Misses Ella Barker, Isadora Kessler, Frederica Boernor, and Isabel Melcher (afterwards Mrs. Casad).
                    Later ones were Misses Fannie Shadday, Fannie Culbertson, Hannah Waldenmaier, Jennie Denmann, Mrs.
                    Leila Bledsoe, Mrs. Adelaide Griffith and Mrs. Lela Shadday. Only the two latter are still with us,
                    though Fannie Shadday is an associate member. A few of the girls played the mandolin and guitar.</p>
            <p>In the days when Mrs. Van Pelt was with us she inspired her friend, Miss Caby Froman of Ghent, just
                    across the river in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, to form a club in her town. It was at first called the H. &amp; P.L.S. Jr., but
                    later took the name of its <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-046-2-050"/> founder. It has been active all
                    these years and recently we held a couple of exchange meetings with it. From it sprang the Eggleston
                    Club of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in this way;—Mrs. A. J. Schenck came to our town as a bride, and being of
                    literary mind joined the Ghent organization, as it met in the afternoons, while our club has always
                    held night meetings, and Captain Schenck desired that his new wife spend her evenings with him. As
                    the river was sometimes a barrier, Mrs. Schenck decided to get together an afternoon association.
                    Originally composed of only married women, it gradually expanded to include their daughters and
                    other detached women.</p>
            <p>For some time we held joint annual meetings with the Egglestons—guest evenings with
                    printed programs of fine entertainment. For several years we had both state and district federation,
                    and during that time were awarded the merit flag for civic improvement for three years, and the
                    fourth time when we tied with the Egglestons, we conceded the honor to them as we'd won so
                    often.</p>
            <p>With that club we entertained the District Convention at which time Mrs. Lura Thiebaud, one of our
                    members, was District Chairman. But like the C.C.C. of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, we finally withdrew from both federations because it restricted our initiative in
                    program planning; we preferred to chart our own course.</p>
            <p>Our first attempt at civic improvement was made in conjunction with the Egglestons to get the pigs
                    and cows "put up." Almost every member of each club went before the Council to
                    plead that the liberty of these obstreperous but necessary creatures be properly restricted. We
                    might as well have been battering at the gates of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Rome</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and would not have been surprised if the tobacco spitting solons had called down the
                    fires of Jupiter to shrivel us up for our unbridled audacity in presuming to take a hand in affairs
                    that belonged to men. So, we trailed home like birds with broken wings, but we finally won out and
                    convinced the "city dads" that women's clubs were to be reckoned with,
                    and later prevented the removal of the iron fence around the courthouse lawn.</p>
            <p>With the Egglestons and P.T.A. we arranged a public exhibition of some hundred canvases from the
                    brush of state artists, one of which was the work of our member, Mrs. Nora Dupraz. We sponsored a
                    lecture course or two, contributed to the Chautauqua fund, donated yearly to welfare and health
                    drives, and to the support of a county nurse, and Christmas <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-046-2-051"/>
                    tree project. We gave one hundred fifty dollars to the Riley Hospital, and twenty-five dollars to
                    defense work in 1942. Our organization contributes annually from five to twenty-five dollars to each
                    Red Cross, T.B., Polio, Cancer, Salvation Army, and Heart Health drives etc. besides what we give
                    individually.</p>
            <p>For the last ten years we have awarded an annual five dollar prize to the member of the graduating
                    class of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> High School who has done the best work in both written and spoken English. We gave
                    fifty dollars for the stage curtain of the old gym and fifty dollars recently for blinds used when
                    films are shown. We helped by money and personal service in the project of furnishing food to
                    undernourished children during the depression. We have assisted in civic and patriotic efforts both
                    in peace and war. In an attempt to beautify Market Square we held Arbor Day ceremonies and planted
                    three trees in memory, respectively, of our founder, Mrs. Barker, our early dea ex machina, Mrs. Van
                    Pelt, and our famous, pioneer educator, for whom our organization is named, Mrs. Julia L. Dumont.</p>
            <p>During World War I, in support of food conservation, we refrained from serving the fabled
                    "delicious refreshments." We knitted, made scrapbooks, sent candy and letters to
                    our own boys; subscribed liberally to U.S.O., and collected money and supplies for war sufferers
                    abroad; joined the Red Cross where we rolled bandages etc. Several of our members have officiated as
                    head of the Red Cross where they did yeoman service, and one of them now holds that position. We
                    were the first club in the state to adopt a war orphan—a little French
                    girl—that we supported for three years and from whom we received grateful letters.
                    Together with other clubs we unveiled and dedicated the stone in the courthouse yard to the memory
                    of our county boys who never returned.</p>
            <p>During World War II one of our members was chairman of bond sales for the women's
                    organizations of the county and received state and federal commendation—congratulatory
                    telegrams from state and federal headquarters, and a certificate of Honor—because our
                    county was one of the first to "go over the top" in each drive—total
                    sales were more than five times our quota.</p>
            <p>We have been active in T.B. work, giving unselfish service, one of our members often being at the
                    head. In war time we had a chairman of defense. We have a chairman of Child Welfare, and assist in
                    linen sales for the blind.</p>
            <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-046-2-052"/>
            <p>Between the World Wars we built a Receiving Vault in our cemetery as at that time we did not yet have
                    our fine funeral home. This building of concrete blocks has a chapel and crypt, and art glass
                    windows. It was completed at a cost of thirty-five hundred dollars which would be about twice as
                    much or more now. This represents individual and united effort—teas, church suppers,
                    apron sales etc. There were generous donations from former members, residing in other places, and
                    from citizens in general. This was accomplished in three years, and June 22nd, 1924, the corner
                    stone was laid with appropriate formal ceremonies, and the building was presented to the county. In
                    recognition of our efforts Mr. James Crozier of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, gave a handsome border of candle pines to the cemetery.</p>
            <p>We have carefully observed our birthday every decade with special ceremonies, the most impressive
                    being our fiftieth and sixtieth, during which the writer, only surviving charter member, was made
                    president. Our Golden Anniversary, the Jubilee year, was opened by a Candle Light Pageant on New
                    Year's Eve at the Baptist church. This was followed by an Art Loan Exhibit at the home of
                    Mrs. Grace Copeland. The members brought out all their treasured heirlooms, which, when added to
                    those of the Copeland home, made the largest and most unique display ever assembled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was "for free" and was viewed by the Indiana Historical Society
                    then on Pilgrimage, as well as by our own and neighboring communities. Then there was the dinner at
                    the Swiss Inn when Melvin Lostutter, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName> editor, son of one of our charter members, as guest speaker, reviewed his novel, <hi rend="i">High Fever</hi> just off the press. Many besides the club and their husbands were in
                    attendance, and "a good time was had by all." This was followed by an open session
                    at the High School gym with Barton Reese Pogue and Frances Sellars as entertainers. The study year
                    closed with a banquet at the president's home, where toasts were given by past presidents
                    present, messages read from those who were non-residents, and tributes rendered to those deceased.
                    The secretary read the names of all who had ever been affiliated with the Club. The season of
                    planned events was climaxed by a summer garden party, when the Club, for the second time, posed for
                    its photograph. The first time we sat for our likeness was in the Barker parlors, our birthplace
                    when the photographer, a pilgrim and a stranger, reversing the usual procedure, "took us
                        <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-046-2-053"/> in." Even our calendars for the fiftieth year were
                    very special, with gold paper covers and a list of all past presidents and vice presidents.</p>
            <p>During our sixtieth anniversary we had many outstanding affairs, beginning with a
                    Presidents' night at the home of Mrs. Hazel Hines. Many past presidents were there and
                    responded to roll call with the high lights of their term of office. Greetings from former members,
                    scattered from the Atlantic to the Pacific were received. Mrs. Isabella Chittenden read the club
                    history which she had been appointed to give when one of the churches, recognizing the influence
                    clubs wielded, had invited several to present their history to the church audience. But the most
                    impressive occasion of this period was when we entertained some two hundred guests in the High
                    School Auditorium with speeches, toasts, and birthday cake with sixty candles.</p>
            <p>In our long career over the turnpike of letters we have sponsored a variety of entertainment. Among
                    the early gatherings the Egyptian evening at the Grisard home stands out. The back parlor was an
                    Egyptian scene; on one hand was the Temple of Apis, and on the other that of Bubastis, pylons and
                    all. Hieroglyphics, lotus, and scarabs were strongly in evidence, and the refreshments were
                    representative of the "flesh pots" of the land of the Nile.</p>
            <p>One meeting in which fun predominated was the famous cat trial, in which with all solemnity and due
                    course of law, Alice Yonge was condemned by judge and jury for chloroforming a superfluous pussy,
                    but when, using one of its nine lives, it was waiting, as good as new, on her doorstep, the next
                    morning, the judgment was reversed.</p>
            <p>Then there was the Hallowe'en ghost party of which Mrs. Jane Wright was hostess. Zombi
                    dances and ghoulish stories were the order of the evening. The Masque Party and Guess-Who sequel was
                    another program in lighter vein, as was also the one when Mrs. Fiske entertained some two hundred
                    guests at Metropolitan Hall with a program preceding Professor Quiz.</p>
            <p>The Mexican evening at Isabel Melcher's featured papers on our southern neighbors, and an
                    exhibit of Mexican curios, loaned by our travelers, concluding with a luncheon consisting of
                    tamales, chili con came, etc. The menus were decorated by our water color artists.</p>
            <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-046-2-054"/>
            <p>A meeting with Sara Hall as hostess had as guest speaker, a woman who had lived at an Indian post,
                    and there was a display of Indian arts and crafts—Navajo blankets, basketry, and Hopi
                    pottery, jewelry, etc. Our most recent exhibit was one of the many woven coverlets in our club. An
                    April Fool program at Mrs. Leo Protsman's was in a merry mood with shadow pictures and talk
                    on Shakespeare's Fools and others. With scrapbooks and program files before me I could go
                    on indefinitely for there were many other outstanding affairs.</p>
            <p>These experiences represent many enjoyable and profitable associations, meaning more to us than
                    perhaps we realize. Few of the Old Guard who have shared all these memorable occasions remain. Death
                    has rifled our roster of many of the "intellectual giants" of those days. Our
                    history would not be complete without some mention of the most outstanding not before referred to.
                    Miss Em Patton, our first vice president, inherited her Irish wit from her father, a major in the
                    Civil War, and a graduate of the University of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Dublin</settlement>
                    </placeName>. She could dash off clever verse and cariacature at a moment's notice. Miss
                    Bettie Carter who succeeded her, was educated in Catholic schools and was talented in music, art,
                    and literature. She was a daughter of a colonel in the Mexican war, with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> background. Both of these gifted members left to make their home in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. Miss Ella Parker wrote our club song and other verse, and was one of our early
                    vocalists, as was also Miss Isadora Kessler.</p>
            <p>Miss Hannah Waldenmaier was most versatile; she decorated our invitations, menus, favors, etc. with
                    dainty water color sketches, and original verse; played the guitar and mandolin; furnished original
                    ideas; and was always the "life of the party." She was treasurer of the Vault
                    fund, and her efficiency is recalled with admiration. The vocal duets which she and her inseparable
                    friend, Miss Jennie Demann (more retiring but solidly competent) furnished, are remembered with
                    pleasure. Although Miss Hannah, a primary teacher, used two crutches, that could not cramp her
                    style. She was quite a traveler and on a trip abroad with Miss Jennie and her father, she made her
                    way from <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> alone.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Lou Protsman Waltz, and her cousin, Miss Lou Grisard (who survives, and lives in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName>) skilled pianists, were affectionately called our "Twolous." They
                    entertained <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-046-2-055"/> us with classical music. Mrs. Isabel Melcher Casad,
                    who, although a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> for some years, retained her membership till her death, delighted us with her gay
                    repartee and lovely soprano solos. Miss Frederica Boernor, our fourth president, who had an
                    excellent alto, carried on the work of the weather bureau at a time when it was almost considered
                    white magic. Miss Grace Stepleton, popular and gifted high school teacher, was queenly and
                    statesmanlike. Miss Mary E. Hall, expert businesswoman, widely popular and intensely reliable, and
                    her sister Mrs. Adah Rabb furnished gaiety to all occasions. Others who contributed were Mrs. Nora
                    Dupraz with her photographic memory, ready pen, witty expressions, and artistic ability; Miss
                    Frances Culbert-son, popular and able high school instructor, with golden voice and gracious
                    personality; Mrs. Corda Wiseman, whose sprightly wit enlivened our meetings; Miss Alice Yonge,
                    saintly but merry hearted; and Miss Laura Lamson, gentle and self-effacing, serving the public as a
                    teacher and Head of Red Cross, etc., and others. They have been going down the valley very rapidly
                    in the last few years. Our most recent loss was Mrs. Effa M. Danner in August, 1949. One of our most
                    valuable and distinguished members, she had attained wide recognition as local historian and
                    genealogist. Her article on Edward Eggleston in <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>
                    brought her a letter of commendation from Meredith Nicholson, then our representative in South
                    America. She was made a member of the National Society of Genealogy in 1942 and a Fellow of the
                    Institute of American Genealogy. She was a D.A.R. with several bars, member of the Indiana
                    Historical Society, and charter member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society of which she was the first president, and held the office for twelve
                    or thirteen years. When she resigned, she was made historian for the remainder of her life. Our
                    study of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName> for the last two years has been based largely on her research work. She also wrote
                    poems. Few of the early members remain. Outstanding among them are Miss Sara Hall, retired teacher,
                    so familiar with club routine that her advice is deferred to, and she is regarded as the Thomas
                    Jefferson of the organization; Miss Ella Waldo, relied on for scholarly book reviews; Mrs. Nell
                    Waldenmaier, although long a resident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName> is still claimed as one of us. She is a recognized genealogist and <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-046-2-056"/> compiler of several books along that line. Mrs. Mary Van Pelt Waldo,
                    our clever versifier, who occasionally sends, from her <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> home, rhymed history of our early meetings; Miss Annette Danglade, who has a flair for
                    antiques and local history; and Mrs. Kate Benedict, one of our most faithful attendants, are being
                    rapidly pushed up our chronologically arranged roster to the status of the Old Guard to fill
                    vacancies left by those who have joined the Upper Circle.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to mention all who should be spoken of. As this is chiefly ancient history there has
                    been only indirect allusion to the vigorous and able younger women now taking over and carrying on
                    the torch lighted so long ago.</p>
            <p>Our members are teachers, retired and otherwise, businesswomen, civic workers, mothers, homemakers,
                    musicians, artists, an editor, writers of both prose and poetry, contributors to newspapers and
                    magazines, and authors of a couple of books. We have representation in "Women of
                    Indiana," in both Eugene Field and Mark Twain honorary societies, and in the
                    Poets' Corner, Inc., a state affair where we have won several first prizes. All but a few
                    are members of the Eastern Star and several belong to the D.A.R. One or two have served on
                    committees of the Indiana Historical Society and contributed articles to the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi>. All the officers, but one, of the county historical society belong to
                    the Julia L. Dumont Club of which it is largely composed. At least three are members of Delta Kappa
                    Gamma. The Penholders, a creative writing group, consists chiefly of our members. We are represented
                    on the local library board and staff, in the Tri Kappa, athletic and home economic clubs. The
                    president of the latter is one of us. Very few have not traveled extensively and one or two might be
                    considered world travelers. More and more are becoming college graduates, all are keenly alert to
                    self improvement. We have been called on to serve on local and federal juries and election boards.
                    All denominations are represented, but the Baptists predominate. The pioneer woman physician, Dr.
                    Hannah C. Rous, was a wonderfully important member until her death.</p>

            <p>Our membership is limited to thirty-six. We have seven associate members, and two non-residents. Our
                    meetings are fortnightly from October until May. The club flower is a chrysanthemum, and the club
                    color orange. Officers are chosen for one year and cannot succeed themselves without an intervening
                    year. Our present officers are: President, Miss Gertrude Wahl; Vice-president, Miss Julie Le Clerc
                    Knox; Recording Secretary, Mrs. Lovina Bakes; Corresponding Secretary, Mrs. Lela Shadday; Treasurer,
                    Mrs. Olive Du-four Trafelet; and Keeper of Records, Mrs. Blanche Ricketts. Although basically a
                    cultural organization, we have tried to do our part in civic and patriotic endeavor.</p>
            <p>In conclusion may we say, without being accused of "Russianizing" that we look back
                    on the cultural and civic growth of our community with some satisfaction, and in "our
                    artless Japanese way," claim of it that we've "had a great
                    part?"</p>

            <p>In the winter of 1840-1841, thirty-three women of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe County</region>
                    </placeName> joined together in the organization of a club which met weekly so that the members
                    might ponder the argumentative questions of the day. The original minute book is in the archives of
                    Indiana University. The final entry is dated June 14, 1844.</p>
            <p>The organization adopted a constitution and by-laws and carried on its business under the rules of
                    order as they existed in the early nineteenth century. In the words of the first president, Mrs. M.
                    E. Hughs (Hughes), similar organizations had been limited to the "other sex." At
                    least three such organizations for men had existed in Indiana Seminary; Henodelphisterian, prior to
                    1828; Athenian, 1830; and Philo-mathean, 1831.</p>
            <p>At their meeting on January 22,1841, the women adopted the name "Edgeworthalean" in
                    honor of Maria Edgeworth, English author, whose works had been issued in many editions. She had been
                    born in 1767 and died eight years after the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> club was organized.</p>
            <p>The Minerva club, which was organized on September 20, 1859, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, has long claimed to be the first women's club in America to have a
                    written constitution and by-laws. Miss Constance Owen Fauntleroy and eleven other women were the
                    charter members of Minerva. As with the Edgeworthalean Society, the constitution and by-laws of the
                    Minerva Society have been preserved.</p>
            <p>Many of the activities of the Edgeworthalean Society were similar to those of the Athenian and
                    Philomathean societies. The men met on Friday evenings; so did the Edge-worthaleans. The officers

                            attention was called to the Minute Book in the Archives by Mrs. Mary B. Craig, Archivist in
                            the office of President Herman B Wells. Dr. William Lowe Bryan, president emeritus of
                            Indiana University, could not add additional material toward the identification of the
                            members of the Society.</item>

                    being unprepared to take part in the programs of the clubs were alike.</p>
            <p>Numbered among the Edgeworthalean members were young ladies and women from the <placeName>

            <p>Once the Constitution and By-Laws had been set down in the Minute Book the record of the meetings of
                    the Society start abruptly with Friday, January 8, 1841. There had evidently been an earlier meeting
                    for the unidentified secretary notes "the society met pursuant to adjournment, Miss H. not
                    being present, Mrs. Hughs was called to preside protein. The composition class performed with credit
                    to its members and the criticism was both appropriate and encouraging. The meeting then adjourned to
                    meet the following Friday afternoon."</p>
            <p>Miss L. Hughs was again absent on January 15. Mrs. M. E. Hughs (Hughes) was elected president
                    unanimously. The secretary noted the fact and said "it is expected she will deliver an
                    inaugural address accordingly. The several classes performed their duties with much credit to
                    themselves and to the young ladies of the county. It is to be hoped that the embarrassment which is
                    still consequent on our exercises may soon be done away or exchanged for that modest freedom which
                    is necessary to the proper criticism of all the exercises and to the right improvement of the
                    members."</p>
            <p>A week later the inaugural address was given. It set the tone of the work of the Edgeworthaleans and
                    emphasized the pioneer character of the Society. Mrs. Hughs said: <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-046-2-064"/>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="center">Address</p>
                        <p>Ladies, Fellow-members of the Edgeworthalean Society,</p>
                        <p>I appear before you on the present occasion with mingled feelings of gratitude for the honor
                            which you have been pleased to confer upon me, and a conviction of my own inability to
                            discharge properly the duties assigned me. For the confidence manifested in electing me to
                            preside over your meetings, you will please accept my <hi rend="i">accept my</hi> sincere
                            thanks. Permit me likewise to bespeak what I shall certainly need— your kind
                            indulgence towards the many errors which must necessarily grow out of my entire ignorance of
                            the rules and regulations pertaining to the office.</p>
                        <p>Although societies similar <hi rend="i">to character</hi> to the one which we are now engaged
                            in forming have long existed in places not very distant, yet, in our own immediate community
                            they have hitherto been confined exclusively to the other sex. As we may therefore be
                            considered in some degree <hi rend="i">innavators</hi> in the established order of things it
                            may be necessary and proper to state our intentions in forming this <hi rend="i">organsociation.</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>Our object is the cultivation and improvement of the mind; and to effect this we have adopted
                            such exercises and regulations as other socities of the same nature have found most
                            conducive to the same end.</p>
                        <p>In the progress of society the belief has been gradually gaining ground that the station
                            assigned to women in the social scheme is one of much greater importance than it has
                            hitherto been considered and that her position in the various relations of daughter wife
                            mother mistress of a family and the acknowledged arbitress of the rules which regulate
                            social intercourse, gives her an influence which may be powerfully wielded either for good
                            or for evil. To enable her therefore to fulfil her destiny with credit and happiness to
                            herself, advantage to others philanthropists now deem it necessary to give her the aids of a
                            solid and useful education. We gather from history that in the earlier ages of the world
                            when all else was made to yield to physical superiority, the lot of woman was hard and her
                            state degraded: she was esteemed suffciently honoured in being made the household drudge and
                            slave of man. At a later period when the wild and romantic spirit of chivalry pervaded
                            nearly all the nations of the Earth, the caprice of her masters wrought an astonishing
                            change in her condition, and she found herself elevated to the rank of an earthly divinity
                            — a godess worthy the adoration of the other sex: since that time the benign
                            influence of Christianity has been silently working out yet another [illegible] in her
                            destiny; and it has now grown quite customary to view her as a rational being, intended by
                            her Creator to perform a useful and respectable part, and endowed by Him with the faculties
                            necessary to enable her to fulfil the end of her being. The two former theories however are
                            not entirely exploded and while some contend sturdily for the puppet system, others are to
                            be found, who would fain set her down in their list of chattels. But to return to the
                            subject more immediately before us.</p>
                        <p>When discussing the propriety of our present undertakings it has been objected by many that a
                            part at least of the exercises customary in such societies was too masculine to be proper
                            for females and was <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-046-2-065"/> calculated to dim the lustre of
                            that modest reserve which is justly considered the <hi rend="i">sexes</hi> best ornament</p>
                        <p>However much I may prize the jewel in question or respect the honest prejudices of those who
                            think thus, I do not participate in their fears as to the result as this would to me wear
                            the appearance of making a woman's modesty, and propriety of deportment dependent
                            on her ignorance for their preservation. There may indeed be a false modesty which is placed
                            in the above predicament; and perhaps the true and false (like the sublime &amp; the
                            ridiculous) may be but a single step assunder, but if it be so, is it not an additional
                            reason for strengthening all her powers of mind, that she may the more readily discriminate
                            between the two?</p>
                        <p>With the notice of one more objection, I will now conclude. It is agreed by many that mental
                            culture unfits a woman for the performance of these domestic employments which make a part
                            of her daily duties. That this pursuit like every thing good under the sun, may be abused
                            perverted cannot be denied; but surely when properly directed it has no such tendency and I
                            trust I do not misrepresent the sentiments of my fellowmembers when I assert that we
                            advocate it because we believe it to be eminently calculated to strengthen and perfect the
                            sex in the discharge of their duties, thereby rendering home the seat of happiness.</p>

            <p>On January 29, the first subject for debate was raised: "Is there more pleasure in pursuit
                    or in possession?" Two weeks later a special assignment was given to Mrs. Barnes and Miss
                    Howe to write a dialogue, if possible. And, on February 26, the members agreed on a method whereby

                    Debating. A week later the debate subject was: "Is wealth productive generally of the most
                    happiness or misery to mankind?" When the decision was made on March 12 it was agreed that
                    wealth had brought more misery than happiness. That decision having been made, the Society buckled
                    down to the question: "Is it important that ladies study the dead languages?" The
                    secretary never did record the answer.</p>
            <p>On May 21 the Society discussed "whether Observation or Reading most improved the
                    Mind" and agreed that Observation was most important. It then turned to another question:
                    "Which is the Most Important, Male or Female Education?" On the 28th, when the
                    arguments were given the club voted that, for strength of argument, Male Education won but that, on
                    the merits of the case, Female Education was overwhelmingly important.</p>
            <p>June 4 came and J.F. Hughs was "unpunctual" but on <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-046-2-066"/> roll call she gave a sufficient reason and was excused. Miss V. Buskirk
                    was not prepared for her part in the program and was fined. <placeName>

            <p>Mrs. M. W. Barnes became president on June 11, 1842. Her address was long and included the suggestion
                    that Phrenology might hold the solution of the superiority of the male or female brain. She
                        said:<quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="left">Ladies of the Edgeworthalian Society:</p>
                        <p>Accept my thanks for the implied preference which has chosen me to preside at your meetings
                            and let me hope that to the brief address which (in compliance with our established
                            regulations) I offer you — you will extend your indulgence, attributing its
                            defects, or insipidity, not to any want of interest in the subject which would seem
                            appropriate for the occasion but to inability perhaps to treat them as I would wish; and
                            indeed to entire ignorance as to the usual mode adopted and considered proper in similar
                            cases; — the field for discussion (however) must necessarily be extensive; nor
                            can the subject be deficient in number or barren in interest if even limited to those
                            connected with or arising from our immediate situation as a society, yet in its infancy:
                            — But which has for its great object and aim the intellectual culture and
                            improvement of our sex. And if (as we believe) institutions of a like nature have heretofore
                            been found profitable in the many instances where they have been established for the benefit
                            of the other sex— as well as in the more limited trials that have been given by
                            our own — have we not every reason to expect that (with due perseverance and
                            energy) results equally happy will crown our exertions (in a cause which must strike each
                            one of us as being the most desirable of any that could possibly claim our attention)
                            — nor need we, I think— fear that at any future period of life we
                            shall be disposed to regret or deem misapplied whatever portion of time or thought we now
                            withdraw from our other occupations and devote in the manner here prescribed;—
                            and indeed does not our actual experience even thusfar go to favor such a belief? For to
                            most of us (I must think) our mutual relations and exercises have already been productive of
                            much pleasure — with regard to myself I confess so far has the experiment
                            exceeded my expectations that it would now be with great regret I should be compelled to
                            forego its advantages — nor should we, I think, feel discouraged that our numbers
                            are not greatly augmented;— prospects being decidedly more favorable with a few
                                <hi rend="i">eneregetic</hi> spirits than if our number were greater and the interest
                            more languidly sustained.</p>
                        <p>Most happily for women that dark season in the world's history which deemed her <hi rend="i">incable</hi> of <hi rend="i">sustaing</hi> the general character of a rational
                            being, well as the more confined one of her own peculiar sphere — is rapidly
                            passing away — and she is now called upon to come forward and herself assist in
                            the great work of emancipating the spirit from <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-046-2-067"/> the
                            thraldon and degration in which the ignorance of past ages have held her bound —
                            for though the sentiment which prevailed some years since of the inferiority of females
                            intellect seems exploded in this age of universal refinement and a woman of cultivated
                            understanding is no longer a <hi rend="i">phaenomina</hi> though the portals of science are
                            thrown open even to her and the paths of knowledge rendered accessable — what
                            matters it if she herself is not actuated by the proper spirit! — is not alive
                            and on the alert to seize and appropriate the rich and invented advantages that are now
                            offered to her acceptance for that we <hi rend="i">have</hi> good advantages compared to the
                            females of the olden time imperfect and mechanical as it is even yet our system of education
                            all must admit and that also the superiority of the modern to the ancient civilized world is
                            in a marked manner displayed in this particular for though we do hear of one or two gifted

                            consigned to the distaff, — and scarcely thought of in connexion with any more
                            elevated employment — but opinion is now more than ever in favor of the <hi rend="i">general</hi> diffusion of knowledge— and it is only to be expected
                            that women must profit by this enlargement of feeling — men of learning have
                            stooped from the elevations of science to accelerate her improvement — they now
                            abridge, complete, explain for her assistance and advancement in literature —
                            Shall we then be less active or shall we not rather gratefully unite our efforts with theirs
                            for the promotion of an object so desirable to each one of us and to our sex generally?
                            — convinced as we are that the cultivation of the mind ever opens exhaust-less
                            sources of amusement and delight of which the ignorant can form no estimate and in woman
                            equally with man is the beneficial effect of a proper system of culture made manifest
                            rendering her superior in all respects from being accustomed to think and be discriminate
                            her opinion is no longer a mere momentary impulse, her sphere is enlarged and she is as much
                            actuated by selfish motives or so likely to receive critical and consequently errorneous
                            impressions— she is generally more correct in her own sentiments and liberal to
                            those of others for tis mediocrity or ignorance that is intolerant and <hi rend="i">opionative</hi> but that knowledge is a treasure most heartily to be desired by all and
                            equally proper for all,— few now will question nor does the belief entertained by
                            some (that of this possession men are more tenacious than of any other and less willing to
                            share it with us) seems altogether probable — may it not rather be that in many
                            instances females are but superficially taught and when satisfied with that imperfect
                            teaching do sometimes make it the plea for undue assumption from which real information
                            would shrink— and there are, too, instances of female pretenders in learning who
                            seem to think it absolutely necessary to remove as far as possible from feminine grace, in
                            order to approach manly vigor of intellect; we cannot in such cases wonder that men should
                            prefer proficient to <hi rend="i">smatters</hi> in science— yet, there is no
                            reason why female acquirements should be identified with such folly or as is sometimes the
                            case with slovenly attire, an ill arranged table or an ill conducted household —
                            on the contrary the tendency of real knowledge is to make her sensible as well as humble
                            — nor will accomplishments <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-046-2-068"/> in any degree
                            indispose her for active domestic duties, "order is the <hi rend="i">sympton</hi>
                            of a well regulated mind and she who has felt the importance of interior arrangement will
                            scarcely be indifferent to a well directed household and if <hi rend="i">experience</hi> has
                            ever seemed to militate against this opinion it must proceed from constitutional defect
                            which mental discipline may have in some degree amended but which it has not been <hi rend="i">wholy</hi> able to correct" — is it then natural that man,
                            when superior himself, should wish to encounter even in a female companion the
                            contractedness of ignorance or inaptitude of folly— would he not rather wish to
                            meet in the domestic circle a friend who could sympathise if not participate in his higher
                            pursuits— who could appreciate literary excellence and taste intellectual
                            pleasures — to whom knowledge had given elevation and refinement? Let us then
                            bear in mind that it rests in a great degree with ourselves— whether we sink
                            again in the social scale —maintain merely our present position or rise still
                            higher, to be indeed the fit companion for man — his equal and his friend! that
                            such a state of things is practicable as well as desirable, I must believe until at least it
                            shall be proven by fair opportunities of trial— by Phrenology or other
                            incontrovertable evidence that our minds are actually incapable of the high degree of
                            attainment which constitutes the glory of man— but, if (as I must believe) we <hi rend="i">are</hi> equally endowed by nature how can we, nay how dare we, suppose the
                            divine attribute of intellect yielded us but to remain inactive or unemployed indeed I must
                            think there is more than mere matter of pleasure or inclination involved in this question
                            for should we not rather consider it an imperative duty to exercise and encourage whatever
                            portion of talent we may possess; if nothing was made in vain, surely this richest, <hi rend="i">choisest</hi> gift of God to man, was not designed to remain idle or
                            unappreciated; — then though many of our necessary occupations may seem in
                            compatible with mental culture let us be the more careful to devote even a portion of what
                            we are wont to misterm our spare moments to some profitable attainment and we shall be
                            astonished at the close of a year at the advantage we may derive from even the small payment
                            of time that otherwise would have been but useless blanks in each days history—
                            We may doubtless affect much in this way if we will but apply ourselves diligently to the
                            task — much too independent of the information gained at school where (even under
                            the most favorable circumstances) the whole business of obtaining an education (as it is
                            termed) is confined to a few brief years of perhaps the most thoughtless portion of life
                            — instead of constituting (as it should) and often does with men a part, at
                            least, of the daily work of a lifetime, for it is most generally after that season has gone
                            by that we learn to think (if we ever do) to apply the facts with which the mind may then
                            have been stored and which will but lie upon the memory as in the books from which they were
                            taken unless by the exercise of our own understanding we make them our own— it is
                            then by self directed study and reflection principally that we must prove what we have heard
                            and read extract from what we have learned from others all its <hi rend="i">nutrecious</hi>
                            juice, strengthen and enrich the soil of our own intellect which unless the reasoning
                            faculties are properly exercised, can no more be effected than can a limb or <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-046-2-069"/> muscle be strong or vigerous without a constant and healthy
                            application of it, to its use— Neither must we forget that there is nothing truly
                            valuable to be obtained without some pain or exertion — then surely with us the
                            sacrifice of a little present comfort might well be endured, for the sake of the rich reward
                            that must undoubtedly follow; and the young lady who would not shriek from an occasional
                            vigil in her untiring search mid learning's treasured hordes though she might peril
                            the blooming freshness of her cheek would be more than compensated by the additional lustre
                            and beauty thrown around her life and character.</p>
                        <p>It is to be regretted that the good sense and industry of the women of former days is not <hi rend="i">oftner</hi> imitated in this particular for (though literature) was indeed a
                            rare accomplishment among them (as they had great difficulties to encounter) yet, when they
                            did attempt it they were satisfied with no ordinary proficiency
                            —‘Parnassus itself was a craggy rock but the muses dwell upon its
                            top."</p>
                        <p>It has been remarked that many a bright and shining talent may lie hid in a napkin for very
                            want of activity to unfold it — and I must think it impossible to be greatly
                            under the influence of indolence, when actually unaware of the fact, in ourselves, this,
                            then is one among the many reasons that render it desirable to form and encourage a society
                            such as we now constitute for (unless there is some portion of him set apart and devoted
                            exclusively to intellectual improvement) we are too likely to neglect it
                            altogether— still quieting conscience and the spirits yearnings for light with
                            the assurance that we cannot possibly do otherwise;— tis not indeed unusual to
                            hear persons habitually complain of the want of time, ever in a hurry, and so perplexed with
                            business as to be unable to enjoy themselves or the society of a friend — when
                            with these very persons an habitual diligence and methodical arrangement would so dispose
                            the affairs of life that none would be found to intrude upon another; see (for instance the
                            dispatch with which some in public stations manage a multiplicity of the most important
                            concerns) to contemplate them we would almost conclude nothing (<hi rend="i">is</hi>) too
                            extensive for the human mind to compass yet diligence and methods are the charms that effect
                            it all: — let us then check every intimation which may occasionally urge that we
                            have no time to attend to the duties prescribed by our institution.—I will not
                            believe as some have predicted that we are destined to be shortlived and <hi rend="i">proffitless</hi> in our career — some opposition we have had (and where too
                            we might have expected more liberal and enlightened views) — yet such will affect
                            us but little if we but maintain the proper spirit within ourselves —
                            remembering— that those who too easily influenced by every adviser or intimidated
                            at the appearance of difficulty must necessarily be desultory and unsettled and effect
                            nothing of consequence because unable to persevere in any undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Let us then not doubt that we shall— as the name we have chosen
                            indicates— continue to prosper in this undertaking that, as we progress in years,
                            and increase in numbers, we shall be more and more convinced of the substantial benefits

            <p>As the summer moved along June 18 found the members debating the wisdom of mature years as against
                    the happiness peculiar to youth. Again there was a split decision. The members liked the arguments
                    for Wisdom but they chose Happiness. From that the Society a week later considered whether a
                    murderer or a slanderer exerted the most pernicious influence. Those who argued for the murderer
                    won. On July 2 the question of manual labor was debated—whether it was a curse or a
                    blessing. It turned out to be a curse; as far as debating ability went. A foretaste of many another
                    argument these hundred years was given on July 9 when the Society discussed who had the greatest
                    reason to complain of their treatment: the Whites, the Indians or the Negroes. "The debate
                    was carried on with spirit and is now one of the most pleasant and useful exercises of the
                    Society," noted the secretary. The Edgeworthaleans decided for the Negro.</p>
            <p>During the remainder of 1841 the Society met regularly and received acclaim for its work from the
                    secretary. The questions for debate continued to hold the interest of the members. They were:</p>
            <p>July 15. Which profession affords the best opportunities to benefit mankind—Law or Physic?
                    Law won. (The defender of Physic failed to attend.)</p>
            <p>July 22. Which has caused the most bloodshed— Love or Anger? Love won. (Miss May
                    — to speak for Anger, failed to attend. She was fined 6<hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">4</hi> cts.)</p>
            <p>July 30. Is a young person of the lower ranks happier with a good education and a well informed mind
                    or with an education just equal to those around him? The decision went to the debaters favoring
                    equal education but all members agreed they would prefer a superior education.</p>
            <p>August 6. Is Conscience an inate principle? It is.</p>
            <p>August 13. Which is the greatest crime, slandering or stealing? Slandering.</p>
            <p>August 20. Which would be the most conducive to our happiness, to be at once created with all the
                    knowledge to be acquired or to obtain it by slow degree? The question was not answered. Neither of
                    the debaters was present.</p>
            <pb n="191" id="VAA4025-046-2-071"/>
            <p>August 27. Did Napoleon exert a good or evil influence over Europe? The vote of the Society decided
                    that the argument was strongest against Napoleon but the president held that the good he had done in
                    Europe outweighed the evil.</p>
            <p>September 3. Which was the most blameworthy in the original transgression, Adam or Eve? The president
                    held for Eve and the Society voted that "Adam was less guilty."</p>
            <p>September 11. Which is the most honorable passion, Ambition or Love? As argued, Love.</p>
            <p>September 18. Is there more happiness found in the married or single state? And the vote of the
                    Society was for the single state!</p>
            <p>September 25. Should novels be abolished? A positive "No" was registered.</p>
            <p>By mutual agreement there were no meetings until November 12 when it was decided that parties were
                    not injurious to society.</p>
            <p>November 19. Should capital punishment be inflicted or not? The Society thought it should be
                    abolished.</p>
            <p>November 26. Is happiness more dependent on the mind or on surroundings? The mind won.</p>
            <p>December 3. Was Elizabeth justified in her conduct toward Mary Queen of Scots? That question of
                    British history was never answered — the secretary copied the minutes of a week before
                    and repeated that those in favor of "the mind" won.</p>
            <p>December 10. None of the officers came to the meeting. The few members present adjourned.</p>
            <p>December 17. A similar situation developed.</p>
            <p>December 24. Is there such a thing as disinterested benevolence? The date being Christmas Eve, the
                    vote was unanimous in favor of disinterested benevolence.</p>
            <p>On January 9, 1842, the secretary wrote: "It was proposed during a meeting of the Society, a
                    few weeks previous to the Anniversary of the Edgeworthalean Society that Judge McDowall should be
                    requested or invited to deliver an address on that occasion— it was unanimously agreed
                    to— and "Mrs. Barnes, L. Howe &amp; M. Maxwell were appointed a committee to
                    inform the gentleman of the arrangement—and obtain his answer."</p>
            <p>‘The invitation was accepted and at the appointed time, New Year's Evening, 2
                    o'clock, an appropriate and very <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-046-2-072"/> beautiful address was
                    made—claiming our highest admiration and entire satisfaction. On the evening of the same
                    day, the members of the Edgeworthalean society together with the young Ladies of the Academy, and as
                    a further celebration of the anniversary, adjourned to the Seminary, where they had previously
                    prepared and arranged an abundant repast.</p>
            <p>‘Each individual had the liberty of inviting a certain number of their friends and when
                    all were assembled there were upwards of a hundred and twenty persons. The evening was pleasant and
                    passed off to the general satisfaction of both entertained and entertainers.</p>
            <p>‘There were some small expenses, for <hi rend="i">spermaceta</hi> candles &amp;
                    &amp; that were defrayed by the funds of the Society; everything else necessary for the occasion
                    was contributed by the different individuals."</p>
            <p>A week after the party, on January 6, 1842, death took Mrs. Hughs, the first president, from the
                    ranks of the Society. Suitable resolutions were drawn at a special meeting on January 8 including
                    "That we truly sympathize with her afflicted family especially with her youthful daughter
                    who was formerly a member of our Association and whom we would earnestly commend to the
                    ‘Father of the Fatherless’ trusting that she may inherit the virtues of her
                    deceased parent, And, That in token of our regret at this irreparable loss we wear a badge of
                    mourning for 20 days, And, That a copy of this resolution be presented to the family and also that
                    they be published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Post."</p>
            <p>Mrs. M.L. Hinkson became president on January 28, 1842. She found "the star of women
                    rising" and hurled defiance at those who would injure her cause. In her inaugural address
                    she said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="left">Ladies</p>
                        <p>It is with fear and trembling I enter upon the duties you have assigned me; knowing that much
                            depends on the President to excite and maintain an interest in the exercises But your united
                            zeal for the prosperity and permanance of this institution, I trust will amply compensate
                            for deficiency and inability on my part. Associated together for the laudable purpose of
                            training the higher faculties of our nature in accordance with the laws of science and art
                            — of striking out thought by the <hi rend="i">colision</hi> of intellect, of
                            strengthening <hi rend="i">memery</hi>, invigorating mind and facilitating the acquisition
                            of knowledge, we have much to hope and but little to fear. The short period of our existence
                            as a body has not passed without many advantages. Every member, no doubt, is <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-046-2-073"/> already sensible of having received much benefit. In the brief
                            space of a year, a name, a character is established of which you may well feel proud; and I
                            trust that you will sufficiently appreciate the responsibilities resting upon you to sustain
                            and increase your present reputation by unremitting industry. True the society has met with
                            some disappointment— the collection of a library has not commenced, but then
                            access to <placeName>
                                <region type="county">the County</region>
                            </placeName> &amp; other libraries is so easy that but little anxiety need be felt on
                            that account. One seat has been vacated in our little assembly which will long remain a <hi rend="i">memento mori</hi>: and should also remind us of the zeal and punctuality of the
                            highly prized member whose loss we deplore.</p>
                        <p>Fairly equiped and started on an expedition to the promised land of improvement with every
                            necessary advantage, there is no looking back to the smooth plains of indolence without
                            bringing contempt upon the Society and upon the sex, so far as its influence extends; and
                            that extends much farther on accoutn of such societies still being rare. Indefatigable
                            &amp; energetic exertions are, therefore, imperiously required. Not only would a failure
                            bring obloquy and sarcasm on the <hi rend="i">abandoners</hi> of so noble a cause, but
                            rising genius would be damped— woman's energies suppressed—
                            the friends of humankind disappointed — and the narrow minded envious part of
                            (the) community would feel gratified that their croakings of woman's lack of
                            perseverance were no nearly confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Under the favorable auspices of the present age, if woman fail to improve the increasing
                            means, which the Arts and Sciences present, and which the wise and generous of the opposite
                            sex so nobly accord she tacitly acknowledes her indolence and proves her unfitness for
                            anything but the blind worship, abuse and scorn of him <hi rend="i">whome</hi> she should
                            sedulously emulate. But this cannot be her destiny. The star of woman is rising, and though
                            its beams have hitherto only glittered on our intellectual mountains, yet a ray has reached
                            the Edgeworthalean phalanx to illume its onward upward march. Then let its members beware
                            how they yield to the impulse of sloath and the suggestions of contracted minds lest they
                            fall behind the rapid strides of female improvement in various parts of the world.
                            Persevere. Be among the pioneers into woman's future sphere. The real
                            philanthropist is looking to such women and such institutions to prove to the world that
                            woman <hi rend="i">will</hi> become what he has asserted she can — the reasoning
                            counterpart of man. The gate to the temple of science is now unbarred &amp; many secret
                            wishes and approving voices are urging woman up the laborious but invigorating steep. Shall
                            she <hi rend="i">faulter</hi> because the sneers and scoffs of the idle, vain, and
                            thoughtless are heaped upon her? Will she linger on the threshold of knowledge because fools
                            assert she has not energy enough to grasp its blessings? Nay let her fearlessly enter
                            confounding her enemies and proving to friends that she has zeal and industry enough to
                            overcome obstacles, at least.</p>
                        <p>She who superficially skims over the surface of useful studies and merely strives to <hi rend="i">excell</hi> in ornamental will ere long be viewed in the same light with a
                            student who should spend his college course in experimenting on fiddle strings What though
                            she may flutter in the <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-046-2-074"/> assembly with all the graces of
                            Venus, yet man must acknowledge that Minerva is a more interesting character —
                            that mind makes the woman as well as the man. The time will arrive— nay it is
                            almost here — when those only who are distinguished for intellectual and moral
                            worth shall be considered the truly accomplished.</p>
                        <p>The stability and prosperity of our Government must materially depend upon the proper
                            direction of the female mind. For a government to be truly republican woman must be
                            free— not from the laws of social life— but from ignorance and
                            superstition— from pride and vanity the spontaneous productions of an
                            uncultivated mind.</p>
                        <p>That women exert a vast influence in republican government has been acknowledge(d) in
                            different ages of the world, and for that reason the wise have repeatedly urged their claims
                            to a higher degree of mental discipline. But the great amount of domestic duties rendered
                            such a course generally impracticable. Only consider in addition to our domestic duties that
                            of spinning, weaving, and embroidery occupying two thirds perhaps of the time and because
                            fashionable as well as necessary it must be done. How much our condition is bettered. We
                            hava leisure for reading and thanks to Dame Fashion for taking that under her protection so
                            that it will generally be practised. The manual labor of woman is reduced nearly one half.
                            Indeed it seems that man by his numerous inventions is determined to strip her of the only
                            plausible excuse she has had for not improving her mind equally with his. Of the earliest
                            advocates of female education Pythagoras is the most prominent. It is said that many females
                            ranked among the brightest ornaments of his philosophical school. But the world was then
                            unable to appreciate strength of mind without corresponding physical strength. Therefore the
                            effort was premature, the mass of womankind was not sufficiently prepared for so great a
                            change.</p>
                        <p>But the way has been gradually prepared by the inventions and discoveries of ages. Man no
                            longer believes that the greatest mind necessarily dwells in the most athletic frame. And
                            now woman must show that she has kept pace with the changes of the times — that
                            she is ready to partake of the proffered tree of knowledge — to sacrifice ease,
                            in order to become the companion of man in his advanced state of civilization. What though
                            she never rival Bacon, Locke, or Newton yet need she despair? May she not aspire after
                            knowledge and seek for wisdom as for hid treasures? Though the richest ores and deepest
                            veins may perhaps be beyond her grasp, yet many a sparkling gem and priceless treasure will
                            be hers. Though the records of the past do not furnish many examples of surpassing talent,
                            still there are enough for ample testimony, that sex is no demarkation of capacity.</p>
                        <p>United together for the cultivation of mind— of the immortal past. How important
                            the duty— How glorious the privilege. What <hi rend="i">intrest</hi> should
                            characterise our meetings and stimulate our exertions. But it should be borne in mind that
                            to realize the greatest amount of good from such an association several things are
                            requisite. In the first instance; Every member should set an example of cheerful obedience
                            to the laws framed for the good of the whole. Regularity and punctuality in attendance are
                            almost indispensible to the interests and prosperity <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-046-2-075"/> of
                            the Society; especially while its numbers remain so small. Attention to the discussions,
                            compositions recitations and reading should be carefully bestowed. In the selections read,
                            the truth or falsity of the subject— the beauty or defects of the author
                            — might properly be criticised.</p>
                        <p>Above all things, order should characterize every part of the exercises. An observance of the
                            rules of punctuality, order and attention will tend to promote valuable mental habits, and
                            in conjunction with due preparation for the performance of the duties of the class, will
                            ensure those benificial results which we anticipate in becoming members of the
                            Edgeworthalean Society.</p>

            <p>No sooner was Mrs. Hinkson comfortably seated in office than the club debated the question:
                    "Is there sufficient evidence to prove the truth of Phrenology?" and found that
                    there wasn't. Likewise the question of slavery arose in a debate on "Is it right
                    to hold slaves?" That, too, was answered in the negative. In February a most vital question
                    was asked: "Which has the most extended influence, Riches or Women?" The young
                    ladies of 1842 answered "Women." But a week later when the question was asked:
                    "Which is the more desirable in a young lady, Riches or Beauty?",
                    "Riches" won. One of the most strongly contested debates was over
                    "imprisonment for debt." The Society was against it.</p>
            <p>On June 3 the Society met but immediately adjourned so that the members could attend "the
                    Temperance Meeting." The Society had obtained its own quarters and dated its minutes
                    "Edgeworthalean Hall." In late June the Society discussed a topic that was to echo
                    in other halls for three quarters of a century: "Is it desirable that females should take
                    an active part in the great political questions of the day?" The president refused to
                    decide the issue.</p>
            <p>When Mrs. C. Morrison delivered her inaugural address on July 29, it proved to be one of the most
                    unusual in the annals of the Society but was, perhaps, more typical of popular addresses of the day.
                    It follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="left">Ladies</p>
                        <p>Bad health and business of a peculiar kind have this week prevented me from preparing <hi rend="i">myself</hi> to appear before you in a manner suitable either to the calling or
                            the occasion. I hope therefore to receive your indulgence while I in an imperfect and
                            bungling manner address you.</p>
                        <p>I cannot, dear ladies, thank you for your unanimous voice in confering on me the most arduous
                            office of this society which I am well aware you all know that I would in <hi rend="i">no-wise</hi> willingly accept, on account of my utter incapacity to rightly discharge
                            its responsible duties. But <pb n="196" id="VAA4025-046-2-076"/> I am highly gratified by
                            the honor thus confered on me and therefore thank you and also for your partiality, for <hi rend="i">there by</hi> you have shown that you do believe me to be as competent, and
                            able as is <hi rend="i">requsite</hi> under present circumstances to do some little, or at
                            least to preside while you show forth to the utmost of your minds your power to do what
                            should be done by our mutual co-operation, and let me tell you, that we can do nothing
                            without co-operation, some may not see nor appreciate the value of it but do you keep in
                            mind its indispensibility, I would never again take this chair let the consequences be what
                            it might did I not believe I should have your assistance,— the assistance of each
                            one of you in conducting this body a short distance along the road of preparation for
                            heavenly enjoyment. But, believing that you do sympathise with me on account of the great
                            weight that is now pressing my puny hand, that no reprimand will ever be required, that each
                            one is fully able to govern <hi rend="i">herself</hi>, that what you may see in me, that you
                            can fully approve you will not with-standing admit is right in me, considering my high
                            station as your president, and in fine believing that you will, on account of this my
                            standing, consider me incapable of error, during my presidential career. I feel strong in
                            your help as it is in Jesus our mutual master, who will crown us with <hi rend="i">reward's</hi> according to our works, for his own righteousness sake, what if
                            it should be to enjoy uninterruptedly His own lofty, pure, incomparable mind, but oh! it has
                            not entered into the heart of man to conceive the blessings that are in store for those that
                            serve God. To serve him in a society; capacity is now our high privilege, and how to do it
                            our study. A very few years hence say half a century and the place that now knows us; will
                            know us no more; it will not then be even supposed that each of you or I ever stood here.
                            This thought excites in us an awful, holy humility: fifty years hence and probably not one
                            of us will be living to witness the change, if any that one will be looking forward for her
                            dissolution as soon to take place. Will any say that this is a melancholy picture, I do not
                            consider it as such, unless we dwell upon it and say painful reality, instead of looking to
                            the promise and saying, bright, glorious realities.</p>
                        <p>Is not one dear one already gone. Oh! how soon — in the twinkling of an eye as it
                            were she was snatched away. Oh! Why so soon? but may be not too soon, who can say
                            —but we did need one tried spirit; tried in our very midst to stand up before our
                            Lord and influence our track thither. The loss at first appeared to us irreparable surely
                            she is not lost to us, for have we retrograded since her change? No, we have increased in
                            strength and energy. We appear doubly attached to each other, harmony and goodwill prevail
                            among us to a greater degree and though our meetings sometimes small and sometimes we are
                            pained at the loss of a member, still our ardour faileth not, and we are frequently
                            encouraged by the admission of a new and valuable member, and if our aim is still high, our
                            object noble and our motto T R U T H we will advance upward and onward in spite of bitter
                            scorn, cruel oppression and indeed in spite of every opposition.</p>
                        <p>To some of us the attendance here with the duties require much self-denial, but in their
                            accomplishment confer much pleasure, while to <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-046-2-077"/> others
                            there is very little self-denial and still much happiness enjoyed, in proportion as we deny
                            lazy self, take the cross and follow the line and precept of duty, we will derive unalloyed
                            pleasure….not withstanding to prepare for these meetings requires self-denial of
                            some and labor of others while it affords a continual stream of delight to others, it is
                            with mingled feelings of delightful satisfaction, <hi rend="i">intrest</hi> and pleasure
                            that we cooperate in its duties, witnessing its operations upon its members, the improvement
                            of some, the renewing of mental abilities in others, and the bringing to light and flame
                            talent sparks in a third class while the members of a fourth if not doing so much themselves
                            are the happy spectators of the society's advancement and elevating exertions, in
                            spite of obstacles which it is wonderful so small a body so lightly armed could have
                            conquered. Is there any desire more enobling than that of cultivating and improving the mind
                            that thing immortal and coeval with the great Creator of the universe, let us then set our
                            standard high, even to prepare ourselves to be companions with the perfect, an approximate
                            according as He gives us strength to proceed.</p>

            <p>Perhaps reflecting some of the religious ferver of Mrs. Morrison's remarks the debate
                    question on August 5 concerned the question: "Should the Roman Catholic religion be
                    tolerated in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>?" The president decided it should but the secretary was careful to record in
                    the minutes that the vote was six to six.</p>
            <p>Then a question arose that apparently stirred the town— "Should the literary
                    societies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> unite in encouraging and supporting a good literary paper, for their own pleasure and
                    as a credit to the place?" The Society voted not to join in such an ambitious enterprise
                    but did vote to subscribe to two copies of "The Western World." (Mrs. Morrison
                    agreed to pay for one.)</p>
            <p>In August the question of Phrenology appeared again. This time the Society debated "Would it
                    be advisable for the young ladies and gentlemen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> to have charts taken of their heads and sent to Fowler to see which would make suitable
                    companions for life?" And the Society decided it would! Whether the members ever did is not
                    an item in the minutes.</p>
            <p>Miss M. Maxwell became president November 11, 1842. Her address gives more of an insight into the
                    weekly meetings of the Society than the Minutes do. Her remarks would indicate that some problems of
                    presiding officers have not changed a great deal. She said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="left">Fellow Edgeworthaleans—</p>
                        <p>We are met again, after the lapse of a month, to resume the usual <pb n="198" id="VAA4025-046-2-078"/> duties of our Society, either with active and energetic
                            spirits, or to give it an impulse, merely sufficient to keep it in existance during the
                            winter, without interest or improvement.</p>
                        <p>I know how much depends upon the President in this case, and truth forbids me to express any
                            great gratification at the position in which I find myself placed. There may be honor or
                            even partiality attached to the bestowal of the office, yet the responsibility so far
                            exceeds it, that the pleasure it might otherwise afford, is lost sight of. It is but right
                            and just that the office should be held in rotation: yet I can but wish that your choice had
                            fallen elsewhere, or falling upon me, that I was more worthy to accept it, more fully
                            competent to perform the duties, and to enforce all the regulations and laws of our
                            Constitution. — And permit me ladies, while "dressed in the little brief
                            authority" which you, yourselves have given, to say, that, we have of late been
                            somewhat wanting in due deference to the smaller matters of order, matters (however trifling
                            in themselves) upon which depend, in a great measure, the success of our Society. It were
                            better far to have too much formality and punctuality in our Association than too little. If
                            we wish to make it a sociable affair, a place equal for amusement and enjoyment, with
                            literary improvements, we should make laws to that effect; but while we acknowledge
                            ourselves governed by a particular constitution, we should strictly and uniformly act up to
                            its requisitions. Our By-Laws expressly forbid any member to speak upon the same subject
                            oftener than twice, or longer than ten minutes, or even leave her seat without
                            permission;— but methinks it will not prove a very severe tax upon any of our
                            memories to recall instances in which we have acted independantly of these regulations, long
                            before the usual duties of the evening were brought to a close; neither would it have always
                            taken the most observant eye to detect three four and sometimes more speaking at once and as
                            often as we <hi rend="i">chose</hi> — This is not a very heinous offence in
                            itself but it creates confusion and makes the exercises tedious to those who are disposed to
                            join the remarks and who are thus prevented from hearing the arrangements made for the
                            ensuing meeting.</p>
                        <p>I entreat your pardon ladies, for thus wearying your patience with such minute details; but
                            it were at least safe to bear in mind that a slight departure from the <hi rend="i">right</hi> may end in serious evil — It had been better, perhaps, to have
                            dispensed with such regulations altogether, at least better, than having, not to abide by
                            them: Or it might be construed into a want of confidence in ourselves, implying a doubt as
                            to the falsity of the universal accusation against our sex, that woman's tongue is
                            never still— Or perchance it may be that impulse within us, the surest legacy
                            left us by our Mother Eve, that ever tells us "forbidden pleasures are
                            sweet." Thus without restrictions or temptation our good sense would have taught us
                            the way to preserve order and insure success.</p>
                        <p>But do not understand me to say that I would have our Association to consist in a mere
                            mechanical routine of duties — we should ever be familiar and cheerful in our
                            intercourse and yet perform the exercises simply as they are required to be done. Indeed
                            such an Association as ours is calculated to form and perpetuate friendships which else had
                                <pb n="199" id="VAA4025-046-2-079"/> never existed. We can drink of the Pierian Spring
                            and yet gather the sweet flowers of friendship which bloom upon its margin. And should a
                            bitter draught mingle with the clear crystal of the fount their lovliness and fragrance
                            alone will change it into the waters of oblivion.</p>
                        <p>Our intercourse has not been marked merely with literary improvement but it has opened to
                            many of us, perhaps to all, new friendships, new thoughts, and new desires — We
                            who met as strangers, now meet as friends,— and often we find something to admire
                            in those from whom we least expected it and which, but for our association as a society,
                            would have remained (to us at least) unknown and unappreciated. We may not know until the
                            casket is opened (though rough and unseemly it be) what priceless jewels are concealed
                            within.</p>
                        <p>"True friendship" says a lady Authoress, "is a liberal and
                            expansive nature and seldom flourishes so well as when extended through a circle."
                            The same writer says "That woman's sympathy and friendship for a few will
                            extend to the whole sisterhood of her sex until she becomes what woman ever must be
                            — in her noblest, purest, holiest character — the friend of
                            woman."</p>
                        <p>If we are prosperous as a society, the pleasure and advantages are alike to all; if
                            opposition crosses our path, we meet it together and this unity in action and thought
                            creates a bond which may not be severed by light and thoughtless words. And have we met with
                            opposition! and from whence! From the other sex, as we possibly might expect? Nay! but from
                            our own. If I have at all feared ridicule it is from this source — but with a
                            Mark Anthony generosity we will say — We will not stir your hearts and minds to
                            do them wrong, for they are all <hi rend="i">sensible women</hi>. This however is but one
                            kind of opposition and the least dangerous— There is another kind more fatal to
                            our progress and success than this from our neighbors—it is opposition from
                            ourselves, against ourselves— Every member who is irregular in the performance of
                            her duties, who wants punctuality and perserverance, who yields to the disinclination she
                            has for mental exercise, and omits or slights the performances, is opposing her own interest
                            and the advancement of the society.</p>
                        <p>What matters it, if we do make sacrifices of personal comfort and the pleasures of
                            society— or what matters it, if we are compelled to make preparation by the
                            waning lamp of the midnight hour if it but serve to make brighter the light within us. At
                            such a time are there not moments when the longing for wisdom and knowledge— when
                            that yearning to know, and still to know, would tempt us to sacrifice all, yea, that which
                            we would almost startle to mention, and in such feelings is there not a warning, a voice
                            that tells us we have an unquenchable spirit withinm which seeks and must have food.</p>
                        <p>It is said the <hi rend="i">moral</hi> reformation of the world depends upon women. Are we
                            capable of undertaking the task? I fear not, until our mental reformation has at least
                            progressed further if not perfected. But upon this subject I need make no remark. The
                            emancipation of woman from the thraldom of ignorance and servitude has been portrayed by
                            those who have preceeded me in true and beautiful colors. Indeed I am almost compelled, in
                            self justification (however improper the time may <pb n="200" id="VAA4025-046-2-080"/> be
                            for passing a compliment) to say that my predecessors have said everything that can well we
                            said on the occasion of inaugural addresses. For this reason I have in some measure had to
                            carve out for myself a new path and like most other new paths it has no doubt been somewhat
                            rugged and barren of interest. And if in the <hi rend="i">farther</hi> discharge of the
                            duties pertaining to the office I should meet with difficulties or inadvertantly pursue a
                            wrong course I must solicit your kind assistance to extricate me and point out the true way.
                            I cannot flatter myself, as I am the first single lady whom you have honored with authority,
                            that I shall preside with as much dignity and ability as those whose maturer wisdom and
                            years so well fitted for the station.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I would say that to carry on pleasantly and smoothly the good work we we have
                            so <hi rend="i">prossperously</hi> begun we must bear and <hi rend="i">forbear</hi> with
                            each other — rejoice when we are successful, persevere when we meet with
                            difficulties and we may ultimately present that anomaly in the records of <hi rend="i">men</hi>, a body of intelligent yet rational women —with minds well cultivated
                            yet possessing a taste for the domestic duties of life.</p>

                    </placeName> weather began to take a hand in the affairs of the Society early in 1843 and several
                    meetings were abandoned. On March 3 an ever present question was debated—
                    "Should women be allowed to vote?" A. D. Maxwell, E. Baugh and M.A. Batterton took
                    part. The decision was unanimous. Women should not be given the ballot. The Society made a similar
                    decision concerning dueling.</p>
            <p>On June 23, the secretary had difficulty. After the regular meeting a question for debate was offered
                    and the secretary put it in the Minutes: "Is <hi rend="i">jeneous herditary</hi> or
                    not?" This didn't look quite right so another member wrote in the book:
                    "Is <hi rend="i">jenious</hi> hereditary or not?" On June 30 the Society decided
                    genius was a heritage. This out of the way, the debaters turned to "Does Sir Walter <hi rend="i">Raileigh</hi> deserve more <hi rend="i">censure</hi> for the introduction of tobacco or
                    praise for the introduction of potatoes into <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>?" The vote was taken and tobacco was tolerated, at least, although
                    "Mr. Raileigh" was censured.</p>
            <p>Death entered the ranks of the Society again on July 27 when Miss C. Swearingen died. Suitable
                    resolutions were passed.</p>
            <p>Miss M.E. Lowe became president on September 1, 1843. Her inaugural address is the last of those
                    preserved. It reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p rend="left">Ladies</p>
                        <p>The task both of writing this address and presiding over such an intelligent association
                            would be delightful if it were not for my inability <pb n="201" id="VAA4025-046-2-081"/> to
                            perform either creditably. You have heard every effort of mine at original composition:
                            therefore I know you will not expect much from me in the way of an address. My talent for
                            governing remains to be tried. Dignity, self-possession, impartiality and insight into human
                            actions and passions are qualities that should belong to your president. I am fearful that I
                            have but a slight claim to any of these, much less to the whole of them. A want of these
                            attributes will make me depend on your discrimination in my official decisions: which let me
                            hope you will not withold. It is not to be expected that we should be equally endowed with
                            genius or filled with important suggestions or aided by an equal amount of practical wisdom
                            yet all those contribute largely to the prosperity of society, either particular or
                            universal. Diversified minds blending and diffusing their different powers and dispositions
                            combining all the happy influences and promptings of their nature is what constitutes the
                            perfection, wisdom and happiness of all society. The varieties of female character are as
                            numerous as education and nature can make them and if it should be the destiny of any of us
                            not to be ex-i cessively refined or intelligent we are able at least to make truth and
                            nature our guides. If our style is but simple and chaste, we in all probability may appear
                            as well to a correct taste as if we should attempt some <hi rend="i">superfluios</hi> or
                            foreign decorations. "Valuable thoughts when unadorned are admired the
                            most." If it is but little that we are now able to accomplish; yet our feeble
                            exertions and limited sphere of action may become unbounded in its extension and influence.
                            We should be encouraged by the recollection that it is the plan of <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                            </placeName> to accomplish mighty results by the use of very simple means. Every achievement
                            has a beginning. Even our own dear bought freedom was kindled from a spark that remained
                            unextinguished in the bosoms of the few patriotic fathers of our liberty. It was the
                            unkindling of this very spark that leaves us this day in possession of privileges and
                            attainments which far surpass those possessed by women of other nations of the earth: who
                            were comparatively mere beasts of burden. But woman is no longer the slave of degraded man.
                            The excellencies and accomplishments which should have been hers, she has at last assumed.
                            Man's nature which in every age was not human nature now feels that she has her
                            undoubted rights, capacities and powers: and that she should freely exercise all (of) them
                            in support of her highest dignity and happiness. A steadiness of purpose in a well directed
                            plan of intellectual, moral and social culture is only necessary to the highest development
                            inwoman as well as in man. These are highly necessary to her usefulness in society, both in
                            and out of the domestic circle. That woman is very useful without education is no argument
                            against her being far more so with it. If it is the business of education to cultivate the
                            powers and virtues of the mind why should it be denied the companion of self-exalted man, or
                            how can it be expected that the exalted sympathies and excellencies of woman's
                            nature could be exhibited without its aid. When it takes years of mental labor to develope
                            the powers of the minds of man. It is the favorite theory of tyrants that the education of
                            the governed makes them disorderly. But it has been found from experience that mental
                            cultivation instead of raising women above her duties tends to give her a deeper <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-046-2-082"/> sense of her responsibility and enables her to discharge them
                            more faithfully.</p>
                        <p>Since this is proven true by so many living examples the world is compelled to feel and
                            acknowledge the importance of female education: and exert their noblest efforts to raise
                            them to that station which nature and reason show they should attain. The temple of science
                            like the paradise of Mohamed was formerly considered a place too sacred for the intrusion of
                            woman and although its jealous barriers are broken down and they are permitted to enter yet
                            the effects of this repulsion exert an influence sufficiently strong to keep the greater
                            number from making the attempt.</p>
                        <p>Every individual of this society is endowed with a rational and immortal soul, therefore we
                            are all important beings: whether rich or poor, learned or illiterate, we are held
                            responsible by our Creator for the talent given us. We should then in view of our present
                            usefulness and future happiness assert ourselves. If we but make the necessary exertion and
                            are influenced by correct motives we shall not be found wanting nor our talent hidden at the
                            general <hi rend="i">reconing.</hi> Let us remember that the source of all improvements
                            depends upon the improvement of the human mind and this again upon the state of literature
                            and science. I might say that literature has almost become incorporated with the life and
                            constant employments of the more favored of us. No fashionable amusement— none of
                            the seductive arts of the age are necessary to recommend it to our pursuit; but when
                            presented in its purity we are willing to grasp it and love it for itself alone.</p>

            <p>In January, 1844, there were indications of difficulties in the affairs of the Society. The Minutes
                    read: "Society convened as usual. The roll being called several members were absent, upon
                    which those present (being a quorum) resolved upon an adjournment. On the following Saturday, Jan
                    20th, the members met and disposed of the business affairs of the Society; after which M.L. Bollman
                    was appointed to keep the records and during the last week in April to notify the members

                    At the final meeting noted, a subject was entered for debate: "Which has done the most harm

                    long career, a journal. During his early years he was in almost constant contact with older men who
                    had played important roles in the drama of the Civil War. Occasionally these men recounted for him,
                    often in the course of dinner parties, political meetings, and on trains, personal memories of the
                    important events with which they had been connected and the famous men they had known and with whom
                    they had consorted. Young Lodge had an historian's interest in these tales, and recognized
                    their permanent value, so he recorded many of them in his journal, along with casual jottings on his
                    personal doings.</p>
            <p>The following two selections concern Abraham Lincoln. The first offers some previously unpublished
                    recollections of Carl Schurz, certainly a friendly observer, and the second is an account by Charles
                    Francis Adams which helps explain the coolness which existed between the Great Emancipator and his
                    distinguished representative in Great Britain. <text>

                                    various subjects particularly Mr Lincoln. Mr S. said he was convinced of
                                    Lincoln's abilities &amp; sterling qualities by the Douglas
                                    controversy. Told me an anecdote of Lincoln's diplomatic methods &amp;
                                    how popular he was with all the foreign ministers. Mr Lincoln sent for Lord Lyons<hi rend="sup">1</hi> on one occasion &amp; bidding him to sit down near him
                                    said "Now look here lord Lyons I want to keep peace with <placeName>

                                    </placeName>'s insidious acts of hostility) Mr Schurz also described to me
                                    an interview with Mr Lincoln during the campaign of '64. The intense
                                    sadness &amp; sorrow of Mr Lincoln &amp; the manner in which he said in
                                    reference to attacks upon him "Why do they misunderstand me so" Mr
                                    S. said brought tears to his eyes. He also told me that Lincoln was a lover of
                                    Shakespeare &amp; that his favorite play was Macbeth. A natural preference
                                    &amp; sound taste but in view of Lincoln's tragic fate it seems
                                    something more. To no man more than to Lincoln did the sublime lines beginning
                                    "After Life's fitful fever" better apply.</p>

                                    replied—‘Very kind of you to say so Mr Adams but you are not
                                    my choice you are Seward's man" &amp; then turning to Seward
                                    said "Well Seward I have settled the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

                                    in his mind in connection with Lincoln &amp; had colored the Seward eulogy. Mr
                                    Adams also told of Washburne's<hi rend="sup">5</hi> application to Lincoln

                    notes, and index. $6.00.)</head>
            <p>Oliver W. Larkin's <hi rend="i">Art and Life in America</hi> is to American art what H. G.
                    Wells's <hi rend="i">Outline of History</hi> was to history. There is one major
                    difference—Wells hit all the high spots, Larkin misses many but goes deep into a glowing
                    account of some of the valleys! The structure of the story is beautifully set up, the writing is
                    lucid and entertaining, and the prodigious accomplishment of the whole thing is a wonder for a first
                    effort by any author! Its pages and illustrations would give mental and aesthetic indigestion to
                    anyone attempting to forge through it; but nobody will, for it is much too heavy a volume to hold at
                    any angle—this fault of publication is my most serious criticism of the whole effort!
                    Larkin has beautifully divided his material into six very nearly equal parts; they would have made
                    at least three easy to handle separate volumes that anyone would have been delighted to pick up and
                    peruse anywhere, anytime. That's exactly the kind of writing it is—the author
                    made it spontaneous fun, but the publisher turned it into a laborious job.</p>
            <p>One is carried from page to page by the beautiful English, the good humor and the graceful bounding
                    from subject to subject. The reader is also impressed by the amazing survey of the vast material. In
                    fact, no one knew the subject was so vast! The bibliography adjoining the index at the back of the
                    book covers about everything that has ever been published on American art and you feel that Larkin
                    has read it all. He becomes the largest and busiest of all bookworms, chewing his way through the
                    vast walls of art literature that surround him.</p>
            <p>His book covers the visual arts from pre-colonial days to 1949 with special emphasis on architecture
                    as the visible building of the background of American life. His coverage of sculpture is sensitive
                    and at times, eloquent, but it is not all inclusive.</p>
            <p>His account of the crafts is casual and fails to recognize some of the vulnerable spots of the
                    country. He is not too aware of the art attainments in the South, Middle West, and along the Pacific
                    Coast. In fact, outside of <placeName>

                    opinions of others.</p>
            <p>In the field of painting he makes a resplendent picture of the accomplishments in our country,
                    although refuses to admit many of them as American in spirit. This attitude he augments by bringing
                    Cezanne, Matisse, Duchamp, and Derain into the American picture. One finds himself in complete
                    contradiction with his estimate of Copley and Edward Savage, but rejoices in his courageous
                    deflation of the, "Mop, Pail and Ash Can" era! In fact, his classification of late
                    nineteenth and twentieth century painting is delightful and spirited. Only two of the great
                    Expositions are mentioned, no recognition of the important art influences of the Fairs at <placeName>

                    with their fabulous treasures and their active programs of exhibitions of contemporary American art
                    and loan exhibits from abroad. Also the art schools and the rapidly developing art departments of
                    the great universities and colleges are not mentioned, but it is very possible that this new
                    brilliant writer on the fine arts is saving this for another volume.</p>

            <p>This volume is No. 114 in the Numismatic Notes and Monograph series. It describes the chaotic
                    conditions that prevailed during the so-called "wildcat banking period," and
                    explains the techniques developed for dealing with the depreciated wildcat bank notes. It also
                    devotes considerable space to the problem of counterfeit currency.</p>
            <p>The confusion in banking and monetary matters during the period covered was due in large measure to
                    an unusual combination of circumstances. There was no effective national control of banking policy,
                    and the state banking laws were in most instances notoriously lax. With respect to the <pb n="207" id="VAA4025-046-2-087"/> currency, there was no effective limitation of bank note issues, and no
                    adequate provision for their redemption. The bank notes appeared in a bewildering variety of
                    designs, and with cheap paper and grossly inferior printing and engraving. In the absence of
                    adequate supervision and control unscrupulous adventurers found it easily possible to enter the
                    banking business. A large percentage of the banks that were established were both unsound and
                    unnecessary, and soon the country became flooded with state bank notes. To make matters worse, many
                    of the banks made no pretense of redeeming their notes in specie. In fact it became a common
                    practice to establish banks in the depths of forests or in other inaccessible places so that it
                    would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to present the notes for payment.</p>
            <p>Under these conditions the bank notes in circulation during the wildcat banking period had widely
                    varying degrees of acceptability. A discount of as high as 40 per cent was not uncommon, and in
                    extreme cases the notes became utterly worthless. Gradually there developed the business of trading
                    in the notes of distant or out-of–state banks, and interestingly enough the bank note
                    brokers frequently combined their traffic in bank notes with the sale of lottery tickets. Thus the
                    holder of notes issued by distant banks could take them to a local lottery office and exchange them,
                    at the current discount, for the notes of local banks.</p>
            <p>As the bank note currency increased in both volume and diversity, the businessmen were ready to
                    welcome any assistance available in the problem of evaluation. As early as 1818 certain newspapers
                    began to publish bank note tables or lists, giving the latest quotation on each issue. Later these
                    listings came to be published independently, and were known as "bank note
                    reporters." As might be expected, the publishing of this information frequently resulted in
                    litigation, as the officers of the wildcat banks would try every means to prevent the facts from
                    becoming known. There were also some dishonest publishers, who were guilty of
                    "puffing" worthless bank notes. Such cases were rare, however, and on the whole
                    the publishers of bank note information performed an important protective service.</p>
            <p>The circulation of paper currency usually brings with it the problem of protection against bogus
                    notes. It is said that the Bank of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was in operation for sixty-four <pb n="208" id="VAA4025-046-2-088"/> years before the
                    first discovery of a counterfeit Bank of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> note; but this was something of a record. In this country, counterfeiting was a serious
                    problem even before the middle of the eighteenth century. As early as 1726 the newspapers contained
                    warnings of the appearance of counterfeit bills, and a century later the flood of bogus notes had
                    reached alarming proportions.</p>
            <p>The author classifies and describes the bogus currency as follows: "A <hi rend="i">counterfeit</hi> note has been described as one that resembles and has been copied from a
                    genuine note. It is usually the same size, shape, pattern and similar in all respects to a genuine
                    note. A <hi rend="i">spurious</hi> note has been characterized as a peculiar style of counterfeit
                    and has been so termed due to the fact that it has been printed or engraved from an original plate
                    although it bears no resemblance to a genuine note, except as to the name of the bank and the
                    signatures of the officers. An altered note is usually one where the name of a reputable bank has
                    been substituted for that of a suspended bank. Genuine notes upon which the amount has been raised
                    to a higher denomination are generally referred to as <hi rend="i">raised</hi> notes" (p.
                    16).</p>
            <p>In 1859 it was estimated that there were nearly four thousand counterfeit or fraudulent bills in
                    circulation, with new discoveries of spurious notes averaging at least ten per week. There were also
                    in circulation a large number of notes of banks that had been broken or closed. By this time it had
                    become regular practice for the publishers of bank note reporters to add to the listing of genuine
                    bank notes a separate section called a "counterfeit detector." This section gave
                    detailed descriptions of the various counterfeits reported to be in circulation.</p>
            <p>We may observe that our paper currency problems did not end with the establishment of the national
                    banking system, and the subsequent withdrawal of state bank notes from circulation. We have made
                    progress; but at best improvement has come slowly. As early as 1810 Abel Brewster published a
                    pamphlet urging the desirability of having a uniform paper currency, as a protection against fraud;
                    but it was not until the issue of the "New Series" in 1929 that uniform designs
                    were adopted for all the circulating paper currency. With our present system the denomination of a
                    bill can be ascertained by the portrait as well as by the numbering, and <pb n="209" id="VAA4025-046-2-089"/> this makes it much more difficult to pass bills that have been
                    "raised." But in spite of all precautions the counterfeiters are still active. The
                    suppression of counterfeiting and alteration of bills is one of the duties of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Secret Service, and according to a recent report from the chief official there were 174
                    new counterfeit notes in production in 1949, and during the year 478 persons were arrested for
                    counterfeiting offenses.</p>
            <p>The book under review is very readable, and the material presented is well arranged. The appendix
                    contains a useful bibliography, and an extensive listing of bank note reporters, giving dates,
                    number of issues, and places of publication. There is also an excellent series of plates of bank
                    notes, illustrating the differences between genuine and bogus bills. The author deserves credit for
                    having provided us with an informative account of the currency difficulties, and of the protective
                    devices used, during a rather turbulent period in our banking and monetary history.</p>

            <p>The present is the second of the projected series of seven volumes to appear as the official
                    chronicle of the army air forces in World War II. As the subtitle indicates it is concerned with the
                    story of the air arm in the war from the conception of the plan for allied landings in north and
                    northwest Africa (TORCH) in the summer of 1942 to the fulfillment of the Combined Bomber Offensive
                    (POINTBLANK) as a preliminary to the invasion of western Europe in the spring of 1944. A subsequent
                    volume will record the remainder of the European phase of the war to VE Day.</p>
            <p>Initially planned general strategy, by which it was hoped to accomplish a global victory against the
                    tripartite alliance of the Axis powers, which had been formed in 1940, called for defensive measures
                    in the Pacific and offensive efforts <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-046-2-090"/> in Europe. This was
                    generally delayed and altered to some degree by the amazing amount of successes the Japanese were
                    accumulating after Pearl Harbor. Priority of the limited resources then available was made to allied
                    operations in the Pacific. Only after the Japanese defeat at Midway, in June, 1942, generally
                    conceded to be a turning point in the war, were the allies able to wage offensive war in Europe.
                    With the B–24 attack on the Ploesti oil refineries in Rumania on August 1, 1942, the
                    first large scale heavy bomber attack on a strongly defended target and the longest major bombing
                    mission undertaken up to that time, and with the B–17 attack on the marshaling yard of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, on August 17, 1942, inaugurating the experimental campaign of daylight bombing, the
                    offensive air war against <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> was begun.</p>
            <p>Two sections of the book, written by Thomas J. Mayock, who covered the north African theater
                    operations for the historical office during the war, and Albert F. Simpson, who served in <placeName>
                        <country reg="it">Italy</country>
                    </placeName> as a historical officer, are devoted to the Mediterranean theater. Preferential bias
                    for the air force is so lacking in these accounts of the north African, Sicilian, and Italian
                    campaigns, that, at times, a careful culling of the narration is necessary to ascertain the specific
                    role of American and British air forces. The close co-operation and integration of the combined
                    land, sea, and air forces necessary to execute modern warfare is ably related.</p>
            <p>Arthur B. Ferguson, who devoted his attention to the antisubmarine and Eighth Air Force operations
                    during the war, and Alfred Goldberg, who served as a historical officer in the European theater,
                    have authored the two sections of the volume devoted to the campaign of strategic bombardment
                    against <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and occupied Europe. One concludes from the account rendered on this phase of the war,
                    and perhaps rightly so, that the air force operated rather independently of the ground and sea
                    groups. In addition to being a picture of the activities of the air force operations from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, it is also necessarily a narration of the very struggle of acceptance by military
                    leaders of the fundamental tactical assumptions upon which they were predicated and the difficulty
                    of obtaining the requisite forces and supplies to execute these assumptions.</p>
            <p>Attempt is made, by Goldberg and Simpson, in the concluding section of the book to show the intimate
                    connection <pb n="211" id="VAA4025-046-2-091"/> between the Mediterranean and European theaters by
                    dealing with reorganizational changes which co-ordinated more closely their efforts leading to the
                    "grand invasions" of 1944. The concept of interdependence of the two theaters,
                    both in theory and in practice, has been portrayed throughout the volume; this section successfully
                    adds to an understanding of the necessarily close co-operation from the organizational standpoint.</p>
            <p>As in the previous volume, the editors have attained a remarkable degree of uniformity in style and
                    objectivity of presentations even though the accounts have been written by four different writers.
                    Typographical errors are relatively few in number, but errors of fact may be of greater frequency
                    than can be accurately checked. This is due to the easy exaggeration with which combat results are
                    reported under war time stress. What material difference correction of these inaccuracies would make
                    in the over all picture, it is not possible to say. Perhaps this can never be determined because an
                    absolute check would involve a careful comparison with enemy battle reports and statistics, some of
                    which will never be available.</p>
            <p>The maps used to illustrate the campaigns in the Mediterranean theaters are excellent and most
                    helpful. Those accompanying the text describing the offensive against <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and occupied Europe are too few in number and too sparse in detail. A key or
                    explanation of symbols used in several of the maps throughout the volume would add to their utility
                    in understanding the story which they illustrate.</p>
            <p>This, as the previous volume, will bring home to the reader the overwhelming amount of detail and
                    careful planning involved in "total" war. It is a picture as seen from the eyes of
                    strategists and rendered "in terms of the cold statistics which ultimately measure air
                    victories" (p. 670). As a documentary record of the air war from the American point of
                    vantage, <hi rend="i">The Army Air Forces in World War II</hi> is a most valuable contribution to
                    military history.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> of Saint Mary-of–the-Woods from the time of the arrival of the first sisters

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1840 to 1856, the year of the death of the Foundress, Mother Theodore. Anne-Therese
                    Gurin (Mother Theodore) entered the novitiate of the Sisters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> at Ruille-sur–Loir in the autumn of 1823, and upon her profession was named

                    </placeName>. Celestin de la Hailandiere, Bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1839 seeking financial assistance and sisters for his diocese, and the Superior
                    General of the Sisters of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> promised to send a missionary group, provided Mother Theodore would be its leader. And
                    so it was that on July 16, 1840, Mother Theodore, Foundress of the Community in America, and five
                    sisters started on their journey to America. Not until September 5 did they reach <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>. On October 21 they were in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, installed in a crude farm dwelling, their first motherhouse. It was truly a house
                    "in-the–woods," and the adjustment which the young French sisters had
                    to make to life in the remote, inconvenient place is one of the most interesting themes of this
                    book. With almost no money and little help, they labored in the fields, planted, harvested, founded
                    their schools, and finally gained a strong and permanent foundation.</p>
            <p>The Sisters immediately started preparation for their boarding school which opened in July, 1841, as
                    St. Mary's Academy for Young Ladies. The prospectus announced instruction in writing,
                    arithmetic, geography and history, English composition, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany,
                    mythology, astronomy, rhetoric, plain and fancy needlework, bead work, tapestry, and lacework. Both
                    Catholics and Protestants were enrolled. By November there were ten boarding students. In August,
                    1842, the first commencement was held. "The closing exercises were preceded by a public
                    examination conducted by invited gentlemen from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> …. the demure little group of frontier young ladies [were] seated in a
                    semi-circle their hair brushed back from their clear brows. They wore small black silk aprons donned
                        <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-046-2-093"/> for the occasion to go through the ordeal of the
                    examination, which was <hi rend="i">de regueur</hi> afterwards for many years."</p>
            <p>This school's reputation spread over the state and daughters of many of the outstanding
                    pioneers were enrolled. Booth Tarkington's mother was one of the early students. Years
                    later her son wrote: "Something rare and fine was brought from <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> to Saint Mary-of–the-Woods, and none of those who were students there
                    remained unaffected by it. For lack of a better word, I must call it
                    ‘distinctive.’ The visible effect was a manner of simplicity and gentle
                    dignity."</p>
            <p>The Sisters started their first mission schools in 1842, the year after the Academy opened. The first
                    included the village school in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and schools at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jasper</region>
                    </placeName> and St. Francisville. These were maintained primarily as day schools where pupils were
                    received at nominal fees. Later missions were founded at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
               </placeName>, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The Sisters also took over the orphan asylums for boys and girls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> founded by Bishop de Saint-Palais. In 1849 the Community had twenty-seven professed
                    religious, six novices, fourteen postulants, and was carrying on seven schools with a total
                    enrollment of about six hundred.</p>
            <p>The history of these activities of the Community is almost submerged by the author, however, in her
                    detailed account of the struggles which the Community had to survive during its first nine years.
                    Poverty, prejudice, and above all the unfriendly, sometimes openly hostile, attitude of Bishop de la
                    Hailandiere to the Community which he had been instrumental in bringing to America, threatened its
                    very life. The crisis came in 1847 when Mother Theodore was deposed by the Bishop, dismissed from
                    her Congregation, forbidden to return to St. Mary's, or communicate with the Sisters. A few
                    weeks later she was permitted to return. The Bishop was leaving <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and he renounced all right over the Community. During this period the devotion and
                    fortitude of Mother Theodore, and the devotion and loyalty of the Sisters of the Foundress saved
                    their community. Following Bishop de la Hailandiere's departure, under the regimes of
                    Bishop Bazin and Bishop de Saint-Palais, progress was steady. Building programs were carried forward
                    and curricula expanded.</p>

                    preserved and drawn upon by the author. The book is well organized and quite readable, and the

                    the history. A bibliography of published and manuscript sources and an index is included.</p>

            <p>In recent years a number of studies based on the socioeconomic conditions existing in certain
                    manufacturing and industrial areas, which tend to indicate an increasing appreciation of the
                    significance of such contributions to American society have appeared. Unfortunately, however, most
                    of those published so far have been either highly technical or popularly superficial. Perhaps a new
                    type of historical writing which will emphasize the best features of both needs to be developed.</p>
            <p>This paper-covered volume is a study of the evolution of manufacturing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, from 1820 to 1933, with emphasis on the period 1929-1933. The author attempts
                    to answer three questions: (1) "Has there been more than a modicum of order inherent in
                    Manufactural <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>?"; (2) "Is the outlook for future manufacturing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> optimistic?"; and (3) "What would help Manufactural <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>?" All three of these questions are interrelated, of course, and the author
                    claims that the answer to each is "positive." From his study he arrived at two
                    major conclusions: first, "that discernible order permeates much of Manufactural <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>"; and second, that "the time of possible demise of extensive
                    manufacturing in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> lies happily remote."</p>
            <p>A tremendous amount of data has been collected and assimilated in this volume. No less than eighty
                    tables are included and analyzed. There are thirty-eight illustrations, including several
                    photographs. There is also a generous sprinkling of footnotes, and an adequate bibliography. A
                    pocket fastened to the back cover contains a map.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately a doctoral dissertation of this kind is not very apt to appeal to the general reader,
                    and it is doubtful that it will be received with much interest outside its locale. Perhaps in order
                    to meet the graduate school requirements, the author was compelled to display an unusual amount of
                    erudition, but the general effect has a tendency to repel the casual reader. A little popularizing
                    would have given it balance.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The forty-six sketches range in chronology from Governor Osborn's first experiences in the
                    wilderness area around Florence, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, to happenings at his retreat on Duck Island in the St. Marys River. He endured the
                    hardships of primitive existence through necessity as a youth, and by choice continued to make his
                    home in log cabins and simple camps until his recent death in the ninetieth year.</p>
            <p>The amateur, as well as the trained woodsman, will benefit from Osborn's experiences in the
                    north woods. The sketches, "Indian Woodcraft" and "Bough Bed"
                    reveal the secrets of the comfortable life in the wilderness. Deer hunters will gain much from
                    "Real Sportsmen Do Still Hunting" and "What to do with a Slain
                    Buck," while the general reader will chuckle at the efforts of the tenderfoot in
                    "Eating a Rubber Boot." All will sympathize with "The Supreme Court
                    Justice and the Bear," and the student of history will be better acquainted with the Upper
                    Peninsula.</p>
            <p>The author's humor is stimulating and his philosophy wholesome. Nature lovers will agree
                    with him that "The best thing about the woods and the fields and the waters is that they
                    are for womanly women and manly men." Children brought up in them or permitted to spend a
                    portion of each <pb n="216" id="VAA4025-046-2-096"/> year in them may come to something and do
                    things. If they know how to choose, they shall be made clean.</p>

                    </placeName> Historical Society has reprinted (with additions and corrections) a number of articles

                    makes no pretense of having written a complete history of the town's early years.
                    Apparently he has concentrated his efforts on those aspects which are closely allied to his
                    profession, for the greater part of the work is devoted to treatments of such subjects as the
                    commons, the dwelling house, early mills and factories, building construction, craftsmen, and works
                    of defense.</p>
            <p>Interested historians will appreciate these discussions of phases of the building trade by a writer
                    well-qualified to treat them. It is unfortunate, however, that the pamphlet has such a large number
                    of typographical errors.</p>
