                        <l>It was upon a golden first June day</l>
                        <l>I chanced to take the quiet meadow way</l>
                        <l>The flowers and grasses met across my feetâ</l>
                        <l>Red sorrel, daisies, and pale meadow-sweet,</l>

                        <l>I drew her face to lean against my own.</l>
                        <l>The branch of May that hid her maiden eyes</l>

                        <l>And I, 'mid rapture and tears, found voice to say</l>
