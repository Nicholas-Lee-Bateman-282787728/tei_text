            <p>According to Wendell Phillips, the nineteenth-century antislavery leader, "Revolutions are
                    not made; they come."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> So it must have seemed for the residents of
                    Sault Ste. Marie when the revolution unleashed there by the War of 1812 turned their world upside
                    down. After the American Revolution the settlement of Sault Ste. Marie on the south bank of the St.
                    Mary's River, the river that marked the boundary between <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, came under the jurisdiction of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and, after 1805, formed part of the new Territory of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>. Thus the War of 1812 did not represent an act of political liberation; instead it
                    constituted a revolution of a different sort, one that brought changes in the social, political, and
                    economic life of the community.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    The settlement lay just below the site where the river tumbled down a series of rapids. Because of
                    the abundant fish, the Ojibwa and the <placeName>

                    the location as a trade center, and so did the English who followed the French in exploiting the

                    became a trading center for the large North-West Fur Company and for a few lesser companies. Houses
                    of the traders, fur warehouses, the huts occupied by their employees, and the wigwams of the Ojibwa
                    stretched along both sides of the St. Mary's River just below the rapids.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
                    Throughout the years of French and British occupation, Sault Ste. Marie survived despite the
                    economic vagaries of the fur trade. To call the settlement a village would be an exaggeration.</p>
            <p>The settlement, marked by a two-tiered class system, mimicked a seigneurial world. Fur traders, who
                    constituted the elite, were Europeans of substance and exercised a paternalistic control over their
                    lower-class laborers, extending them credit, providing them places to live, employment, and
                    presents, and often serving as godfathers to their children. In return, traders expected loyalty and
                    deference. In a volatile world governed more by custom than by law, trust was vital. The laborers,
                    mainly lower-class French, Scots, and mixed-blood Ojibwa or <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName>, filled positions as both employees and retainers; they not only worked for their
                    benefactor but also fought his battles and pledged their allegiance. Although most of the Ojibwa
                    shared a lower-class status with the European and mixed-blood laborers, some of the headmen,
                    spiritual leaders, and band chiefs of the local Ojibwa community were accorded a higher ranking.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> While such a society harkened back to seignourial Europe, it was also
                    compatible with the Ojibwa society, which was characterized by heavy kinship obligations and
                    responsibilities. Indeed, in many ways, Sault society was more Ojibwa than European and proved
                    superbly adapated to the severe environment and precarious economic situation.</p>
            <p>In Sault Ste. Marie nearly all the traders married or cohabited with Indian women or women of mixed
                    blood. Traders learned quickly to marry into important Ojibwa and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> families. Kinship and ties of affinity proved more than merely useful to the traders.
                    They were both a source of power and a necessity if one was to achieve success in the trade. One
                    Sault trader, the Irishman John Johnston, courted and married the daughter of Waubejeeg, or the
                    White Fisher. Because the White Fisher was a major band chief among the Ojibwa on the south shore of
                    Lake Superior in the 1790s, Johnston greatly improved his opportunity for trade with the Ojibwa. He
                    was not alone in gaining economic advantage through marriage. One of Johnston's rivals in the fur
                    trade married another daughter of the same chief. Obviously, the White Fisher could also take out
                    insurance. Other <list type="footnotes">

                    generally assumed positions as clerks or attained higher entrepreneurial status in the fur trade.</p>
            <p>Kinship was only one social structure that could be manipulated to maintain status and create a
                    functioning community. Exchanges of presents and the custom of generosity also proved important. In
                    such a harsh environment wealth had to be shared and credit extended to assure survival. Trade was a
                    product of alliances, not the reverse. Gaining allies for protection or for future wars proved of
                    major importance to Indian groups who upon successfully negotiating alliances sealed them with
                    presents and often with the exchange of both women and men in order to establish kinship bonds. The
                    value of the objects traded was less important than the symbolic meaning of the exchange. Generosity
                    insured loyalties.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Knowledge of the Ojibwa and French languages also proved
                    useful not only for trade but also for the establishment of easy social rapport. With an
                    understanding of Ojibwa one gained insight into those aspects of religion related through legends
                    and tales and thus into culture and personality. An ability to speak Ojibwa also allowed joking
                    relationships and the recounting of stones of physical stamina, both of which served cohesive
                    symbolic functions in Sault society.</p>
            <p>The community of Sault Ste. Marie ranked economics more important than politics. Both British and
                    American political concern were too distant to interest people in the settlement. British
                    authorities were hard pressed in their attempts to enlist the residents of the Sault to take even
                    rudimentary steps in their own defense as the War of 1812 approached.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> When the

                    did so not for the defense of country but out of anger stemming from the 1806 revision of the Jay

                    but by the traders themselves.</p>
            <p>The war, and the events shortly thereafter, brought about the transformation of the Sault community
                    by undercutting and replacing its old seigneurial society. In reprisal for the attack on Fort
                    Mackinac, American forces in 1814 sacked and destroyed the North-West Company's warehouse on the
                    Canadian side of the Sault. Because Americans suspected Johnston of being one of the agitators
                    urging the attack on Fort Mackinac, his warehouses were also destroyed.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> These
                    attacks seriously crippled the fur trade at the Sault.</p>
            <p>With the end of the war, the old residents of the Sault, including many of the local Ojibwa, were
                    apprehensive about the arrival of the Americans. Not knowing what to expect, they waited and were
                    uneasy about the future of their community and feared being at the mercy of distant events and
                        decisions.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> After the war American fears of British attacks and British

                    1820 the government forced the Ojibwa to relinquish land for this structure, and in 1822 Fort Brady
                    was built. That same year the government appointed Henry Rowe Schoolcraft Indian agent to the
                        Sault.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the old residents of the Sault the American troops and officers represented more than a population
                    increase and the extension of American power. Likewise, the arrival of an Indian agent represented
                    more than the government's concern for Indians. Both events symbolized the loss of local control.
                    The intrusion of external power and authority undercut the influence of the local elite and altered
                    the social hierarchy. The new rules did not emerge from the community but originated in a distant
                    center. For the local population this new circumstance symbolized momentous change. Both

            </p>
            <p>The old settlers at the Sault recognized that not only did both Schoolcraft and the military draw
                    their orders and their salaries from outside but that their authority derived now from law rather
                    than custom. The new agents of power were responsible not to the old inhabitants but to distant
                    authorities and interests; hence, they did not need to negotiate with the old residents, engage in
                    community life, or subject themselves to the usual pressures that once tended to constrain community
                    leaders. Nor were the newly arrived Americans overtly concerned with including the old populace in
                    the process of change. As one fur trader noted regarding the construction of Fort Brady,
                    "It could scarcely be credited the work they have done and well done too, all by
                    themselves. Not an individual of the place was employed by them."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                    Such methods of operation clashed with the sense of shared responsibility and obligation that
                    formerly prevailed among the people of Sault Ste. Marie.</p>
            <p>The "colonial" situation that now characterized the Sault left an inherently
                    unstable community. Only a weak sense of community involvement could be expected from the new
                    arrivals. Although the institutions were permanent, the personnel were not. There were few attempts
                    by the Americans after their arrival to enter actively into community functions. Except where called
                    upon to administer the laws of the territory, the American military kept themselves separate from
                    the old Sault residents.</p>
            <p>Even Schoolcraft seemed to distance himself from the community and entered into its life only to the
                    degree that proved necessary for the running of his office. When he did attend community
                    engagements, he exhibited little enthusiasm for the residents. Schoolcraft especially had an
                    antipathy for dinner parties and light conversations. Finding them dull and intellectually
                    unstimulating, he recorded in his journal, "I do not recollect any wise or merry remark
                    made during dinner, which is worth recording."'<hi rend="sup">17</hi> During the years that
                    Schoolcraft spent at the Sault, he never adapted to the local society and was a bit of a social
                    recluse. According to his journal, "The necessity of complying with times and occasions, by
                    accepting the current invitations of the day, is an impediment to any system of intellectual
                    employment; and whatever the world may think of it, the time devoted to public dinners and suppers,
                    routs and parties, is little better than time thrown away."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>

                        to dine with Mr. Siveright, at the North West Company House…. The evening was passed
                        with the ordinary sources of amusement. I have for sometime felt that the time</item>

            <p>Frequent replacement of commanders at the fort prevented their extended contact with the populace.
                    This, however, was not Schoolcraft's problem. Although he was to remain at the Sault for eleven
                    years, throughout his first year Schoolcraft sincerely believed that his assignment would be only
                    temporary. At the end of that year, learning that the government opening he sought in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> would not be his, he stoically accepted that his position at the Sault—which
                    he often called the American Siberia—would be permanent. He confided in his journal his
                    sense of despair: "I do not, however, cease to hope that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> has a more eligible situation in reserve for me."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Indian agent, Schoolcraft regulated the trade with the Ojibwa and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> Indians. Since the economy of the Sault was the Indian trade, whatever Schoolcraft did
                    to control the trade served to alienate the community. In order to discourage pro-British sympathy
                    among the Ojibwa and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at the same time prohibit British traders from entering the territory of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Schoolcraft issued licenses only to American traders. This policy discriminated
                    against the old trading firms and opened up the territory west of the Sault to independent American
                    traders, the most significant of which was John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company. Schoolcraft
                    further manipulated the Indian trade by controlling who would receive presents. To punish those
                    Indians traveling a few miles down river from the Sault to trade at the British post on Drummond
                    Island, Schoolcraft gave presents only to those Ojibwa who could prove that they had not traded with
                    the British.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Given the credit obligations in the fur trade, where traders made
                    loans to Indians each fall in the form of supplies for the winter hunt and took their payments the
                    following summer in the form of peltry, Schoolcraft's plan flew in the face of tradition. The Ojibwa
                    took their debt obligations seriously and were bound by custom to pay them. Having accepted presents
                    and other acts of generosity from the British in the past, the Ojibwa believed themselves obliged to
                    maintain friendship and association with them.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Thus custom subverted
                    Schoolcraft's orders. Although realities of the Indian trade defeated Schoolcraft's simplistic
                    scheme, the new regulations did cause tensions. In the eyes of many, Schoolcraft's action appeared
                    petty and spiteful rather than generous.</p>

            <p>Other Americans who followed the army and Schoolcraft to Sault Ste. Marie—government
                    blacksmiths, saloon-and storekeepers, missionaries—also rejected the customs and
                    enjoyments of the old residents. They did not share the easy rapport between the old settlers at the
                    Sault and the Indian and mixed-blood population. If the feelings of Schoolcraft and the missionaries
                    are representative, there was a particular antipathy to Ojibwa religious ceremonies.</p>

                    disgust for their [Ojibwa] superstitions, or to speak out bluntly against them."<hi rend="sup">22</hi> This antipathy also extended to the New Year's custom of going door to door
                    singing and requesting drinks, or as Schoolcraft noted with disdain, "the humblest
                    individual is expected to make his appearance in the routine, and 'has his claims [of a drink]
                    allowed.' The French custom of salutation prevails."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Recognizing that their interests and goals were different and being insensitive to or ignorant of the
                    customs of the old settlers, the new American arrivals began to shape their own community based on
                    the laws and regulations issued from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the customs that prevailed in the world they had left in the East. Built into these
                    regulations was a dislike of people of mixed race, Catholics, and Indians. Within a decade and a
                    half after the War of 1812, the recent arrivals controlled society at the Sault. Under governmental
                    authority, which the fort symbolically represented, Americans manipulated laws that shortly resulted
                    in the virtual disfranchisement of most of the old residents.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The settlers
                    resisted in various ways but to little success. No pattern of collective behavior sprang up.
                    Instead, different interest groups and individuals experimented with approaches to resistance that
                    drew upon traditional patterns of behavior. These forms of attempted resistance can be clustered
                    under three headings: militancy, ingratiation, and evasion.</p>
            <p>Overt aggression, or militancy, proved ineffectual. Most of the traders recognized the futility of
                    resistance, but there were numerous Ojibwa who refused to admit their defeat in the recent war and
                    remained eager to resist American encroachment. In 1815 and 1816 they threatened to attack the
                    American soldiers visiting the Sault, and in 1820 when Lewis Cass, governor of <placeName>

                    Brady, a confrontation nearly occurred. Each time, it was difficult for the cooler heads in the
                    community to keep the Ojibwa from launching an attack.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>Recognizing the utter futility of confrontation, several traders, such as John Johnston,
                    Jean-Baptiste Nolin, William Holliday, and others, interceded to dissuade the Ojibwa from violence.
                    By so doing, these traders hoped to curry favor with the Americans.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
                    Ingratiation became a major alternative to aggression in meeting American challenges to the social
                    and economic affairs of Sault Ste. Marie. The most adroit practitioner of this form of resistance
                    proved to be John Johnston. Repeatedly he entertained and offered hospitality to official government
                    parties visiting the Sault. He provided a building to agent Schoolcraft for use as an Indian office,
                    let him board with his family, and—perhaps operating on the traditional assumption that
                    kinship ties would prove useful—approved of his daughter's marriage to Schoolcraft.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This approach did not always prove as useful as its advocates expected. Despite good deeds, neither
                    Nolin nor Johnston was allowed to engage in the interior fur trade, and both were forced to restrict
                    their activities to the Sault. As Johnston told his son in 1819, "I wrote to Governor Cass
                    to know if from my length of residence in this country I might have liberty to send into the
                    interior. I received his answer… in which he mentions unless I chose to become a citizen
                    under Jay's treaty I could not have the liberty of trading beyond the established Post, therefore to
                    this Post I shall restrict myself until the Almighty in Mercy enables me to quit their Territories
                        forever."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Johnston was never allowed to trade in the interior
                    again. Neither did his many kindnesses move American authorities to act favorably on his claims
                    against the government for war damages or expedite his appeal to let his son George, who was born on
                    the American side of the Sault, engage in the trade.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was, of course, an alternative open to Johnston, and that was to remove to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Before the war Johnston had every intention of doing so, but age, the loss of his
                    western trading territory, and the destruction of his property during the war left him financially
                    ruined and prevented such a move. Others, including Shin-guakongse, or the Little Pine, who planned
                    the aborted attack on Cass in 1820, did choose this evasive alternative.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> Nolin

                    Cass. There the tribes were able to obtain better trade goods and liquor in exchange for furs and
                    information on American activity. In this way tribes carried liquor and British influence back into
                    the Lake Superior country despite Schoolcraft's efforts to stem both activities among the western
                    tribes. Cass and Schoolcraft were perhaps paranoid about British influence and intentions. They
                    moved quickly to implement policies curtailing such influence, policies that served only to
                    aggravate the division between the Americans and the old residents. For example, Schoolcraft, who
                    believed that many voyageurs and traders were really British, denied them permits to enter the
                    interior. He was probably correct in his suspicions regarding their political allegiances, but the
                    result of his policy led to greater friction between him and the old residents at the Sault.<hi rend="sup">34</hi>

            <p>After 1822, with the completion of Fort Brady, the community of Sault Ste. Marie began the slow
                    political process of redefining itself. The new community emerged in incremental steps expressed
                    through actions, symbols, and institutions. Whereas before the war the social polarities at the
                    Sault were between the haves and have-nots, after 1822 they were between Americans and old
                    residents. Standing as it did for the extension of Yankee civilization into the wilderness, the fort
                    represented the new American Sault. Johnston's trading post and the dwellings of the mixed-bloods
                    and Ojibwa symbolized the older Sault. In this polarization the new arrivals derogatively defined
                    mixed-bloods as blacks, half-breeds, or Indians.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> By <list type="footnotes">

                    commanded none. Once the elite, the Johnstons were now just another family of

                    marriage to white women, schools, frame houses, and churches marked the advent of a true American
                    settlement. For the old residents few political or economic roles were available in the new Sault,
                    and what remained of their old social life shifted to the Canadian Sault.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sault of the Americans and the Sault of the old residents presented contrasting policies of
                    development. The first was entrepreneurial and individualistic. The latter was seigneurial and
                    collective. The Sault of the old settlers was out of step with the ethos of the times. Built around
                    the fur trade—which suffered a major depression in the early 1820s and was by that time
                    already in decline at the Sault—the world of old Sault Ste. Marie was entering its last
                    days.</p>
            <p>The old inhabitants did not welcome the Americans and resisted the new life that their arrival
                    represented. Through various actions—sometimes militant, sometimes evasive, sometimes
                    ingratiating—they tried to maintain control of a world slipping away and to make sense of
                    the changes that surrounded them. Little survived of this old world except in weakened form in
                    marginal segments of the population.</p>
            <p>When a German "ethnologist" traveling through the Sault in the 1850s asked a
                    voyageur to sing some of the famous voyageur songs, the man responded with a shrug that those songs
                    were no longer sung. According to him, too many Americans now traveled with the voyageurs, and when
                    a voyageur started to sing, no one knew the words. So the singing stopped. When this same
                    ethnologist asked an elderly Ojibwa woman to tell some of the old stories, she replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I have lost my memory. The Ojibbeways have all lost their memory. The Americans have made

                            They no longer feel the same pleasure in telling the old stories, and they are being
                            forgotten and the traditions and fables rooted out. You often ask after <list type="footnotes">

                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, headed west, leaving behind his farm and his family: his pregnant wife,
                    Louisa Stone Faucett; his four-year-old son, Henry; and a two-year-old son, Charles. Although his
                    father, George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> Faucett, Jr., had once been a minister who preached about heavenly streets of gold,
                    Levi apparently was a believer in earthly treasures, and he did not go to search for them alone. Of
                    George Faucett's immediate family, one son and the husbands of four of his eight daughters went to <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Louisa's brother, Lorenzo D. (Lee) Stone, also went with Levi, and the men wrote home
                    from towns such as Whiskey Slide, Hang Town, Peppermint Gulch, and Murphy's Defeat that they had met
                    several neighbors from <placeName>

                    Johnson. All of these men, who once might have been satisfied with a crop of golden corn, were
                    probably inspired to go west by the same sort of frenzy that seized a young man who spied the riches
                    in the pack of a returning Forty-Niner.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, none of the Faucett family returned to Indiana with the envisioned fortune, but
                    several letters from Levi, and a few from two of his brothers-in-law, Joseph Rhoades and Lee Stone,
                    reveal that the men did find aspects of life on the frontier rewarding. Levi's letters suggest that
                    this thirty-seven-year-old farmer, much older than most Forty-Niners, considered the chance for
                    adventure as enticing as the lure of gold. Until almost the end of his stay in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, the only wealth the family received from him was a growing packet of letters, rich in
                    the details of life in the gold fields. The responses from his father and from his brother, Abel,
                    make it increasingly clear that the Faucetts did not consider the letters satisfactory compensation
                    for Levi's failure to remain in Indiana and support his wife and children. The family may well have
                    agreed with one philosopher of the time who believed that participants in the gold rush were
                    "temporarily or permanently escaping home responsibilities or
                        expectations…."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>When Levi decided to go west in the spring of 1850, he could have gone by ship to Panama, made a
                    five-day trip across the isthmus, and then taken passage on to <placeName>

                    </placeName> could cost as much as $300 for a cabin or $150 for teerage.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Despite the expense, traveling by ship was a popular means of transportation
                    because it was the fastest route to the gold fields—if the complicated connections went

                    switch to pack animals for the remainder of the trip through the jungle to Panama City. One man
                    recorded that the "howling of the monkeys &amp; chattering of parrots" formed
                    a chorus in the trees, while another wrote his wife about "groping through the forest, with

            <p>Those who were more familiar with the sea or more concerned about disease chose to avoid Panama and
                    sail around Cape Horn. The trip of approximately eighteen thousand nautical miles could take up to
                    eight months, a definite disadvantage to those eager to get to the gold fields. To work their way
                    south, many ships sailed so far east that their decks and spars were coated with red dust from
                    Africa. As men shivered in the Antarctic cold and sampled goonie birds, gulls, and albatross, ships
                    could take from a week to forty days just to round the Horn, depending on the weather. For captains
                    who tried to shorten the journey by sailing through the Straits of Magellan, a sudden storm might
                    drive the vessel aground on shores where natives were not always friendly.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Whether one chose to round Cape Horn or brave the dangers of Panama, traveling by sea presented risks
                    that midwesterner Levi Faucett might not have been prepared to take, especially if he had heard of
                    incidents such as the 223 passengers lost when the <hi rend="i">Golden Gate</hi> caught fire at sea
                    or the grounding of the <hi rend="i">Union</hi> two hundred miles south of San Diego on July 5
                    because its helmsman had celebrated with too much whiskey on the Fourth of July.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Besides, Levi was already in Paoli and probably would have considered it a waste of precious
                    time to reach the West by going east.</p>
            <p>Like many of the Forty-Niners, Faucett was a farmer. He already had oxen and could buy a vehicle from
                    his brother, who was a wagonmaker. Several books, newspapers, and lecturers offered information and
                    advice to men who were headed to the gold fields. Levi might well have purchased a book by Sidney

                    items were staples readily available in a farm community. A group similar to Levi's also carried
                    eight to ten hams, four pounds of tea, and one keg each of vinegar, pickles, and brandy. Additional
                    supplies might include three pounds of rough nails, forty feet of rope, ten pounds of soap, ten
                    pounds of gunpowder, two thousand percussion caps, one quart of #6 shot, one gallon of tar, one

            <p>The gunpowder and brandy served two purposes because both were popular medicines on the trail west.
                    Gunpowder was a favorite treatment for cholera, the disease that most often struck those crossing
                    the prairie, and brandy obviously could be used for medicinal purposes. Some groups also carried in
                    their medicine chests one-half pound of ginger, one-half ounce of quinine, three pounds of soda, one
                    quart of liniment, two ounces of ammonia, one pint of castor oil, and two ounces of opium.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> All of these would be needed if cholera struck, and one traveler came to

                    </placeName> on March 26,1850, Levi told him, "It will cost us about one hundred dollars to

                    Levi stated that his health had "binn tolerable good since I left and I am in good
                    spirits…." He was especially pleased because gossip said that "the news
                    is flatering from the mines."</p>
            <p>By May 5, 1850, when he began a running letter home, Levi had advanced from <placeName>

            <p>As did many Forty-Niners, Levi's party formed a company of wagons traveling together, and Levi was
                    elected sergeant. These quasi-military groups selected leaders who would choose campsites or
                    establish a rotation for standing watch. One <placeName>

                    were joint stock ventures bankrolled by eastern merchants who preferred to hire proxies to do their
                    digging. Desperate for funding, even Notre Dame University sent four Holy Cross brothers and three
                    laymen to search for a golden endwnment.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Despite all the study, planning, and organization, the first few days on the trail were always
                    difficult because of inexperienced drivers, unbroken teams, and poorly balanced loads. Stampedes
                    were frequent, as Levi soon discovered. "May the 6th had a Stamped all the teams but ours
                    and Mahans run I hapened to be cloase by ours and cetched the leader by the horn &amp; bow of

                    and there were only five wagons and nineteen men remaining in the party. Levi described an increased
                    feeling of isolation, but it lasted only until May 20 when the group arrived at the Platt River.
                    "I expect there is five hundred wagons in this bottom," he wrote. Another
                    Forty-Niner who reached this point in his journey west was not as pleased to see so many people.
                    Both banks were lined with "a solid mass of wagon," he related, and "men

                    scetch of our travels from Fort Kearney to this place." He wrote of a Sioux village they
                    had passed, which had two hundred to three hundred "wigwams," and commented that
                    Court House Rock resembled the statehouse in Jefferson City. He explained that he had not gone with
                    friends to see Chimney Rock because he was "almost wore out walking." Levi had

            <p>Even simple, daily tasks such as cooking and sewing were a challenge on the trail, and one man wrote
                    that there was "a heightened sensitivity to the arduousness of women's work." The
                    Forty-Niners struggled to repair irreplaceable shirts and trousers and gathered buffalo chips to
                    fuel their cooking fires. Until they learned the real art of preparing food over an open campfire,
                    the men must have eaten many scorched meals. Washing clothes was considered the hardest chore, and
                    one fellow was delighted when he returned to the stream where he was doing his laundry to find that
                    his clothes had floated away in the current. Many men resolved the laundry situation by never
                    changing clothes from the time they left home until the time they reached <placeName>

            <p>From the gold fields Levi's first letter to Louisa closed with what would become his standard advice:
                    "do the best you can untill I return…." Unfortunately, none of her
                    letters survive so it is difficult to gauge her reaction to his absence. Her feelings may well have
                    been similar to those of Mary Elizabeth (Lizzie) Wilson, her sisters, Annie and Charlotte, and
                    brother, Jamie, when their father, James Wilson, Jr., of Keene, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, suddenly went west. The former congressman left the young people, three of whom were
                    teenagers, to deal with foreclosure notices and a mountain of debts that it would take a gold strike
                    to pay. Only six months after his departure, Annie wrote to Wilson that Lizzie had "grown
                    older, and actually sick, since you left us, and really seems to droop under it all." Later
                    Lizzie told her father that "anxieties and troubles have nearly destroyed us."<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

            <p>In a January 13, 1851, letter to his son, George reported that it had been necessary for Louisa to
                    sell most of the farm stock because she could no longer care for it. Since she had fired the latest
                    hired hand, "an unprincipaled scamp," only she and the children were left on the
                    farm. George assured Levi that Louisa had worked hard to keep everything in order but acknowledged

            <p>Levi's father also reported in the November letter that twelve window panes were broken in Louisa's
                    house, the roof on the barn was leaking, and the fences were falling down; however, Levi probably
                    read and reread only the section in which George reported that "Azer Wilson got home [from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>] the 12th day of July, I think he brot about $5,000, he is working as hard
                    in the shop as if he had not one dollar, he made his pile on feather river. When he first went there
                    he made gold verry slow, but his luck became more favorable and he made a pretty smart fortune and
                    then come home."</p>
            <p>Although inspired by such stories and excited by the journey, Levi, at least at first, often thought
                    about events back home. His letters are full of references to the wheat crop, orders for the hired
                    hands, and complaints about not hearing from Louisa. "I cannot give you any instructions
                    [about the farm until I hear from you," he wrote. Despite that statement, he told her,
                    perhaps in response to his father's comment about the stove and hearth, to "keep things in
                    good order and be careful with fire as the barn is so close to the house." When he learned
                    that a hired man was getting married, Levi assumed that he would "still attend to my
                    business [.] If he does not however you will do the best you can as I cannot say what would be
                    best—I was in hop[e]s I would be able to send you some money by this time but my chances
                    has been bad[.]" He could not send her funds, he said, because "I fear I shall not
                    have anuff to take us to the southern mines. As soon as I get some to spair I will send you a draft,
                    probably not untill next Spring."</p>
            <p>Levi explained repeatedly to the struggling Louisa that he also could not provide any support because
                    of the high cost of living in "the diggings." He informed her in a letter from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento</settlement>
                    </placeName> that he had to pay sixteen dollars a week for his "bord" in a place
                    so filthy that he was "eat up with the flies at night." <hi rend="i">Although
                        Faucett</hi> did <pb n="24" id="VAA4025-095-1-032"/> not single out food prices, a fellow miner
                    recorded that he and his partner paid forty-three dollars for a breakfast of a box of sardines, some
                    hard bread, butter, cheese, and two bottles of ale.<hi rend="sup">26</hi> In an area where fresh
                    fruit was scarce, miners paid one dollar for unripened pears hanging on a tree in Coloma.
                    "The purchaser would select his fruit, tag it with his name, and wait hopefully for it to
                        mature."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Given a choice between a bag of gold and a basket of

                    </placeName> gold fields almost always chose the food.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the high cost of living, Faucett reported to his wife that "the miners [were]
                    making no more than… three to five dollars per day." The largest nugget he
                    himself had found "weighed ninteen dollars." He informed Louisa that he no longer
                    wanted to "accumilate greate wealth" but just wanted "a nuff gold to
                    enable me to clear myself of debt and I suppose I shall have to stay a way from home about two years
                    from present." Faucett acknowledged that he could probably go into business and make about
                    one hundred dollars a month. Levi Strauss, who did so, accumulated a fortune selling jeans, while
                    Philip Armour started his meat-packing empire with a butcher shop in a mining camp. Others
                    accumulated wealth by providing the miners with "necessities," such as liquor,
                    tobacco, gambling, and prostitute.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The Indiana farmer decided that he could
                    not open a business in a "place whear so much vise and wickedness prevail."
                    Faucett somehow rationalized that it was more acceptable to live where "heaps upon heaps of
                    money [are] piled up on the gambling tables… every night" if he were mining for
                    gold.</p>
            <p>Levi refused to give up and go home. On November 24,1850, he wrote his father, 'You can see from this
                    that I have made nothing hear since I have binn in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>. If I do not make money anuff between this and next Spring to take me home and pay my
                    debts I shall stay until next fall and then come home if I only have money anuff to take me. I want
                    you to tell my crediters to be patient—-I may be one of the lucky ones this
                    winter." On January 13, 1851, George responded, 'We are Sorrow that you have made nothing
                    yet, &amp; that your Prospects are not Flatering, We are in great hopes that you will come home
                    in the Spring, I will say to you, that if you only have enough to Bare your expenses home come,
                    &amp; there is no danger but you can soon make enough to Pay your debts, I see nothing that is
                    flatering from Calefornia to induce any man to Stay there." Pride and a gambler's optimism
                    probably kept Levi and the others digging in the gold fields. When Lucius Fairchild's parents urged
                    the young Forty-Niner to return, he responded, "Just think to have it said that Lush

            <p>The correspondence from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> grew as more and more family members went west. People in Indiana who received the
                    letters frequently exchanged the information they contained. On October 21,1850, Levi wrote Louisa
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento</settlement>
                    </placeName> that he had located county friends, Joseph and Albert <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and "was surprised to see them nothing but skin and boanes." He
                    included the information that old Mr. Hamilton and Duncan Dicky were both "dead with
                    Erisi-ples… poor felows such a long way from thear famileys." Since Levi
                    included the information that Joseph had not yet notified the Hamilton family, Louisa had the
                    additional responsibility of informing them. When he learned that a friend was considering coming
                    west, Faucett, who refused to return home, must have bemused Louisa by asking her to tell the man to
                    stay in Indiana "if he loves comfort and good society."</p>
            <p>Levi acknowledged that he did have a great deal of company at the celebration of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> statehood in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He described for his wife the fireworks and the speeches praising Henry Clay but added
                    that "There is more dissadisfied in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> now than ever I saw any where[.] Some cursing the country others the people that wrote
                    back some them selves for being such foolls for ever coming &amp;c&amp;c." About
                    the same time another miner wrote an eastern friend that "instead of being a blessing [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>] will prove a curse to the Union…. You can form no adequate idea of the
                    depths of sin and moral degredation to which most of the people are sunk or rather sink
                    themselves…." One town had seventeen murders in a week, and over a period of
                    five years Nevada County averaged eighty-three homicides per one hundred thousand people. Gambling
                    was a popular diversion that often accompanied the violence as miners bet on everything, including
                    the survival chances of a shooting victim as he underwent surgery on a pool table. Alcoholism was
                    rampant, and travelers commented that whiskey bottles littered the state's roads and trails. Such
                    drinking made men who wore filthy clothes, stood in cold water all day, and lived on an inadequate
                    diet even more vulnerable to disease. The lonely miners added to that health risk by paying up to
                    four hundred dollars a night for the services of the prostitutes who worked the camps. In fact,
                    dissipation was so common that a Forty-Niner named George McCowen complained that if a man did not
                    have bad habits such as drinking, gambling, or chewing tobacco, he was considered "little
                    short of an outlaw." McCowen decided <list type="footnotes">

                    dangerous that even peaceful farmers began to carry revolvers and bowie knives.</p>
            <p>While high prices, the failure of his search for gold, and the presence of flagrant immorality could
                    not persuade Levi to leave the new state and return east, the mere rumor that there was
                    "cholary in this city" certainly convinced him to leave <placeName>

                    </placeName>. On November 24,1850, Levi informed his father that he had departed on October 25 and
                    traveled about one hundred miles to Calaveras County. With winter approaching he joined a group
                    cutting logs to build a 14-by-18-foot cabin. Once it was completed, Levi purchased thirteen feet of
                    lumber at 37 cents per foot, made a "gold washer" or cradle, and, with a friend,
                    commenced mining for gold. They "worked all week hard and only made thirty
                    dollars." A group of twenty-seven men who had dug a twelve-foot-deep trench nearby made
                    even less. All were concerned about their ability to live in the area where one hundred pounds of
                    flour cost twenty to twenty-four dollars, tea was three dollars a pound, and those who preferred to
                    drink coffee paid one dollar per pound. While the climate was much healthier than in the
                    cholera-ridden cities, Levi reported that the rainy season had set in and that he expected rain
                    every day for three or four months. By January 28, 1851, he was so discouraged that he left for
                    Placerville and in February moved on to "Grizley Kanyon," near the north fork of
                    the American River. When he and the Cathers, friends from <placeName>

                    over… we got $400 out in a few days… our prospects are tolerable
                    good at present." Despite the discovery, a deep snow forced them to seek shelter, and the
                    cost of living soon ate up their profits. The strike proved to be a small one, and, in May, 1851,
                    Levi moved on to Nevada City. It was the fifth relocation he had made since arriving in <placeName>

                    </placeName> the previous year. When Faucett complained to his family about the lack of letters, his
                    father responded that "when you did tell us where to direct [a letter], you would be gone
                    before [it] could get there."</p>
            <p>All of the miners were eager for mail and often stood in line at the post office in <placeName>

                    delivery window for every letter of the alphabet, and the line for each window stretched out of
                    sight. Individuals near the front when the facility closed for the night simply sat down and waited
                    for it to open the next morning. Food vendors supplied the crowds, and miners who had been weakened
                    by illness or injury earned money by waiting in line and then selling their place to the highest
                    bidder when they neared the front. If Levi <list type="footnotes">

                    because of the eight letters that Louisa wrote to her husband not one ever reached its destination.
                    A miner who had a similar experience commented that he would "cheerfully pay 100 doll[arsl
                    for a Letter from Home."<hi rend="sup">33</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although he had not heard from his wife, Levi discovered in Nevada City a way to get some news about
                    events in Indiana. He went to work for a company that was hiring twenty to twenty-five miners to
                    conduct a large sluicing operation; Samuel and Marley Clark and John Cather from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Orange County</region>
                    </placeName> were also employed there. On May 4, 1851, Levi described for Louisa the bunk that he
                    and John were sharing: "some clabboards laid on two poals and two blankets under us and two
                    to cover us." He assured his wife that "I have got so I can rest sweetly in that
                    way although it went verry hard with me at first." Levi called the area "the
                    richest mining region of country I have bin in." He described it as "full of
                    Gold." He told Louisa that the men who owned the company were two ministers: John Thompson,
                    ua baptist and a fine mason from Misouri," and Johnathan Phelps, "a universelast
                    from N. Hampshire." On Sundays the partners would share a pulpit, and the miners attended
                    in great numbers. On one occasion there were even fifteen to twenty ladies present, which caused
                    great comment. Levi wrote to Louisa that he had heard a "sermint" by Rev. Isaac
                    Owens who "gave his brethern a severe thrashing for Sabbath braeking, dealing in ardent
                    spirrits, etc, and concluded by asking his brethern and all to untie there gold bags and the stuards
                    would wait on them with a plate for them to pass in the dust—liberally."
                    Earlier, Faucett had stayed in Coloma for a period of time and might have heard a
                    preacher-prospector in that town tell his congregation, "There will be divine service in
                    this house next Sabbath—if, in the meantime, I hear of no new diggings."<hi rend="sup">34</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Levi was excited about working for Thompson and Phelps and may have offended his family when he wrote
                    that he wished he "could be with you all a few days and then back here again I am bound to
                    make six or eight hundred dollars before I go home…." Faucett stayed with the
                    preachers for one month, until June 6, 1851, when he used all the money he had earned to purchase a
                    claim, two hundred feet of the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> Flat." He explained to Louisa on July 7, 1851, that "on this flat
                    they have binn and are yet taking out large amounts of coarse gold pieces weighing from two bits up
                    to two hundred Dollars we have not got a piece larger than sixteen Dollars yet we have done
                    tolerable well so far it is butiful gold we get." Levi had gone into partnership with three
                    men from <placeName>

                    dated September 7,1851, came from Union City, <placeName>

                    perform an undefined task and had enough savings that he could offer to send Louisa "a
                    check for two or three hundred dollars… if you stand in need of
                    money…." It would have been the first financial support she had received from
                    her husband since he had left home eighteen months earlier. Perhaps the offer of the money was
                    intended to counterbalance the news that he was not coming home that fall. In a letter addressed to
                    "Louisa Faucett God bless her," Levi told his wife that "there is no one
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>

                    yet I cannot think of going home now to count two years of my life a blank…."</p>
            <p>Levi's brother, Abel, definitely considered the time in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> a waste. On December 21,1851, he wrote to their parents, "I was glad to hear
                    from our <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> friends… that they had sent some money home to their famileys &amp;
                    creditors as I think the[yl had been gone about long enough for to begin to make something. Most any
                    good hand could do as well down on the <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName> cutting cord
                    wood." Abel told his father, who had been pressing hard for Levi's return, to
                    "make your mind easy in refference to the boyes in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> all we can say does but little good and may do much harm in coming years….
                    They are young and may proffet by the lesson."</p>
            <p>Levi certainly had not profited monetarily before his next letter home, which was dated October 26,
                    1851. He had returned to Nevada City, but this time he was working his own claim, bringing in about
                    four dollars a day. The sluicing effort begun by Thompson and Phelps had ended the previous July
                    when the stream went dry. As a fellow minister, George had asked to be remembered to the Baptist
                    preacher, but Levi sent word to his father that Thompson had <text>

            <p>This October, 1851, letter closed with the usual requests to his wife that she write often, extend
                    his love to his family, and remember that "I remain your husband until death." It
                    was the last she heard from him for almost six months, until a rather stilted communication, dated
                    March 1,1852, arrived from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sacramento</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Although the letter does not state how he did so, Levi had managed to amass a
                    considerable sum of money. It noted that he had sent a check for $300 to his father to
                    begin payments to his creditors and was enclosing in this letter to his wife $350 for her
                    to give George to apply on other debts. For the first time Levi no longer asked her to write, made
                    no reference to his expected return, and extended only his best <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-095-1-038"/>
                    wishes "for yours and the childrens welfare." He even omitted the now-hollow
                    encouragement to do the best she could. This letter appears to be the last Louisa ever received from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Levi's formality in this final letter could have been in reaction to his family's mounting anger over
                    his continuing absence. The money he enclosed was perhaps an effort to prove to them, and himself,
                    that he was not a failure. During the previous months George Faucett had become ill and in his
                    letters to his son was increasingly critical of Levi's neglect of his family. Throughout the series
                    of letters George's sympathies were always with Louisa. A few days after his son-in-law Enoch Millis
                    left for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> in 1853, George took his daughter Lydia to "Lawyer Pain" to file for
                    divorce. It is probable that Louisa's experiences influenced her father-in-law's actions. As for
                    Abel, the brother who remained at home had nothing but disdain for the "b~y" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> who was approaching forty and had so little to show for his efforts. Because of her
                    missing letters, Louisa is the silent participant; but it is hard to imagine that she did not
                    experience increasing resentment over having to bear the burden of farm and family without any moral
                    or much monetary support from her husband. Lizzie Wilson may have spoken for such women when she
                    wrote to her father, <text>

                     <div type="letter">

               </text>Whatever Louisa's trials, her husband's remedy was always "do the best you
                    can." The words eventually must have evoked in her the thought that she probably could have
                    done a lot better than Levi.</p>
            <p>Whatever the cause, the correspondence ceased. Although Levi returned to Paoli in time to father
                    Alice Faucett (Rhodes), who was born in 1855, the pile of fading letters suggests that gold fever
                    and the years of separation cost the Faucett family far more than it ever gained. If there was
                    continuing discord, it must have gradually faded from memory, or gold fever was contagious. In the
                    1890s Levi's and Louisa's son, Charles, joined the gold rush to Alaska. There he was reportedly
                    murdered while defending the rich strike that had eluded his father forty years earlier.</p>

            <p>The African-American population of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, grew from 2,517 in 1940 to 5,294 in 1950 and 11,645 in 1960. By the end of
                    this period blacks constituted 7.2 percent of the city's total population, compared with 2.1 percent
                    twenty years earlier. This expansion typified the experience of smaller industrial cities in the
                    North, most of which had relatively few black inhabitants before World War II.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    In his classic study of prewar racial issues, Gunnar Myrdal observed that these cities represented
                    "the most important of all community groups to which the Negro has yet to gain
                        access."<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Earlier black migrants from the South, particularly
                    during the great exodus of World War I, settled largely in the big cities of the North. These
                    metropolises received another huge influx of African Americans during World War II, but the manpower
                    needs of the "arsenal of democracy" also brought blacks in sizable numbers to many
                    smaller industrial centers. Between 1940 and 1950 the black population doubled in cities such as <placeName>

                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
               </placeName>; it grew by nearly as much in Bridgeport, <placeName>

                    these cities continued to expand at a much faster rate than the white population. As a result racial
                    issues took on new significance in the lives of these communities.</p>

            <p>It is hardly surprising that research on African Americans in northern cities during World War II and
                    the postwar era has concentrated on the big metropolises.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> The black population

                    inhabitants. Nevertheless, the experience of African Americans as latecomers in the smaller
                    industrial centers of the North in the two decades after 1940 is an important part of their urban
                    history. A case study of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> during this period, for example, throws light on black struggles to secure jobs and
                    decent housing in smaller industrial cities. It also illuminates the interrelationship of race with
                    the other major forces of urban change, namely, the beginnings of the transition from the industrial
                    to post-industrial city, the growth of suburbanization, and inner-city decline.</p>
            <p>Situated in northeastern Indiana within the industrial heartland of the upper Midwest, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> was an important manufacturing center for electrical products, trucks, pumps, and
                    metals in the mid-twentieth century. Gaining entry into the city's industrial labor market between
                    1940 and 1960 was a significant advance for African Americans, one that contrasted with the false
                    start of the World War I era. Labor shortages in 1917 and 1918 and postwar strikes had induced a
                    number of manufacturers in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> to recruit black workers from the South. As a result, the city's black population, 572
                    in 1910, rose to 1,454 in 1920 and to an estimated 2,200 within another two years. This expansion
                    ceased abruptly after the labor unions' defeat in the final wave of postwar strikes in 1922.
                    Thereafter only a handful of firms hired new black workers. Many of the black newcomers were
                    dismissed from jobs in industry, leaving them to choose between taking poorly paid service work or
                    looking for employment in other cities such as Gary, <placeName>

                    1940. Gary's black population grew from 340 in 1910 to 5,500 in 1920 and 18,000 in 1930. During
                    World War I African Americans displaced eastern European immigrants as the main source of cheap
                    labor in the steel industry. Immigration restriction laws enacted in the 1920s insured the
                    continuing importance of black labor in the local market. Gary millowners aimed at stabilizing black
                    workers at around 10 to 15 percent of the work force in order to maintain ethnoracial diversity as a
                    safeguard against class solidarity. Although African Americans in the main were confined to
                    unskilled jobs, the growth of the steel industry in the 1920s sustained the expansion of black
                        employment.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

                    </placeName>'s business and civic leaders, by contrast, hoped to stem the black influx as part of
                    their strategy to attract new industry to the city. In the 1920s, after local union militancy had
                    been curbed, the Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign that drew truck, pump, and electrical
                    manufacturers to Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>. Lighter industries of this kind were thought to require more skilled and intelligent
                    workers than heavy industries such as steel. Accordingly, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> boosters regarded the social composition of the city's labor force, in which people of
                    German, Irish, and British extraction were predominant, as one of their greatest selling points.
                    Promotional publicity boasted that Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s old-stock work force was more reliable, enterprising, and hardworking than labor in
                    big cities where immigrants from eastern and southeastern Europe and blacks were more numerous.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Unsurprisingly, the booster campaign attracted firms with a conservative
                    racial outlook. Of the fifteen businesses that located in Fort <placeName>

                    experienced either marginalization or displacement during the local boom of the 1920s. By 1940 Fort <placeName>

            <p>Because of their precarious position, African Americans were more vulnerable to the ravages of the
                    Depression than any other group in Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Local unemployment persisted at high levels throughout the 1930s. Promising signs of
                    economic recovery in 1935 and 1936 were abruptly halted by the further recession of 1937-1938, which
                    hit Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> particularly hard. African Americans had to operate on the margins of a devastated
                    local economy rather than in the prosperous one of the 1920s. In 1940 the unemployment rate among
                    blacks was 38 percent compared with 11 percent among whites. Out of a total black male employment of
                    455, the census of that year recorded only two men working as semiskilled operatives in
                    manufacturing and forty-eight holding laboring jobs in factories. Nor did African Americans receive
                    an equitable share of federal and state work relief from agencies such as the Federal Emergency
                    Relief Administration, the Civil Works Administration, and the Works Progress Administration (WPA).
                    This disparity was typical of the situation throughout Indiana, but in some
                    cities—notably <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—a vocal black political leadership used its influence to secure better
                    treatment of African Americans, particularly after all work relief was placed under federal control
                    with the creation of the WPA in 1935. In Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName>, however, the black middle class was very small, lacked influence, and had no tradition
                    of political involvement with the Democratic party. Indeed, it was hard pressed to protect its own
                    position. Many of the sons and daughters of the city's black bourgeoisie, who might have provided
                    the African Americans with a new generation of leadership in the era after World War II, moved in
                    the 1930s because they could not find decent jobs in Fort <placeName>

                    but declined to around five thousand within a year as defense production slowed. International
                    Harvester, which experienced high turnover among its black workers throughout the war, reported an
                    intensification of this trend in the first half of 1945 as many African Americans chose to return
                    home to the South or moved to other northern cities to look for peacetime jobs.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

                    breakthrough into industrial employment, however, prefaced slow and tortuous progress rather than a
                    steady advance toward occupational mobility.</p>
            <p>Occupational distribution among African Americans was a significant indicator of limited racial
                    change from the 1940s through the 1960s (see Table 1). Black employment in the skilled trades lost
                    momentum after the war, remaining static in the 1950s and 1960s. The strongest advance was recorded
                    by semiskilled operatives, a wide-ranging occupational category that encompassed operators of basic
                    machinery from industrial presses to elevators and laundry equipment. On the other hand, low-paying
                    service work remained the single largest category of black employment until the 1960s. In 1940
                    service workers and unskilled laborers constituted three-fourths of the gainfully employed African
                    Americans. The numbers in these categories declined proportionally over the next twenty years but
                    still accounted for nearly half of black jobs by 1960. Significantly, African Americans made slower
                    economic progress than whites during the so-called "long boom" that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> enjoyed in the quarter century after World War 11. In 1969 the median income of black

                    racial discrimination in industries with defense contracts, nor the Indiana Plan of Bi-Racial
                    Cooperation, a state body established in 1941 to help win the war through promoting cooperation

            <p>The first companies to hire African Americans in sizable numbers in 1942-1943 were General Electric,
                    which had hitherto barred them, and International Harvester. Significantly, these firms operated the
                    largest factories in the city, and their corporate headquarters determined manpower policies. A
                    number of smaller local businesses also began to hire blacks, but others did not. Although there
                    were exceptions, companies engaged in brewing, pump manufacture, and precision tools—the
                    industries longest associated with Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>—continued to bar blacks, in some cases until the early 1960s. Many of these
                    firms were engaged in war work but did not fall afoul of the federal and state antidiscrimination
                    watchdogs largely because African Americans did not protest against them. The Indiana War Manpower
                    Commission admitted in 1946 that Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> had received more war contracts than its labor supply actually merited. As a result,
                    blacks could easily find industrial work, usually in the larger factories, which offered the best
                    wages and seniority prospects. Significantly, the FEPC dealt with only one serious complaint of
                    racial discrimination in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s defense industries. Despite a reputation for treating workers well in pay and
                    seniority, the Studebaker Corporation, which opened a new plant in the city during the war, refused
                    to employ blacks other than as janitors and common laborers. In marked contrast to their toleration
                    of discrimination by smaller firms, African Americans issued a chorus of complaints about Studebaker
                    at a time of an intensified local labor shortage. As a result, in mid-1944 the FEPC negotiated an
                    agreement in which the company promised to mend its ways.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    </placeName>'s African Americans encountered many obstacles to their advancement in the workplace
                    after World War II. When demobilized white workers returned from war to reclaim their jobs, black
                    employees were "bumped down" in level of employment—a practice common
                    in Gary and other Hoosier cities in 1945 and 1946." Federal antidiscrimination regulations
                    would have effectively prohibited mass layoffs of African American workers, but Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> business leaders had no such plans. The lesson that many of them had learned from World
                    War II was that blacks constituted a useful pool of surplus labor that could be taken on or laid off
                    in accordance with the needs of the local economy.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> African Americans were thus
                    condemned to a prolonged period of economic insecurity in a city that showed early signs of
                    deindustrialization during the decade and a half after 1945.</p>

                    manufacturing processes; a loss of defense contracts to the rising sunbelt cities of the South and
                    Southwest; the increasing use of overtime by employers to avoid hiring additional workers with full

                    in manufacturing component parts rather than finished products. The first recession, paradoxically
                    the most shallow of the three in national terms, had the worst effect on Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, particularly in the tool and wire industries. In 1949 11 percent of the local labor
                    force was unemployed, but the jobless rate for African Americans was twice as high.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The local economy enjoyed a dramatic revival during the Korean War but fell back again
                    during the postwar recession. By March, 1954, employment in the Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> area was nearly six thousand less than its Korean-era peak (66,324 in June, 1953) and a
                    thousand below its 1948 level. Thereafter, the growth in local jobs occurred outside the
                    manufacturing sector, where the number of jobs experienced a decline of 2.8 percent compared with an
                    expansion of 14.6 percent in total employment between 1950 and 1960. These fluctuations hit African
                    Americans, latecomers to the industrial city, much harder than whites. Not only were blacks prone to
                    suffer the "last hired-first fired syndrome but recurrent layoffs compelled many of them to
                    take work where they could get it, thus preventing the acquisition of seniority within one
                    particular firm. In a tight labor market blacks were also hurt because they lacked special skills
                    and educational qualifications. Trapped in the ranks of unskilled laborers, they were vulnerable to
                    layoffs and replacement when plants automated.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>To counter the effects of manufacturing decline, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> launched another booster campaign in the mid-1950s to attract new business. On this
                    occasion the city sought firms tied to the nation's booming consumer economy, notably trucking,
                    warehousing, and retailing. By 1958 Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> was home to four major truck lines; warehousing activity that had started in the 1920s
                    had undergone a huge expansion; and four new shopping centers were in operation—the first
                    major retailing enterprises to be built outside the downtown district. This success did not spell
                    good news for African Americans. Retail jobs in particular were not a promising source of employment
                    for them. The downtown department stores did not employ blacks as sales assistants until the late
                    1950s for fear of alienating white customers. The new shopping centers, which were almost wholly
                    dependent on a white clientele, took even longer to follow suit. For African Americans, however, the
                    main problem with the new businesses was their suburban location. Warehousing and, to a lesser
                    degree, trucking were industries with a tradition of hiring blacks, but the new <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> was $1,750, a figure marginally higher than the average of $1,697
                    for the urban Midwest. Nevertheless, black males had a lower income than in nearby Gary and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> (respectively $2,196, $2,598, and $3,114), but the

                    $873). The reason for this difference lay in the industrial structures of the cities.
                    Gary's steel mills and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s automobile plants offered males, black and white, better wages and prospects than

                    </placeName>'s diversified industries and smaller factories. Automobile manufacturing also proved

                    </placeName>. By contrast, women of both races had fewer opportunities in the heavy industries of

            <p>In the 1950s black women also progressed further than black men in certain categories of white collar
                    work. This advance reflected national trends during this decade and the next. As white collar jobs
                    grew more significant both within the national and local economies, black women found relatively
                    greater work opportunities in sectors that had a tradition of female employment. They also
                    benefitted from access to better schools in the urban North than the rural South. In the case of
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>

                    workers in 1960 compared with 41 percent and 43 percent in 1950. This gain also reflected the fact
                    that black women tended to stay longer in school than men. From 1944 to 1948, for example, women
                    constituted three-fifths of black high school graduates in Fort <placeName>

            <p>Another consequence of the early transition from the industrial to post-industrial city was the
                    intensification of racial animosity on the part of white workers. More often than not organized

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> locals tended to be less progressive on race than their national bodies. In 194.6, for
                    example, one International Ladies Garment Workers local contravened national policy by threatening
                    strike action in response to a textile firm's decision to employ African Americans for the first
                        time.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Although management's persistence overcame this opposition, few
                    employers were willing to risk confrontation with labor over racial issues. Except for locals of the
                    Hod Carriers and Laborers and the Plasterers and Cement Finishers, both of whom supported fair
                    employment, craft unions exhibited the strongest opposition to black advancement. In 1952 only nine
                    of the thirty-nine affiliates of the Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> Urban League (FWUL) noted that these unions displayed the traditional attitudes of
                    skilled labor on racial issues. Also, many of their members still resented blacks for their
                    strike-breaking activities after World War I. Nevertheless, the report rated the racial record of
                    the FWFL locals as being much worse than their big-city counterparts' and concluded that Fort <placeName>

                    the United Steel Workers (USW). Nevertheless, the influence of blacks within these unions was
                    limited because they did not constitute more than a tenth of any local's membership. Not
                    surprisingly, the UAW and UERMW locals at the International Harvester and General Electric plants,

                    more in principle than in practice. Divided leadership was a problem during World War II. The local
                    president, who was reputed to be a former Ku Klux Klansman, held more liberal officials in check.
                    The more progressive leadership that gained power in the late 1940s proved cautious on racial
                    issues, recognizing that the downswing of the local economy had intensified the hostility of white

                    until General Electric began hiring blacks in 1942; thereafter it developed a firm commitment to

                    seniority rights and encouraging them to be active in union affairs. In the postwar era local 901
                    also mounted a campaign to educate its membership on equal rights for blacks. With the enthusiastic
                    support of district leader John Gojack, other UERMW locals followed its lead. At Magnavox the union
                    backed up its pledge "to work our part" in support of the wartime FEPC. It also
                    won a major concession from the <placeName>

                    this defeat was attributable not only to the communist issue but also to the local leadership's
                    being too far ahead of its rank and file on race issues. There is little evidence to support this

                    concern that some local 901 officials were corrupt. Significantly, UERMW's downfall at General

                    hold the loyalty of existing members, particularly women and African Americans. Moreover, the new
                    IERMW local sustained its predecessor's racial policy, as evidenced by the election of a black

                    council of the FWIUC in 1945, but this body was unable to agree on a united front against racism.
                    Its most high-profile action was to join with civil rights organizations in challenging Jim Crow
                    restrictions in downtown hotels and restaurants prior to the state IUC convention that was held in

                    the industrial front, FWIUC shied away from conducting a fair employment education program allegedly
                    for fear of offending rank-and-file members but also in reality to avoid splits within its own
                    ranks. In the early 1950s over half the FWIUC affiliates openly maintained discriminatory practices.
                    In particular, four locals belonging to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the United Brewery
                    Workers, and the USW (two) colluded with management to prevent the employment of blacks. As one

                    1949 one survey reported: "The competition for jobs since World War II has brought about
                    organized efforts by white workers, both unorganized and labor union members, to prevent Negroes
                    from acquiring employment, especially as production and skilled workers." The upgrading of
                    black workers was a particular bone of contention. Often shop stewards did not sympathize with the
                    progressive intentions of their local and did nothing to protect black rights. After the war white
                    workers reportedly formed unofficial committees to lobby against the promotion of black colleagues.

                    II blacks had lived in well-defined but racially mixed areas of the inner city. By 1960, however, a
                    process of ghettoization had taken shape based on black population expansion, formal and informal
                    restrictions on black settlement in other neighborhoods, and the exodus of white residents. The
                    black in-migrants of the World War I era had clustered in two areas, in the east-central district
                    between downtown and the railroad yards and in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Westfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> housing development, but low-income whites constituted a large majority in both places.
                    Economic circumstance dictated the pattern of African-American settlement because the newcomers
                    could not afford housing elsewhere, particularly after the imposition of discriminatory employment
                    practices in the early 1920~.~~ Since cheap housing was plentiful in both districts, racial
                    competition for dwellings did not provoke serious problems, but the general standard of
                    accommodation was low and deteriorated still further in the depression era. In 1940, 20.1 percent of

            <p>African Americans' better economic circumstances in the 1940s and 1950s did not lead to a comparable
                    improvement in their housing. In spite of rising home ownership, increased racial concentration went
                    hand in hand with substandard housing. The number of dwelling units owned by blacks rose from 228 in
                    1940 to 656 in 1950 and to 1,477 in 1960, by which time almost one-half of all black housing units
                    were owner occupied. Except for the small enclave in West-field, the vast majority of the African
                    Americans continued to reside in the east-central area during this twenty-year period. By 1960
                    blacks made up 40 percent of the population of the five census tracts that covered most of this
                    district; ten years later they constituted a small majority of 53.6 percent. Although in the

                    population—there was hardly residential segregation on a big-city scale. As one observer
                    commented in 1960, there was no street in the east-central area "where black and white

                    deterrent to the sale of homes to blacks. Although claiming to have no official position on such
                    matters, members of the FWREB invariably referred black purchasers to houses in the east-central
                    district. In the two decades after World War II only a handful of well-off black families slipped
                    through the net. The resentment of their white neighbors generally faded away within a few months
                    when it became clear that the African Americans' presence did not presage full-scale black
                    penetration of the neighborhood. There was never the kind of violent response encountered by the

            <p>By 1949 only a ten-block area on Hugh Street adjacent to the east-central district had been opened up
                    to new black settlement. This extension afforded wealthier African Americans the opportunity to
                    purchase one-and two-story homes of moderate quality from whites but at prices well above their
                    normal market value. During the 1940s and for most of the 1950s, however, black families for the
                    most part took over houses in the original zone of black settlement from upwardly mobile whites who
                    profited from postwar prosperity to move into neighborhoods with better housing. But housing demands
                    from an expanding black population eventually required the opening of new areas. In April, 1960,41.5
                    percent of African-American dwellings were occupied by families or individuals who had moved in
                    after January, 1958. In the 1960s, therefore, the line of black settlement was allowed to extend
                    beyond the east-central district to the adjoining neighborhood flanked by Calhoun Street on the
                    west, Drexel Avenue on the south, and Anthony Boulevard on the east. Because housing stock in this

                    reform. Lax enforcement, however, insured that there was little improvement in housing conditions in

                            Administration used the appraisals to red-line those parts of America's central cities in
                            which it would not insure mortgages. For HOLC appraisal see Kenneth T. Jackson,

                    public housing following the passage of the Federal Housing Act of 1949. A decade later the city had
                    only three public housing projects, two of which—Miami Village and Edsall

                    In 1951, however, the board's refusal to permit the transfer of two black basketball stars from
                    Central High School to North Side, the city's top school for sports, highlighted a new policy of
                    promoting racial concentration. In line with this policy, small but significant changes were made in
                    school boundaries after the war. As a result, 75.5 percent of black elementary school pupils were
                    concentrated in three schools by 1949 compared with 53.4 percent twenty years earlier, and 85.1
                    percent of black high school students attended Central High. Local civil rights organizations feared
                    that Central would eventually become an "all-negro" school. In 1940 African
                    Americans constituted an insignificant proportion of Central's students, but they made up a third by
                    1960. Although the school was refurbished and remodeled in 1958, its enrollment of white pupils
                    underwent dramatic reduction. By 1959 Central had only 1,300 pupils, 400 fewer than in 1955, and
                    many classrooms were underutilized at a time of overcrowding in the other Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> high schools. In 1960 the decision to amalgamate Central with the nearby junior high
                    school, which also had a large black enrollment, intensified fears about the school's future,
                    particularly because the decision was contrary to the Board of Education's usual policy of rigidly
                    separating these two levels of school.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>

                    ghettoization. Much of the substandard property in the east-central district was owned by whites,

                    face of the continued decline of the central city. Between 1946 and 1958 four-fifths of all new

                    </placeName>'s Republican administration and the Chamber of Commerce were eager to be in the
                    forefront of this development to symbolize their city's enterprise and initiative, but popular
                    opinion did not reflect their enthusiasm. In late 1946 expressway opponents formed the Property
                    Owners and Taxpayers Association (POTA) to lobby against the project.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many people complained that the parkway project necessitated massive demolition of existing housing
                    units that would displace 15 percent of the city's population at a time when local housing was in
                    short supply. Owner-occupants and businessmen whose properties were likely to be razed to make way
                    for the new roads expressed concern that they would not receive market-value compensation. Other
                    citizens predicted that the project would impose a long-term debt on local taxpayers because Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> had to bear 15 percent of total project costs, officially estimated at $27
                    million but expected by expressway opponents to be far in excess of this figure.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Racial factors, however, were the principal cause of opposition. Because the east-west
                    expressway would run through the heart of the east-central district, black residents would have to
                    be relocated elsewhere. White working-class and lower-middle-class property owners feared for the
                    values of their homes if their neighborhoods were subject to black settlement. Although POTA's
                    leaflets, advertisements, and other printed statements made no mention of race, the anti-expressway
                    movement conducted a "whispering campaign" that planted this fear firmly in the
                    heart of the white community.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Local supporters of the project tried to dispel
                    such anxiety with a counter-campaign, but statements by federal officials provided their opponents

            <p>In spite of popular opposition, the Republican-controlled City Council approved the expressway scheme
                    on December 10, 1946, but the POTA carried the battle to the state legislature. Primarily as a
                    result of lobbying by the taxpayers' association, the Indiana Senate rejected a bill creating a
                    special taxing district to pay the city's share of project costs. The only alternative was a general
                    increase in local property taxes. Nervous about the political repercussions of such an increase,
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s administration decided to submit the expressway project to a referendum, to be held
                    at the time of the 1947 local elections. It was hoped that this would give supporters the
                    opportunity to mold public opinion in favor of the scheme.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The regular Democratic organization, led by businessmen and lawyers who backed the project, agreed to
                    remain neutral on the issue, but their candidate was surprisingly beaten in the mayoral primary.
                    Seeing the expressway controversy as a means to regain control of the local party, old-line
                    Democrats who had been ousted from power in the factional battles of the 1930s backed the candidacy
                    of Henry Branning, a realtor who was a strong opponent of open housing and a critic of the Anthony <placeName>

                    </placeName> Parkway. Banning's nomination insured that the issue remained in the forefront of local
                    politics. Realizing that the highway controversy was the key to an election victory, Democrats used
                    their precinct organizations to keep neighborhood concern about black relocation at a strong pitch
                    and spread the word that the Republicans could not be trusted to abide by the outcome of the
                        referendum.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> This strategy neutralized the efforts of Fort <placeName>

                    focusing attention on the economic benefits of the scheme, including new job creation. In November,
                    1947, voters rejected the expressway project by an emphatic majority of 24,786 (61.7 percent) to
                    15,364 (38.2 percent). Opposition was heaviest from the precincts in the pathway of the planned
                    roads, but only seven precincts, all representing high-income suburban neighborhoods, returned a
                    majority for the scheme. At the same time, the Democrats gained their only municipal victory in the
                    thirty-year period between 1929 and 1959, winning the mayorship with a 59.6 percent share of the
                    popular vote and making their first-ever clean sweep of city offices.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>African Americans voted overwhelmingly against the project. Black property owners, several of whom
                    were active in the POTA, feared that the financial compensation they would receive for their
                    east-side homes would be inadequate to allow them to buy a house elsewhere in the city. Black
                    tenants worried that they would end up with nowhere to live because white landlords would not rent
                    to them in other neighborhoods.<hi rend="sup">55</hi> By election day there was widespread anxiety
                    within the African-American community, encouraged by POTA propaganda, that half its members would be
                    made homeless. The best that could be hoped for, one black resident warned, was "to be
                    herded onto any unwanted land that is available," where conditions would be far worse than

                    black relocation. Known among the black population for his involvement with the Phyllis Wheatley
                    social center, Kilbourne promised that property owners would be compensated two-and-a-half times the
                    assessed value of their dwellings and that the east-side clearance would not take place until 1954.
                    Black critics of the highway scheme placed little credence in these reassurances, pointing out that
                    the Better Homes Foundation lacked capital and had no concrete plans about relocation.<hi rend="sup">57</hi> Judging from the effect of highway construction programs on African Americans in other

                    Deal era. Following its narrow victory in the 1934 municipal elections, the local Republican party
                    made a special effort to broaden its political base in the 1938 contest. Party members appealed to
                    the traditional GOP loyalties of black citizens, who had shown signs of deserting to the Democrats
                    in gratitude for New Deal efforts to alleviate mass unemployment. The Republicans mended fences by
                    nominating William Briggs, the first black candidate in the city's history, as justice of the peace
                    for <placeName>

                    Deal, however, the GOP carried its whole ticket with ease and so had no further need to court the
                    black vote. Although Briggs continued to hold office until his death in 1950, he was powerless to
                    negotiate significant racial change. During the 1940s local Republicans supported segregation of
                    communal facilities, temporized over the construction of the community center, and restricted black
                    patronage to a bare minimum.</p>
            <p>African Americans gained scant reward for their partisan conversion since their support had been less
                    than crucial to the Democratic victory of 1947. Branning, the new mayor, was an avowed opponent of
                    open housing and public housing. His administration also colluded in the reimposition of segregation
                    in downtown hotels and restaurants after the 1949 state industrial union convention. Not until the
                    enactment of a strong state civil rights law in 1963 did segregation of downtown public
                    accommodations end in Fort <placeName>

                    one "colored" officer—and the Public Welfare Department appointed its
                    first black social worker. In addition, the municipal utilities and the school board began to hire
                    blacks as laborers and cleaners. Not until 1952, however, was the first black school teacher
                    appointed; only under a Republican administration in 1956 did the municipal utilities employ a black
                    meter reader; and employment in the fire service remained closed to blacks until the 1960s.<hi rend="sup">61</hi> In spite of such limited rewards, blacks became progressively more active as

                    National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was established in 1946, about
                    half of whose members were white. One of its black founders avowed, "We do want to wake
                    this very reactionary city to its often unrealized discriminations." The NAACP spearheaded
                    the challenge to segregation in Fort <placeName>

                    facilities that practiced Jim Crow. The association earned respect among African Americans for its
                    forthright stand but achieved only sporadic success before the enactment of the state civil rights
                    act of 1963.<hi rend="sup">63</hi>

                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> chapter of the Urban League (FWUL) became increasingly involved in seeking to improve
                    housing and employment conditions for African Americans. The organization's activism was
                    constrained, however, because it remained tied to the white power structure through financial
                    dependence on the city's United Fund. Good relations with local elites enabled it to win small but
                    well-publicized successes in opening up new employment opportunities. In 1949, for example, Robert
                    Wilkerson, the executive secretary, persuaded Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>'s largest department store to hire its first black clerical worker. Nevertheless, the
                    FWUL was broadly perceived by blacks as a "white organization" that was allowed
                    occasional successes to keep racial trouble from brewing.<hi rend="sup">64</hi>

            <p>But the mass of black citizens showed little inclination to unite in challenging discrimination until
                    the national civil rights revolution of the 1960s. Several factors limited the potential for
                    protest, notably the absence of a sizable middle class, the continuing influence of the black clergy
                    who eschewed social activism and whose congregations formed subgroups among the African-American
                    community, and the view of recent newcomers from the South that racial conditions in Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> were tolerable. In 1963 one survey of the black community concluded that it was
                    "an amorphous mass that is not geared to the accomplishment of much of any political or

            <p>From 1940 to 1960 jobs and housing were the main concerns of African Americans in Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Their experience on both these fronts replicated developments in big cities in some
                    respects but differed in others. Like metropolitan blacks, they found their employment opportunities
                    constrained by a combination of discrimination and structural change, but their status as latecomers
                    to the industrial city made their situation more precarious. The Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> factory gates were only half open to them, and those who got inside lacked job security
                    and promotion prospects. In contrast to the post-World War I era, the opposition of white labor
                    constituted a greater obstacle to black occupational mobility than the racial prejudices of
                    management. In terms of housing, the process of black ghettoization was not as far advanced in Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> as in large cities. According to historians Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton, at the end
                    of the 1960s "the average black city dweller lived in a neighborhood where the vast
                    majority of his or her neighbors were also black."<hi rend="sup">67</hi> As late as 1970,

                    </placeName>'s African Americans lived in racially mixed neighborhoods. Neverthless, formal and
                    informal mechanisms to control black settlement had been in operation since the early 1940s. Black
                    Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> may not have been a ghetto in the accepted metropolitan sense, but blacks were confined
                    to the most run-down parts of the inner city where substandard housing was widespread. At least
                    African Americans in this Hoosier city escaped the ravages of urban reconstruction visited on black
                    communities in many big cities, but it was significant that they were delivered from this evil by
                    the racism of white Fort <placeName>

                    </placeName> in the 1947 highway referendum. Overall, however, the case of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName> attests more to the universality than to the diversity of the black urban experience in
                    the North in the mid-twentieth century. By 1960 racial discrimination in jobs and housing was as
                    firmly established in its own form in this Indiana industrial city as in the northern metropolises
                    where African Americans had settled in large numbers long before 1940.</p>

            <p>In the annual report of the Indiana Department of Geology and Natural Resources for 1897, Willis
                    Blatchley, then state geologist, discussed the organic and inorganic theories of the origin of oil
                    and gas. Blatchley supported T. Sterry Hunt's organic theory, which had first been proposed in the
                    early 1860s. Known as the primary decomposition theory, it stated that petroleum had "been
                    formed from the remains of animals or plants in the rock strata <hi rend="i">now</hi> yielding the
                    oil…." The oil and gas did not migrate from their origin in the shales; instead,
                    the animal or plant remains "passed directly into petroleum which has since remained in the
                    rocks where it was formed." According to Blatchley, "the fads gathered and
                    observations made in the Trenton-limestone fields of these States [<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana] have furnished much evidence in support of his [Hunt's] theory."
                    Scientists, said Blatchley, accepted the notion that limestone and oil resulted from "the
                    direct decomposition of organisms originally inhabiting the water in which the rock was
                        deposited."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Most petroleum geologists from the late-nineteenth century to the present have agreed with Willis
                    Blatchley that organic theories for the origin of oil and gas comport better with the known facts on
                    the formation of petroleum than do the inorganic theories. Blatchley also observed that inorganic
                    theories, such as those of M. Berthelot and Dimitriy Ivanovich Mendeljeff, were</p>

                        fast as they are used. Such a belief is responsible for much of the reckless waste which has
                        taken place in the gas fields of Indiana in the past; a waste which has already brought the
                        stored supply down close to the limit at which the natural rock pressure of the gas is overcome

                    "only at depths ranging from 500 to 1,600 feet below the surface." Then, too,
                    there were no trends of a northwest-southeast or northeast-southwest direction to follow in the
                    search for oil and gas pools. For that reason, as Blatchley noted, oil and gas "operations
                    in Indiana have always an element of chance connected with them." The state geologist also
                    discounted the use of "hazel rods or what not." He stated: "There is one
                    instrument, and but one, that can be used in locating oil, and that is the drill. All others are and
                    ever will be humbugs…."<hi rend="sup">13</hi>

            <p>In his report of 1907 Blatchley commented on the decrease in petroleum production in Indiana for
                    1905. One reason for the decline involved a decrease in the price for oil and gas. In addition, the
                    beginning of the boom in southeastern <placeName>

                    </placeName> attracted oil operators away from Indiana. In that regard Blatchley complained:
                    "The average oil operator is much like the gold prospector. He is usually eager to let the
                    bird in hand escape when he sees or hears of a new one in the bush."<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Willis Blatchley's knowledge about petroleum in Indiana, especially in the Lima-Indiana Field, came
                    in large part from the findings of the drill. Information gained from the boring of thousands of
                    holes indicated that four conditions must be met "before an accumulation and preservation
                    of oil in commercial quantities can take place": a porous stratum of the Trenton rock to
                    form a reservoir, an impervious cover above the reservoir, an arched or anticlinal structure of the
                    rock in which the reservoir is located, and a pressure behind the oil to force it into the
                    reservoir. The impervious cover for the Trenton limestone was about two hundred feet of Utica
                        shale.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Willis Blatchley's day the pressure behind the oil and gas was known as rock pressure.
                    "Sometimes," Blatchley wrote, "this pressure is so great that when the
                    oil stratum is reached the boring tools are expelled from the drill hole, and the oil escapes in a
                    fountain, rising high above the derrick, much of it being lost before the flow can be
                        controlled."<hi rend="sup">16</hi> That rock pressure resulted from the presence of
                    large quantities of water impinging on the petroleum from the side and came to be called
                    water-drive.</p>

            <p>The Cold War lasted as long as the period between the Franco-Prussian War and World War I (about
                    forty-four years). The earlier period has long been a happy hunting ground for diplomatic
                    historians, who have produced a library of monographs, source collections, and interpretive
                    syntheses on the subject. We are now filling bookshelves with Cold War histories, mostly written
                    from a one-sided viewpoint reflecting limited access to archives. In his latest book John Lewis
                    Gaddis calls for a new generation of Cold War synthesists, using archival material from the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName> bloc, <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>, and North <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> in addition to much Western material hitherto shut away. He modestly confesses that he
                    himself relies on secondary sources here instead of direct archival access, and he specifies and
                    recants errors in his past books—for example, on the outcome of the Cuban missile crisis.</p>
            <p>The organization of the book turns out to be quite different from most syntheses on the background
                    and causes of World War I. After a brief introduction on World War I and the interwar period, Gaddis
                    progresses from the last years of World War II through the Cuban missile crisis, moving back and
                    forth through these years, subject by subject: World War II settlement, rival empires and
                    ideologies, nuclear arms, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and the Third World. Unfortunately, instead of increasing the detail and intensity of
                    the analysis as it approaches the collapse of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-ur">Soviet Union</country>
                    </placeName>, he breaks off in the mid-1960s and ends by laying out guidelines for a "new
                    Cold War history." The 1970s and 1980s are barely mentioned; for example, the Reagan
                    administration is relegated to a noncommittal paragraph.</p>
            <p>This organization grows out of Gaddis's latest interpretation of the Cold War. According to him,
                    communism collapsed because of "internal contradictions" between authoritarianism
                    and capitalism. In his words, "reforms intended to restore competitiveness shattered
                    authority both internally and within the international communist movement" (p. 191). This
                    determinist thesis is already familiar to historians. But Gaddis does not reject the role of
                    leaders—indeed, the errors of Joseph Stalin loom large in explaining many of the Western
                    successes, for more than once his measures brought about the very effects they were intended to
                    avoid. Also the rest of Gaddis's analysis is mostly devoted to diplomatic strategy and manipulation,
                    military advances, and ideological friction. If communism was doomed to fail, it was apparently
                    pushed to its doom by the actions of Soviet and Western statesmen.</p>
            <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-095-1-075"/>
            <p>Samples of Gaddis's views on the principal problems of Cold War historiography during the 1940s,
                    1950s, and 1960s will show how he handles these problems in the context of his general thesis. He
                    accepts Harry Truman's explanation of dropping the A-bomb—that it was a military measure
                    to end the war quickly—and shows that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> gained only brief nuclear hegemony thereafter and could not even use the bomb as the
                    basis for aggressive diplomacy. On one hand Stalin created an empire in eastern Europe through
                    deliberate action, careful to avoid a war he did not have the strength to fight, while on the other
                    hand American strength was usually prepared to thwart any planned Soviet empire-building. Stalin
                    risked the success of his plans by failing to restrain the brutality of Soviet soldiers, especially
                    in East <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and by failing to build some flexibility into the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Warsaw</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pact. In contrast, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> encouraged democracy by flexible occupation policies in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> and cooperation with the European allies in NATO—and with the help of the
                    frightening Soviet acts.</p>
            <p>Gaddis uses monographic literature in describing the complicated three-way diplomacy between the
                    USSR, the Chinese communists, and North <placeName>
                        <country reg="ko">Korea</country>
                    </placeName> that led to the Korean War, but he explains the end of the war more
                    simply—the death of Stalin removed the one man who favored continuing it because it
                    revealed American weakness. During the 1950s, Gaddis goes on, any chance to end the Cold War failed
                    because neither side would tolerate the other's world view or wanted to risk war to realize its own.
                    As for the Chinese, they appear here and there throughout the last half of the book. At first Mao
                    Zedong often imitated Soviet methods—Gaddis suggests that the Great Leap Forward was
                    partly inspired by the Stakhanovite speedup. Eventually Mao came to respect Stalin less and less
                    because he gave insufficient aid during the Korean War, but he continued to believe in Soviet
                    military power into the 1960s.</p>
            <p>As that decade began, the USSR seemed superior to the U.S. in military matters, while the Americans
                    tended to undervalue their more genuine political, economic, and ideological advantages. But Nikita
                    Khrushchev's apparent military margin was the product of "Potemkinism," by which
                    Gaddis means Khrushchev's penchant for bluffing about weapons. This practice led Mao, the East
                    German Walter Ulbricht, and Fidel Castro to expect more military support from the Soviets than
                    Khrushchev was prepared to give. Gaddis also faults Dwight Eisenhower for overemphasizing nuclear
                    weapons at the risk of making war seem so terrible as to be impossible. For his part, John F.
                    Kennedy created his own risk by allowing the defense department to reveal its understanding of
                    Khrushchev's boasting and thereby "expose Moscow's Maximum Leader onstage and in full view
                    of the audience as the Wizard of OZ" (p. 259).</p>
            <p>The climax of Gaddis's account of these deceptions and misunderstandings is, of course, the Cuban
                    missile crisis. He thinks <pb n="68" id="VAA4025-095-1-076"/> Khrushchev interpreted the Bay of Pigs
                    attempt to invade <placeName>
                        <country reg="cu">Cuba</country>
                    </placeName> as showing not so much American weakness as American aggressiveness and expected the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to invade again with a stronger force. While Gaddis joins those historians who have
                    attributed the missile crisis to Khrushchev's desire to protect Castro, he finds the fundamental
                    cause in the Soviet realization that the USSR was losing the Cold War. He differs from the majority
                    view of the crisis in rating Kennedy's handling of it less tough and Khrushchev's victory more
                    substantial than imagined. Thereafter Americans were content with a military faceoff, unaware or
                    ignoring that this was the only part of the contest in which the Soviets could make a respectable
                    showing. As a result, the Cold War continued for over two more decades, although its outcome was
                    already determined.</p>
            <p>This is hardly the last word on the subject. For example, Ronald Reagan's admirers will insist that
                    Star Wars and America's increased defense spending during the 1980s so overburdened the Soviets'
                    economy that the whole system broke down. Other explanations will have their partisans too. We shall
                    need more archival materials and preliminary monographs before we can reliably explain the 1970s and
                    1980s. Then future synthesizers can fit the last half of the Cold War onto the first half and
                    complete the analysis that Gaddis has begun here. By that time the Korean War, the missile crisis,
                    and MIRV will have joined the Russo-Turkish War, the Bosnian crisis, and Dreadnought as features on
                    the landscape of modern diplomatic history.</p>

                    index. $34.95.)</head>
            <p>Few Native American leaders have received more popular and scholarly attention than the Shawnee
                    warrior Tecumseh (c. 1768-1813). John Sugden, a British scholar who previously wrote <hi rend="i">Tecumseh's Last Stand</hi> (1985), presents a thoroughly researched and authoritative study of
                    this chieftain. It should remain the standard study for years to come.</p>
            <p>Central to Sugden's biography is the thesis that Tecumseh was "the most ambitious of a small
                    number of leaders who dreamed of a brotherhood of tribes capable of resisting white expansion, and
                    who tried to replace intertribal indifference and conflict with unity and common purpose"
                    (p. ix). This argument rests upon at least two critical assumptions: that war was the only solution
                    to the Indians' dilemma and that intertribal cooperation was feasible. Sugden never <pb n="69" id="VAA4025-095-1-077"/> confronts the first assumption and never proves that a significant
                    "Tecumseh coalition" existed. For Sugden, as for Tecumseh and his prophetic
                    brother Tenskwatawa, preservation of a hunting-based society and traditional religious values
                    justified an alliance with the perfidious British. Sugden fails to consider the policy pursued by
                    the majority of Shawnees under the leadership of Black Hoof and William Anderson, i.e., adapting to
                    the Euro-American's values and economic system in order to salvage a modified Indian culture in the
                    American Middle West. The rivalry between the accommodationist and warrior wings of the Shawnee and
                    other middle-western tribes reached the intensity of inter-and intratribal warfare. It finally
                    resulted in William Henry Harrison's having more Shawnee warriors at the battle of the Thames than
                    did Tecumseh.</p>
            <p>Sugden has done a prodigious amount of work in primary and secondary sources. He openly confronts
                    contradictory evidence and comes to his own conclusions regarding tribal and family movements. There
                    are so many blanks in the Shawnee brothers' background and conduct that any biographer must resort
                    to supposition and conjecture to fill in the spaces and use conditional verbs and cautionary
                    clauses. Sugden knows all too well that in "many episodes of Tecumseh's life, the truth has
                    been buried beneath mythology" (p. 182).</p>
            <p>Although diligent readers will find his bibliography extensive, they might wish he had consulted the
                    recent studies by Harvey Lewis Carter on Little Turtle, Leroy Eid on Indian tactics, and Larry
                    Nelson on the battle of Fort Recovery. Their conclusions might have enlarged his perspective on the
                    quarter-century struggle for the land between the Great Lakes and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio River</region>
                    </placeName>. At times he does not seem to have assimilated fully the findings of Colin Calloway,
                    Gregory Evans Dowd, R. David Edmunds, and Richard White.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Sugden falls into the biographer's trap, becoming so close to his subject that he sees the
                    world from Tecumseh's perspective. He contends, for example, that the Shawnee warrior "Blue
                    Jacket had been the most important leader of the northwestern confederacy of the 1790s" (p.
                    131). Most would give principal leadership in the disastrous defeat of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Army at the battle of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> in 1791 to the Miami chieftain Little Turtle. He sometimes exaggerates, e.g., in
                    describing the small engagement at Brownstown, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, in 1812 as "one of the most remarkable victories in Indian history: seldom
                    had so inferior a force administered so severe a defeat at such little loss to themselves"
                    (p. 293). In another instance, Sugden makes Tecumseh, not General Sir Isaac Brock, "a
                    principal architect" (p. 305) in the surrender of the American garrison at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The central problem with any study of Tecumseh lies with determining just how much influence the
                    Shawnee warrior had in developing a united opposition to American advancement. In all probability
                    the Red Stick faction of the Creeks would have warred with the whites and many of their fellow

                    </placeName> frontier should be given more to British fur trader Robert Dickson than to either
                    Tecumseh's persuasiveness or Tenskwatawa's prophecies. Sugden's arguments to the contrary
                    notwithstanding, the powerful Maumee-<geogName>Wabash valley</geogName> confederacy of the 1790s had
                    little to do with Mohawk chieftain Joseph Brant and focused more on the Miamis than the Shawnees.</p>
            <p>Sugden writes with verve and a compelling style. For instance, he describes William Hull as
                    "turning his problems into dragons" just before the general surrendered <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 298). Sugden's conclusion summarizes the entire book "Among all the
                    leaders in that brave but futile Indian revolt, Tecumseh stands out because of his outstanding
                    versatility and energy. Not only was his ambition boundless, but his eloquence made him the voice of
                    the oppressed, his magnetism bound people to him, and he was an inspirational field
                    commander" (p. 401).</p>
            <p>Our fascination with Tecumseh reflects American support of an underdog who fights the good fight for
                    what are perceived to be good motives against great odds. But Tecumseh could not control his allies,
                    and their tactics and atrocities turned the Americans against all Indians. Tecumseh's war parties
                    destroyed the path sought by Black Hoof and Anderson. In the end, as his frequent opponent Lewis
                    Cass reported, Tecumseh sacrificed "the happiness of his people to his own impracticable
                    objects" (p. 401).</p>

                    analyzing town development before 1820, during the transportation revolution to 1850, in the Civil
                    War era to 1880 (including the decline in steamboat transportation and the rise of the railroads),
                    and during the age of industrialization to 1920. Thereafter, the automobiles and trucks, paved road
                    networks, corporate consolidation (particularly for railroads), and urbanization to the north
                    changed the region dramatically, removing the towns and people from their close association with the <placeName>

            <p>Bigham makes his greatest contribution to our understanding of the lower <geogName>Ohio

            <p>Floods, river depth, county seat status, and cultural heritage as well as entrepreneurship, nearby

            <p>In this meticulously and extensively researched book sociologist Wilma A. Dunaway argues that the
                    frontier of southern Appalachia fits neatly into the modern world-system paradigm developed over the
                    last quarter century by Immanuel Wallerstein. Dunaway's study includes parts of nine states:
                            <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>, <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>, <region type="state" reg="mdu">Maryland</region>, <country reg="ncu">North Carolina</country>, <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Instead of viewing this region as an isolated, undeveloped frontier, she contends that
                    from its earliest settlement it was linked to the capitalist world system.</p>
            <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-095-1-080"/>
            <p>Dunaway opens with a theoretical analysis of the transition to capitalism in southern
                    Appalachia—one of the arenas in which <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>,
                            <country reg="fr">France</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> competed for "core" status in the world economy. Chapters two and
                    three deal with the incorporation of the Cherokee slave-fur trade into the world market and
                    landholding patterns. In chapter four Dunaway insists that farmers in the region used slave and wage
                    labor to produce marketable surpluses. Then in the next chapter she employs cliometric techniques to
                    counter the fiction of "subsistent homesteaders." Following a treatment of the
                    growth of antebellum industry, Dunaway devotes chapters to the region's supposed geographical
                    isolation and economic autonomy. In chapter nine Dunaway discusses the political and social
                    "articulation" of the region with the capitalist world system. The final chapter
                    traces the decline of the economy, which resulted in the deepening peripheralization of the region.</p>
            <p>This extremely complex work, filled with interpretive nuances and quantified data, touches on
                    virtually every aspect of life in southern Appalachia. Surely it will add to the considerable
                    historiographical disputes among western and frontier historians. In a sense, Dunaway's book may be
                    considered a companion to Patricia Limerick's work. Limerick views the trans-<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> West in terms of conquest; Dunaway sees southern Appalachia from the perspective of
                    exploitation. Hence one supposes that the "new western" historians will be quite
                    comfortable with this book. Their critics definitely will not be.</p>
            <p>Whether or not one appreciates the author's point of view, the book is a veritable encyclopedia of
                    economic, geographical, political, and social data. Topics range from gold and coal mines to oil
                    wells, from slave cabins to elegant spas, from rivers to rails, from canal barges to steamboats,
                    from turkey drives to stockyards, from ethnicity to environment. Dunaway's discussion of labor
                    articulation with the world economy is particularly interesting, but her treatment of Cherokee
                    cultural disintegration is fairly standard. As do many historians, Dunaway views Thomas Jefferson as
                    simply a land grabber. This interpretation is a misreading of the sources.</p>
            <p>Dunaway describes her statistical techniques in a chapter-length appendix; Stanley A. Engerman and
                    Immanuel Wallerstein were among her readers. One does not have to be a quantifier, however, to
                    appreciate the author's exhaustive research. Her bibliography includes seven pages of manuscript
                    sources, nine pages of published primary sources, and thirty-one pages of secondary works. Some,
                    perhaps many, scholars who study the southern frontier will disagree with the thesis of <hi rend="i">The First American Frontier</hi>, but it is a work that for many years will be the subject of
                    considerable commentary and analysis.</p>

            <p>It is now generally believed by historians that the fall of Fort Donelson to the Union in February of
                    1862 was a truly decisive event in the Civil War. Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Cooling, one of the very best military historians of war in the West, is well aware of
                    this. He writes, "The western defense perimeter of the Confederacy had crumbled, rebel
                    forces from West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>

                    </placeName>" (p. 26). The almost uninterrupted Union advance in the West—where
                    the war was won and lost—may be said to have begun at Donelson, from which it proceeded,
                    sometimes haltingly, to Corinth, Stones River, Vicks-burg, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Chattanooga</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
               </placeName>, and the
                    March to the Sea. Cooling's intent, however, is not to tell this large story. As suggested by the
                    book's subtitle, <hi rend="i">War and Society in <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>

                        </placeName>, 1862-1863</hi>, his book concerns the relatively unknown, day-to-day war after
                    Donelson in those states, and it tells an interesting and grim tale of bushwhacking, guerrilla
                    warfare, and vengeance. The point is that this geography was strategically significant and contained
                    a volatile mix of citizens with deeply felt and conflicting loyalties to North and South. Once the
                    Confederacy's defeat at Donelson opened this area—the <geogName>Mississippi
                    valley</geogName>—to further Union penetration, it became a donnybrook of regular and
                    irregular warfare.</p>
            <p>Federal forces in this western theater were dominated by soldiers from Indiana and the other states
                    of the Old Northwest. Further, people from the upland South migrated to Indiana before, during, and
                    after the war. Thus, Hoosiers have a special relationship to this area. Cooling has dug deeply to
                    find this unknown story. It suggests a moral: civil wars are not nice for the combative people left

                        American Women on the Home Front</hi>, Judy Barrett Litoff collected previously neglected
                    writings of women who were separated from loved ones by war. Now she has edited a unique and
                    enjoyable volume of family letters. The Berman children of <placeName>

                    their father, army physician Reuben Berman. <hi rend="i">Dear Poppa</hi> provides "the
                    first significant opportunity to incorporate the actual wartime voices of America's children into
                    accounts of the Second World War," since William Tuttle used <hi rend="i">retrospective</hi> letters in the acclaimed "<hi rend="i">Daddy's Gone to War":
                        The Second World War in the Lives of America's Children</hi> (p. ix).</p>
            <p>Litoff s excellent introduction describes the family's adjustment to relocation, separation, and
                    other wartime hardships in the framework of the war's impact on millions, including many Hoosiers
                    who will identify with the Bermans. Sammy, five, struggled to comprehend "I wish you would
                    come back. That's all I want to say" (p. 15). David, nine, worried shortly after Reuben
                    left, "I hope you are not dead already" (p. 20). A mythical
                    "perfect" father developed: "everybody is older, meaner, and generally
                    not as nice as poppa" (p. 40). Sammy muddled fantasy with fear for and of poppa:
                    "I hope you don't get killed in the invasion. If you come back and spank me I will have the
                    right to make you feel badder than anything and tell you that you are not like Abraham Lincoln so
                    you had better not come back and spank me…. I hope you're not shot because if you're shot
                    I'll feel very bad because I would like to have a poppa, you same poppa, that same poppa"
                    (pp. 123-24). Isabel naturally hoped for Reuben's imminent return, acknowledging in November, 1943,
                    "putting off the purchase of overshoes in the hope that you might come back and we would go
                    someplace where overshoes are not needed" (p. 51).</p>
            <p>The war shaped play and entertainment. The children bought war bonds, enjoyed gender-differentiated
                    war toys, watched war movies, planted victory gardens, and even dreamed about the war. Thus
                    generally these were very ordinary children caught in "no ordinary time." Yet
                    while some aspects of their homefront experience were typical, others were not: these were
                    semiprivileged officer's children, unusually attentive to music lessons and to their Jewish
                    heritage. The Bermans should especially be saluted for their candor in depicting Isabel and Reuben's
                    religious differences. When David disdained his mother's Reform Judaism, Isabel appealed to Reuben:
                    "Now, you may have your views and I mine, but in your absence I am in charge. Some hint to
                    David that his parents agree on where he should go might be in order" (p. 128).</p>
            <p>Though Litoff might have illuminated the text more effectively with more annotation, she does
                    frequently include the parents' accompanying letters as reference points. The pictures and
                    illustrations include many poignant children's drawings. Daughter and compiler Ruth Berman also
                    provides a prelude and all-too-brief postlude. This attractively packaged volume should inspire more
                    families to dig through their attics and memories.</p>

            <p>The editor of this interesting collection of essays claims that "to rethink Native American
                    history is to use new theories and methodologies, and introducing this revisionist approach is the
                    purpose of this book" (p. 3). This "new version" of American Indian
                    history ostensibly challenges earlier scholarship. In fact, rather than rethinking the subject, most
                    of the authors merely review extant research published years or even decades ago. James Axtell
                    concludes that, despite imperfections, ethnohistory remains "the sharpest, most
                    comprehensive, most inclusive, most flexible tool we have" for writing the history of
                    America's native peoples (p. 23). William T. Hagan's "The New Indian History" is
                    essentially a bibliographical essay on the books he has collected over the last ten years. Those
                    interested in women's studies will find the fifteen pages of references accompanying the excellent
                    essays by Glenda Riley and Theda Perdue on the historiography and ethnohistory of native women very
                    useful. In "Indian Peoples and the Natural World," Richard White rejects the
                    upstreaming approach commonly used in ethnohistory and expresses a preference for traditional
                    historical practice. Donald L. Fixico concludes the collection with yet another bibliographical
                    essay.</p>
            <p>The least useful chapter was written by the only Native American contributor. In "Power of
                    the Spoken Word," Angela C. Wilson, a Dakota who is a doctoral student in history, comes
                    dangerously close to advocating a proprietary history controlled by insiders. First she accuses
                    historians of ignoring oral traditions, and then she insists that oral traditions should escape the
                    critical scrutiny commonly applied to written documents. In short, American Indian history must be
                    as native people perceive it and "should be kept beyond the reach of historical
                    analysis" (p. 114). The best "rethinking" involves striking a compromise
                    in the contested terrain between a traditional historical objectivism and a postmodernist-influenced
                    historical relativism. Wilson's extreme position is likely to be ignored and has already been
                    overshadowed by the efforts of many aboriginal people who reject the facile dichotomy between
                    Western and non-Western approaches.</p>
            <p>All of the contributors are professors or students of history in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> universities, and this has had a significant impact on the book. First, there is an
                    emphasis on "Indians" who lived in what are now the forty-eight contiguous states.
                    This would hardly matter except for the following: when it comes to the indigenous inhabitants of
                    North America, the border between the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> is largely irrelevant, and a great deal of the rethinking that has occurred has
                    actually been generated by Canadian scholars who long ago dropped the anachronistic appellation
                    "Indian" from their <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-095-1-084"/> professional discourse.
                    Second, it is axiomatic that exploring the past cultures of non-Western peoples who have occupied
                    this continent for thousands of years necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. While most of the
                    contributors are highly respected members of their academic guild, they simply do not have a command
                    of the voluminous anthropological, archaeological, and other literatures. The absence of essays from
                    representatives of these other disciplines is perhaps the book's greatest weakness.</p>

                    scholars and the person to whom the volume is dedicated. James P. Ronda points out that Jefferson
                    described <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> as "the center of our western operations." Although Jefferson himself
                    never ventured beyond the Appalachian Mountains, "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>
                    </placeName> faces West," reports Ronda in his helpful introduction, "and we
                    expect its builder to be somehow western as well" (p. xii). In fact, even before the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson's vision of the country's republican destiny presupposed that white
                    Americans on the Atlantic seaboard would, for generations to come, have easy access to fresh lands
                    beyond the Alleghenies. Because land ownership seemed to him the surest foundation for the
                    independence and civic virtue that undergirded a healthy republican polity, Jefferson
                    "never doubted that the rural West was the ultimate guarantor of republican
                    virtue" (p. xvi).</p>
            <p>Readers interested in the manifold tensions between this Jefferson vision and the actual course of
                    western history will find much of value here. For example, anthropologist Anthony F. C. Wallace
                    devotes considerable attention to President Jefferson's correspondence with William Henry Harrison
                    when Harrison was governor of the Indiana Territory and superintendant of Indian Affairs for lands
                    north of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and emphasizes that Jefferson's dealings with Native American tribes revealed
                    "the ruthlessness of a benevolent zealot who would do virtually anything to ensure that his
                    new, free <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-095-1-085"/> American republic survived and grew" (p. 39).
                    Peter Onuf provides arguably the best analysis available of Jefferson's tortured response to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> controversy of 1819-1820 over the westward expansion of slavery and black Americans.
                    Environmental policy analyst Robert Gottlieb, though he makes nary a reference to the Sage of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Monticello</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Denver</settlement>
                    </placeName>, San Diego, and Seattle. As Patricia Nelson Limerick asserts in the concluding essay,
                    "the second most complicated aspect of applying Jeffersonian thought to the contemporary
                    West, second after the issue of race, is the issue of the gap, and even the hostility, between the
                    rural West and the urban West" (p. 189).</p>

            <p>Although "Manifest Destiny" is a phrase used to describe American expansion in the
                    thirty years before the Civil War, the movement dates back to the beginning of the colonial era. The
                    first territorial expansionists were the first British settlers who planted their feet on the shores
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> in 1607. Territorial claims played a central role in all four of the Anglo-French
                    colonial wars in North America (1689-1763). Within twenty years of the British triumph in 1763, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had become the principal arbiter of the New World.</p>
            <p>Even though the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> emerged from the revolution with very generous boundaries, the nation's appetite for
                    territory was far from sated. In a remarkable half century (1803-1853), the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> more than tripled its size. Nor did this expansionist impulse die out with the Civil
                    War. Casting its gaze overseas, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the Gilded Age established an empire that stretched from Alaska to <placeName>
                        <country reg="pr">Puerto Rico</country>
                    </placeName> in the New World and from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to the Philippines in the Pacific. Depending on one's perspective, American expansion
                    was either the product of a great folk movement that realized Jefferson's noble vision of an Empire
                    for Liberty, or the story of a ruthless and aggressive people who tried to buy what they wanted and
                    took what they could not buy, running roughshod over the rights of all who got in the way.</p>

                    remaining territory in North America.</p>
            <p>Although the broad outlines of this story are well known to specialists, the details lie scattered in
                    a host of monographs, articles, and popular works published over the last seventy-five years. The
                    strength of this work is that it draws these threads together and presents them in a single, compact
                    book. Unfortunately, the work rarely rises above the level of summary. The authors rely mainly on
                    secondary sources and printed primary sources. As a result, they must speculate on some issues that
                    a more thorough examination of the sources almost surely would have clarified. The authors' failure
                    to mine fully the papers of Jefferson, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

                    collections have been microfilmed and thus are widely available.</p>
            <p>Readers will find this work a serviceable overview of American expansion into the Gulf Coast region,
                    but a definitive and compelling account based on a thorough review of the abundant source material
                    remains to be written.</p>

                    distinguished historian Robert W. Johannsen, who also provides, given the title of the collection, a
                    crucially important essay on "The Meaning of Manifest Destiny," linking it to the
                    distinctive political discourse of the day rather than to the common-sense rhetoric of the middle
                    class. Romanticism figured strongly in this discourse, which linked Whigs, Democrats, southerners,
                    and even Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas as strange rhetorical bedfellows.</p>
            <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-095-1-087"/>
            <p>John M. Belohlavek chastises lawyer Caleb Cushing for trying to be on both sides of the expansion
                    question at once. Since Cushing was a lawyer, this should not surprise anyone. Nor should Cushing's
                    Newberyport statement that "men, nations, races, may, must, will
                    perish…" be surprising, because it is true, as every serious historian will
                    attest; immortality is left to the gods, and Cushing was not one of them. Likewise it is no news
                    that George Catlin and Henry Thoreau opposed westward expansion (despite the famous quotation from
                    Thoreau to the effect that "westward I go free") though Thomas R. Hietala appears
                    to think it is.</p>
            <p>Samuel J. Watson's piece on the role of professional army officers such as John E. Wool, Zachary
                    Taylor, and Winfield Scott in preventing filibusters into <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> in the pre-Mexican War period is contradicted by Robert E. May in his concluding essay,
                    "Manifest Destiny's Filibusters." Nonetheless, Watson's discussion of Whig
                    political views and the disciplined restraint of the professional military with regard to expansion
                    helps put to rest the assumption that the military always start the wars. It is a valuable lesson.</p>
            <p>By far the best essay in this collection is Sam W. Haynes's "Anglo-phobia and the Annexation
                    of <placeName>

                    the most powerful nation on earth, presented to an already fragmented <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Many feared, and rightly so, that if Britain somehow gained control of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName>, it could control the world's cotton market and in so doing threaten the mills of the
                    North as well as the planters of the South; and by playing off one against the other, it could
                    disrupt the fragile Union. The cause of antislavery was the lever that could bring about this
                    disruption, which it did later anyway. British control of <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> western expansion, which many policymakers regarded as a safety valve for northern
                    worker discontent. As this reviewer wrote long ago in When the <hi rend="i">Eagle Screamed: The
                        Romantic Horizon in American Diplomacy</hi>, Great Britain's machinations in regard to <placeName>

                    Bulwer Treaty of 1850, and its fleet patrolling the Nicaraguan coast amounted to a policy now
                    familiar to Americans who understand the Truman Doctrine of "containment."
                    Haynes's essay, however, has two faults. By using the word "Anglophobia" he
                    implies that Americans were irrational in their fears, and by failing to note the danger of the
                    British Balkanization of North America—an imperial policy Great Britain pursued elsewhere
                    on the globe, especially in the Middle East and the Balkans—he does not go far enough in
                    analyzing the implications of Britain's potential threat to the <placeName>

            <p>Paul W. Gates's career as an historian opened with his first published article in 1931, when he was
                    thirty, and apparently closed with his most recent book in 1991, when he was ninety. He became the
                    acknowledged dean of historians of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> public domain and in addition directed many students who became accomplished historians
                    themselves. Among them are Allan and Margaret Bogue, who have rendered an important service by
                    bringing together nine of Gates's essays in this collection. They also provide a biographical
                    sketch, a list of Gates's books and essays, and a five-page "Memoir" by Gates
                    himself on his work and his collaboration with his wife, Lillian Cowdell Gates. Gates's corpus is
                    one of the most important in American historical scholarship in this century, and this book is both
                    deserved and needed.</p>
            <p>At first glance, one wonders why the editors did not include what they rightly call
                    "probably the most influential article that [Gates] ever wrote," the 1936 <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> essay called "The Homestead Act in an
                    Incongruous Land System," or a segment from his monumental book, <hi rend="i">History of
                        Public Land Law Development</hi> (1968). But the Bogues instead include Gates's own revisions
                    and second thoughts of 1963 on the Homestead Act essay, which is even more worth reading, and they
                    may have decided that the 1968 book is too massive to yield a representative abstract. They also
                    include Gates's 1942 critique of speculators, who frustrated the fiontier-egalitarian ideals he so
                    favored; a 1957 essay on the sharp class divisions that existed on settlement frontiers and that the
                    Turnerian tradition glossed over; and excerpts from <hi rend="i">The <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>

            <p>One essay (now sounding quite Anglocentric) from Gates's extensive writings on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> land disposal, so different from the Midwest's, appears here. In another Gates offers
                    an analysis of the shift from Jeffersonian individualism to government regulation in land policy,
                    and there is an outspoken article of 1985 in which Gates declared that "the West's greatest
                    opponent is not colonialism… <pb n="81" id="VAA4025-095-1-089"/> [but] its own opposition
                    to policies that would do much to improve its ranges… water resources… land
                    problems… and distribution of its waters" (p. 142). Concluding the book is the
                    collaboration of 1984 in which Paul and Lillian Gates compared and evaluated the pre-1930 land
                    policies of <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Not included is "Hoosier Cattle Kings," which appeared in the <hi rend="i">Indiana
                        Magazine of History</hi> in the March, 1948, issue—which, say the Bogues, a
                    "sensitive descendant of these gentry" bought up in its entirety to prevent its
                    circulation (p. xiv). Gates was often critical of land policy for favoring wealthy interests over
                    settlers and for exacerbating inequalities. In this, as the Bogues state, he was a true progressive.
                    He was fair, fearless, and diligent. If he is to be faulted, perhaps it should be for a Turnerian
                    overlooking—no sin in his day—of the negative effects of land policy on
                    African Americans and Latinos.</p>
            <p>This book could have been larger; the Bogues refer to "restrictions as to
                    pagination" (p. xix). It will nevertheless especially benefit younger historians, who may
                    not yet have heard Gates's message.</p>

            <p>The anthology is an uncompromising but reasoned assault on slavery. The essayists, controlling their

                    themselves. Most articles are based on wide-ranging research in primary sources, especially judicial
                    cases and slave codes, and on secondary accounts from several disciplines. In particular, state
                    judicial cases enlighten us about slavery's relationship to racial, legal, constitutional,
                    political, and economic ideology. Other primary sources include biblical, economic, political,
                    scientific, and sociological studies, slave and freeman narratives, auction sales books, legal
                    treatises, census records, legislative debates, fiction, newspapers, and periodicals.</p>

            <p>American slavery was "peculiar" because it was based solely on race. Blacks were
                    adjudged inferior and reduced to a diminished status; their innate humanity and moral character were
                    denied. Americans, particularly southerners, developed a complex legal and constitutional system to
                    protect slaveholders' property rights and to police slaves. Slaves had few legal rights, and their
                    testimonies in courts carried little or no weight. Slavery was protected by the US. Constitution,
                    under which Congress passed fugitive slave laws that endangered even free African Americans. The
                    legal system also assisted slaveowners through its deep involvement in shameful and brutalizing
                    slave auctions and its suppression of antislavery speech. Slavery was strengthened (ironically) as
                    society became more democratic. Worse yet, the institution was made to seem compatible with
                    democracy.</p>
            <p>The essays, mostly of high quality, form a superb introduction to the subject, profiting both expert
                    and novice. Nevertheless, editor Paul Finkelman, an authority on the literature of slavery and the
                    law, could have assisted the reader further by firmly placing this anthology in that literature. It
                    would have been useful also to have put the essays in chronological order. For instance, the

                    effective introduction and William W. Fisher III's fine article on the ideology and imagery of the
                    law of slavery. The volume's capstone could have been Michael <placeName>

                    actually a foreword, in which Bell demonstrates that the study of slavery explains racism's

            <p>In her 1998 presidential address, American Historical Association president Joyce Appleby lamented
                    that progressives had misrepresented the nature of capitalism by focusing on groups that had
                    "failed to benefit from [a] profit-driven economy" and hoped that present and
                    future generations would be equally aware of the liberating "human possibilities"
                    of the marketplace (<hi rend="i">AHR</hi>, February, 1998, <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-095-1-091"/> p.
                    13). <hi rend="i">Wages of Independence</hi> takes an important step toward presenting a more
                    balanced picture. Sparked by Paul A. Gilje's erudite opening essay that is both a review of the
                    literature and a general introduction to the topic, this collection of historiographical and
                    interpretive essays on capitalism in the new nation is the most useful single volume available on
                    this subject to scholars and students.</p>
            <p>Jeanne Boydston analyzes the role of women in the marketplace, finding that after the revolution,
                    with American capitalism in full stride, women may have become both more important to men and the
                    nuclear family and more threatening to males' sense of masculinity. The increased emphasis on
                    separate spheres was in part a reaction to the volatility of the market and household. Ultimately,
                    the importance the society placed on separating women from the market made the concept of
                    "working woman" seem to be an oxymoron.</p>
            <p>In his essay on southern paternalism, Douglas Egerton maintains that the South was a precapitalist
                    society. He stresses that in slavery there was no cash wage, that the slave/master relation was not
                    economic, and that the South was not a consumer society and lacked an acquisitive yeoman class.
                    Christopher Clark agrees with Egerton about the South but stresses that agriculture outside the
                    South, although based on smaller farms, gave American capitalism a major push. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> excess farmhands formed an industrial working class; in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> economic stress forced women into mills; in the West indebtedness pressed farmers to
                    concentrate on marketing and cash crops; and throughout the West increasing numbers of agricultural
                    laborers began to appear before the Civil War.</p>
            <p>In his discussion of capitalism and industrialization, Jonathan Prude points out that the key change
                    from earlier production was organization. A factory could have as few as ten workers, but it always
                    utilized large-scale production—not always with new technology but always with a division
                    of labor, increased output, and decreased cost per hand. While industrialization and industrial
                    discipline could offer a woman the chance to earn twice as much as the rural wage earner or artisan
                    who might become an entrepreneur, there were negative connotations attached to factory work, and
                    wages ultimately declined.</p>
            <p>Richard Stott's essay criticizes the concept of artisan republicanism as misleading for several
                    reasons: it does not encompass the outlook of many rural artisans; the thesis of the decline of the
                    skilled tradesman is only true with selective trades; and the "harmonious
                    workshop" may have been a fiction. Capitalism, he points out, may have offered the artisan
                    more freedom than the paternalism that engulfed the colonial craftsman.</p>
            <p>Cathy Matson deftly surveys economic thought in regard to land, commerce, credit and banking, and
                    manufacturing, while Gordon Wood in a final essay discusses the differing interpretations and
                    definitions of capitalism and also offers a sharp critique of Marxistoriented <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-095-1-092"/> thought for its attempts to defend a moral economy that never existed.
                    He argues that Republicans, who were small farmers and artisans on the make, were the group most
                    responsible for capitalism. "hey wanted new banks and credit far more than Federalists.
                    This is a valuable collection and an excellent introduction to current thought on the early national
                    economy.</p>

                    $75.00.)</head>
            <p>This volume is the first of a projected series of four in which Leonard P. Curry intends to document
                    the development of American urbanism between 1800 and 1850. Curry defines urbanism as a set of
                    political and population patterns, expanding public services, and an environment of opportunity and
                    innovation that distinguished American cities from nonurban areas. Focusing on the fifteen largest
                    American cities as of 1850, Curry's investigation is shaped by his commitment to what he terms
                    comparative methodology. "The comparative method," Curry contends,
                    "demands that comparable data be collected without conscious reference to a theoretical
                    concept" and results in "a product that presents far more data and is likely to
                    give considerably less attention to the elaboration of a theoretical construct" than other
                    methods achieve (p. xiv).</p>
            <p>Curry keeps his promise to present data in <hi rend="i">The Corporate City.</hi> In chapters loaded
                    with details that will deter all but the most determined readers, he examines city charters,
                    municipal finance, elections and the makeup of city government, street patterns and city planning,
                    city relationships with county and state governments, and city sponsorship of commercial development
                    for all fifteen cities in his sample group. Most of his findings reinforce what urban historians
                    already know: that suffrage grew more democratic; that officeholders still came from the ranks of
                    the economic elite; that the nation's largest cities supported the Whig party between 1836 and 1850;
                    that cities designed after 1680 modeled themselves on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s pattern of rectilinear streets; that "the city as a political entity became
                    an instrument of support for the commercial community" (p. 239). Nevertheless, the weight
                    of empirical evidence Curry piles up adds some insights to familiar themes. For instance, he
                    observes that while urbanites expanded government authority, they simultaneously limited its
                    exercise by spreading responsibility among numerous officials. Thus city dwellers demonstrated both
                    "the imperative need for order and corporateness" (p. 30) and their suspicion of
                    concentrated power. In his exploration of "urban mercantilism," Curry makes the
                    valuable point that city government in the first half of the nineteenth <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-095-1-093"/> century favored commercial ventures over industrial development. On a
                    larger scale, Curry's research demonstrates the close relationship between private economic
                    interests and urban politics.</p>
            <p>There are certain other advantages to Curry's encyclopedic approach. Scholars seeking details on
                    topics such as changes in city charters will find profitable information in this book. Curry also
                    includes sixty-seven useful contemporary city maps. Nevertheless, there are also disadvantages to
                    his comparative methodology. Without significant context or thematic signposts, the deluge of
                    statistics and tables becomes numbing. Only the most intrepid, fact-starved specialist will be
                    willing to wade through most of them. Moreover, there is a static, abstract quality to the book. As
                    his subtitle indicates, Curry presents the city as an "entity," not as a
                    three-dimensional place where people lived and worked. Perhaps the future volumes in this series
                    will remedy that shortcoming; for now, Curry's achievement is mixed.</p>

            <p>The facts of Lincolnian reconstruction are not difficult to discover. But for many historians the
                    facts have not been the main interest. They have instead been concerned with Lincoln's ultimate aims
                    because of the light those goals might shed on his motives. The post-World War II school of
                    Reconstruction historiography has been dominated by scholars with an intense, even agonizing,
                    interest in those motives—agonizing because their quest to show that Lincoln was a
                    dedicated equalitarian has had to confront many obstinate facts that are difficult to reconcile with
                    this particular canon of their faith.</p>
            <p>William C. Harris does not belong to this school, although he certainly does not shrink from
                    asserting what the Great Emancipator had in mind, including what he would have done if he had
                    survived the war. The president, he says, "did not think of reconstruction policy primarily
                    as an instrument for winning the war or securing white support for black freedom. For Lincoln,
                    wartime reconstruction was designed to initiate the restoration of civil self-government in the
                    South, a process that had a high and immediate priority for him…" (p. 2).</p>
            <p>The author also dismisses the theory that Lincoln wished to create an alliance of old Whigs and
                    Republicans that would form a political majority in the postwar nation. He has not, he says, found
                        <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-095-1-094"/> any evidence that the president "approached
                    reconstruction with any such partisan intent" (p. 3). Nevertheless, the evidence is
                    there—plenty of it—to support the inference. One might ask Harris if he
                    believes that Lincoln would have championed any form of reconstruction that might have produced a
                    Democratic majority in the years to come. He is on sounder ground when he challenges those
                    historians who portray Lincoln as changing his reconstruction plans to accommodate Radical demands
                    "for black suffrage and for other revolutionary changes in Southern society" (p.
                    4). This will probably get the author in big trouble with the Lincoln industry.</p>
            <p>Mind-reading aside, Harris has given us a lucid, readable survey of Lincolnian reconstruction,
                    concentrating, of course, on those Confederate states with substantial areas under northern control
                    where there was an opportunity of getting the process under way. As such, it is a useful
                    contribution. Whether, as he asserts, his book "fills a void in Lincoln and Civil
                    War-Reconstruction historiography" (p. 4) depends on how one defines
                    "fill" and "void." There are, after all, only 275 pages of text.
                    The main shortcoming in an otherwise good, sensible book is the inadequate treatment of Lincoln's
                    actions during the last eight or nine months of his life, which saw many sinuous twists and turns,
                    many of them behind the scenes, that would have, if analyzed, given considerable additional depth to
                    our understanding of the subject at hand.</p>

            <p>Brian Lloyd's book represents another effort on the part of a younger generation of historians to
                    explain why older scholars were wrong to underestimate the potential of radicalism in American
                    history. The author acknowledges the validity of the liberal consensus scholarship that emerged in
                    the 1950s, particularly in the works of Louis Hartz and Richard Hofstadter, but he believes that the
                    conservative nature of the American social order, one lacking in clear-cut class antagonisms, need
                    not trouble us if we attend to the higher reaches of intellectual history. Here the key is, he
                    insists, the theoretical compatibility between European Marxism and American pragmatism.</p>
            <p>The effort to render pragmatism compatible with Marxism had been undertaken in the pre-World War I
                    years by Robert LaMont and William English Walling, and it reached philosophical sophistication two
                    decades later in Sidney Hook's <hi rend="i">Toward an Understanding of Karl Marx.</hi> What Marx and
                    John Dewey had in common was a <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-095-1-095"/> "praxis" test
                    of knowledge, a criterion that would verify an idea based on its ability to prove successful in the
                    world of practice. What Lloyd does not seem to "get" is that such a criterion goes
                    to the heart of American society in general; as George Santayana observed, pragmatism simply
                    expresses what America is all about and thus can hardly be used as a critique of its existing
                    institutions and practices. From Ben <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> to William James to William Gates the test of life is what functions successfully, what
                    enables one to cope with experience, what ultimately brings "satisfaction." In his
                    essays on "What Pragmatism Means" and elsewhere, William James heralded the new
                    philosophy as fulfilling a "cash nexus." The pragmatist "account[sI of
                    truths in the plural," James declared, have "only this in common, they
                    pay." Is this the goal of Marxism or of Wall Street?</p>
            <p>Lloyd is one of a number of scholars who believe that pragmatism, whether wedded to Marxism or not,
                    constitutes a radical stance in American history. Where is the evidence? Charles Sanders Peirce, the
                    original genius of pragmatism, sought to exclude political questions from philosophy, was skeptical
                    of democracy, and came from a family that opposed the abolition of slavery. James condemned the
                    Haymarket labor strike and hailed women's place in the home, and Dewey wrote almost nothing on such
                    social issues as race and poverty.</p>
            <p>Although Lloyd expects too much of intellectual history, he is on stronger ground when he criticizes
                    the new social history for leading us to believe that the working class offered the possibility of
                    radical revolution emerging from the cauldron of modern industry. Lloyd is critical of English
                    Thompsonianism (E. P. Thompson) and its American variant in the work of Herbert Gutman, which led a
                    generation of young historians to see the seeds of radicalism in working-class neighborhoods, as
                    though a class that dances together rises together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Left Out</hi> often seems desperate in trying to reconceive America in order to rescue
                    history from consensus liberalism; yet its author shows every sign of a first-rate intelligence.
                    Particularly learned is his treatment of Thorstein Veblen. Lloyd rightly shows Veblen's misplaced
                    hopes, articulated among other places in <hi rend="i">Imperial <placeName>
                            <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                        </placeName> and the Industrial Revolution</hi> (1914), that industrialism and modern science
                    would extirpate premodern animism and militarism. Less convincing is his contention that Veblen
                    misunderstood Dewey's pragmatism when he saw it as the rationale for expediency at the expense of
                    "idle curiosity." The expression Dewey hated most, it should be noted, was
                    "otiose," and his belief in practical ideas was as fervent as Henry Ford's.
                    Contrary to Lloyd, Veblen was prescient about a pragmatism that would see life as "shrewd
                    management-a body of maxims of expedient conduct." Look around you!</p>
