            <head>Our Reasons for Being.</head>
            <p>BY way of introducing this magazine and justifying its existence we cannot, perhaps, do better than
                    repeat, in substance, what was said in a <hi rend="i">Prospectus</hi> recently issued by us.</p>
            <p rend="center">Early Neglect of Documentary Material</p>
            <p>That the historical material of Indiana has never been adequately preserved and rendered accessible
                    is a fact patent to all who have occasion to deal with such material. The dereliction of the State
                    itself in the earlier days in caring even for its official documents exemplifies a neglect that has
                    been general. By way of illustration, on the old statute books stand laws that require the
                    preservation in the State Library of a number of copies of the general and local laws, and of the
                    Senate, House and Documentary Journals; that require the careful indexing of the Documentary
                    Journals; that require the alphabetical arrangement and binding into volumes of bills, petitions and
                    other legislative papers. No efforts seem to have been made until later years to obey any of these
                    statutory requirements, and so far as the culpable neglect has been rectified it was by the
                    collections and clerical efforts of recent librarians. Even with these efforts complete sets of our
                    State documents have not been secured, and much other matter of value has passed away beyond
                    recovery.</p>
            <p rend="center">Present Preventable Losses.</p>
            <p>Much material not within the jurisdiction of the State has also passed away and is daily passing. Old
                    men who have had a part in the history of the commonwealth die, and with them is going the last
                    dwindling remnant of first-hand knowledge of the phases of life that have been; they leave papers,
                    journals and various documents of interest, and these, descending to indifferent heirs, become
                    irretrievably lost. To gather from surviving pioneers their testimonies, and to save from oblivion
                    documents still accessible is a thing to be desired.</p>
            <p rend="center">Awakening Interest in Other States.</p>
            <p>An interest in these things in this State sufficient to support a magazine of local history is only a
                    matter of time. Such interest is not a sporadic one but a natural growth. Already something like a
                    score of States are represented by as many periodical historical <pb n="2" id="VAA4025-062-1-006"/>
                    publications, a number of them quarterly magazines, devoted to the preservation of local material.
                    Some of these, such as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>, <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
               </placeName>, are younger States than ours
                    with, perhaps, less history to record. Most of the publications mentioned have back of them the
                    Historical Societies of their several States. We, unfortunately can look to no central organization
                    for such support, but local societies are springing up in a number of counties, and if these will
                    evince an interest proportionate to the service we can render them they can go far toward making our
                    publication a success.</p>
            <p>To the members of these societies and to others who think an interest in our past worth promoting as
                    of value to the present, then, we make an appeal. We have launched the magazine at a venture and at
                    some sacrifice in the faith that if we can make a worthy showing the support will be forthcoming. It
                    is not our disposition to resort to any foisting or booming method. We assume that the class we
                    desire and hope to reach will take our effort exactly at its worth, and that if every page we
                    present to them is full of matter that justifies itself no better advertisement will be needed. For
                    the first year, if need be, we are willing to make no account of managerial and editorial labors if
                    the actual cost of publishing, distributing and associated expenses are covered.</p>
            <p>This, of course, is experimental and is by no means the limit of our hope. If our success justifies
                    it we shall certainly expand our scheme. One feature much to be desired, but prohibited in the start
                    by cost, is the reproduction of old maps and cuts of interest, many of which exist but are lost to
                    all but the delver.</p>
            <p rend="center">Character and Scope of Publication.</p>
            <p>The publication will be strictly what it purports to be at the start—a magazine devoted to
                    the preservation and collating of matter that is of real value to the historical student. There will
                    be no space given to advertising "write-ups," and no cheap padding. Of matter
                    within its legitimate field there is an abundance, and outside of this field it will make no bid for
                    popular favor.</p>
            <p>Its intended scope (subject to extension, as may seem advisable) is—</p>
            <p>1. The seeking out and publishing of hitherto unprinted documents that have an historical value.</p>
            <p>2. The re-printing of valuable and interesting matter that is buried away and practically lost in old
                    newspaper files. Of this <pb n="[3]" id="VAA4025-062-1-007"/>

                    <pb n="4" id="VAA4025-062-1-008"/> there is much that is wholly forgotten, and, owing to the absence
                    of any guide, to be found only after long and patient research.</p>
            <p>3. The conducting of a department of bibliography of historical material now scattered through
                    periodicals and local histories, and of an indexing system that shall comprehend all important
                    official publications besides other matter of interest. We believe that this will at once commend
                    itself to all who have had occasion to search out obscure information.</p>
            <p>4. The binding together into a co-operative system (and this is one of the important and hopeful
                    objects) the various local historical societies in the State, as well as the encouraging and
                    promoting of other such societies. The needful thing in Indiana to-day, in this direction, is the
                    historical "atmosphere," that shall stimulate work all along the line and inspire
                    the student in history with a sense of the usefulness of such study. This once existing there is no
                    reason why much should not be accomplished, and it is to those who have already started societies
                    and otherwise manifested an interest that we must look for the creation of such an atmosphere by the
                    uniting of their efforts.</p>
            <p>5. The publication of original studies in Indiana history by careful and trustworthy students. Some
                    of the best history work being done at present is intensive, dealing with special aspects and of
                    limited compass, but, by a corresponding thoroughness, particularly illustrative of great
                    principles. Of work of this character we can secure enough to add a desirable feature to our plan.</p>
            <p>6. The promoting of history work, particularly State and local history, among teachers and in the
                    schools. On this point we wish to be distinctly understood. The habit of "working"
                    the schools as a lucrative field with many and various private enterprises is an evil conspicuous,
                    we presume, to most school officials, and obvious to us. We have no intention of attempting to
                    persuade teachers and trustees as to their needs—they themselves should know their needs
                    better than we do—but this we have in mind: the interest in home history is making way in
                    the schools; in the development of this interest and the directing of it to the most useful ends
                    help and co-operation not available hitherto will surely be a need. Such help and co-operation we
                    are ready to extend to the best of our ability.</p>
            <p>To sum up, we feel quite satisfied that we can carry out acceptably and well our proposed venture if
                    our friends encourage it, and we hope to receive this encouragement.</p>

                    </placeName> Riper (1876–1944) was an Indiana school teacher and administrator who, near
                    the close of his career, chose to record recollections pertaining to his personal life and
                    professional activities. Most of the topics depicted in this and the earlier published sections of
                    the "Reminiscences" relate to the youthful period of the writer's
                    life—from the early 1890's to the time of World War I. Their principal
                    geographic setting is the rural neighborhood of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Riper perhaps shed some light upon this question. They allow us to view what is, in
                    many respects, a typical area of the state at a time when values and concepts were in their
                    crystallizing stage. Just as mores governing <placeName>

                    are a determinant for Hoosier thought and action today.</p>
            <p>

                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Riper implies that religious beliefs and practices were a vital concern in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> society of his boyhood. The influence of the Protestant churches as guardians of
                    personal morals in the rural community is certainly worthy of attention—as is the role
                    that the churches apparently played in preserving the traditional <placeName>

                    <pb n="6" id="VAA4025-062-1-010"/> (pp. 38–46). Perhaps the pattern of scheduling
                    Methodist and Baptist church services at the same time on alternating Sundays began in an effort to
                    maintain doctrinal purity (p. 45). Both congregations, however, continued to adhere to the pattern;
                    and there was dormant friction in the community as a result. The reluctance of the Catholic mother
                    to have her daughter seriously courted by Protestant boys (p. 45) can be partially explained by
                    circumstances recited in another portion of the "Reminiscences": Catholic families

                    </placeName> Riper provide clues to the state's traditional but precarious political
                    balance. According to the author, late nineteenth century political factionalism in his neighborhood
                    was based on local ecological conditions rather than on the merits of either major political party
                    (pp. 36, 37). He also suggests that his neighbors were not without racial and nativistic bias and
                    that this bias was reflected in their formal political views. Flagrant vote-buying, a practice of
                    both parties in <placeName>

                    the Australian ballot and more stringent residence requirements for voting. State law now prohibits

                    </placeName> Riper's presentation is a synthesis of one man's observations and
                    experiences and therefore possesses uniqueness. Its real value, however, stems from the
                    writer's concern with commonplace, "grassroots" situations. The comments
                    and anecdotes, whether they relate to religion, politics, transportation, or other facets of life in
                    his youthful neighborhood, add to the store of source material which ultimately must serve as the
                    basis of more formal historical accounts.</p>

            <p>My Father was a firm advocate of the theory, "The Devil finds work for idle hands to
                    do." He usually kept me busy at work. But never so busy that I did not have some time for
                    boyish games and play. We burned at least three stoves all winter and sometimes more. It was my job
                    to keep the wood boxes well filled, and kindling ready for the morning fires. Nothing was to prevent
                    my doing this chore except absence or sickness. Many times when I had gone to bed with the chore
                    left undone I was routed from my warm bed, made to dress and fill those woodboxes. We also kept a
                    horse and a cow. I had these to feed and water and generally care for. I drove the cow to pasture in
                    the summer time and went after her in the evening. Charley Simmons proudly rode their cow back and
                    forth but I never could get our cow broke to ride. Father caught me at it one day and needless to
                    say I never tried to ride the cow again. Some one had taught me to make a dart with a sharp point
                    and tailed with feathers. I became quite expert with it. One evening as I was bringing bossy home
                    she persisted in eating the lush grass along the road. Exasperated I finally threw my dart at her
                    and it stuck in her rump. She high-tailed it for home and unfortunately Dad saw her pass the store
                    in a run and more unfortunately for me he saw the dart also. Strange <list type="footnotes">

                            and at the contributor's request, the most obvious typographical and grammatical
                            errors have been corrected. When lacking, apostrophes have been added to show possession; in
                            three instances periods were placed after abbreviations of "Mrs.,"
                            "etc.," and "Rev."; and a period was added to replace a

                            a small letter and two words mistakenly capitalized in the middle of sentences. Obviously
                            unintentional repetitions have been omitted, but all other deletions are indicated by
                            ellipses. Apparent typographical errors, such as "rememver,"

                            "threashing" (threshing) and "catched" (cached), the
                            original spelling has been maintained in order to retain the flavor of the article and to
                            preserve the author's style. These words are indicated by a [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                            the first time they are used. For the same reason Van Riper's use of the verb
                            "run" instead of "ran" has also been retained and
                            indicated by a [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]. Minor changes in spacing have been necessary in
                            presenting the play party songs. No attempt has been made to identify the towns, schools, or

                            in boldface type without changes in capitalization or punctuation. Some sections of the

                    Postmaster. While I was Deputy a new Postoffice was established at Fleming four miles west of
                    Hayden, and an old man by the name of Day made Postmaster. Shortly after the quarterly reports had
                    to be made, I had a request from the head office at <placeName>

                    </placeName> to go to Fleming and help Mr. Day correct his report. I went down to Fleming and told
                    Mr. Day why I had come. We went over his report and counted the cash and stamps, but though he swore
                    that he kept the office money separate we found a shortage of sixty cents. Finally the old man asked
                    me, "Do I have to pay for the stamps I use?" We had found the source of the
                    shortage. One summer I worked for Uncle Garner Paul on the farm. He paid me twenty-five cents a day
                    and my board. With a team plowing or harrowing or cultivating, I could do as much as a man. Of
                    course at hard manual labor like pitching hay or cutting wood or hauling manure I could not do as
                    much. Then I worked two summers for Mitchel Day. He was one of the best farmers in the County
                    [Jennings]. I learned much from him. He paid me fifteen dollars a month and my board, room and

                    and he had to give up the store. We moved back to the farm on Six Mile Creek. Father and mother had

            <pb n="12" id="VAA4025-062-1-016"/>
            <p rend="center">PLAY AND RECREATION</p>
            <p>We had an unusually fine group of young people in and around Hayden. They in general were clean, full
                    of fun, intelligent and ambitious. The German young people held pretty much to themselves. They
                    played cards and danced and their social activities centered pretty much about their church.</p>
            <p>Some of the protestant young people danced and more played cards but hardly ever at a party. The
                    Baptist and Methodist churches frowned at cards and dancing. Some of us however belonging to the
                    church did both.</p>
            <p>Our social and recreational activities varied. We had picnics, church socials, swimming, baseball,
                    and buggy riding. In the winter we had parties, bob-sled rides, skating, church festivals and plays.</p>
            <p>At our parties we played games other than cards, played charades, had a great deal of music both
                    vocal and instrumental and occasionally played a few of the singing dancing games in vogue in
                    southern Indiana at that time. However our group never indulged much in these games because they
                    savored too much of dancing for the good Methodist and Baptist folks. I went with the crowd in
                    Hayden and because of my wide acquaintance all over the Township [<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName>] I was invited many times to dances among the German People and to Play Parties in both
                    the North and west parts of the community.</p>
            <p>These playparty games are worthy of more than passing notice. In my opinion they were a heritage from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or at least from the early settlers of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. They were a boon to people who had few musical instruments. All sang the songs to
                    which they danced if it could be called dancing. There was rhythm and keeping time. The players
                    skipped, swung, promenaded, bowed, walked and run all in time to the tune of the song. They sang
                    stanzas that were in fact directions for the game. These songs were simple and at times crude, but
                    they were rhythmic and full of action.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Since these games are now a novelty,
                    though I am told that they are still played in some communities in Indiana, I have collected words
                    and music for a few of them from friends of my boyhood, and from others to whom I have written for

                    <p>Gay was the mountain song Of bright Alfaraita. Where sweep the waters Of the blue Juniata. Strong
                        and true my arrows are In my painted quiver. Swift goes my light canoe Adown the rapid river.</p>
                    <p>Bold is my warrior, good, The love of Alfaraita. Proud waves his snowy plume Along the Juniata.
                        Soft and low he speaks to me, And then his war cry sounding Rings his voice in thunder loud From
                        height to height resounding.</p>

                    <p>Keep thy gold, I do not want it, Lady, I have prayed for this, For the hour when I might foil
                        him, Rob him of expected bliss. Gentle lady do not wonder At my words so strange and wild, Lady,
                        in that green grave yonder Lies the Gypsy's only child.</p>

            <p>We always had a good baseball team at Hayden. It is said that Hayden developed more baseball players
                    and railroad men than any town near its size in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Baseball was played at school every day that a game was possible. No wonder many good players were
                    developed. From among those who came to school to me or with whom I played the following played
                    professional ball. Howard and Roll Daringer with the Three I League; Cliff Daringer with the Three I
                    and later with the <placeName>

                    </placeName> League.</p>
            <p>During the summer months we played ball each Saturday P. M. About half the games were played at
                    Hayden. Then we would go to neighboring towns, <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">North
                        Vernon</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dupont, Reddington, Scipio and Alert for return games. These trips were made in
                    buggies or the entire team went in a large spring wagon drawn by four horses. I usually played first
                    base.</p>
            <p>On Sundays, since we did not play Sunday games at home, a few of the team would play with some
                    neighboring team. Once I went with the Seymour team on a week's trip to West Baden. We
                    played a game there each day to entertain the guests. We were paid fairly well and were royally
                    entertained.</p>
            <p>During the winter we usually put on a number of dramatic plays. We would give a performance at home
                    and then repeat it at Scipio or Reddington and sometimes at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Those plays were a lot of fun. I usually played the lead. Dr. Davenport, a young
                    Doctor, who had been two years on the professional stage, played character parts and coached the
                    plays. Among the plays I remember playing in were, "Down on the Farm,"
                    "Way Down East", "Tony the Convict", "Out in the
                    Street", "Hector", and "A Woman's Honor".</p>
            <p>One night we were playing at Scipio. All the boys knew me because I had played baseball there many
                    times. I was made up to represent a man in very poor health. In the midst of a very dramatic scene,
                    with soft music, one of the boys in the audience recognized me and in a stage whisper that could be
                    heard all over the house said, By God, that is Paul <placeName>

                    </placeName> Riper. That came near breaking up the show.</p>
            <pb n="30" id="VAA4025-062-1-034"/>
            <p>My sister Maud and I were frequently asked to dances, social affairs and weddings down in the German
                    neighborhood. When Adam Machino married Lena Huersberger we were invited. They were married at the
                    Church at ten o'clock in the morning. Then all the guests went to the home of the bride.
                    There a long table in the yard was spread bountifully with excellent things to eat. Beer was on tap
                    in the cellar. Following the dinner came dancing. A large dance floor sufficient to accommodate
                    three sets for square dances, had been laid in the yard. The music was provided by two fiddles and a
                    base viol. The dance opened with a waltz. At first only the bride and groom danced once about the
                    floor. Then the Groom honored Sister Maud, by selecting her as a partner, and the Bride selected me
                    to dance with her. We danced once about the floor and then at a signal from the Groom the other
                    couples joined in the dance.</p>
            <p>This waltz was followed by a square dance of three figures, called or rather sung by one of the
                    German Boys. Each square dance was followed by a waltz, schottische or a polka. The dance continued
                    until the wee small hours.</p>
            <p>I had my favorites as a boy at school. There were Katy McGinty, a sweet little Irish girl whose
                    father kept the saloon, Hetty Hartpence, a daughter of the village doctor, and Emma Oliger, who sat
                    across the aisle. I had brought them apples and candy and had sent Hetty a valentine, but I had my
                    first real date the spring I was twelve years old. I shall never forget it. I was attending school
                    at the Wohrer School. The Graves boys, cousins of mine sent out invitations to a party in honor of
                    Boyd's twelfth birthday. I asked Alice Woodson to go to the party with me. She lived near
                    the Wohrer School two miles west of Hayden. Father thought I was too young to use the horse and
                    buggy but said I might take a horse that would carry double. But Alice wanted to walk. So the night
                    of the party I walked the two miles from Hayden to Alice's home. Then she and I walked the
                    mile from her home to the Graves Home. We played dancing games till midnight, then we walked back to
                    the Woodson home and I walked alone the two miles to my home. It was a large evening. Imagine my
                    letting Paul Jr.,<hi rend="sup">11</hi> at twelve years of age pull such a stunt.</p>

            <p>Alice was a fine sweet girl just my age, but that was our only date. I think I was rather discouraged
                    by the distance that lay between our homes.</p>
            <p>For other entertainment we had spelling schools, shooting matches, an occasional barn raising, maple
                    sugar pulls, corn roasts and steak frys. I doubt if the younger generation today have better times
                    than did we and the cost to us was nil, other that the effort involved.</p>
            <p rend="center">ROADS</p>
            <p>The roads in Southern Indiana, as I first remembered them were unimproved. They were laid out and
                    fenced and most of them graded and ditched. There was an occasional stretch that had been graveled
                    but for the most part they were dirt. In particularly wet places the roads were corduroyed. To
                    corduroy a road, small trees were cut and laid close together across the road. Sometimes the surface
                    thus secured was leveled with dirt or gravel but more often travelers had to take the bumps.</p>
            <p>The first pike road in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> Township was built from Hayden to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was a toll road. The right of way was first widened and graded. Then on a base of
                    about six inches of coarse rock, crushed by hand power, was spread a layer of gravel. It was never
                    much of a road, judged by today's standards, but for the time it was very good. There were
                    two toll houses on this seven mile stretch of road. Toll keepers lived in them and collected a small
                    sum from all persons traveling the road. The toll gate was a large pole across the road, which by a
                    mechanical device, could be raised or lowered, to block or clear the road as occasion demanded. As I
                    remember the round trip of 14 miles on this road a team and wagon was twenty-five cents, and fifteen
                    cents for a single horse and buggy. Later the County took over the road and maintained it. It was
                    then known as the free pike.</p>
            <p>A law was then passed permitting the people of any section to petition for a gravel or rock road to
                    be paid for by a local tax.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Soon the main roads of the Township were converted
                    into pikes. These were constructed largely of crushed stone.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">12</hi> The Indiana General Assembly had approved such a law as early as May 3,

            <p>The early dirt roads were dusty in summer and muddy in winter. Especially in the spring due to
                    freezing and thawing, many of the roads became impassible except to a person on foot or horseback.
                    Doctors rode a horse during the winter and spring. I have seen wagons loaded with hay or logs with
                    all four wheels in to the mud to the hubs.</p>
            <p>One night I was returning home from a party, on old Bill my riding horse. It was dark and the mud was
                    deep. I dozed as Bill plodded along. Suddenly I was awakened by Bill stumbling in the mud knocking
                    off my stiff hat. I stopped Bill and got off in the mud to look for my hat. Finally in the gloom I
                    noticed a bulge on one of Bill's hind legs. He had stepped through that hat and the mud had
                    pushed it up nearly to his knee.</p>
            <p>At another time I was driving Bill to the buggy. I was asleep but I knew Bill would bring me safe
                    home. Suddenly the lines were snapped from my hands. The buggy had mired to the hubs. Old Bill
                    lunging forward, had broken the single tree and any harness that connected him to the buggy, and
                    went on home. I waded home through the mud, found Bill waiting for me at the barn, and went back the
                    next morning for the buggy.</p>
            <p>We went to dances, parties, spelling schools etc., in the winter on horseback. The day had nearly
                    passed when boys would take the girls up behind them on a horse, but I did have that pleasant
                    experience a number of times. But I preferred to take my girl in a buggy rather than behind me on a
                    horse.</p>
            <p>One spring night, Wallace Orcutt and I borrowed Ben Burtch's spring wagon, made up a team
                    with his horse and mine, and with two girls started to a school entertainment at the Glixner School,
                    three miles from Hayden. We never got there. We mired in the mud, got the horses down and finally
                    disgusted and covered with mud, came back home.</p>
            <p>In that day the smaller streams were forded. The larger streams on the most used roads had large
                    covered wooden bridges. The planks forming the floor of these bridges were laid crosswise of the
                    road. A team and wagon crossing one of these bridges at a trot could be heard for miles.</p>
            <p>The Township levied a road tax. If the voter desired he could work this tax out on the road. It
                    required one day's work with a team of horses or three days' work for a man <pb n="33" id="VAA4025-062-1-037"/> and a shovel. In this way the roads were maintained in a more or
                    less passable condition.</p>
            <p>In 1912, Margaret<hi rend="sup">13</hi> and I drove from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in our first Automobile, to Hayden. We digressed from the graveled road and got on
                    some of the dirt roads. We got through without getting stuck but we had several close calls. George <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>
                    </placeName> lived south of Hayden across Six Mile Creek. On my first attempt to ford this creek I
                    drowned the engine. Joe Megel pulled me out with his team and it was more than an hour before the
                    wires dried out so that I could start the car.</p>
            <p>As late as 1920, there was no through pike or solid road between <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

            <p>The spring of 1920, I was asked to make the Commencement Address at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Margaret drove me down in our four cylinder Buick. It rained hard all day. The road on
                    the hills near Scipio were deep with mud. We came near stalling a dozen times but finally, nearly
                    worn out, we reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The river there was high and two of the graduates were not able to get across to
                    attend their commencement. The Orchestra came out from Seymour. They got in a creek west of <placeName>

                    </placeName> by coming around by way of Commisky. The County Superintendent, Shepherd Whitcomb,
                    drove over from Hayden, and broke a spring on his Ford in route. Finally near nine o'clock
                    the exercises began. Of course we curtailed the exercises as much as possible as every one was near
                    worn out. Then Shepherd Whitcomb closed the occasion by singing a solo. I disgraced myself by
                    laughing when he started in on his selection. He had selected as the closing number, "The

                    Finally the wheels locked as the horses passed each other and Bill my horse jumped and jerked a

                    and knew the negro bosses quite well. Just before the election one of the Negro Bosses told me that
                    the Democrats had promised them $2.00 each for their votes. I reported this to the
                    Township Chairman and the Republicans held a meeting and invited the leaders of the negroes to be
                    present. It was finally arranged that the negroes were to take the $2.00 each offered by
                    the Democrats and to insist on payment before the day of election. Then they were promised
                    $3.00 each if they would vote the republi[can] ticket, but were not to be paid until
                    after election. The negroes consented to do this provided the money was turned over to me, whom they
                    knew and that I would guarantee payment. I was republican clerk that election in the precinct, where
                    they voted. I managed to get the room arranged so that I as clerk sat next to the voting booths.
                    Then when a negro came in and asked for help to mark his ballot, I would get into the booth first.
                    Frank Nighswander was the democrat clerk. It was laughable to see him when each negro came in and
                    voted the straight ticket from township candidates to president. We voted more than fifty negroes in
                    that election and then the democrats carried the township, but that vote sure boosted the County
                    ticket. We kidded the Democrats a good deal about the two dollars they had paid each negro to vote
                    the straight republican ticket.</p>
            <p>Before the Australian ballot system was adopted, voting was a very simple process. The ballots were
                    printed and distributed. Any one could get a ballot. The ballots could be marked any place and
                    brought to the polling place and deposited in the ballot box. All that was necessary to vote a drunk
                    man or even an idiot, was to get a ballot, mark it to suit the ones most concerned, lead or carry
                    the voter to the polling place, put the ballot in his hand, and lift his hand to a position where
                    the ballot would drop into the ballot box. Often the voter when well known did not need to tell his
                    name or residence. No wonder that people who wanted honest elections welcomed the Australian voting
                        system.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

                    if his vote was challenged. So that election they got a good bunch of republicans to stand around
                    the polls and they challenged every drunk man the democrats tried to vote. Unless he could state his
                    name they did not let him vote. Several fights resulted but the republicans stood their ground and
                    had their way.</p>
            <p>The voting of Pete …<hi rend="sup">17</hi> is a good example of the abuse of the ballot
                    under the early system of voting. Pete was an imbecile, in fact almost an idiot. His family had
                    voted Pete for several elections. On this particular occasion, they came to the polls, leading Pete,
                    with a ballot in his hand, up to the window where the ballot box was located. His vote was
                    challenged. After a long argument it was decided that Pete should vote if he would say his name. I
                    can still hear his father as he said to his son, "Damn it, say Pete." But Pete
                    refused to give his name. Then they promised Pete a new pair of boots if he would speak his name.
                    Pete demanded the boots first. They took him over to the store and got the boots and then brought
                    him back to vote. But such a crowd had collected by that time that Pete was frightened and lost what
                    little wits he did have. His family and friends kept him in town till the Polls closed but never did
                    get Pete to give his name.</p>
            <p>The saloons were supposed to close on election day. Outwardly they did close. But usually they
                        catched[<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] a supply of liquor out in the woods so that plenty was to be
                    found without going into the saloons.</p>
            <p>There were always a few people who would not vote until given a sack of flour or a side of bacon, or
                    a pair of boots. They did not care which ticket they voted. One year the township chairman of each
                    party got together before election and decided that neither party would purchase the votes of these
                    particular people. Each side lived up to the agreement. It was laughable to watch these men try to
                    attract the attention of party workers. Finally the polls closed and most of the bunch went home
                    without voting.</p>
            <p>The floaters in the Township were well known. At committee meetings just before election, these
                    floaters would be <list type="footnotes">

                    name would be placed the amount thought to be necessary to influence his vote. Then some one was
                    appointed to see each particular floater and see that he voted right.</p>
            <p>In that early day there was little scratching of tickets. Most people voted straight. Entire families
                    voted the same ticket. When Earnest Swarthout, on one occasion, broke away and voted the party
                    ticket opposed by the rest of his family, Old Uncle Aaron Swarthout declared that he was now ready
                    to die since the family had been so publicly disgraced. George Ade sure knew Indiana politics. In
                    his Play, "The County Chairman," he has Hackler say, "The convention got
                    together about ten o'clock. We agreed on a harmony platform and then began to
                    fight." "The kind of Politics we have in this County, breaks up
                    families." "I aught to know what politics is in <placeName>

            <p>The most colorful event of a campaign in the Nineties, was the political rally. A speaker of
                    prominence would be billed at the principal town in the township or county. The party workers would
                    arouse all the enthusiasm they possibly could. The day of the speaking, in would come parades from
                    all parts of the county, with great wagons, decorated with bunting and flags, and filled with
                    children. The boys and men often formed a horseback parade. The procession would be led and
                    interspersed with drum corps and bands. Great banners proclaimed the virtues of the candidate or the
                    party platform. I have seen these processions near a mile long. If <list type="footnotes">

                    churches. If one had a date Sunday night and there was preaching one went to Church. The ice cream
                    suppers and the straw berry festivals were held in the church or in the church yard. Traveling
                    entertainers, if they did not have a tent, and if they could persuade the Church Trustees that the
                    entertainment was clean, and instructive, gave their shows in one of the churches. Each winter a
                    revival was held in each church, these running from two to six weeks. Lectures, concerts, local
                    entertainments, especially on Children's Day and Christmas, were held in the churches.
                    Later the Kendricks built a town hall. Then the more secular activities were held there, but the
                    churches continued to be the real center of community life until the new School House was built. It
                    is a matter of debate whether the change of interest from Church to School was a good thing. Now the
                    Baptist Church has no church services no Sunday School, and has been sold to the Township Trustee,
                    to be used as a school gymnasium. A few Baptists joined with the Methodist congregation, and others
                    allied themselves with the Baptist churches of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Seymour.</p>
            <p>The Methodist Church is having a hard struggle to exist and even the Catholic Church has been greatly
                    weakened by the intermarriage of their young people with protestants, through their acquaintance in
                    the public schools.</p>
            <p>Father was a Deacon in the Baptist Church. He was a godly Man and exemplified his religion in his
                    daily life. He could make a powerful, eloquent and moving prayer. Mother was equally religious, but
                    in a more quiet way. Her people had been Quakers and she, like them, waited for the spirit to move
                    her. But she was loyal to the Baptist Church. She had been immersed, not because she believed in
                    immersion with water (The Quakers believed in Spiritual Baptism only) but because the Baptist Church
                    Membership demanded it.</p>
            <p>I joined the church at an early age. It was the natural thing to do. A large number of the boys and
                    girls joined at the same time during the revival.</p>
            <p>My first Sunday School Teacher was Mrs. H. B. Weaver, wife of the public school teacher who thought I
                    could not learn arithmetic.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> She was a beautiful character. She could <list type="footnotes">

                    always remember her with a great deal of pleasure and respect. I presume that I was not more than
                    sixteen when I became Secretary-Treasurer of the Sunday School. At about age eighteen I was
                    surprised to have the young ladies' class select me as their teacher. Later I taught the
                    men's class. Most of the men were old enough to be my father.</p>
            <p>About that same time I became clerk of the church. Soon after this one of the Deacons died and some
                    of the Brethren suggested that I be elected a Deacon. My name was placed in nomination, seconded and
                    the Moderator called for remarks. Old Uncle Silas Baker rose to his feet and as near as I can
                    remember spoke as follows;—"Brother Paul is all right, he has been our church clerk, he
                    has been active in the work of this Church. He is worthy of the honor of being made a Deacon. But I
                    read in my Bible, where Paul sets forth the qualifications of Deacons, that he says a Deacon shall
                    have one wife. Brother Paul has no wife, therefore in my opinion he can not qualify for the office
                    of Deacon." Brother Baker held his ground, though others explained that the Apostle meant
                    that a Deacon should not have plural wives, and I was not made a Deacon.</p>
            <p>Church trials were common in that day. I remember two. In one a young woman was summoned before the
                    church body to explain her conduct with a very worldly young man. She was not able to satisfy the
                    congregation as to her innocence, and was dismissed from the fellowship of the Church. The second
                    was held to adjust the differences that had grown up between my father and Mr. Weaver. Probably I
                    was the chief cause of the discord. Anyway at this meeting father and Mr. Weaver became reconciled
                    and as far as I could tell were friends from that time on. Knowing my father as I did I think he was
                    sincere in laying aside all rancor.</p>
            <p>Big Meetings as we called Revivals were held yearly. People would come for miles around. Usually
                    there was a choir of mixed voices that led in the singing. The Preacher would have a number of
                    prayers from the older members, both men and women. Then the Minister would preach or exhort. Then
                    following a song, the invitation would be given to unite with the church, while the choir and
                    congregation sang some of those wonderful old revival hymns. How well <pb n="42" id="VAA4025-062-1-046"/> I remember those old songs. I can still hear them singing,
                    "Almost Persuaded", "Jesus, Lover of My Soul," "Where
                    is My Wandering Boy Tonight," "Sinner Come Home," "Rock of
                    Ages," "Jesus is Tenderly Calling Me Home," and many others.</p>
            <p>The Revival in which I and many others united with the Church, was conducted by Rev. Conger. He was
                    an elderly man and a fine preacher. He stayed at our home the entire six weeks of that revival. He
                    owned the first baptistry heater I ever saw. So following the accession of a few new members he had
                    the Baptistry, recently built under the pulpit, filled with water, and from then on during the
                    meeting, nightly baptisms added to the interest and the solemnity of the services. The baptistry
                    heater was a gasoline floating burner with coils over the flame. The heat caused the water to
                    circulate through an intake pipe, then through the coils and then out an exhaust pipe. Rev. Conger
                    taught me to run it. So each day I would go at noon, fill the tank of the heater, light it and set
                    it afloat in the baptistry. By night the water would be pleasantly warm and comfortable for both
                    preacher and those baptized.</p>
            <p>A number of the new members, not quite satisfied that the new baptistry satisfied the biblical
                    conditions for baptism, preferred to be baptized in Six Mile Creek. These were baptized usually
                    following the morning service on the Sabbath Day. Then the entire congregation would repair to the
                    stream. Then with the people, standing on the bank, and singing, "Shall We Gather At the
                    River"?, the baptizing was done. Though the water was often very cold and sometimes with a
                    fringe of ice, I never knew anyone to suffer ill effects from the immersion. I was one of those
                    baptized in the creek. Father was waiting on the bank with a heavy blanket and I was hurried home to
                    change into dry clothes.</p>
            <p>Perhaps today, when big revivals are a thing of the past, we think that they were too emotional. But
                    those meetings were in vogue at that time. I am not so sure that we have not gone to the other
                    extreme of cold intellectualism. Religion, without deep feeling, call it emotion if you will, has
                    little power. While some of those converted during a revival, did backslide, many more were truly
                    converted and demonstrated the fact in their daily lives.</p>
            <pb n="43" id="VAA4025-062-1-047"/>
            <p>One winter the Methodists had a very successful revival. The converts were given their choice of
                    sprinkling or immersion. So some were sprinkled and some were immersed. I reported the meetings to
                    the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">North Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName> Plain Dealer. But I made a sad mistake. I stated that so many were sprinkled and so
                    many were baptized. I can still see Aunt Jennie Swarthout, as she in a very unmethodist manner,
                    informed me most emphatically that she was baptized by sprinkling.</p>
            <p>Some of the prayers offered in that early day, were and still are, to me marvels of beauty,
                    simplicity and appeal. Many of those offering prayer, could and did, quote freely from the
                    Scripture. They demonstrated a knowledege of God's Word that puts me to shame. Howard
                    Griffith was tall, ungainly, and anemic looking. My brother George [George Humphrey
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Hammond</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
               </placeName> Riper's half brother] always said that he was afraid that
                    some day Howard would stub his toe and jerk his head off. But Howard could make a most beautiful
                    prayer. Couched in the simple language of the Bible, given with great earnestness, in a soft
                    pleasing voice, Howard could depict the glories of the Lord, until we could almost see within the
                    Pearly Gates. Silas Whitcomb once said that if Howard ever began praying for him personally, he
                    would have to either leave town or mend his ways.</p>
            <p>Jack Kendrick would pray long and earnestly, but he had one phrase that he invariably repeated. Near
                    the climax of his prayer, he always exhorted the sinner to see the error of his ways and repent
                    while, "there was space, time and opportunity."</p>
            <p>Many men and women could pray long and fervently. They in general had little education, yet there was
                    always a beauty of phrasing and wording and expression that could come only from long study of the
                    Bible with its simple and beautiful wording.</p>
            <p>Baptists at that [time] believed and practised closed communion. They offered communion only to
                    immersed believers. At the close of the preaching service on communion day, the congregation would
                    sing a song. The preacher would announce that those not qualified to partake, might depart during
                    the singing of the hymn.</p>
            <pb n="44" id="VAA4025-062-1-048"/>
            <p>My Mother called our home the Baptist Hotel. Traveling Baptist Ministers always came to our house.
                    Rev. Conger remained for six weeks during the big meeting. Preachers coming for trial sermons
                    invariably stayed at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Riper house. At Church Association Meetings, I have known Mother to feed and bed at one
                    time as many as twenty guests. Frequently two or three Baptist families would be invited to have
                    dinner at our house following the Sunday Morning Service. How mother managed I never knew, but other
                    than calling our home the Baptist Hotel, I never heard her complain.</p>
            <p>Once a blind preacher came and stayed several days. I remember him well because he begged me to read
                    to him so pathetically, that I could not refuse. During his stay I read to him the, "Twenty
                    Famous and Decisive Battles of the World," [<hi rend="i">Twenty Decisive Battles of the
                        World</hi>?] "Sea and Land," and many parts of the Bible. I breathed a sigh of
                    relief when he moved on. But for years we rarely ate a meal without some guest present.</p>
            <p>Many of our Ministers came from the Seminary at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> They seldom remained with us more than one or two years. They
                    would complete their course at the Seminary and move on. I remember we usually paid them
                    $250.00 to $300.00 per year for their services. Since they preached only two
                    Sundays in the month that paid them about ten dollars a sermon. This was not bad pay for those
                    times.</p>
            <p>Many of these young men were excellent preachers and were usually a jolly lot. When a preacher would
                    resign we would send to the Seminary and have them send us a trial candidate. I remember one jolly
                    fellow from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, named Kincannon. He declared that an old fellow at church had inquired if he came from
                    the Southern Baptist Zoological Cemetery. I asked him if he took his [meals] at the
                    "Commons", the School boarding place for students. He replied that he took his oat
                    meal there. One candidate who came <list type="footnotes">

                    made a nuisance of himself by inquiring of every one he met if he had been saved. He asked Clarence
                    Miller, the principal of the High School at that time, if he was a christian. Miller replied,
                    "The neighbors have not fully decided my case yet."</p>
            <p>Some of these young preachers would spend a few days during the summer months with us. Then I would
                    take them hunting or fishing or they would help me with my work. Some of them were good baseball
                    players and then we would draft them for our team.</p>
            <p>Outwardly the Baptist and Methodist congregations got along fairly well, but underneath the surface
                    there was a strong rivalry. During times of revival some of our good Baptists would attend the
                    Methodist meetings and vice versa, but this was not true of the members in general. Although both
                    churches had half time service, they usually held their service the same day. I never knew them to
                    hold a union service. I have even heard it hinted by some of our good Baptists that they thought it
                    doubtful if any Methodist ever got as near the Throne of Grace as one who had been immersed in the
                    Baptist Faith. Some of the older people of each church never entered the church of opposite faith,
                    except to attend a funeral. However the young folks were more liberal. But it always caused
                    complications when two young people of opposite faiths started keeping company.</p>
            <p>At that time there was little mingling socially or religiously between Protestants and Catholics.
                    Through my acquaintance with a large number of Catholics and having gone to school at their school,
                    I was always welcome at their homes or at their church. It was all right for me to invite a Catholic
                    girl to attend a party or a dance, but I noticed that too frequent visits were discouraged. One
                    Sunday Charley Wohrer and I had dates with two sisters. They were very pretty German girls. We had
                    called on these girls several times. This particular Sunday as we drove up the mother met us at the
                    gate. She greeted us very kindly then said very seriously, "Paul you and Charley are
                    welcome to come see my girls, but don't you fall in love with them." We assured
                    her <pb n="46" id="VAA4025-062-1-050"/> that our intentions were not that serious, and went on into
                    the house and spent a very jolly evening.</p>
            <p>Occasionally a Protestant would attend a service at the Catholic Church and sometimes a Catholic
                    would be seen at a Protestant Church service. But at funerals each group freely attended churches of
                    a different faith.</p>
            <p>One laughable incident left an indelible impression on my mind. The Quakers were holding a series of
                    meetings in their church just over the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jennings County</region>
                    </placeName> Line, west of Hayden. A German, Charley Dunstammer, attended the meetings seemingly
                    with great interest. Finally a committee of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> Brethren waited on Charley in his home to see if Charley did not want to hear more in
                    regard to their particular belief. Charley received them kindly and listened very attentively. After
                    the Quakers had their say, they urged Charley to express his thoughts on their discussion. Charley
                    replied as follows;- "Veil, wat you say may be true, but damned if I believe it."
                    That broke up the conference but it was so good, that one of the Brethren, with a sense of humor
                    told it. For years in that Community when one wanted to express a doubt on any argument it was
                    sufficient to say, I feel like Charley Dunstammer.</p>
            <p rend="center">Philosophy Of Life.</p>
            <p>My father in many respects was an unusual man for his time. He was not educated in the sense of the
                    term today, but he was exceedingly well read. He had a keen intellect and was a leader in church, in
                    politics and in the community. His ideas in the treatment of us children were advanced. He was a
                    strict disciplinarian, but he wanted us to always do the best we knew. If we did that, though we
                    erred, we met nothing but sympathy from him. The last thirty years of his life he suffered terribly
                    and was physically a wreck but he carried on and reared his family, if not in luxury at least we
                    never suffered for food, clothing and shelter.</p>
            <p>Father and Mother were both honest, hardworking sincere, generous, religious people. They had fine
                    standards of life and lived them. From them I learned early in life, that, "man should earn
                    his bread by the sweat of his brow," <pb n="47" id="VAA4025-062-1-051"/> that a
                    man's word should be as good as his bond, that one should live simply and frugally, and if
                    possible put something aside for old age, that one should pay his just debts, that one should
                    "do unto others as he would that others should do unto him", that each person has
                    a task to do in this world, to be temperate, in all things, to live at peace with all men, to guard
                    the weak and respect the aged. And finally to fear God and keep his commandments.</p>
            <p>While I have not always lived to the fullest degree the precepts of Mother and Dad, they have
                    influenced my life perhaps more than I realize.</p>
            <p>I have never cared greatly for money. I have been happy with little. At times I have wished for more,
                    not so much for myself, but for my family and others. Perhaps having to live simply, I value a
                    dollar too highly. It hurts oft times to spend freely. I confess that I have always had a fear that
                    in my old age I might be dependent upon others. That I could not stand. I have never contracted a
                    debt that I did not pay and have paid debts contracted by others that I did not have to pay, but did
                    pay because I thought it the right thing to do.</p>
            <p>In politics I regard the independent, thinking voter the greatest safeguard to Democracy. With enough
                    independent voters, there can be few Bosses, and little long lived wrong and corruption. Yet I
                    believe in political parties. In general I have voted principles in State and National Elections and
                    for the best men regardless of party in local elections. I have no doubt been influenced by
                    Dad's political experiences but I try to do my own thinking.</p>
            <p>I feel that all men should work at least to the degree that they are self supporting. Man is at his
                    best when he is at work. Too much leisure is not good for man. One of the problems of the future I
                    feel will be to get people to use their leisure time wisely. For that reason every man should
                    cultivate a hobby.</p>
            <p>I am inclined to think that some suffering is necessary to a man's highest spiritual
                    development. My father suffered terribly yet I never heard a word of complaint or bitterness. He
                    rose to a spiritual height, during those years of suffering that is unusual. My respect for him is
                    enhanced when I realize <pb n="48" id="VAA4025-062-1-052"/> how he kept sweet and wholesome and
                    patient during those years [of] suffering.</p>
            <p>Then I am glad that I have had faith in men. The world is growing steadily better. Progress is not
                    always in a straight upward line, but on the whole mankind has advanced immeasurably in the past two
                    thousand years. For years I have made it a habit to help in a small way the underprivileged or those
                    apparently down and out. I have loaned them small sums of money, or helped them to borrow small sums
                    at the bank. I can count on the fingers of one hand the ones who have let me down. Fifty dollars
                    over a period of forty years will more than cover my loss. That money is a small price to pay for
                    the satisfaction I have had through the appreciation of those to whom I have extended a hand.</p>
            <p>My school philosophy has been simple. Perhaps this is it. To help render my service and that of my
                    teachers useless to the pupil. To put him on his feet so that he can stand alone and be independent.
                    To guide to counsel, to admonish to encourage each pupil to help himself, to develop the best in his
                    personality, body, mind, and spirit, has been my aim. Sometimes I have had to say don't,
                    but more often I have been able to say do.</p>
            <p>I have tried to keep young and keep in mind the pupil's point of view, and to realize that
                    he must make his own decisions, if he is to develop the best within him. I have never used corporal
                    punishment without feeling a sense of failure.</p>
            <p>I feel that in our school work we have, in seeking the development of the intellectual, neglected too
                    much the physical, moral and spiritual. We are just now beginning to realize that we must have a
                    larger program of guidance in our schools.</p>
            <p>As I approach the years of retirement the school problem gets larger and larger. How to take the
                    untutored, often uncouth and unattractive youth, at times from homes worse than none, and guide him
                    for twelve years until he develops into a wide awake, civic minded, moral, thinking, self supporting
                    young man, is an important and tremendous task. I know no greater work in this world.</p>
            <pb n="49" id="VAA4025-062-1-053"/>
            <p>I have made many mistakes in my school career; I have committed sins of omission. I fall far short of
                    my objectives. But I have generally done the best I knew. I have worked at the job and I have been
                    happy in doing it.</p>
            <p>To many of us, life is little more than hardship to endure and difficulties to overcome. We do not
                    see the happiness or inspiration that is all around us. We are like Peter Bell of whom Wordsworth
                    says;- <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>"A primrose by the river's brim,</p>
                        <p>A yellow primrose was to him,</p>
                        <p>And it was nothing more."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>I have had much joy out of the beauties of nature, and of art and of music. I have not understood
                    much about them but they have been a source of pleasure. I like to realize now and then that the
                    world is fresh and beautiful and happy. That helps to keep the spirit young. Nor have I ever lost
                    the happiness of today by brooding over the sorrows of yesterday or fearing the troubles of
                    tomorrow.</p>
            <p>My religious philosophy is also simple. I have not been bothered by questions of theology. I have not
                    worried about the Virgin Birth, or Fundamentalism in any form. I have accepted the Old Testament as
                    being a history, beautiful in imagery and symbolism, of a people rising from barbarism to
                    civilization. The miracles have not disturbed me. Jesus said, "Greater things than these
                    shall ye do," and modern science has made the miracles appear tame. My philosophy can be
                    summed up about as follows.</p>

               </placeName>, coincides in time
                    with the territorial period of that part of the country in which it was situated. First built in
                    1787, the year Congress established the Northwest Territory, Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>
                    </placeName> remained in operation until 1816, the year Indiana became a state. It occupied three
                    locations: the first, from 1787 to 1803, on the northwest edge of the old town; the second, from
                    1803 to 1813, about three miles above, on the river; the third, from 1813 to 1816, back in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the site of the former Fort Sackville. These three separate locations, called for
                    convenience I, II, and III, and the obliteration of obvious physical remains led to great confusion
                    in the minds of early local historians. Lacking documentary evidence, they depended upon tradition
                    for their descriptions of Fort <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Knox</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName>, called it the fort of the Peanguichias. Another name, mentioned in 1746, was

                    considered a part. An English form of this was Little Wiautanon, abbreviated to "L.

            <p>The foregoing resume of the work of historians, who might be expected to know the facts, points to
                    the unreliability of tradition as a source of information. The then undiscovered and unpublished
                    records of the period were inaccessible to these local historians; and the better-remembered events
                    of Harrison's administration as governor tended to emphasize the out-of-town fort,
                    especially as all observable traces of the town structures had presumably disappeared. The up-river
                    location is the only one known to the majority of the present residents of <placeName>

                    1778–1782, and indicates another structure parallel to and the same shape as Fort
                    Sackville, but nearer the river. This might be Fort <placeName>

            <p>Living conditions for the soldiers were not pleasant. Their fare was poor, and sometimes near famine
                    conditions prevailed. Transportation difficulties and local crop failures were contributing factors.
                    The post surgeon, John Elliott, requisitioned vinegar as necessary for the troops who were living
                    entirely on salt provisions. There were constantly many persons on the sick list, largely owing to
                    the prevalence of malaria. For the sick Elliott further requisitioned a few delicacies, including

            <p>The year 1788 opened with the excitement of an Indian attack. In a letter of August 12 Hamtramck
                    reported that on July 27 Indians had surprised a convoy of stores coming up the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. Ten men had been killed and sixteen wounded in the ensuing attack. He suspected
                    treachery on the part of some of the inhabitants in passing to the Indians information obtained from
                    the "express." Most of the supplies were captured; and the garrison was placed in
                    a bad situation as the troops had no drugs, no flour, only two months pork, no bark, and no emetic.
                    The misfortune was greater since soldiers and villagers were as usual full of malaria. In the letter
                    of August 12 Hamtramck also enclosed a plan of the garrison and asked Harmar to give it a name.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                    by the incident as it threatened their usual peaceful relations with the tribes. Hamtramck was
                    forced to give <placeName>

                    town. According to Hamtramck the party was greatly exasperated and would have made an expedition

                    a treaty with the Americans perhaps because the British had told them that the Kentuckians would not

            <p>In a letter of October 13, 1788, Hamtramck acknowledged the receipt of a flag and asked approval of

            <p>Hamtramck complimented Captain Ferguson on the appearance and discipline of his company and also upon
                    his efforts in building the garrison. How he achieved so much with his company is hard to understand
                    since the men of Captain Smith's company were "not able to do duty for the want of
                    shirts and shoes." In a letter of the same date Harmar directed Hamtramck to name the fort

                    inspired respect and affection while maintaining a reputation as an excellent disciplinarian. As an
                    administrator of civil affairs he was admirable under great difficulties. He merits remembrance by
                    the town which he protected at a critical time.</p>
            <p>The administration of Captain Pasteur who succeeded Hamtramck is reflected in his orderly book, dated
                    June 24, 1793 through May 16, 1797. The entries, which deal mainly with infractions of discipline
                    and punishments therefor, give some idea of the life of the soldiers at the fort. Several
                    infractions occurred during Pasteur's first two months of command, but prompt punishment
                    soon reduced the number substantially. Sleeping while on guard, drunkenness, going to the village
                    without permission, and riotous conduct were chief offenses. A court martial of non-commissioned
                    officers tried the cases and prescribed the punishment, generally lashes. The number varied from
                    thirty-five, fifty, or seventy-five up to the legal limit of one hundred, usually inflicted at
                    evening roll call. Several times the commandant forgave the culprit because of previous good
                    conduct. The only unusual "crimes," for which certain privates were brought to
                    trial, were imposing on and cheating a Mr. Reed of Post <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the killing of a hog belonging to an unspecified person, and an attempt to defame the
                    character of a young lady of the village. Financial restitution was made to the owner of the hog and
                    the usual lashes administered for the other offenses. These are the only indications of relations
                    with the village.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the restricted life at the fort, it is surprising that insubordination was not more
                    frequent. Nothing in the way of amusement, not even card playing, was allowed. Visits to the town
                    were only by permission and only to specified places "where there [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>]
                    business calls them." The soldiers celebrated the Fourth of July and the victory of Fort
                    Recovery in 1794 with an exemption from fatigue duty and an extra allotment of whiskey. On St.
                    Patrick's Day the Irishmen in the corps were accorded the same rewards in honor of their
                    patron saint. Despite these restrictions Pasteur's <list type="footnotes">

                    objected to the presence of the troops—perhaps due to the riotous conduct described in

                    usual consequences. Sentiment for moving the garrison was evidently developing; and this as well as
                    the lack of ground for raising food and the difficulty of obtaining firewood, were reasons for the

                    of a considerable slope back from the river with a good view up and down the stream. Part way down
                    the slope was (and still is) an excellent spring, and the Petit Rocher furnished a good place to tie

                            or the spring of 1813, they took it down and rafted it down the river and put it up on the
                            river bank opposite the Catholic Church. 2nd. The fort was about 80 yards from the old
                            Cathedral Church that was there at that time. 3rd. It was still called Fort <placeName>

                            wide and ten rods long. 6th. It was built of hughed [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] logs for pickets
                            set in the ground and 12 or 15 feet high. 7th. There was a gate in the uper [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] end of the fort and I think there was one in the lower end—there
                            was gates in the sides. 8th. I seen the fort in the fall of 1813 &amp; in 1814 &amp;

                    chimneys, and hewn timber scattered over the ground. Still later the heirs of James Buckley, three
                    daughters and a son, appeared and asked for a retrocession of one hundred acres of land which
                    Toussaint Dubois had sold their father. They also asked for compensation in the amount of eight
                    hundred dollars for the destruction of timber. They presented Dubois' receipt for the full

                    for the officers and soldiers, and that the buildings and timber were rafted down the river and used
                    to build another fort in 1813. A second deposition concerned the value of the timber, said to have
                    been worth about four hundred dollars.<hi rend="sup">87</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, on July 14, 1832, Congress passed an act for the relief of the heirs of Jeremiah Buckley,
                    confirming them to their title to one hundred arpents of land and requiring the Secretary of
                    Treasury to pay the heirs the sum of two hundred eighty dollars in compensation for the use of
                    timber and land. The Buckley's in turn must relinquish all claims against Dubois or the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. This relinquishment was dated February 27, 1833. The other heirs conveyed their title
                    to John Smith, husband of one of the daughters.<hi rend="sup">88</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1835 Smith and his wife sold one hundred arpents of land to Henry M. Shaw, an Episcopal clergyman
                    and a colorful character of the time. His widow had possession for some years but finally sold the
                    land to W. B. Purcell in 1894. It was farmed by Purcell and his heirs until 1932, when it was
                    conveyed to the Public Service Company of Indiana, which corporation contemplated the building of a
                    power plant on the site. While the area was farmed, ploughing turned up various military items:
                    buttons, a small cannon ball, a gun barrel, and flints, as well as numerous Indian artifacts.
                    Interest in the site never flagged, and in 1963 the Indiana Historical Society sponsored an
                    excavation to discover, if possible, the exact location of the fort. A considerable part of its
                    outline was discovered that summer, and the next summer gave more information. On March 16, 1964,
                    the Public Service Company deeded to the Indiana Historical Society 41.5 acres of land valued at
                    forty thousand dollars, thus insuring the preservation of the fort site and making possible the
                    erection of a reproduction on the original location.</p>

            <p>During the past two decades, Populism, its meaning and impact on national life, has received
                    increasing attention. Professor Durden's brief study, relying primarily upon the papers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>'s Senator <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the party's national committee chairman, analyzes the problems of Populist
                    leadership. The author concludes that there was no "conspiratorial" manipulation
                    behind Bryan's nomination at the convention—at least he can find no evidence of
                    any scheme in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> manuscripts. In reply to historians who support the position taken by H. D. Lloyd and
                    the Midroad Populists that the silver issue edged out other reforms because place-seeking
                    politicians sacrificed their party and its principles to win public office, Durden insists that
                    logic and ideology dictated Bryan's choice far more than did personal ambition. He tempers
                    this stand, however, by pointing out how important an even minor public office was to a politician
                    in the depression-ridden 1890's.</p>
            <p>Most of the book details the work of the national committee, especially <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s problems in dealing with the irrepressible Tom Watson. Watson was a
                    difficult man, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> did yeoman work trying to harness him in tandem with Bryan, while the latter, engaged
                    in one of the liveliest campaigns in American history, tried to win with two vice-presidential
                    candidates. C. Vann Woodward's appraisal of Watson remains essentially unchanged, but
                    Durden does brighten <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s image by reviewing their campaign correspondence. Durden also stresses <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s role in organizing local fusion tickets.</p>
            <p>The author describes but does not emphasize <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s anomalous position after the election, when he seemed to be both the
                    party's defender and liquidator. Fusion had been so complete that preserving
                    Populism's identity proved hopeless, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> became the target for criticism by angry Midroaders as well as fusionists who wanted to
                    become Democrats.</p>
            <p>Durden's work illustrates the need for a biography of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, whose life—he became a Bepublican progressive by 1906—seems to
                    indicate that Populism's link with the Democrats was neither so logically nor ideologically
                    sound as it has appeared. The leaven of Populism had small impact on southern Democrats. Where its
                    heritage persisted, reform was so entrammeled by the states rights orthodoxy that its spokesmen,
                    even today, find a better hearing outside the South. A similar condition appears to hold in the
                    Middle and <geogName>Mountain West</geogName>
                    <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-062-1-086"/> where Republican progressives seemed to reflect the Populist
                    demand for reform far more than the Democrats.</p>
            <p>In this context Cedric B. Cowing's well-written and splendidly research study is significant
                    because it relates the original and ideological responses of reformers to the behavior and practices
                    of the commodity and stock markets. Cowing demonstrates that in most instances the Populist
                    strongholds in the wheat and cotton states shared a distrust for the grain pit and Wall Street. Both
                    felt speculation was morally corrupt and a detriment to the economy, but, whereas the mid-westerners
                    and southwesterners attempted to end speculation by federal intervention, the cotton states balked
                    because of the constitutional issue of states rights.</p>
            <p>Cowing's work is multidimensional: a legislative history of the market as well as an
                    analysis of the groups that favored and opposed federal regulation of it. He catalogues the votes of
                    three generations of anti-speculation politicians, discusses the rhetoric of various factions both
                    in and out of government, and delineates three positions: the agrarian, the financial reformer, and
                    the progressive. The agrarians, their geographic base in the wheat and cotton states, denied that
                    future trading served a useful purpose and favored eliminating the exchanges. The financial
                    reformers, primarily situated in large eastern cities, believing the market to be both essential and
                    beyond government control, argued that only an internal mechanism could reduce the influence of
                    corrupt individuals who upset legitimate dealings. The progressives, whether urban or rural,
                    accepted the economic function of the market but sought to use government commissions to protect the
                    interests of the less knowledgeable and poorly financed investors who were being fleeced by
                    dishonest brokers, controlled investment monies, false representation of values, and market
                    manipulation.</p>
            <p>Unlike other businessmen after the turn of the century, market operators made almost no effort toward
                    self-regulation. That the market so long staved off control is directly attributable to the
                    divisions among agrarians and progressives and the almost continuously prosperous bull market until
                    1929. Cowing explains how each minor market panic produced agrarian sponsored legislative efforts at
                    both the state and federal level as well as progressive proposals for investigations and
                    commissions. Both groups gradually provided an ideological and practical basis for the regulatory
                    measures of the 1930's.</p>
            <p>From fetching title to thoughtful conclusion, Professor Cowing writes with insight and wit. His work
                    is a highly valuable contribution to the literature of the Progressive Era.</p>

            <p>Professor Conrad contributes to the abundant literature on New Deal agricultural policy as he
                    analyzes the effect it had on a single class of farmers—the sharecroppers of the Cotton
                    Belt. These "Forgotten <pb n="83" id="VAA4025-062-1-087"/> Farmers," numbering
                    nearly two million, "constituted one of the most perplexing problems facing the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in the 1930's" (p. 205). This pitiable group of farm families, filled
                    with the real life characters of Steinbeck and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Caldwell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was the debris cast up by the confluence of the onrushing stream of southern economic
                    evolution and the torrent of the Great Depression. The author contends that in the attempt to
                    fashion a program to raise farm income, the Braintrusters either overlooked or disregarded the
                    sharecroppers.</p>
            <p>The cotton programs, Conrad asserts, were designed to favor the landlords and offered motivation for
                    tenant eviction by reducing acreage. Payments went to the landlord who then divided the money with
                    his tenants according to their interest in the crop but kept the lion's share for himself.
                    This procedure, to the dismay of the author, tended to perpetuate the evils of tenancy at the very
                    time there was opportunity for reform. Payments made directly to the tenants, had this been
                    practical, would have given sharecroppers more independence and could have substantially modified
                    planter-tenant relations. It was the author's conclusion, unsupported by an adequate
                    evidential base, that during 1933–1934 "the landlords were desperate enough to
                    accept government aid no matter what strings were attached" (p. 206).</p>
            <p>Conrad relates the well-known story of the friction-ridden Agricultural Adjustment Administration
                    during its first three years. He emphasizes, however, the catalytic role played by the tenancy
                    controversy which ruptured the strained relations between agrarians and liberals (p. 105). Conrad
                    correctly points out that the fundamental difference lay in an ideological conflict between the
                    liberals who envisioned substantial socio-economic reforms and the agrarians who sought a workable
                    program for agriculture. He sympathizes with the liberals (p. 153). Readers may become confused by
                    Conrad's assessment of the liberals' motive in forcing the issue in 1935. Their
                    action, he states, was "well calculated to disrupt the entire cotton program, cause trouble
                    in the plantation areas, and tear AAA apart" (p. 109).</p>
            <p>The author set out to tell the story of the impact of the AAA on southern tenants but, in fact,
                    devoted only three of his ten substantive chapters to the tenants and the remainder to operations in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The nature of the sources perhaps dictated this. The official files of the AAA
                    provided the bulk of the documentation. The records of the Southern Tenant Farmers' Union
                    gave added perspective to events in one geographical area—northeastern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, the trouble spot of southern tenancy during the depression. STFU attempts to get the
                    AAA to halt tenant evictions, the inaction of the AAA, and the violent reaction of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName> planters constitute one of the most interesting parts of the book.</p>
            <p>This is a good and useful book. It could have been much better with a minimum of additional effort.
                    There are two obvious deficiencies in addition to the rather casual organization of chapters. First,
                    it lacks any preface or introduction. One must read well into the book to discover the
                    author's purpose because the opening chapter describing southern tenantry is immediately
                    succeeded by two chapters on the origin of the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the cotton programs
                    under it. Second, it has no bibliography. Good footnotes and a scant <pb n="84" id="VAA4025-062-1-088"/> page at the end discussing the manuscript collections consulted are
                    hardly substitutes.</p>
            <p>The merit of Conrad's contribution is indicated, however, by the fact that this book was the
                    1964 award winner of the Agricultural History Society.</p>

            <p>The emergence of the present civil rights movement has impelled historians to reexamine the findings
                    of previous antislavery research. New conclusions are being reached by men who are more familiar
                    with sit-ins and mass demonstrations and profess to see in today's reformers the
                    reincarnations of Garrison and Weld, Douglass and Birney. If we accept this view and admit to the
                    purity of heart of contemporary leaders, then similar considerations should be applied to the
                    abolitionists. We should perforce reappraise Sumner and Phillips (for examples) as rational men of
                    principle; the vituperative Garrison will emerge as a benevolent reformer who was right for all the
                    right reasons.</p>
            <p>Most historians agree on the broad outlines of the history of anti-slavery. Differences center about
                    causality and motivation. Many senior historians—who generally declined to contribute to
                    this collection—have been preoccupied with behaviorist and sociological explanations,
                    which argue Duberman, <hi rend="i">et. al.</hi>, is at the expense of a more direct and
                    rationalistic approach. The editor's introduction gives perspective to this view with a
                    discussion of objectivity and presentism. Noting that some of his essayists wrote "explicit
                    defenses" of their subject, he yet reiterates the obligation of each generation to
                    reevaluate the relevant past. He concludes that the sympathy of holders of the "new
                    view" for civil rights is necessary and proper and in no way compromises the writing of
                    antislavery history.</p>
            <p>In assembling this laudable group of seventeen essays, Duberman has captured the essence of the new
                    scholarship. Larry Gara attempts to ascertain who was and was not an abolitionist and decides that
                    the evolutionary diversity of the movement makes this a highly relative question. Fawn M. Brodie
                    ponders the perennial unpopularity of the abolitionist and concludes that it stems largely from
                    "anxiety over contemporary racial problems …" (p. 67). Leon F. Litwack
                    emphasizes the central contention of his associates, that "the entire question of racial
                    equality was at issue, not merely the elimination of chattel slavery's (pp.
                    154–55). James M. McPherson ably reviews the last century's
                    "scientific" arguments against racial equality and demonstrates their rejection by
                    the abolitionists. Silvan S. Tomkins presents a challenging theory of social commitment to explain
                    the activities of four leading abolitionists with the supposition that it is generally applicable.
                    In his summary of Canadian abolitionism, Robin W. Winks records parallels and contrasts between the
                    two North American anti-slavery movements.</p>
            <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-062-1-089"/>
            <p>Editor Duberman and Robert F. Durden separately examine the attitudes of the North toward slavery and
                    the Negro. Durden analyzes the early Republican party's inconsistent dislike of
                    slaveholders, slavery, and Negroes. Duberman demonstrates the failure of abolitionists to direct
                    northern public opinion, showing that the radical solution—such as abolitionism
                    presented—is usually rejected in this land of moderation. Instead,
                    "non-extension" was accepted by most as the sensible path which would presumably
                    result in the "natural" death of slavery in the Old South. Duberman also marshalls
                    evidence in defense of abolitionist leadership by demonstrating the stability and good sense shown
                    by most abolitionists. His rationalist point of view precludes behaviorist interpretations.</p>
            <p>Howard Zinn contributes the final essay, a zestful attack on past historical writings on
                    abolitionism. His muscular defenses of the neccessity of "extremism," personal
                    involvement, and emotionalism—which "intensifies the forms of already existent
                    behavior" (p. 426)—are quite provocative.</p>
            <p>By emphasizing the relevance of the crusade against slavery to the present crusade for civil liberty,
                    these essays will surely invoke endorsement and rebuttal from other historians. If a dialogue
                    results, centered on this historical relationship, then this collection will have served its avowed
                    purpose.</p>

            <p>When so distinguished a student of Reconstruction as Professor Donald publishes even a small book on
                    the subject, any serious student in the field will be eager to discover its contents. The present
                    volume consists of the three lectures delivered in the annual series of Walter Lynwood Fleming
                    Lectures in Southern History at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University. This fact alone places the study in good company, for a long list of
                    outstanding contributors to an understanding of Southern history has formerly appeared as Fleming
                    lecturers. These essays are suggestive, informative, and quite possibly provocative of more detailed
                    investigation, although no pretensions are made to sweeping or revolutionary alterations of the
                    Reconstruction account.</p>
            <p>The central theme is that Radicals and Moderates in the Republican contingent in Congress between
                    1863 and 1867 probably cannot be distinguished from each other by sets of characteristics other than
                    political ones. It is suggested that they were much more alike than would be supposed from accounts
                    emphasizing their contests in Congress. The proposition is that all of the Republicans would very
                    probably have agreed on a somewhat Radical position regarding Reconstruction had they been free to
                    vote as they pleased. The difference between Radicals and Moderates is attributed largely to their
                    presumed desire to be reelected and hence to their calculations concerning how much Radicalism their
                    constituents could be persuaded to swallow. Closely contested <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-062-1-090"/>
                    congressional districts tended to send congressmen who had to be Moderates in order not to lose
                    their margins of victory, while safe Republican districts could release their representatives from
                    such constraint so that they could vote their true convictions.</p>
            <p>Appendices conveniently provide the roll-call tabulations used to distinguish Radicals from Moderates
                    or from other segments of the House of Representatives; similar roll-call data for ten key votes on
                    Reconstruction measures in 1866–1867 leading to the passage of the Military
                    Reconstruction Act of March 1867; and the percentages of the popular vote received by each
                    Republican congressman in the three elections of the period under study. The reader may, therefore,
                    pursue the author's path of analysis with the raw materials he employed.</p>
            <p>After laying this groundwork for estimating the practical difference between Republican factions in
                    the House, the author traces the progress of the Congressional Reconstruction plan through Congress
                    by employing a detailed and well-illustrated image of a pendulum, passing through several swings
                    before coming to rest on the precise legislation accepted by both House and Senate in March of 1867.
                    This he describes as the simple arithmetic of politics.</p>
            <p>It is freely admitted that no gross manipulation of the data produced a convincing behavioral-science
                    type proof of the general thesis and that correlation between Radicalism and safeness of seat is
                    about zero for the House taken as a whole. But by scrutinizing the local distinctions between states
                    and even districts, the author offers further evidence in support of his
                    thesis—employing, one might add, a fairly familiar type of traditional historical method.</p>
            <p>Even if a reader should find the approach or the conclusions limited or questionable, he will find
                    all of the cards on the table, face up. And it is difficult to read anything from David
                    Donald's pen without profiting from his perceptiveness, his adroitness in eluding
                    doctrinaire self-shackling, and above all his clarity and grace in presentation.</p>

            <p>Many of the individual state studies of Reconstruction derive from the Dunning school, although there
                    have been important revisionist works, especially Francis <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>

                        </placeName> During Reconstruction.</hi> Professor Williamson's work is, as he admits
                    in his preface, a revision of that "classic in revisionism"; but it is more than
                    simply that. It displays both the strengths and weaknesses of the revisionist approach. Williamson
                    believes that "it is possible that we have passed onto a new plateau … where
                    slavery and Reconstruction fall beneath the horizon … and perspective rises a measure
                    above personal passion" (p. vii). Thus the contemporary historian of Reconstruction
                    approaches his materials "with new viewpoints." He asks "new
                    questions" and ceases "to ask all of the old."</p>
            <pb n="87" id="VAA4025-062-1-091"/>
            <p>Based on exhaustive research in the extensive manuscript sources—many of which had not
                    been fully utilized before—Williamson's book presents a detailed and complete
                    account of the role of the Negro in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> during Reconstruction. Indeed, in <hi rend="i">After Slavery</hi> Williamson has given
                    us a thorough reworking of the traditional story of the Negro in the Reconstruction history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He presents massive factual evidence and persuasive arguments to support his
                    interpretation of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> Negro as an intelligent, responsible voter (p. 341) and an effective, sensible
                    politician (pp. 345, 378), not simply an illiterate field hand raised by circumstances to political
                    prominence and power (p. 376). Moreover, Williamson produces considerable information to indicate
                    that the corruption of the radical government was not nearly so extravagant as many redeemers
                    maintained (p. 417). He also credits the Republicans with much of the reform work that effectively
                    put a stop to the worst corruption before the redeemers came to power (p. 397) and condemns the
                    redeemers for their failure to deal "viciously" with the corruptionists (p. 416).</p>
            <p>Not all of this is by any means new; but much of it tends to suggest that the experiences of the
                    Negro in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> during Reconstruction deviated, in many respects, from the traditional view of the role
                    of the Negro in the Reconstruction South. In at least one particular, however, Williamson seems to
                    press for a conclusion that is more, perhaps, than is warranted. He challenges the widespread notion
                    that the separation of the races and the establishment of a rigid code of segregation was a
                    development of the late nineteenth century. Williamson feels that the separation of the races
                    "was the most revolutionary change in relations between the whites and Negroes in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> during Reconstruction" (p. 274). He also asserts that "well before
                    the end of Reconstruction, this mental pattern was fixed; the heartland of racial exclusiveness
                    remained inviolate; and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> had become, in reality, two communities—one white and the other
                    Negro" (p. 299). While this argument is not without merit and is supported by numerous
                    examples which Williamson cites, it seemingly undervalues the rather obvious fact that
                    Reconstruction was a period of fluidity in race relations and that many elements, old as well as
                    new, were involved in the determination of the emerging pattern of race relations. One can doubt
                    that by the end of Reconstruction conditions were so settled, even in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>, as to produce two exclusive societies, one white and one black.</p>
            <p>Without question there is much that is substantial and stimulating in this solidly researched,
                    carefully written work. Not least among its virtues is its comprehensiveness and its integration of
                    the Negro into the general story of Reconstruction in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The period of Reconstruction remains one that is much debated among historians. There
                    are still wide areas of disagreement. Williamson has enriched the quality of this debate and has
                    increased the measure of our understanding not only of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Carolina</settlement>
                    </placeName> Negro during Reconstruction; but, in many ways, of most Reconstruction developments.</p>

                    </placeName> with a Ph.D. degree from the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, has written a good book, which is both a contribution to intellectual history and a
                    continuation of C. Vann Woodward's <hi rend="i">Strange Career of Jim Crow.</hi> In it he
                    explores anti-Negro thought, which he defines as "specifically, the body of ideas revolving
                    around belief in the Negro's innate racial inferiority" (p. viii), from 1900 to
                    1930. The first half of the book deals with the contributions which scientists, social scientists,
                    historians, novelists, and clergymen, wittingly or unwittingly, made to the development of this
                    thought. Perhaps the thing about the book which strikes the present-day reader most forcibly is the
                    volume of the racist literature and the large number of eminent scholars and public men who
                    subscribed to and perpetuated racist doctrines—usually not out of malice but simply
                    because they accepted certain assumptions without question.</p>
            <p>Science, reinforced by the social scientists, was the chief bulwark of racism. An enormous amount of
                    literature by eugenists, ethnologists, anthropologists, paleontologists, psychologists, and
                    sociologists substantiated popular beliefs that Negroes were innately inferior. Scientists relied
                    heavily upon the race-climate hypothesis to prove that evolution was the source of racial
                    inequality. Social scientists interpreted the results of "intelligence" tests as
                    evidence of innate racial inferiority. Respectable scholars accepted prevailing notions of
                    "biological law" and "racial instincts." Even a humanitarian
                    like Frank Lester Ward declared that Negro men raped white women because of the "biological
                    imperative" to improve their offspring. Nearly all of the leading American
                    historians—including Rhodes, Burgess, Dunning, Fleming, Phillips, and
                    Bowers—explicitly believed in the inferiority of Negroes. Reconstruction was interpreted
                    as a riot of "Africanism," and the Ku Klux Elan was defended. But historians were
                    less widely read and less influential than novelists. A host of literary figures ranging from Thomas
                    Nelson Page to Thomas Dixon pictured slavery as a benevolent institution and emancipation and its
                    aftermath as disasters.</p>
            <p>Much of the defense of slavery had been religious, and clergymen in the early years of the twentieth
                    century revived these arguments. A northern-born Episcopal bishop, residing in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="aru">Arkansas</region>
                    </placeName>, in the book, <hi rend="i">The Crucial Race Question</hi>, sought to prove that Negroes
                    were inherently bestial and degenerate and that race prejudice was "God implanted"
                    (p. 88). In short, says Newby, "The Negro then was virtually friendless. Condemned by
                    science to a subordinate place in nature and disparaged by history for his alleged failure to
                    contribute anything to man's civilization, he now found himself abandoned, ignored, or
                    patronized by Christianity and the nation's religious community" (p. 109).</p>
            <p>In the second half of the book the author shows how the Vardamans and the Tillmans and other
                    extremists vulgarized and applied the racial theories of the intellectuals to defend segregation and
                    disfranchisement and other schemes for "solving" the race problem. Newby indicates
                    that by the middle of the 1920's changes were underway which eventually <pb n="89" id="VAA4025-062-1-093"/> eroded much anti-Negro thought. But in a final chapter on the
                    persistence of racism he deals briefly with the revival of extreme anti-Negro thought in the guise
                    of science which has developed as a reaction to the Supreme Court school decision of 1954 and the
                    current civil rights struggle. The "scientific" racism of Carleton <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Putnam</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a return to the kind of science which was prevalent in the early years of the

            <p>Struggle, as Hugh P. Rankin concludes, is perhaps the best word to describe a marked and pervasive
                    quality in the records of theatrical activity in colonial America. The managers of theatre companies
                    and actors, sometimes with shrewd tact and diplomacy, sometimes by means of subterfuge or downright
                    deceit, struggled first of all to entice appreciative audiences, so that theatre in America might
                    survive. Sometimes managers and players struggled with stubborn adherents of various religious sects
                    or with civil authorities merely to get permission to build a theatre and to present theatrical
                    entertainment. Rankin's fascinating and carefully documented account of the effort and
                    circumstance involved in planting a seedling theatre in American soil offers substantial new
                    information and insight about the activities of both the players and their antagonists.</p>
            <p>In his diligent search for new knowledge about colonial theatre, the author first investigates and
                    succinctly recounts the existing annals of early theatrical activity in America. He then considers
                    in particular the years from 1716, when the building of the first theatre in English America was
                    started at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    resolution which discountenanced and discouraged theatrical activities. Chief attention is given to
                    the management policies, the personnel, the repertoire, and the artistic qualities of various
                    playing groups. Thus, with increased fullness of information and sometimes with new perspective, the
                    reader learns about the tours and the theatrical experiences of the early Murray-Kean Company, the
                    Hallam Company, and David Douglass' Company, first known as a "Company of
                    Comedians from <placeName>

                    </placeName>," later as the "New American Company." Such companies, and a
                    few lesser groups, are carefully observed and described as they performed in such cities as

            <p>In addition to his amplified account of the touring activities of theatre companies, the author gives

                    theatre in America bespeaks the interests and intentions of a social historian. This means that
                    readers are sometimes given a chance to observe the colonial theatre as a cultural manifestation,
                    embroiled with social or political turbulences of eighteenth-century American society or forced to
                    contend with certain intellectual and religious forces of the time. Perhaps a significant indication
                    of the contrasting cultural interests espoused by citizens in the northern and southern sections of
                    colonial society was the warm welcome and support given to the actors in <placeName>

            <p>This excellent study is based on scrupulous research, contains much fresh material about its subject,

                    Notes, appendices, index. $7.50.)</head>
            <p>Although the intellectual history of the American Revolution has long received study, in the last few
                    years there has been renewed and fresh interest in it. In the twentieth century Carl Becker probably
                    contributed the most perceptive study of American political ideas of the Revolution in his <hi rend="i">The Declaration of Independence.</hi> Becker's work has been revised to some
                    extent by Edmund S. Morgan, most notably in <hi rend="i">The Stamp Act Crisis.</hi>
                    Becker's book placed American thought in the long tradition of natural rights;
                    Morgan's focused more closely on the American context. Recently another sort of
                    study—the outstanding example is Caroline Robbins <hi rend="i">The Eighteenth-Century
                        Commonwealthman</hi>—has offered yet another approach to American revolutionary
                    ideas. <hi rend="i">The Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman</hi> demonstrated the persistence of a
                    seventeenth century revolutionary tradition, as expounded and amplified by the "Real
                    Whigs." Colbourn has chosen to follow up this second approach and has extended and
                    amplified suggestions made in Caroline Robbins' study. He has also done much more.</p>
            <p>In the early portions of his book Colbourn carefully reconstructs colonial tastes in
                    history—Americans read ancient and medieval history though they favored English above all
                    other—and shows how indebted Revolutionary thought was to the colonials' reading
                    of history. This must have been a difficult job demanding patience and energy, and the author has
                    done it well. Colbourn also tells how the early eighteenth-century colonials read their books, what
                    they found in them, and how they interpreted them. Here the evidence is flimsy, and readers may at
                    first be skeptical of Colbourn's reconstruction of colonial reactions. But to read further
                    is to become convinced by his views. The author's research has been so thorough, his
                    judgment so balanced, <pb n="91" id="VAA4025-062-1-095"/> and his craftmanship so excellent that one
                    is carried by his arguments. A good historian must say what he thinks after he has considered all
                    the evidence: Colbourn seems to be a good historian, and he has exhausted the sources.</p>
            <p>In the major part of this study, which shows the uses to which such Americans as John Adams, John
                    Dickinson, James Wilson, Benjamin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Daniel Dulany, Richard Bland, George Mason, and Thomas Jefferson put history, it
                    becomes clear that American ideas were not derived from the past. Bather the past was used
                    selectively to illustrate American contentions about political principle and rights.
                    Americans' perceptions about their politics probably developed from their understanding of
                    their own experience. But to demonstrate the validity of their claims of rights—and
                    eventually their claim to independence—Americans invoked the English revolutionary past.
                    The English tradition, in turn, was seen in the context of nature. From this perspective the
                    American presented a series of arguments which proved unassailable.</p>
            <p>Like any good book this one raises many questions it cannot follow up. It is hoped that Colbourn will
                    some day turn to the view in America that eighteenth century <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was corrupt. He has chosen many quotations which suggest that American leaders detested
                    English corruption and feared that free institutions contained imperfections that would inevitably
                    lead to degeneration. In any case, one is grateful for this balanced and clear headed book.</p>

            <p>Talbert has avoided one obvious pitfall of the institutional historian, reporting only those events
                    which do not embarrass the institution. One finds in Talbert's history accounts of
                    President Henry Sites Barker's deficiencies and difficulties and the bribery of several <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s achievements.</p>

            <p>The Talbert study will be of interest chiefly to Kentuckians concerned with the development of their
                    state university. In this respect it is regrettably typical of many instutional histories, for its
                    concerns are distressingly parochial. One learns of the erection of new barns on the campus but
                    little of the developments affecting colleges and universities throughout the country during the
                    same period. No doubt one explanation is Talbert's nearly exclusive reliance, as indicated
                    by footnotes, upon <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> archives and newspapers in preparing this study. He writes of the division between
                    retiring President Patterson and President Barker during the early years of this century concerning
                    vocational and classical curricula, but this dispute is not analyzed in the context of the
                    widespread controversy throughout the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on the same issue at that time. The concept of service to the state in Chapter III,
                    "Serving the Commonwealth," is developed without reference to Charles <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Van</region>
                    </placeName> Hise's "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> Idea," which established the principle of service among state universities.
                    Instead Clark Kerr's vastly different "multiversity" notion is cited as a
                    latter day equivalent of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s earlier concern with service. A later discussion of economy in education (p.
                    34) omits reference to the popularity of Taylorism among educators of that period. Finally, the
                    report of litigation leading to the admission of Negroes to the university does not include any
                    report of comparable legal activity in other border states, particularly <placeName>

                    </placeName>, at the same time.</p>
            <p>Talbert occasionally manages to whet the curiosity of his reader but repeatedly fails to satisfy him.
                    He recounts in one paragraph (p. 102) the appointment of German Jewish professors in the
                    mid-nineteen thirties, assisted by the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars and
                    the Rockefeller Foundation; but he does not assess their influence at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. His evaluation of Frank L. McVey, whose presidency lasted from 1917 to 1941, is
                    limited to one paragraph (p. 132). Another question which Talbert skirts is <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>'s apparent ambivalence in identifying itself with the titans of state
                    universities to the north, such as <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>,
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <country reg="inu">Indiana</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                    </placeName> (p. 61) or with the small, regionally-oriented ones to the South. Talbert notes but
                    does not amplify President McVey's effort to establish a repository for infrequently-used
                    library books in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> (p. 127), but the author does not define the relationship of this project to the
                    Midwest Inter-Library Center. In short, Talbert's work relies heavily on recapitulating
                    events and decisions without interpreting them.</p>

            <p>This addition to the growing body of studies of higher education by trained historians reflects a
                    variety of forces in American life in the first third of this century. The volume also contains
                    useful lessons for governing boards charged with relating the academic community to the general
                    citizenry through the selection of university presidents. Glenn Frank, a self-made man who deserted
                    a rural, evangelistic background, found fulfillment in eastern cities and on the campuses of
                    Northwestern and <placeName>

                    economic and international upheavals of the era of the First World War. As editor of <hi rend="i">Century Magazine</hi> he had to cope with changing financial and literary conditions which

                    educational enterprises and the exciting but frustrating innovations such as the Experimental
                    College. His sudden decline from popularity demonstrated that Wisconsin's powerful faculty
                    and deans had accorded their lay executive only grudging acceptance from the start. In the end,
                    Larsen holds, the problems brought by the depression exposed the president's previously
                    concealed weaknesses.</p>

            <p>This study rests to an impressive extent on correspondence and interviews, supplemented by
                    Frank's numerous writings and newspaper accounts. Larsen's reiteration of the many
                    "facets" of Frank's activities (pp. vii, 6, 88) suggests that some
                    interpretations lay beyond precise documentation. We read that "intuitively Frank had
                    sought to insure himself against the day when crisis threatened" (p. 104) and, in relation
                    to John Chappie's attacks on the university in the 1930's, that "it was
                    probably no coincidence that almost two decades later a <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Department of State" (p. 117). Larsen's indictment of Frank as
                    shallow, a judgment apparently shared by much of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> faculty, is blurred by revelation of Frank's support of internationalism in
                    the interwar years, his disassociation from the racist Lothrop Stoddard "from principle
                    rather than expediency" (p. 33), and his willingness to instigate if not to support
                    consistently Meikeljohn's Experimental College.</p>
            <p>A legible text with excellent illustrations is marred by the use of tiny reference numbers and the
                    placement of source notes in the back of the book without running chapter identifications.
                    Nevertheless, readers will find this brief but searching biography an instructive guide <pb n="94" id="VAA4025-062-1-098"/> to personal characteristics which could earn for one man a place in the

            <p>This book consists of thirteen essays and "A Mordant Last Word," arranged in four
                    parts setting forth the author's view of the relation to culture of (1) colleges, (2)
                    religion and morals, (3) wealth, and (4) beauty and community. The essays depict the degradation of
                    culture in the West.</p>
            <p>This degradation is seen through the gloom of a bitter nostalgia which leads the author to advocate
                    the "restoration" of an educational system and a society that never existed. There
                    was good in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution, but Kirk dwells on it almost to the
                    exclusion of the abundant evil. He does not mention the plague, the Inquisition, the serfdom, or the
                    rigid conformity. He ignores the short, brutal, nasty life of the many in low places; and if he
                    notes the arrogant pride of the few in high places, he seems almost to approve of it. One must agree
                    that much evil has accompanied the Industrial Revolution and the development of democracy. But one
                    need not therefore condemn these movements or ignore the good that has come with them. The growth of
                    individual freedom and of consideration for others should not be left out of the account. Nor is the
                    amelioration of life for the physically and mentally afflicted, the child, and the aged valueless.</p>
            <p>It is clear that the author's values are not those of most Westerners: leaders or followers,
                    intemperate professors or temperate ones. He condemns humanitarianism (p. 113) and castigates both
                    private foundations and government for subsidizing "utilitarian" rather than
                    "humane" ventures ("Massive Subsidies and Academic Freedom"). He tells of a
                    father, a "drunken brute," who often "thrashed his daugter to fill her
                    with a holy terror." But, says Kirk, "Her upbringing, bad though it was, may have
                    been better than the formative years of the average American child nowadays,
                    ‘permissively’ reared." The father had painted on his silo roof,
                    "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (pp. 73–74). Kirk
                    further declares, "To demand for mankind ‘freedom from fear,’ as
                    politically attainable, was a silly piece of demagogic sophistry" (p. 74).
                    "Freedom from fear, if I read St. John aright, is one of the planks in the platform of the
                    Antichrist" (p. 80).</p>
            <p>The opening sentences in the last essay might well have led the entire text: "This is my
                    case: there ought to be inequality of condition in the world. For without inequality, there is no
                    class; without class, no manners and no beauty: and then a people sink into public and private
                    ugliness" (p. 152).</p>
            <pb n="95" id="VAA4025-062-1-099"/>
            <p>The book is, indeed, made up of "cultural splenetics." Yet, incredible as it may
                    seem, the term "intemperate professor" is not meant to apply to the author but to
                    his opponents in the debate. Perhaps it should be applied to both sides. The
                    "Academy" never was temperate, and to assert that it was (p. 6) is to ignore much
                    of its history. In the first part, Kirk asserts his belief that academic freedom protects the
                    radical professor more than it protects the conservative one. This reviewer does not believe that
                    such is or should be the case. Both, if competent, should be secure. It seems worth noting that the
                    book was published by the press of a state university, the kind of institution of higher learning
                    that its author condemns most stridently.</p>

                        </placeName> Historical Quarterly</hi>, a publication of the latter organization, has contained
                    an article on a historical landmark. In addition to telling how a particular site was acquired and
                    restored, each article gives appropriate historical and biographical data. Fifteen of these articles
                    comprise this volume, which has been published jointly by the two historical organizations named
                    above.</p>
            <p>While the title suggests a book designed primarily for popular consumption, the content contains
                    information for the academician as well. Most of the articles are liberally footnoted giving ample
                    indication of scholarly research. Some of the articles contain data which have been garnered from
                    collections of private letters and from archival sources not readily available to the average
                    person. They not only give the work an aura of respectability but set it apart from the brochures
                    which inaccurately present the history of so many of our historic sites today.</p>
            <p>Numerous illustrations make the book especially attractive. In addition to sixty black and white
                    photographs there are fifteen artist's sketches which accompanied the articles when they
                    originally appeared in the <hi rend="i">

                        </placeName> Historical Quarterly.</hi> The fact that the high cost of colored photographs
                    probably precluded their use does not prevent one from speculating upon the added attractiveness of
                    such a medium.</p>
            <p>Like most collections of articles this volume suffers from the un-evenness that inevitably
                    accompanies diverse literary styles. Even more disconcerting is the arrangement of the series in
                    alphabetical order. Having determined the specific historic sites to be presented in this <pb n="96" id="VAA4025-062-1-100"/> as well as its projected companion volume, the editors might have used
                    a chronological approach to greater advantage. Not only would this method have supplied a desirable
                    degree of continuity and cohesiveness to the various articles, but also it would have taken
                    cognizance of the fact that many readers who are not too well acquainted with the history of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> need some logical form of orientation.</p>
            <p>Although the book contains a table of contents, it is not sufficiently detailed to compensate for the
                    lack of an index. The listing of proper names in an index would have been most helpful to the casual
                    reader. Perhaps the editors felt that the illustrated map on the inside covers obviated the
                    necessity for such a tool.</p>
            <p>Despite these minor criticisms <hi rend="i">Landmarks of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> History of American Civilization series is to provide brief but authoritative studies
                    of significant epochs and important topics in American history. Surely the story of the automobile
                    deserved a place in the series, and now, in Professor Rae, it has found a worthy chronicler.
                    Although less interpretative than other volumes in the same series, this one is thoughtfully
                    structured, well-balanced, concisely written, and highly readable. It is in short, the best one
                    volume history of the automotive industry available and a valuable addition to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> series.</p>
            <p>The words <hi rend="i">automotive industry</hi>, however, deserve to be emphasized. Connoisseurs of
                    vintage cars, racing enthusiasts, engineers, stylists, and automotive buffs in general will probably
                    find little here to interest them. Rae, who is professor of economic history at Harvey Mudd College,
                    is concerned with the business enterprise which grew up around the automobile. His book is primarily
                    the story of how and why the horseless carriage became the largest manufacturing industry in the
                    nation.</p>
            <p>In many ways this book is a sequel to the author's <hi rend="i">American Automobile
                        Manufacturers</hi> (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, 1959), which traced the growth of the industry from its beginning to the
                    mid-1930's. The first one hundred twenty pages are a skillful condensation of the most
                    significant portions of the earlier book, the remaining one hundred fifteen pages a model survey of
                    the industry since the New Deal. Because the industry had solved most of its technological,
                    production, and distribution problems by the 1930's, there is less emphasis on these topics
                    in the latter half of the book and more emphasis upon the automobile's influence in
                    American life. The chapters on the rise of industrial unionism present <pb n="97" id="VAA4025-062-1-101"/> an exemplary synthesis of information available only in much longer,
                    more detailed, and less readable works. The discussion of federal assistance to highway construction
                    programs brings together in very brief fashion all the major pieces of federal legislation since
                    1916.</p>
            <p>According to the author the history of the automotive industry is divided into roughly three periods.
                    The first, from 1893 to 1921, was one of experimentation and growing sophistication in the garage,
                    and, despite Ford's dominance after 1915, one of reasonably healthy competition in the
                    marketplace. The major problems were those of technology and production; they were solved by the
                    invention of the electric starter which assured the triumph of the gasoline engine over its
                    competitors and the perfection of the assembly line which ushered in the age of mass production. The
                    second period, from 1921 to 1945, witnessed the maturing of the industry. The depression of
                    1920–1921 hit the leaders hard and forced many of the newer and smaller companies out of
                    the business. After the shake-up General Motors emerged stronger than ever, Chrysler Corporation
                    appeared as a strong contender, and the Ford Motor Company began its gradual decline. By 1929 the
                    trend toward oligopoly was evident; the great depression and World War II only strengthened the
                    tendency. Within the industry planned obsolescence was introduced to combat the competition from
                    used cars, techniques of distribution were greatly improved, and the rise of the UAW necessitated
                    far-ranging changes in management-labor relations. Since 1945 Rae finds few major innovations within
                    the industry. The outstanding features in the automotive world have been in highway construction and
                    design and the explosion of suburbia, both the results of increased automobile usage.</p>
            <p>The only unsatisfactory portion of this book is the discussion of social change engendered by the
                    automobile. Here, it seems to me, the author has been content merely to catalogue the obvious and
                    sometimes to overstate the role of the automobile in the sweeping social changes so obvious in our
                    times. Happily, this is a small failing in an otherwise informative and valuable book.</p>

                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>, an exciting record of mining-boom days in the mountain regions of <placeName>

                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName>, and a thrilling account of the lusty, reckless, swaggering, sensuous crew of artists
                    who built a literature out of the "magnificent, grand rocks" and the wild, rampant
                    urban frontier of the Far West.</p>

            <p>Rollin Daggett, the story's central figure, was born of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> parents in northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, not far from the Thousand Islands, in 1831. While a small lad, he continued with his
                    family the transmigration to northwestern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, where the Black Swamp frontier town of Defiance became home through the time of his
                    youth. Daggett's early exposure as a printer's devil at eighteen to the trade that
                    attracted him to a writing and editing career was interrupted by the cry of
                    "Gold!" in the West, and early in 1850 he hit the trail for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Two years in the gold fields apparently were rewarding and late in 1852, Daggett joined J. Macdonough
                    Foard in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> in founding and publishing for eight years the <hi rend="i">Golden Era</hi>, the
                    Pacific Coast's most important literary journal of the nineteenth century. Bret
                    Harte's earliest preserved works appeared in the <hi rend="i">Era</hi> during
                    Daggett's editorship. After two years of editing the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Daily Evening Mirror</hi>, 1860–1862, Daggett headed for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Virginia City</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the Comstock Lode, "by, … to make money." After
                    establishing a brokerage firm there, he was soon writing for the <hi rend="i">Territorial
                    Enterprise</hi>, along with a brilliant, roistering coterie of youthful reporters that included
                    Joseph T. Goodman, the editor, Dennis E. McCarthy, along with Goodman a proprietor of the paper, Dan
                    De Quille (William Wright), Samuel L. Clemens (who became Mark Twain on this paper), and Charles
                    Carroll Goodwin. For a time, 1874–1875 and 1877–1878, Daggett edited the <hi rend="i">Enterprise.</hi>

                        <settlement type="city">Virginia City</settlement>
                    </placeName> he also gave part of his time to politics. In 1862 he was elected to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName> Territorial Legislature, and between 1867 and 1876 he served as clerk of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Circuit and District courts of <placeName>
                        <country reg="nvu">Nevada</country>
                    </placeName>. In 1876 he was a Hayes elector, and two years later he was sent to Congress for a
                    term. Defeated for reelection, he was named by Arthur minister to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName> in 1882 and served there until 1885.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, his writing—prose and poetry—continued for newspapers and magazines.
                    A novel entitled <hi rend="i">Braxton's Bar</hi> appeared in 1882, and the materials were
                    gathered for a book on <hi rend="i">The Legends and Myths of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, published in 1888 by Mark Twain.</p>
            <p>In Congress Daggett fought for the equalization of railroad freight rates, free coinage of silver,
                    and public land benefits for his adopted state; and at one point he worked for a copyright law that
                    would be advantageous to his old friend, Twain. As minister he strove to create and maintain a
                    situation and atmosphere favorable to ultimate annexation. Although he was a nationalist, he was,
                    above all, a westerner who fancied himself a frontiersman and perpetuated his view of the West in
                    voluminous writings. To him, air and space were the fortune of the West and the preservative of
                    American life, while "poverty and crime and discontent nurse schemes of disorder in the
                    narrow ways and crowded tenements of the great cities, and fill the air with threatened
                    violence" (p. 69).</p>
