            <p>Ten miles north-west of the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson county, Indiana, is located the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is picturesquely situated both beneath and upon the hills, at the place where two
                    streams meet, Middlefork and Big creek. More than sixty years ago this little village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the scene of what was up to that time the most unique step ever taken in the
                    educational history and progress of Indiana. That step was the founding of a school, having in view
                    both common and higher learning, and open alike to both white and negro races. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> and vicinity had previous to that time been the center of a considerable anti-slavery
                    sentiment, which had taken shape in the formation in 1839 of the "Neil's Creek
                    Anti-Slavery Society," the records of which are now deposited in the Indiana State Library.
                    The Neil's Creek neighborhood was some three miles west of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It is probable that James Nelson, who with his brother Daniel, had emigrated from
                    Vermont to Jefferson county about the year 1820, was the leading spirit in the organization of this
                    society. Its records are interesting as showing the trend of anti-slavery sentiment in that early
                    day, and the considerable number of members that were willing to incur the odium of entering upon an
                    agressive anti-slavery agitation. The first settlers of Jefferson county were largely from Kentucky
                    and <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-019-2-004"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, and while not exactly pro-slavery in sentiment, were inclined to view with disapproval
                    any agitation of the slavery question. However, there was a fair proportion of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> people among these early settlers, and such were generally anti-slavery in sentiment.
                    The fugitive slave, therefore, who crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> by the help of such
                    masters of transportation as Rev. Chapman Harris, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a colored preacher and blacksmith, and "Jim" Hackney, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName>, himself a half breed Indian and negro, found numerous friends in Jefferson county.
                    Whether such fugitive's course northward was by way of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>, among the Nelsons the Hoyts and the Tibbettses, or by way of Monroe church among the
                    Elliotts and the Baxters, or by way of Canaan, among other abolitionists, daylight of the next
                    morning after the arrival of such runaway slave upon free soil, usually found him safely hid in some
                    abolition barn loft in Jennings or <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Ripley county</region>
                    </placeName>. Here he was for the time being secure from molestation from Wright Rea or slave
                    catchers of his class. An abolition Baptist church had been formed at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> which afterwards became the College Hill Baptist church. By reason of its known
                    anti-slavery sentiment this church could not at first affiliate with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Baptist Association, but united with an association of anti-slavery Baptist churches in
                    northern <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. About the beginning of the Civil war, however, it was admitted to membership in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> association. The existence of this church and the reasons heretofore given made <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> seem a fit place to establish a school where educational privileges would be open to
                    the negro. The idea of such an institution was first conceived in the mind of Rev. Thomas Craven, of
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, who had visited <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> and preached to the abolition church. Mr. Craven was a Pennsylvanian by birth, a
                    soldier of the war of 1812, and a pioneer teacher and Baptist minister of eastern Indiana, while the
                    state was yet a territory. He completed a classical course of study at Miami university when past
                    fifty years of age. After the year 1854 he made his home at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or College Hill, as it was sometimes afterwards called, until his death in 1860.</p>
            <p>The institution began its work in 1849, and it was named "Eleutherian Institute"
                    from the Greek word "eleutheros" <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-019-2-005"/> because the
                    school was to be dedicated to the idea of freedom and equality. It was incorporated soon after its
                    establishment. Rev. John G. Craven, a son of Thomas Craven, was the first teacher in the school, and
                    he was soon joined by Prof. John C. Thompson, of South <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, a son-in-law of
                    Thomas Craven. The patronage of the school not being sufficient at its beginning to support two
                    teachers, Professor Thompson, the father of the writer of this sketch, returned to Ohio after one
                    year's service. As early as the year 1850 the pro-slavery sentiment of the community
                    surrounding the young institution began to view with much disapproval the founding of a school where
                    educational privileges were open to the negro. The boldest spirits among those of pro-slavery
                    sentiment became incensed at the very audacity of a scheme for an abolition college in their midst.
                    As an outgrowth of this sentiment the incendiary's torch was appealed to, and in the year
                    1850 three houses were burned, which it was supposed would be occupied by persons of negro blood
                    while attending the school. Two of these houses were burned just as they were being completed. They
                    were located about a quarter of a mile south-east of where the institute buildings stand, and were
                    built by a Mississippi planter named <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> had married a wife with a tinge of negro blood, bought land near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> and proceeded to improve it, with the intention of living there, while his children by
                    this marriage could be educated. The other house that was burned was located on the east bank of
                    Middlefork creek, a short distance north of where that stream is now spanned by an iron bridge. The
                    site of the burned house has for many years been overgrown with trees. These acts of incendiarism
                    had no influence whatever in deterring the founders of the school from their purpose. Some two years
                    afterwards, when the black laws of Indiana had become in force, the law attempted to lay its mailed
                    hand upon the institution. A prosecution was begun against Prof. John G. Craven and James Nelson,
                    who, with his good wife "Aunt Lucy," kept the dormitory. They were charged with
                    harboring negroes, and encouraging negroes to come into Indiana, "contrary to the statutes
                    in such cases made and provided." The accused abolitionists went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to answer the charge, expecting to be put upon their trial, <pb n="112" id="VAA4025-019-2-006"/> and withal somewhat hopeful that they might be permitted to spend at
                    least a brief season in the Jefferson county jail. They by no means regarded martyrdom as a thing to
                    be dreaded, and believed they were being persecuted for righteousness' sake. Through the
                    influence of Judge Stephen C. Stevens, their counsel, then a prominent member of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> bar, himself an abolitionist and a warm friend of the school, the accused were
                    permitted to go upon their own recognizance, and the cases were never afterwards pressed for trial.
                    It may be said that after this time no serious persecution was again attempted against those
                    connected with the institution. Even before the breaking out of the Civil war the community almost
                    regardless of political sentiment recognized that the institution was of great benefit in their
                    midst, and many who at first opposed afterwards became patrons of the school.</p>
            <p>Thomas Craven donated the land upon which the buildings were erected. By means of his own and other
                    contributions enough funds were secured to erect two substantial buildings, one for a chapel and
                    school rooms, the other a dormitory. These buildings are built of rough limestone, which was
                    quarried in the immediate vicinity. The dormitory was two stories in height, contained fifteen
                    rooms, and was completed in 1850. The institute building was three stories in height, contained
                    seven rooms besides the chapel and was completed in 1856. This building is surmounted by a tower or
                    cupola from the top of which a very picturesque view of the surrounding country may be had,
                    including a glimpse of the town of Dupont, four miles to the north. Thomas Craven was himself the
                    most generous of all donors to the institution; for in addition to his gifts of land and money, he
                    freely devoted his time to the solicitation of funds and students for the institution, traveling
                    throughout south-eastern Indiana and south-western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. During the year 1858, in company with Mr. E. K. Tibbetts, a student of the
                    institution, he traveled as far east as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Mass., soliciting aid for the school, but with only a moderate degree of success.
                    Before his death he made a conditional donation of $1,000 to the institution, which was
                    to be payable when certain debts of the school were discharged. After his death the executor of his
                    estate contested the payment of this subscription, on the ground that <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-019-2-007"/> the condition had not been complied with. The matter was submitted to
                    arbitration, and decided in favor of the institution, this being the only litigation, so far as I am
                    aware, in which the school was ever involved. The institution never had an endowment, and as its
                    teachers had to depend upon the tuition fees of students for compensation, whatever high thinking
                    such teachers did, had to rest upon a basis of very plain living. They could have suggested from
                    their 'own practical experience a solution of the vexed problem of the present day, the
                    high cost of living.</p>
            <p>Prof. John G. Craven was the principal of the institution from its beginning to the autumn of 1861,
                    when he removed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mnu">Minnesota</region>
                    </placeName>. It was during his principalship of the school that negro pupils attended. The
                    patronage of negro students was never large, owing in part to the menace of the black laws of
                    Indiana, but more especially, I think, to the well nign universal lack among free negroes of that
                    time of the means whereby an education could be secured. Most prominent among the negro pupils of
                    the institution was Moses Broyles, for many years a leader among the negroes of Indiana in
                    educational and religious advancement. He came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the early fifties, having been born a slave in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, but having been allowed to purchase his freedom after arriving at years of manhood.
                    Tradition says that Broyles was bashful and diffident when he first appeared at the school, and that
                    when he would attempt to recite or speak in debate he would be seized with coughing and choking
                    spells. By degrees he overcame these faults, and became a forceful and eloquent speaker. Broyles was
                    a genuine Moses, in fact as well as in name, to the negro Baptists of Indiana; and in the opinion of
                    Dr. W. T. Stott, former president of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, the Eleutherian Institute would amply justify its existence and its cost, if
                    it had educated no other pupil than Moses Broyles. A few other colored pupils progressed to the
                    point of fitness for teaching in common schools, but by far the greater number of negro pupils
                    pursued learning no further than the elementary principles represented by the three Rs. Pupils of
                    negro blood came from as far south as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
               </placeName>, but the greater part were from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>If the traditions of the school may be relied upon, some of <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-019-2-008"/> the
                    best blood of the south was represented at College Hill. Two young women named Lucy and Georgiana
                    Jefferson were pupils there for a time. Their father was one of the first negro residents of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, had been a slave of Thomas Jefferson, and in abolition circles was reputed to be the
                    natural son, by a slave mother, of the great author of the Declaration of Independence. Professor
                    Craven once told me that he did not doubt the truth of this tradition respecting
                    Jefferson's parentage. I do not vouch for the truth of the tradition. I merely assert that
                    such a tradition was current respecting these two young women. Theodore Johnson, a colored pupil
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, was reputed to be the natural son of Col. Richard M. Johnson, once vice president of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. He remained a pupil until the outbreak of the Civil war, when he enlisted in the union
                    army and died in the military service. Johnson always claimed that he was a son of Col. Richard M.
                    Johnson, and there is corroboration of this claim, from the fact that his bills were paid by drafts
                    on a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> bank drawn by those who were interested in the settlement of Colonel Johnson's
                    estate. Johnson was a bright pupil, and he was the envy of some of the boys of his age, by reason of
                    being the possessor of an illustrated paper containing pictures of the Sayers and Heenan prize fight
                    which took place in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in 1860. Two young women with negro blood by the name of Taylor, from
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, were pupils at College Hill. They were reputed to be
                    daughters of a Col. Taylor, who tradition said, once lost thirty slaves in one night, by means of
                    their crossing the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> on the ice. Another colored pupil, Louisa Page,
                    from near Carrollton, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, showed the scars upon her lips caused, so it was said, by a cruel mistress attempting
                    to sew her mouth shut. Two of her brothers, "Jim" and George, were also pupils,
                    the freedom of the whole family having been purchased by their father. It is not likely that more
                    than forty negroes or persons of negro blood attended the school during its entire history. The
                    statements have been made with reference to this old institution, that fugitive slaves were brought
                    there and partially educated before being sent on toward <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName>. Such statements are wholly fanciful, and have no basis in fact. An undertaking of that
                    kind would have been hazardous <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-019-2-009"/> in the extreme. I only know of
                    one instance where a pupil of the school was supposed to be still owned as a slave. This was a young
                    woman from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> or vicinity, having scarcely a trace of negro blood, who was brought north by her
                    master to be educated. At one time it was rumored that she was about to be returned to slavery, and
                    she was temporarily taken to <placeName>
                  <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>, <country reg="ohu">Ohio</country>
               </placeName>, by Mrs. Ellen Collett, a daughter of Thomas Craven. The alarm of
                    her friends proved groundless; she soon returned to the school, and after securing her education,
                    for some years lived in the home of Hon. John R. Cravens, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Neither is it true that those connected with Eleutherian Institute engaged in any
                    wholesale manner in the forwarding of fugitive slaves. If a fugitive reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>, by whatever means or route, the north star was pointed out to him, and he was sped on
                    his way, but such things did not often occur. The stories that Thomas Craven had a secret apartment
                    in the attic of his house, and that Dr. Samuel Tibbetts had a secret tunnel under his barn, where
                    fugitive slaves were concealed, are wholly fanciful, for as a boy I knew every nook and corner of
                    both attic and barn.</p>
            <p>Two instances will suffice to show how fugitives were treated in the early days of the
                    institution's history. One night in the summer of 1849 a step was heard on my
                    father's porch and there was a knock at the door. It proved to be Squire Lyman Hoyt, and
                    the intelligence was imparted to my father in subdued tones, that a man from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> was waiting in the shadow of the orchard, and with him an escaping fugitive slave, who
                    had crossed the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> that evening. The old family mare was quickly caught
                    in the pasture, the negro placed astride her, and guided by Cushman, a carpenter then working on the
                    dormitory, himself a grandson of Dr. Samuel Tibbetts, the slave property was transported to the
                    Forks of Graham, in Jennings county. There among such abolitionists as the Neals and the Hicklins,
                    there was but little dinger of "stoppage in transitu." The same year a colored man
                    came to my father's house in great distress. He was a free negro whose home was at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had worked as a roustabout on an <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> steamboat, had
                    left the boat at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> to go back into the country, when he was seized by a gang of white men and mercilessly
                    flogged, for the pur- <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-019-2-010"/> pose of making him confess that he was a
                    fugitive slave. This he would not do, and he was finally let go. My father washed his stripes,
                    dressed his wounds, took care of him for a while, when an effort was made to identify and punish his
                    assailants; but without avail, there being no evidence sufficient to identify the guilty parties.
                    These instances are enough to show that those were "times which tried mend souls."</p>
            <p>The most prosperous years of the Eleutherian Institute were from 1855 to 1861, and at one time during
                    this period the annual enrollment of students exceeded one hundred and fifty. Professor Craven
                    pursued strict, sometimes austere, and at other times even harsh methods of discipline, and he was
                    somewhat eccentric of manner. He was an accurate scholar along certain lines of study, and
                    notwithstanding his peculiarities of method and manner, he usually succeeded in imparting a
                    commendable degree of energy and enthusiasm to his pupils. He was a profound student of the Greek
                    New Testament, and in his later years became an enthusiast in his advocacy of certain changes of
                    translation of divers controverted passages of the New Testament. He died at Smith Center, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, in January, 1894. Those who were associated with Professor Craven during the period
                    from 1849 to 1861 were Prof. John C. Thompson, already mentioned, Mrs. Martha W. Craven, wife of
                    Professor Craven, Mrs. Lucy Hoyt Thompson, Mrs. Lydia Hildreth Hatch, Miss Barbara Thompson, Prof.
                    M. J. Smith and wife, and Judson Smith. The Smiths were Massachusetts people, and were popular and
                    efficient teachers. Prof. M. J. Smith was suspected of leaning toward Unitarianism, and this caused
                    the withdrawal of himself and wife from the institution, and their return to Massachusetts about the
                    year 1860. Judson Smith afterwards became eminent as an educator at Oberlin and Amherst colleges. In
                    his later years he was secretary of the American Board of Foreign Missions, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and in this position was one of the chief promoters of the Ecumenical conference on
                    Foreign Missions, held in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> in 1900, over which Ex-President Harrison presided.</p>
            <p>Prof. William Brand, formerly of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, succeeded Professor Craven as principal of the institution, and served from
                    1861 to 1866. During a part of this time he was <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-019-2-011"/> in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> soliciting funds for the support and endowment of the school (being himself a native of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>). His efforts did not meet with any considerable success. In his absence the school at
                    different times was conducted by the Rev. Samuel Collins, a United Presbyterian minister, and at
                    that time county examiner of Jefferson county, Miss Sarah B. Hoyt and Prof. Solon B. Campbell of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vernon</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Professor <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s connection with the school lasted about a year, and the year was quite a
                    successful one. The "exhibition" given by himself and pupils in the spring of 1865
                    was long remembered in the community. This "exhibition" lasted for two evenings
                    before crowded houses in the old chapel, and was a curious but attractive combination of high school
                    oratory, dialogue, and vaudeville stunts of considerable variety.</p>
            <p>The Civil war caused a decreased attendance and interest in the school, but the community was not
                    lagging in patriotism. Volunteers drilled upon the institute grounds almost before the smoke of
                    Sumter had cleared away, and some of these who were students enlisted in Indiana's first
                    regiment of the Civil war, the Sixth. The institute grounds were often used for drilling during the
                    war and the chapel for union meetings and concerts. One notable concert given by local talent for
                    the benefit of the union cause received high commendation, and on this occasion Hon. David C.
                    Branham made a fiery union speech, with his characteristic style of oratory, so familiar to old
                    residents of Jefferson county. In fact <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> came near feeling the touch of actual war; for Morgan's raiders passed near
                    by, and burned a railroad bridge over Big creek, but two and one half miles north. What might have
                    been the fate of the "nigger college" had their route been through <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> can of course only be left to conjecture.</p>
            <p>Professor Brand, after leaving Eleutherian Institute in 1866 became a financial solicitor for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. In this position he was successful in raising what was known as the endowment
                    of the Johnson county professorship, which afterwards formed the nucleus for the present endowment
                    of that institution. Professor Brand was succeeded at College Hill by Prof. F. W. Brown, afterwards
                    and for many years, professor of Latin in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college, and by William H. McCoy, also afterwards connected with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. Professor <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-019-2-012"/> McCoy remained only a part of
                    the year, and after one yeas Professor <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> accepted a position at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. They were succeeded in 1867 by Prof. Altheus W. Blinn, and he for a time was
                    associated with Rev. James S. Read, for some years active as a Baptist minister in Indiana, and one
                    of the early graduates of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> college. Professor Read suggested a plan by which the Eleutherian Institute was to be
                    taken over, managed and supported by three Baptist associations, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Coffee Creek, and Sand Creek. The plan was carried out to the extent of appointing a
                    board of directors, with representatives from each of these associations. The support of an
                    institution of learning was too great a burden for so limited a constituency, and the associational
                    control was abandoned in 1870. Professor Blinn was a bachelor well past middle life when he came to
                    College Hill, and was so lame that he walked with a crutch and a cane. He was without much method in
                    the school room, was somewhat eccentric of manner, and a little given to pedantry; but withal he was
                    much respected by his pupils, and imparted much valuable instruction. One eccentricity I remember
                    was the wearing of a linen duster constantly from September until mid-winter, without the same
                    having once visited the laundry. Another peculiarity was the burning of four-foot cord wood in the
                    school room stove, a process that required the ends of the sticks to project from the open door of
                    the stove, a smoky experiment at best. For all that Professor Blinn had an unselfish purpose and did
                    his best for his pupils. He temporarily retired from teaching in the spring of 1870, on account of
                    ill health and was succeeded in the fall of 1870 by Prof. Robert Gilmour, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a United Presbyterian minister, who had for some years edited a paper of that
                    denomination. Professor Gilmour was a graduate of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> university, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and continued as principal of the school until 1874, at one time having a lease upon
                    the buildings. While his school was never large as to numbers he was a successful instructor. In
                    1878 Prof. John G. Craven, the first teacher in Eleutherian Institute, returned to Jefferson county
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName>, with the avowed purpose of resuscitating the institution. He continued to conduct the
                    school with some degree of -success until 1887, <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-019-2-013"/> when the
                    institute building was sold to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName> township, for a public school, and Professor Craven removed to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Perhaps those who read this sketch will think it ought to be better, and I think so too; but he who
                    tries to write the history of such an institution will soon discover how elusive facts are and
                    especially when they have sped so far into the past. The minute book of the board of directors was
                    in the library of the institution as late as 1886, when I recall seeing it; but it was probably
                    taken to Kansas by Professor Craven. The library of the school was never very large, nor especially
                    adapted to its needs. The books first presented dealt largely with the question of slavery, and
                    Judge Stevens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Prof. John C. Thompson were the largest donors of books. No negro pupils attended
                    the school after the year 1861. Of those who were pupils in the school before the Civil war, and who
                    have "made good," I have already mentioned Moses Broyles and Judson Smith. Among
                    the young women who were pupils of the institution, and who at least partially obtained their
                    education there, I am sure I make no invidious comparison in especially mentioning Miss Sarah B.
                    Hoyt, daughter of Lyman Hoyt, and Miss Rebecca J. Thompson, daughter of Prof. John C. Thompson. Miss
                    Hoyt completed a course of study at Oberlin college, and at the time of her death was principal of
                    the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, high school, having deservedly high rank as a teacher. Miss
                    Thompson completed a course of study at the Young Ladies Institute, <placeName>

                    </placeName> college, with marked success, retiring in 1910.</p>
            <p>Some of the men most intimately connected with the institution in its earlier years as trustees,
                    friends and patrons, aside from those already mentioned, were Dr. Samuel Tibbetts, and his four
                    sons, Samuel, John H., Joshua and Dr. Earl Tibbetts, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Milton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Craven, a son of Thomas Craven, Benajah and Lyman Hoyt, Lemuel Record, Isaiah Walton,
                    Calvin Hildreth, Reuben Walker, James Baxter, Angus McKay, William D. Kinnear, Jefferson Nelson, and
                    last but not less deserving of mention, William Brazelton, the jolly and odd old postmaster of the
                    village, whose answer to the question, "IS there any mail for <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-019-2-014"/> me?" was usually "I think there are." Of
                    course there are many others worthy of mention, but these names occur to me now.</p>
            <p>Of those who were students of the institution and who lost their lives in the Civil war I can recall
                    John Baxter, Russell Record, Isaac J. Elliott, Edward Tibbetts, Theodore Johnson, John and William
                    Hughes, sons of David Hughes, Thompson Saulsbury, Calvin Gillett, Linus Literal, Zephaniah Delap and
                    Frank Shaw. Of these John R. Baxter, Isaac J. Elliott, Calvin Gillett and Thompson Saulsbury died in
                    hospital. Russell Record was killed at the battle of Perryville, Ky., Edward Tibbetts near Dalton,
                    Ga., Theodore Johnson at battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Ky., John Hughes at Chicamauga, and Linus Literal and Frank Shaw at Ft. Fisher, N. C.,
                    and William Hughes and Zephaniah Delap died in Andersonville prison. It is impossible within the
                    limits of this sketch to name all the students of the "Eleutherian Institute" who
                    enlisted in the union army.</p>
            <p>Not having had access to the records of the board of directors some inaccuracies must have
                    unavoidably crept into this sketch; but as to names of teachers and dates of service I am sure there
                    is substantial accuracy.</p>
            <p>The idea of Eleutherian Institute undoubtedly was obtained from the plan of Oberlin college in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, the first institution of higher learning in the west, if not in the entire country, to
                    open its doors to negro students. Eleutherian Institute was the first such institution in Indiana,
                    and was founded several years before the Rev. John G. Fee successfully carried out the same plan at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Berea</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>. Had not the Civil war come with its momentous changes in the
                    status of the negro race, it is likely that Eleutherian Institute, by reason of its unique
                    distinction and odious notoriety in admitting negro pupils, would have enjoyed a fair degree of
                    patronage and success as long as the system of slavery endured. Emancipation, however, brought some
                    opportunity for education to every negro's door, and this, with the general establishment
                    of the state system of high schools, caused the decline of Eleutherian Institute, as well as the
                    decline of nearly all the other once prosperous academic institutions of Indiana, that were
                    unsupported by endowment. The idea for which the school was <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-019-2-015"/>
                    founded has prevailed until every northern college from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> down gives to all races equal educational privileges, and this is an abundant success
                    in itself.</p>
            <p rend="center">BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THOMAS CRAVEN</p>
            <p>Thomas Craven who, with his son, founded Eleutherian college on College Hill in the village of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lancaster</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Jefferson county, Indiana, was of English descent. The first one of this branch of the
                    family to come to America came about 1674. Years afterward he set sail for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> "to see about some estate," but the ship on which he sailed was
                    captured by a French war vessel, and he was kept a prisoner for a long time. He was not able to
                    communicate with his wife, who had remained in America. After the lapse of several years she
                    concluded that he was dead, and contracted a second marriage; but before doing so she consulted the
                    officials of her church as to the propriety and rightness of this important step, and received their
                    approval. Then Craven, released from his long imprisonment, appeared upon the scene. She gladly
                    returned to her first love.</p>
            <p>It is almost certain that the one who had this Enoch Arden experience was Thomas Craven, a
                    blacksmith, husband of Emmetje Isbrants, who from before 1683 to 1718 lived at Kinder-hook, about 20
                    miles down the Hudson from <placeName>

            <p>Thomas Craven, the subject of this sketch, was born in Westmoreland county, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, March 19, 1792. His parents were married in Bucks county, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, in 1779. Shortly after they moved into "the southern part of the state on the

                        <region type="county">Franklin county</region>
                    </placeName>, and later to Westmoreland county. His father was a Revolutionary soldier and was with <placeName>

            <p>The following quotation from the autobiography of Thomas Craven shows something of the conditions
                    surrounding his early life: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My next youngest brother, William, and myself being somewhat discouraged and dissatisfied
                            with our domestic circumstances, obtained permission of my father to leave in the spring and
                            do the best we could for ourselves. Our object was to cross the mountains and go into
                            Huntingdon county, where I had spent one winter before, knowing that we could obtain better
                            wages than in my father's neighborhood. But the place was about 60 miles distant.
                            We had no money with which to bear our expenses on the way, nor even shirts to change
                            ourselves when we arrived there. My father made no offer of giving us the least outfit, and
                            we were too proud to ask him to do so. The time had nearly arrived, the 1st of April, 1811,
                            which we had set to leave home. A day or two preceding we called on our oldest brother,
                            John, and told him our circumstances. Our sister-in-law prepared us some provisions for the
                            way and sold us a piece of linen on credit sufficient to make each of us a shirt to change
                            us. My brother lent us $1.00 in money. Having got our knapsacks ready and stowed
                            away our provisions, our piece of linen with some other trifling articles of clothing, we
                            went to my father's to spend our last evening in that neighborhood. That night a
                            slight shower of snow fell, but we set out the next morning on our journey.</p>
                        <p>About six or seven miles on our way we had a large creek to cross which we were obliged to
                            wade. The creek was not very deep but the bottom was rocky and the current was rapid.
                            William, in crossing with his shoes in his hand, unfortunately fell into the water and lost
                            one of his shoes. We stopped, however, at a little village on the mountain called Ebenburgh
                            with a shoemaker and got a piece of leather to make a moccasin, for we were not able to buy
                            a pair of shoes. We offered to pay the shoemaker for the piece of leather but he would make
                            no charge. I suppose, indeed, that we looked like objects of charity. At night I made him a
                            moccasin, and in the morning we set out again with fresh courage, and thus kept on until we
                            arrived at the place of our destination.</p>
                        <p>Having been acquainted in the place before, we had no difficulty in getting into work or in
                            securing board in the same family where I had formerly boarded. In a little while we were
                            able to buy such articles of clothing and other necessaries as we needed. Here we kept very
                            steadily at work and went but little into company. When the inclemency of the weather
                            hindered us I frequently spent the time in studying arithmetic or reading. When harvest drew
                            nigh we concluded to visit my father and assist him with his harvest, and at the close of it
                            to return again. We did so and paid my brother the bill which he held against us, and helped
                            our father through with his harvest.</p>

            <p>As a boy Thomas Craven longed for an education, but in the region where he lived educational
                    facilities were of the <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-019-2-017"/> most meager character. So he became his
                    own instructor, and at the age of nineteen, although he had gone to school only nine months in all
                    his life, he qualified as a teacher and taught his first school.</p>
            <p>Like many other prudent and practical young men of that time and of this, he resolved that he would
                    not marry until he was comfortably settled in life and could easily support a wife, and he hoped to
                    be thus pleasantly situated by the time he was thirty—but then, he met Rebekah Selfridge.
                    They were married April 14, 1812. For their wedding trip, with many relatives and friends, they
                    floated down the beautiful Ohio to the alluring west—the Land of Promise—never
                    to see Indiana county again. A large flat-boat was constructed on the Conemaugh river and brought
                    down to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana county, where most of the company went on board. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName> was on the north bank of the river, about two miles down the river from the present
                    town of Blairsville. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Newport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, like those who embarked there is now only a memory—"some of the
                    old chimneys" are all that mark its site.</p>
            <p>Of this trip Thomas Craven writes: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>But having three horses to take on board, and the river being at rather low stage for
                            boating, it was thought best, in order to have the load as light as possible, that my wife
                            and myself should take the horses and go by land to <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                            </placeName>, and then take them in there. We did so and arrived in <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                            </placeName> the second day after we left <placeName>

                            </placeName> about noon. The boat had not yet arrived. We visited the Allegheny river
                            several times during the afternoon longing to see the boat appear in sight, not knowing but
                            that it had stuck fast on some of the shoals which it had to pass. At length, about
                            sun-setting in the evening, we discovered a boat coming down the river at such a distance
                            that we could scarcely tell what it was. As it came nearer we discovered it to be a
                            flat-bottomed boat, but we were still not altogether certain that it was ours. However, in a
                            little time we were able to distinguish the voices of some of our friends, a soft gale
                            gently bearing the sound down the current of the river. I need not say that we were glad to
                            be relieved from our state of suspense and to have the privilege of meeting our friends
                            again at the destined point.</p>
                        <p>Having made the necessary arrangements, we left <placeName>

                            </placeName> and floated slowly down the beautiful Ohio in consequence of the light winds,
                            which generally blew from the west, the roof of our boat being high. However, after a slow
                            passage of seventeen days through a variety of beautiful scenery on every side, we landed
                            safe at <placeName>

            <p>Among the relatives of Thomas Craven who accompanied him on this trip were his brothers John and
                    William; his father-in-law, Thomas Selfridge, his brother-in-law, William Ferguson, and his cousin,
                    Samuel Craven. Many Indiana people trace their ancestry back to those who came down on this boat.
                    Samuel Craven spent his life in Indiana. In 1829 he wrote to his cousin Thomas that there were a
                    number of people in his county bearing the name Cravens; that he was called Cravens so generally
                    that he had accepted it as his name; and that letters should be addressed to him accordingly., John
                    Cravens, son of this Samuel Craven, left a large family of whom at least eight lived in Indiana.</p>

                    hardships, and dangers. Part of the money to pay for his land he earned by teaching school. One of
                    these schools was about six miles from his home. Of this he says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>So I provided plenty of wood for fires and left my wife and little child and a little boy

                            went to teach school, getting home to see them only once a week. Thus they spent the winter,
                            having their ears often saluted with the nocturnal music of howling wolves. Thus I continued
                            teaching school and laboring alternately, sometimes at home and sometimes abroad, until I
                            succeeded in completing the payments on my land.</p>

                        <p>He was made a captain in an Indian war that broke out during the War of 1812. He was
                            stationed at a block-house in the southeastern part of this state, Indiana, probably in <placeName>

                            </placeName>. According to one account this block-house was on Salt Creek, near the road
                            going from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>

                            </placeName>, and its ruins were pointed out as late as 1862. At that block-house was a
                            barrel of whiskey that was popular with all but father. A messenger came from another
                            block-house one day and saw the state of affairs, and returning to his own block-house told
                            his <pb n="125" id="VAA4025-019-2-019"/> superior officer that the only man there who did
                            not make free with the whiskey was Thomas Craven. Immediately the superior officer made out
                            a captain's commission and sent it to father—and that was how he became
                            a captain.</p>

            <p>From the time he received this authority until his death, preaching was a very important part of the
                    work of Thomas Craven.</p>
            <p>In 1826 he moved across the state line and bought a tract of land within two miles of the campus of
                    Miami university at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Oxford</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>. Here his first dwelling was a cabin made of rough logs,
                    soon replaced by a cabin made of hewn timbers which, in 1834, was replaced by a brick house, which
                    is still in good condition, standing almost upon the site of the cabins.</p>
            <p>When he was forty-five years of age he entered Miami university, took the full course, and graduated
                    at the age of fifty, in the class of 1842—thus, at last, gratifying the desire for an
                    education, that he had cherished since boyhood.</p>
            <p>It is not the purpose of this article to give a history of Eleutherian college, in the establishment
                    of which Thomas Craven was the prime mover, so a few facts relating thereto must suffice.</p>
            <p>The first session of Eleutherian Institute, which developed in 1854 into Eleutherian college, began
                    on Monday, November 27, 1848, with John G. Craven, son of Thomas Craven, as instructor. Fifteen
                    students were in attendance, of whom, the record says, "All will study arithmetic; 3,
                    Latin; 8 or more, English Grammar; 5 or more, geography."</p>
            <p>At first the school was held in the old meeting house down near the village sawmill on the Middle
                    Fork, and on the east side of the road going north to the mill.</p>

            <p>The log house mentioned stood on a direct line between the boarding house and the college, slightly
                    nearer to the boarding house than to the college. For a time it was the home of John G. Craven.</p>
            <p>Since the school was an "abolition school", open to all regardless of color, and
                    situated only a few miles from slave territory, it excited the bitter opposition of pro-slavery
                    people, many of whom lived in that part of the state where the school was situated. A planter from
                    Alabama brought his own children with their black mother, all of whom were his slaves, to College
                    Hill to be educated and freed. For their use he built a cottage a little to the east of the present
                    graveyard, and perhaps 600 feet back from the road. Another planter from Mississippi also built a
                    cottage at the same place and for exactly the same purpose. One night, just before the cottages were
                    ready for occupancy, both were set on fire and burned to the ground. It was believed that the
                    incendiaries lived in the neighborhood. This was in 1850. A third house which was to accommodate
                    colored students was burned. Threatening letters were received by those managing the school. Finally
                    the principal of the school and the steward were arrested under the "black laws"
                    of Indiana; and the prospect looked very discouraging.</p>
            <p>But the men and women backing the enterprise had intense convictions and high courage, and at last
                    succeeded in overcoming much of the opposition; and the school was a success until the beginning of
                    the Civil war. The catalogue of Eleutherian college for 1856 shows an attendance of 109 students, of
                    whom 18 were colored, and of these ten were born slaves. <pb n="127" id="VAA4025-019-2-021"/> The

            <p>In 1857 Thomas Craven and his son made a trip to the east for the purpose of collecting money for an
                    endowment fund for the school, but did not meet with much success. On this trip they visited the old
                    neighborhood in Bucks county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, where their ancestors had lived for three generations, <pb n="128" id="VAA4025-019-2-022"/> namely: Thomas Craven (wife Catherine), who was the father of Peter
                    Craven (wife Mary Oliver), who was the father of Thomas Craven (wife Eleanor Adams), who was the
                    father of the subject of this sketch. The first one of the three just named, Thomas Craven, husband
                    of Catherine, was in all probability the son of the emigrant Craven mentioned at the beginning of
                    this article.</p>
            <p>In 1858 Thomas Craven again went east in the hope of raising money for an endowment fund. In a letter
                    from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

            <p>In another letter he speaks of receiving a letter of recommendation from Harriet Beecher Stowe and
                    her husband, and of calling on Charles Francis Adams and Josiah <placeName>

                    contributions; and the plan for an endowment fund failed.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1860 Thomas Craven returned home from a preaching trip in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, sick. It was thought that his illness was due to the drinking of impure milk. He died
                    August 21, 1860, and was buried in the graveyard at College Hill. His life exemplified the
                    principles which he often urged upon his children—"An unflinching adherence to
                    truth and justice, regardless of consequences."</p>

                        <p>FAREWELL ADDRESS OF ELDER THOMAS CRAVEN, A. M.</p>
                        <p>Beloved Children—</p>
                        <p>Knowing that the time of my departure is at hand, I leave you these lines as the last
                            testimonials of my love to you all and of my most ardent desire for your present and eternal
                            welfare. Like others who have gone before me, I have passed through the scenes of infancy,
                            childhood, youth and manhood to old age. A few days since (the impressions are still fresh
                            in my memory) I was a little boy indulging myself in the pleasures and amusements of
                            childhood. The kind father and mother who, then in the vigor of life, ministered to my wants
                            and watched over me with care, have long been reposing in the house appointed for all
                            living. A few days later and I was a youth indulging <pb n="129" id="VAA4025-019-2-023"/>
                            myself to some extent in the follies and pleasures peculiar to my age. A little farther on
                            and I found myself immersed in the cares and bustle of life—a husband and father.
                            Now in advanced age, I look back on my past life with a mixture of sorrow and joy that I did
                            not improve my time and opportunities better, and with joy and thanksgiving that God was
                            pleased to shield me from many snares and temptations into which others have fallen, and
                            enabled me at an early age to hope and trust in His pardoning love and mercy.</p>
                        <p>When your mother and I were first united we entered into cares and businesses of life under
                            somewhat unfavorable circumstances in a new and strange part of the country without
                            education, without property and even without friends whom we could rely on for counsel, but
                            the Lord was good and kind to us and we never suffered from the necessities of life.</p>
                        <p>When we became your parents the interest we felt in your present and eternal welfare we found
                            to be inseparably connected with our own, and hence all our plans and labor and toil and
                            anxiety were to pursue that course which would be most likely to make you useful,
                            respectable and happy, and with the hope of obtaining this most desirable end we denied
                            ourselves of many of the comforts and indulgences of life. In my private devotion one
                            special petition that I often offered up and seemed not to know how to be denied was that
                            whatever might be the lot of any of you in any respects, God would make everyone of you a
                            subject of His saving grace. When I saw everyone of you make a public confession of your
                            faith in Christ, it filled me with joy that I cannot express. I rejoiced in the pleasing
                            hope that God had graciously heard my prayer. Some inconsistency of conduct not very long
                            after the younger part of you became professors filled me with painful reflections lest you
                            might be deceiving yourselves. I fondly hope that your wanderings have been reclaimed, but
                            it can do you no harm to examine yourself with care remembering that the satisfaction of
                            your natures is inseparably connected with the justification of our persons; and if God and
                            holiness is not the controlling principle in your nature, my pretensions to religion are
                            vain. When I compare my family with thousands of others, I have reasons to be thankful. You
                            have generally been obedient, kind and industrious, and your general conduct I approve, and
                            what in this imperfect state could I expect more?</p>
                        <p>When I look back on my past life I see much to disapprove. I hope if you have seen anything
                            in me that is virtuous you will strive to imitate it and that you will ever profit by my
                            errors—my striving to avoid them. One thing I always endeavored to impress on
                            your minds, and I hope that in the main it was exemplified in my own conduct, viz., an
                            unflinching adherence to truth and justice regardless of consequences. Let this principle be
                            at the foundation of all of your actions, but my irritable temper, my impatience and the
                            improvidence into which I have often been betrayed, avoid with the greatest care. Many of
                            the scenes of your childhood and youth which, no doubt you often review with interest, and
                            which often fill me with delight, are past never to return, <pb n="130" id="VAA4025-019-2-024"/> but let not the consideration fill your mind with gloom. We are
                            destined to exist forever, and if united to Christ shortly to bloom in everlasting youth to
                            be connected again in our family, and to engage in exercises more delightful than those past
                            scenes which we review with so much interest.</p>
                        <p>I have never attained that smooth and kind manner of expression which others have. In this I
                            have probably been faulty, but I think not only your mother and you, but all of my immediate
                            acquaintances will witness for me that whatever I may have been in words, my actions were
                            not unkind. Few, I think, have sympathized more deeply with the suffering than I have done
                            at heart, or been more willing to labor for their relief while the increase of human
                            happiness (when known to me) have always increased my own; but if any of my actions towards
                            any of you have appeared at any time unkind, impute to my mistake with regard to that which
                            I suppose would be for ultimate advantage.</p>
                        <p>All the counsel which I would wish to give you and which I wish to impress upon your minds
                            with all the interest and affection of a dying father, you may find embraced, in the words
                            of the wise man, "Fear God and keep His commandments." Let this precept
                            never be forgotten; let the fear of God always be the principle from which you act; and let
                            his revealed will determine at all times what your actions shall be. Much time spent in
                            meditation, self examination and prayer you will find well spent time.</p>
                        <p>With regard to your duty to each other as children of the same parents, I hope though
                            somewhat scattered you will strive to keep up a friendly correspondence, having in view as
                            your highest object the spiritual welfare of each other. Although the center of your union
                            which once held you together may be removed, yet do not forget it and cleave to Christ as
                            that center of union which shall never be removed.</p>
                        <p>Never forget that solemn declaration of Christ himself, "Straight is the gate and
                            narrow is the way that leadeth unto life and few there be that find it," because
                            "broad is the way and wide is the gate that leadeth to destruction and many there
                            be that go in there at." While you strive to make yourselves agreeable with all
                            with whom you may associate through life, guard with the greatest caution against that
                            wicked temporizing spirit so common With your day. Let not the cry fanatic prevent you from
                            always bearing an honest and faithful testimony against sin, whatever form it may assume. It
                            is better to please God than to please man. Let love to God and man characterize your
                            actions, and the glory of God and interest of Zion be your continued aim.</p>
                        <p>In looking back upon my past life I can see nothing ever done by me to rest my hopes upon.
                            The best things I have ever done have been mixed with that which I know God hates, and
                            blessed be His name I hate it myself. I long for and most ardently desire a perfect
                            conformity to the will of God, but my only hope for pardon, for justification, for
                            satisfaction and redemption is in His rich and sovereign mercy founded upon the merits of
                            Jesus Christ. Resting my faith and hope upon Him <pb n="131" id="VAA4025-019-2-025"/> alone
                            I hope to leave the world in peace and to experience fullness of joy when I awake in His
                            likeness.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the little worldly property which I may leave behind me, I have only to say,
                            divide it in an amicable and friendly manner among you, and do not differ among yourselves
                            about it for although it cost your mother and myself much labor, it is not worth disputing
                            about; and consider yourselves not only stewards of that but whatever more you possess for
                            which you one day must give an account.</p>
                        <p>The riches and honor of the world, its frowns or its smiles seem greatly to diminish as I
                            approach the verge of time, so that I can at least to some extent, adopt the language of the
                            poet as my own: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="center">"Careless myself the dying man</p>
                                <p>Of dying man's esteem.</p>
                                <p>Happy, O Lord, if Thou approve</p>
                                <p>Though all beside condemn."</p>
                            </quote>
                  </p>
                        <p>The smile of the Incarnate is all that I shall need to make me happy in a dying hour; it is
                            all that I shall need to make me rejoice at the judgment bar. Let this be my portion, and I
                            envy not the rich, the noble or the honorable of the earth.</p>
                        <p>The filial regard which I doubt not you all cherish for your affectionate mother, will lead
                            you to sooth the pillow of her age and sweeten her passage down the steps of time. If ever
                            children were laid under special obligations to a mother, those obligations doubtless rest
                            on you for whom she suffered and toiled by day and night, and whose greatest failure in duty
                            to you as doubtless the effect of a maternal tenderness.</p>
                        <p>With regards to my earthly remains, I have no doubt but what you will see that they are
                            decently interred, and I desire nothing more; but as it may be useful to some who may pass
                            by my grave where my moldering flesh may rest after my spirit may have passed its flight to
                            God who gave it, to know the faith in which I live and in which I hope to die, I would be
                            pleased that in connection with whatever else you may think proper, you would engrave on my
                            tombstone these lines of Dr. Watts: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>"My flesh shall slumber in the ground</p>

                                <p>And in my Savior's image rise.</p>

                        <p>Finally, my dear children, farewell. May the God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob and of your
                            father, be your God, and make you a blessing on earth, and through the blood of the
                            everlasting covenant, conduct you safely to immortal glory where I hope through the riches
                            of Divine grace, to spend a happy eternity with you all and with your dear mother in the

                    in the progress of that reform which is so essential to the prosperity and duration of our free
                    institutions, the President has been compelled to make; the most inflammatory articles were
                    circulated from one extremity of the union to the other; it was proper that correct information on
                    the subject should be distributed, and proper that the whole business should be presented in its
                    correct light and thenceforth a portion of that paper should be devoted to the subject. This
                    declaration was followed by more than three columns devoted to an attempt to justify the removals.
                    The next week in an editorial, it showed the general character of appointments and the

                    in the state was wrecked.</p>
            <p>The questions of tariff and internal improvements that had been so prominent in the campaign proved
                    to be mere political shadows, cast for the moment to secure votes. The Adams administration turned
                    the question of internal improvements from a national to a state issue. By an act of congress
                    approved March 2, 1827,<hi rend="sup">15</hi> the nation granted to the state, for the purpose of
                    aiding to build a canal, uniting at navigable points the waters of the Maumee and <geogName>Wabash
                        river</geogName>s a strip of land one half of five sections wide on either side of the canal,
                    and reserving alternate sections to be selected by a land commissioner under direction of the
                    president. This placed the burden of responsibility upon the state, with the nation a mere
                    auxiliary. The interest in internal improvements became greater. The state increased its activity to
                    include not only canals, but turnpikes and railroads. For the next twelve years it continually
                    increased its activity until the state went bankrupt and the system was brought to a sudden
                    standstill in 1839-1840.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The tariff question became a dead issue as soon as
                    the election was over, so far as any political or economic effect was concerned. Ratliff Boon, the
                    representative of the First district in congress was severely criticized for voting for a reduction
                    of the sugar tariff.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fact that he had difficulty in justifying his position shows that O. H. Smith was right in his
                    declaration, noticed elsewhere, that the tariff was understood by few. In fact, it is rather
                    difficult today to understand why the people of the west should be so strongly in favor of a tariff
                    where the effect upon them was so very remote. Had it not been that the Jacksonians needed an issue
                    the tariff would have been almost an unknown thing in the west at this time. When it had served its
                    purpose as a campaign issue it ceased to excite public attention.</p>

                    requirement of a strict accountability from the subordinate officers of the government. It was
                    rather remarkable that the issues of 1828 should not be noticed. The "Federalist"
                    principles were given us: Internal local improvements at the expense of the nation; indefinite
                    postponement of the payment of the national debt; a breach of the national faith with white citizens
                    of the south to enable us to preserve the natonal faith with a remnant of uncivilized Indians. The

            <p>The only independent faction within the state was the Anti-Masons. They, like most minor parties,
                    were ready to pay their respects to and receive concessions from the one of the larger parties that
                    chanced to be out of favor. The first notice of them that we have in a political sense is copied

            <p>No better issue could have been found to attract the voters of Indiana. Their entire experience with
                    a bank had been bad. For a time while Crawford was fostering the banking industries of Indiana he
                    had been popular and banks had been looked upon as the pioneer's friend.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> With the failure of the banking system the popular esteem for Crawford and the bank turned
                    into hatred and everything associated therewith became obnoxious and to oppose Crawford and the bank
                    was a sure start to public favor. The people had no means of knowing the qualities of the bank
                    except by their meager experience and that having been unfortunate <placeName>

                    the first of October, 1831, throughout the campaign the administration papers kept up a constant

                    constructive. By choosing to make the race upon an opposition to the bank he put his opponents
                    clearly on the defensive. The established opinions concerning the bank made that defense extremely
                    difficult. The first action on the subject by the National Republicans was early in December, 1831,

                    When the meeting was held the National Republican press claimed that it was the largest public
                    meeting ever held in the country, while the Jacksonian press claimed that it was attended by only a

                    </placeName> to express approval of the veto.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> The <hi rend="i">Indiana
                    Journal</hi> called it "A meeting got up by office holders and office hunters."
                    The orators tried to justify the veto by the fact that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> vetoed a similar bill in 1811,<hi rend="sup">52</hi> This was turned into ridicule by
                    the opposition who showed that the bill of 1811 was killed in the senate. Business men were warned
                    to curtail their business and pay their debts.</p>
            <p>The strongest argument for the veto was made by Col. Richard M. Johnston who crossed the state on a
                    speaking tour. He was extremely popular in Indiana on account of his activities in Indian troubles,
                    and had been the choice of the state for vice-president.<hi rend="sup">53</hi> He condemned the bank
                    for taking part in elections and declared that a foreign enemy had just as much right to do so.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>

            <p>The fact that there were to be national conventions in 1832 excited but very little comment in
                    Indiana either favorable or adverse. State sovereignty was an inborn principle with the mass of the
                    people. They did not proclaim it as did their southern brethren but they acted it, and when once
                    their state had determined an issue, that settled it for the citizens of the state. Thus when the
                    National Republican convention in <placeName>

                    Indiana was concerned. When the national convention in <placeName>

                    Sargent was the avowed friend of a regular system of efficiently operated banks to equalize and
                    diffuse the profits and blessings of trade.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> The Jacksonian press subjected the
                    address of the convention to a rather severe criticism but it received nothing like the attention

                    approbation of the Indiana delegation and would have their cordial support, and that although
                    Richard M. Johnston of Kentucky received their vote, so soon as the will of the majority of the
                    convention was indicated they had been disposed cheerfully to yield their preference, for the
                    favorite son of the west, whose claims to the rewards of his country, they believed to be second to
                    those of none, and to unite with the older states of the union in support of Mr. Van Buren, whom
                    they hesitated not to say, would receive the electoral vote of Indiana in consequence of his
                    nomination by the convention. The opposition, however, were not so ready to acquiesce in the
                    nomination of Van Buren. Before the convention met and when it was apparent that he would be the

                    committee of five from each congressional district. (The first instance of organization by committee
                    in Indiana). The officers consisted of a president, Seven vice presidents and two secretaries.
                    Nathan B. Palmer of Marion became the permanent chairman. In his speech before the convention Palmer
                    regretted the attack upon Van Buren and Johnston and pleaded for harmony in the Democratic ranks.
                    The delegates from each congressional district were given the right to select the candidate for
                    elector from that district, while a committee of five from each congressional district was selected
                    to appoint two senatorial electors. A committee of three delegates from each congressional district
                    was appointed for the purpose of preparing and reporting to the convention a uniform mode of
                    organizing the Democratic Republican party in the state so as to secure concert of action and
                    harmony of feeling among the friends of popular institutions. Provision was made for a central

                    Congress as "an effort of the few to rule the many." In addition to the
                    state's central committee the committee of three members from each congressional district
                    recommended the appointment of congressional committees of five persons from each district within
                    the state and county committees of six persons living as near the center of the county as possible.
                    Each of these committees was given the power to fill vacancies within its own ranks. It was the duty
                    of the county committees to appoint vigilance committees in the several townships in each county.
                    These vigilance committees were to make a roll of all the Democratic voters within each township and
                    then the county committees were to apportion delegates among the several townships in the various

                    (township) were known. Thus the convention system was applied to the counties through a necessity

                    they had a hero and on the other, "A political grimalkin". It then urged the

                    the "immoralities of the administration". The office holders were condemned as a

            <p>After these two conventions there was very little discussion of the national question by the press of
                    the state. This year was the breathing spell in which the forces of the two parties prepared for the
                    coming campaign of 1840. The date for the Whig national convention was set for December, 1839.<hi rend="sup">127</hi> This started an agitation concerning the possible candidates which were to

                    calculated as his to rally the original Whigs; that he could not rely upon the old Jacksonians who
                    had joined them under the Harrison banners who still retained a deep rooted prejudice against him on

                    part of the Whigs to insure success. The party opposed to them seemed to be united and moved by one
                    common impulse; that although their watchword, Democracy, was understood by few, it was still
                    powerful with the masses; they must meet the issue made for them with the false cry of Federalism
                    ringing in their ears. He thought that Harrison could without a doubt get a majority in the state
                    against Van Buren. He also declared that the State would send delegates to the national

                    direction.</p>
            <p>The campaign began early. In May the Western Sun started its fight for votes by drawing comparisons
                    between the two parties, then and at the time of Jefferson. It pointed out that the principles laid
                    down by Jefferson were equal and exact justice to all men; state's rights must be
                    supported; preservation of the constitutional vigor of the federal government; right of election;
                    decision by majorities; economy in public expense; honest payment of debts; encouragement of
                    agriculture and commerce; diffusion of information; and freedom of religion. The Democratic
                    principles in 1840 were declared to be: equality of men; government for the happiness of all; the
                    voice of the people; the conservation of the government: acquiesence in the decision of the
                    majority; no special favors to bankers or merchants; banks are to be founded on substance and not
                    shadow; separation of the government from the banks; banking interests should not be partisan;

                    Federalist principles under John Adams were: Class distinction (gentlemen and simple men);
                    inequality of both; distinction of rich and poor. The Federalsts' principles in 1840 were:
                    an ignorant people were not to be trusted; free suffrage was a curse to any people; people cannot
                    govern by reason; single aim of the party was self-preservation; money can be used in elections;

                    the hands of a committee that governed his course, and that nothing was more despisable than a
                    candidate that would not declare his position.<hi rend="sup">133</hi> The same paper complained that
                    the hard times were favorable to the Whig cause and that they were laboring to maintain the

                    Adamses and on July 18, it declared that Harrison was a "black Cockade Federalist"
                    and that he had often been seen wearing the black cockade of Federalism. The charge of Federalism
                    was flaunted at the Whigs in every issue of every Democratic paper during the remainder of the
                    campaign.</p>

                    declared that the policy of the Whigs was that the general make no further declaration of his

                    "General Harrison's Body Guard and Conscience Keepers", headed the

            <p>One of the strong characters in the campaign on either side was Robert Dale Owen, the son of the

                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>

                    were copied by the press of the state. In his first article<hi rend="sup">146</hi> he held that the
                    majority of the Whigs were honest in their views and that the leaders might be honest, but their
                    tactics were to keep their principles in the dark, and resort to the methods of Indian warfare and
                    were determined to choose the field of battle. In his second article<hi rend="sup">147</hi> he
                    submitted a long line of evidence to prove his point. In a third article<hi rend="sup">148</hi> he
                    analyzed the hard cider cry. He declared that Christians were called upon to exhibit their
                    enthusiasm in a political strife by drinking hard cider made hard by hard brandy for the glory of
                    General Harrison. He declared that young men were getting their first lessons in drunkenness at the
                    Whig meetings. He analyzed "Harrison's poverty" and his
                    "military fame" and called abuse a "political blunder". Owen
                    continued this series of high-minded discussions until the last of August when he gave them up to
                    take the stump. All traveling had to be done on horseback, so the speaker generally spoke on every

            <p>While those efforts of the Democrats were full of enthusiasm and the crowds were largely
                    consciencious Democrats, there seemed to be lacking that spontaneous outburst of feeling that was
                    found among the same people twelve years before and which now characterized their opponents. The
                    Whigs had been true to their declaration in 1838 that they would regard the Democrats as erring
                    brethren and would extend to them the right hand of fellowship. They did not abuse, but deplored the
                    fact that the hard times had been brought on by the mal-administration of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Van Buren and by irresponsible officeholders. They depended upon enthusiasm
                    generated at public speakings and barbecues to carry them to victory. They began their campaign by a
                    celebration of Harrison's victory at Tippecanoe late in May. The call for the celebration
                    went out through the Whig press of the state in large head lines and popular appeals to the masses.

                    part. O. H. Smith spoke for the Whigs and James Whitcomb for the Democrats. The parties vied with
                    each other in the brilliancy of their declaration. The bands played continuously while the whole
                    city was lighted up with rockets, and the streets were filled with bonfires. Whitcomb occupied a
                    stand on the north side of <placeName>

                    rockets, and the clamor of the crowd rose above their voices and they quit the stand and mingled
                    with the crowd until near midnight. This ended the most fiercely waged campaign that the state had
                    yet seen and perhaps that it has ever seen. Harrison carried the state by a vote of 65,276 to 51,695
                    for Van Buren. The people here again showed that tendency to independent voting that has always made
                    Indiana a doubtful state and has sometimes piled up majorities for a popular candidate of one party
                    and at the very next election buried the less popular candidate of the same party under an avalanche
                    of votes.</p>

            <p>From the time of the first appearance of white men west of the Allegheny mountains, the
                        <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> became an important highway to the vast inland territory now
                    known as the central west. The military expeditions of George Rogers Clark, and Mad Anthony <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne</region>
                    </placeName>, whose conquests gained and held this great territory for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, were made possible by the broad waterway that carried them to the heart of the
                    disputed country. And down this stream, flowing ever westward, came as in an endless pageant, the
                    rafts, flat boats and keel boats of the pioneer settlers.</p>
            <p>For a distance by river of three hundred and eighty miles the Ohio forms the southern boundary of
                    what is now the state of Indiana, and it was, in the days when this territory was being settled and
                    developed, the most important means of transportation from the east.</p>
            <p>Reference to the traffic on the river in those days is made in the journal of Andrew Elliott,
                    commissioner of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> for determining the boundary between this country and <placeName>

                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>. Mr. Elliott left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the fall of 1796 with two keel boats and two flat bottomed or Kentucky boats. The
                    beauty of the river and the fertility of the country filled him with delight. He described the trade
                    then carried on by river to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and noted the important fact that while the settlers possessed ample raw materials, and
                    could export their produce with ease, their imports were attended with great difficulty, risk, and
                    expense. This difficulty was caused by the immense labor necessary to work a boat upstream, and it
                    continued as a serious handicap to the growing traffic of the western country until the days of the
                    steamboat.</p>
            <p>Yet in the early days an amazing volume of transportation was carried on the river in flat boats and
                    keel boats. The flat boat, a type that seems to have originated in the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> valley, <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-019-2-064"/> was the usual boat of the emigrants. It
                    had a flat bottom and was square at each end. The sides were enclosed with heavy planks and over all
                    was a flat roof or deck. Such a boat was in fact a floating enclosure that could be used as a cabin,
                    fortress, barn and store house and was well suited for the task of transporting the family of an
                    emigrant, together with his live stock, household goods, tools and other equipment. The sides of the
                    earlier boats were heavily reinforced, as a protection from rifle fire from the Indians who lurked
                    along the shore. They floated with the current and were steered from the end with a long oar, or
                    sweep, fixed on a pivot.</p>
            <p>Boats intended for use on the Ohio were often known as "Kentucky Boats," while more
                    substantial boats, known as "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> Boats" were built for the longer journey down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The sawed timber of which these boats were made became of great value as they went on
                    down the river where there were no saw mills, and many a pioneer built his cabin from the lumber of
                    the boat that had brought him and his family to their new location.</p>
            <p>A river guide called the Navigator, printed in 1810, gave the following information for those coming
                    to the West: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            </placeName>. There are people in each of those places that make it their business to
                            accommodate strangers descending the river, with every article they may want, either in
                            provisions, farming utensils, boats or other crafts, at a cheap and reasonable price.</p>
                        <p>Their boats are generally made well and strong, the price of which varies according to their
                            make, length, and strength. One convenient for a family, between 30 and 40 feet in length,
                            costs from 1 dollar to 1 dollar and 25 cents per foot, making perhaps 35 dollars for a
                            comfortable family boat, well boarded up on the sides, and roofed to within seven or eight
                            feet of the bow. Exclusive of this expense, is the price of a cable, pump, and fire place,
                            perhaps ten dollars.</p>

            <p>It was by flat-boats that the produce of the settlers was floated to market. Hundreds of them were

                    flat boats, whose total numbered many hundreds, left each spring for the South. Prices everywhere
                    were governed by the <placeName>

            <p>With the growth of traffic on the river a number of companies were organized to write insurance on
                    the boats and their cargoes. Among those in Indiana were the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> Insurance Company organized in 1831 and the Rising Sun Insurance Company organized a
                    few years later. The first policy of the Rising Sun Company was on a flat boat about to start on a
                    trading voyage down the Ohio and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The cargo, which consisted of onions, apples, potatoes, cider and whiskey, was insured
                    until safe arrival at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> a company insured boats while going over the falls.</p>
            <p>After reaching <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and selling boats and cargoes, the boatmen would generally return overland by the
                    Natchez trail, some on horseback, others afoot, traveling usually in groups to defend themselves
                    against bandits who infested the way.</p>
            <p>There was danger from outlaws on the river as well as on land. Bands of pirates operated on the lower <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. A cavern known as Cave-in-Rock on the Illinois shore was headquarters for a gang of
                    fifty or more under the leadership of a bandit named Wilson. Their favorite plan was to capture a
                    flat-boat laden for the lower river, murder the crew and take the boat on down to market themselves.
                    For a number of years these operations went on unsuspected, as the disappearance of a boat and crew
                    could easily be accounted for by the dangers of navigation. Finally, their methods being discovered,
                    and a price set on Wilson's head, he was killed by one of his own men to gain the reward.
                    It is said on good authority that about sixty skeletons were found in a room of his cavern, which
                    gave evidence of the extent of this career of betrayal and murder.</p>
            <p>For traffic up the river, keel boats and barges were used. The keel boat was pointed at each end, and
                    had narrow platforms on which the boatmen moved along when they worked the boat upstream with poles.
                    Oars, sails, poles and the tow line, or cordelle, were all used in a trip upstream, one method <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-019-2-066"/> being abandoned for another as conditions changed at each bend
                    in the river.</p>
            <p>In his recollections of these days, published in the Western Pilot, Samuel Cummings says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The occupation of a boatman was more calculated to destroy the constitution, and to shorten
                            life than any other business. In ascending the river, it was a continued series of toil,
                            rendered more irksome by the snail-like rate at which they moved.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding this, the boatman's life had charms as irresistible as those
                            presented by the stage. Sons abandoned the comfortable farms of their fathers, and
                            apprentices fled from the service of their masters. There was a captivation in the idea of
                            "Going down the river"; and the youthful boatman who had "pushed
                            a keel" from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                            </placeName> felt all the pride of a young merchant, after his first voyage to a foreign
                            port.</p>
                        <p>On board the boats thus navigated, merchants entrusted valuable cargoes, without insurance,
                            and with no other guarantee than the receipt of the steersman. The confidence so reposed was
                            seldom abused.</p>

            <p>These boats had a capacity of about 700 barrels of freight. A crew of nine men could conduct one down
                    to New' Orleans in about five weeks, but the return trip took three or four months and

                    were shipments of Spanish wool, indigo, log wood and quicksilver. Truly a list suggestive of high

            <p>And the record of shipments down the river is of equal interest. The books of the pilot at the Ohio
                    falls show that 197 flat boats, and fourteen keel boats descended in the two months before the close
                    of navigation in January, 1811. Beside the usual cargoes of flour, pork, corn, tobacco and other
                    farm produce, these boats carried to the expectant southland no less than twenty-seven hundred
                    barrels of whiskey, wine and brandy, eight hundred and seventeen hams of venison, and over fourteen
                    thousand tame fowls. Among other considerable items of their cargoes were slaves, ginseng, pine and
                        <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-019-2-067"/> cherry plank, ironware, cabinet work and Seneca oil. This
                    Seneca oil was the crude oil found floating on oil creek, a tributary of the Allegheny. It was
                    thought to be efficient in the treatment of rheumatism.</p>
            <p>In addition to the boats trading with the gulf ports there were many loaded at the headwaters of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, with dry goods, hardware and other articles to supply the settlements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>. These floating general stores, usually in charge of one or two men, who were
                    proprietors, clerks and crew, did a prosperous business. At the end of the voyage, which took about
                    three months, the traders would sell their boat and walk back, with enlarged experience in the needs
                    of the growing river towns, to start another venture.</p>
            <p>No chronicle of the river at that time would be complete without a reference to the ocean rigged
                    vessels launched on the upper <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Perhaps the first was the brig, St. Clair, built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Marietta</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which cleared in May, 1800, with a cargo of flour and pork for Havanna. The brig,
                    Dean, launched in 1806, made a voyage from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the Mediterranean. At Leghorn the customs officer objected to her papers on the
                    ground that no such port as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> was in existence.</p>
            <p>At least a dozen other ships, brigs, and schooners built on the upper river are listed by Zadok
                    Cramer in his quaint and interesting river guide. For a time it was thought that a great
                    shipbuilding industry would be developed, but the falls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> proved a most discouraging obstacle, and after several ships had been sunk at that
                    point the industry was abandoned.</p>
            <p>It had not been expected that these sailing vessels would be used for river traffic. That was
                    confined to flat boats and keel boats, and because of the tedious trip upstream their cargoes were
                    limited to the most essential things.</p>
            <p>New settlers were coming to this fertile western country and opening farms that produced abundantly,
                    but they were forced to live in a comparatively primitive way because of the difficulty in
                    exchanging their surplus produce in the markets of the south and east. It has always been true that
                    the development of a country is limited by the capacity of its transportation system and had not
                    these difficulties been overcome, the Ohio valley would still be handicapped in the same way as are
                        <pb n="174" id="VAA4025-019-2-068"/> Siberia and the interior of <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName>. Such was the situation at the time the development of the steamboat made possible an
                    adequate method for exchanging their commodities in the markets of the world.</p>
            <p>It was in 1807 that Robert <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fulton</region>
                    </placeName>, and his patron and co-worker, Robert Livingston, after many years of experiment,
                    launched the Clermont, a boat that successfully made the trip up the Hudson from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, propelled by the power of steam. For having built a boat that would attain a speed of
                    four miles an hour under its own power, the legislature of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> granted them the exclusive right to steam navigation on the waters of that state for a
                    period of twenty years.</p>
            <p>They soon planned to take a more complete advantage of their remarkable achievement. To extend their
                    monopoly to the great rivers of the west, the Ohio Steamboat Navigation Company was formed, and
                    under the direction of Nicholas Roosevelt, one of the incorporators, work was begun at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> on a steamer, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This, the first steamboat on the western rivers, was launched in 1811. It had a
                    capacity of one hundred tons and was equipped with two masts, it being thought that the use of sails
                    would be necessary at times.</p>
            <p>Naturally enough there had been much doubt as to whether such boats would be successful. The editor
                    of the Navigator made the following noncommittal comment: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>There is now on foot a new mode of navigating our Western waters, particularly the Ohio and

                            steam.</p>
                        <p>It will be a novel sight, and as pleasing as novel to see a huge boat working her way up the

            <p>In the fall of 1811 the new steamboat made the trip down the river from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, her time being fourteen days. It is easy to understand the excitement and enthusiasm
                    with which the boat was received. Word of her coming spread ahead, and at every town and settlement
                    the whole population turned out to welcome the wonderful craft. <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-019-2-069"/>
                    But the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> stayed on the lower Mississippi and it was several years before men were to see
                    "a boat, working her way up the Ohio by her own wonderful mechanism."</p>
            <p>Within the next few' years several other boats were built. One, the Enterprise, built by D.
                    French at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brownsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Pa., conveyed a cargo of military supplies from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the winter of 1814 and was used by General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> in military service for several months. The following spring she returned to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, this being the first time that a steamboat had made the return trip. However, this was
                    during a time of high water when the boat could travel through cut-offs, and over inundated fields
                    where there was little current.</p>
            <p>It was not until the appearance of the steamboat <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in 1816, that it was demonstrated that boats could regularly ascend these rivers under
                    their own power. This boat, built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wheeling</settlement>
                    </placeName>, under the direction of Captain Henry Shreve, contained many improvements over the
                    earlier boats. After she had made two trips from the falls at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and return, all doubts as to the possibility of steam navigation on the western rivers
                    were dispelled. Fulton and Livingston who claimed a monopoly on this use of steam attached the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but their claim was resisted by Captain Shreve, and the court gave a decision in his
                    favor.</p>
            <p>Thus began a new epoch in the development of the central west which, with the growth of the steamboat
                    industry, at last had an adequate means of transportation. The steamboat was carried to its highest
                    degree of perfection on the Ohio and <geogName>Mississippi river</geogName>s and was a means of
                    making the country west of the Allegheny mountains one of the most prosperous regions in the world.</p>
            <p>The new state of Indiana had a full share in this prosperity. Ship yards were started, wharfs and
                    landing places were built, wood yards were established, and for over half a century the steamboat
                    was a dominating influence in the life of the river counties.</p>
            <p>In 1817 the editor of the <hi rend="i">Emigrant's Guide</hi> said that "the
                    southern and much more valuable part of Indiana" was settling with much rapidity. There
                    was, indeed, a remarkable <pb n="176" id="VAA4025-019-2-070"/> increase in population, which from
                    24,000 in 1810 grew to nearly three hundred and fifty thousand by 1830.</p>
            <p>Writing of traffic on the river in the thirties Mr. W. G. Lyford reported over three hundred and
                    fifty steamboats in service. Most of these were freight boats, but nearly all would carry
                    passengers. The fare for cabin passengers, including state room and meals, was then about three
                    cents a mile. Deck passengers, furnishing their own provisions, and helping load wood for fuel, paid
                    about one-fourth this amount. A galley, or cook stove, was provided on the lower deck for their use.</p>
            <p>A striking evidence of the immense river traffic at that time is given by Mr. A. B. Hulbert in his
                    book, <hi rend="i">The <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>
               </hi>, in which we find that by 1834 the
                    tonnage of the boats on the Ohio and Mississippi was larger than that of the British Empire, or of
                    the entire Atlantic seaboard. This was only eighteen years after it had been demonstrated that a
                    steamboat could ascend the rivers, and shows how amazing had been the growth of the western country
                    when given an adequate way of carrying its merchandise.</p>
            <p>In 1818 the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> mail line, built the General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the first boat exclusively for passengers. This boat, which ran from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, stopped at all Indiana towns along the way. The first trip was made in one day and
                    seven hours, which was thought to be, and was, a remarkable achievement. Forty years later boats of
                    the same company, most of them built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, made the trip daily in about nine hours. Among them were the Jacob Strader and
                    Telegraph Number Three, which were among the finest boats ever built and did much to sustain the
                    reputation of the boats of the western waters as being the best in the world. The description,
                    floating palaces, as applied to such boats, was well deserved.</p>
            <p>Because of the rapids at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> all boats were forced to stop there, except in times of high water, and transfer cargo
                    and passengers. A canal was built around the rapids but as the boats increased in size it could not
                    be used by the larger ones. To serve the lower river this same company placed a fleet in the trade
                    between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It included such splendid boats as the Northerner, Southerner, Ben <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and Highflyer. There may have been boys in these days, <pb n="177" id="VAA4025-019-2-071"/> in the river towns of southern Indiana, who did not know the name of
                    the president of their country, but it is doubtful if there were any who did not know who was
                    captain of each mail boat. Boats of this type were built for speed and ran on a regular schedule, in
                    order to attract the passenger traffic and to secure the profitable government contract for carrying
                    the mails. They took only the lighter forms of freight.</p>
            <p>There were fifteen or twenty important shipping points on the Indiana shore listed in the river
                    directories of that time, including such prosperous towns as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Burora, Risi: g Sun, <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> was then the most important commercial center in Indiana and continued to be for many
                    years.</p>
            <p>With so many boats on the river accidents were inevitable. There seem to have been more on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>, in proportion to the volume of traffic, than on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, and many a man ran on the river for years without seeing an accident of consequence,
                    yet the list on either river is a lamentable one. Fire, collision, treacherous snags, and careless
                    handling of the boilers were the usual causes.</p>
            <p>At midnight in May, 1825, the steamboat Mechanic, that had been chartered to take General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a distinguished company up the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, struck a snag a few miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cannelton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and soon sank. There was no loss of life, but in the confusion, General <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName>, was thrown into the river and came near drowning. He was rescued by a deck hand, but
                    lost most of his personal effects, including his carriage, clothing and eight thousand dollars in

            <p>The steamer Moselle, one of the finest boats on the river, was blown up near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> in April, 1838, less than a month after having been put into service. Her officers,
                    eager to establish a reputation for the boat as the swiftest in America, had grown reckless in
                    handling the boilers, with the result that all four exploded at once. Fragments of the boat were
                    found on both the Ohio and Kentucky shores. Eighty-one persons were known to have been killed, and
                    fifty-five were missing. Another disaster, never to be forgotten in southern Indiana, was caused by
                    the collision of the States and the America, packets in the line from <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The States <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-019-2-072"/> was cut nearly in two and soon was in
                    flames. Many citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> lost their lives, the total death list being over one hundred. The Redstone, another <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> packet, was destroyed by a boiler explosion, while making a trip against time, and
                    seventeen lives were lost.</p>
            <p>The ship yards on the Indiana shore were among the best known on the river. There were large yards at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and a number of boats were built at other places. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, at the head of the falls, and with one of the best harbors on the river, was an
                    excellent location. The first steamer built there was the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, launched in 1819. She had two separate engines, built in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, was capable of carrying three thousand bales of cotton, and was described at the time
                    as "the finest merchant steamboat in the universe." In his history of Clark county
                    Mr. Lewis C. Baird has a complete and valuable account of the different ship yards at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the greatest of which were the Howard yards. During a period of sixty years over six
                    hundred vessels were launched by these famous builders, a record not equalled by any plant on the
                    western rivers. The James Howard, a side wheel steam boat, launched by them in October, 1870, was
                    the largest inland steamboat ever built. This splendid boat was 318 feet in length, 54 feet beam and
                    3400 tonnage. It ran in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> trade and represented the highest type of construction ever attained in steamboat work.</p>
            <p>Many of the finest boats on the river were built at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In an interesting paper on "Steamboat Building at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>," Mr. A. S. Chapman has recorded the rise and fall of the industry there. At
                    one time hundreds of men were employed and the reputation of the yards for good design and good
                    workmanship was nation wide.</p>
            <p>The ship yards at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> were among the best in the country. Excellent timber for boat building was to be had
                    there and the business developed rapidly. From 1830 to 1865 over three hundred steamers were
                    launched at the New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> yards, including such famous boats as the Eclipse, the Sultana, the Robert E. Lee, and
                    many others, that for speed, comfort and luxury were the peers of any boats afloat. A writer in the
                    New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> Ledger-Standard in 1877, reviewing the <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-019-2-073"/> prosperity
                    brought to the town in earlier days by the boat building industry, estimated that at one time over
                    two thousand men were employed by the ship yards, foundries, smiths and chandlers directly engaged
                    in building and outfitting steamboats at that point.</p>
            <p>A special type of boat was developed by the western builders for use in the shallow waters of the
                    Ohio and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName>. The earlier boats were fashioned after ocean going models, but in later types the hold
                    was abolished, the machinery put on deck and the bottom made flat. Such a boat could travel in three
                    or four feet of water which was of great advantage in the western rivers where shallow water was to
                    be found during many months of each year.</p>
            <p>There was intense rivalry between the different lines of boats in regard both to speed and to the
                    service given to passengers. On the best boats excellent meals were served, the staterooms were well
                    furnished and cared for, and everything possible was done to attract travellers from opposition
                    lines. A record especially prized was for the time up stream from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the rapids at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a distance of nearly fifteen hundred miles. In 1817 the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had required twenty-five days to make the trip. Twenty years later the trip had been
                    made in one-fourth the time, and by 1851 a record of four days and twenty-three hours was held by
                    the Belle Key.</p>
            <p>Then came the Eclipse, a boat built at the New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> yards, well designed, beautifully finished and described by old river men, who remember
                    her with affection, as the finest boat that ever floated on the western rivers.</p>
            <p>On her first trip, in May, 1852, she lowered the record of the Belle Key by five hours, but the
                    following May there appeared on the river the A. L. Shotwell, also built at New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with the avowed purpose of capturing and holding the record.</p>
            <p>The Shotwell made the trip up stream amidst great excitement. At each bend in the rivers she was
                    greeted with shouts of encouragement, bands playing as she steamed by, and everywhere her time was
                    checked and rechecked to settle the thousands of wagers that had been made. She lowered the record
                    by seven hours and forty minutes.</p>
            <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-019-2-074"/>
            <p>Then in the same month the Eclipse came up the river, with her Master, E. T. Sturgeon, bent on
                    regaining the laurels for his beloved boat. Never had there been such excitement. At one point she
                    would be ahead of the time of the Shotwell, at another a few minutes behind. Every shift of the
                    wind, every change in the current, affected her speed. <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Vicksburg</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Helena</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Memphis</settlement>
               </placeName>, Cairo, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, were passed in succession with the result still in doubt, but when she sped by New <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and turned for the landing at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a record of four days, nine hours, and thirty minutes had been established.</p>
            <p>And, says a writer of that day, when we take into consideration the low water, swift current, and
                    other obstacles she met with, we may safely set her down as the fastest boat in the world.</p>
            <p>For years afterwards, a traveller would see signs posted at many places along the way giving the time
                    of the Shotwell and the Eclipse to that point. Perhaps some of these signs are still standing,
                    silent witnesses of the intense rivalry in the days when the steamboat was queen of the western
                    rivers.</p>
            <p>An old steamboat man, writing of racing on the river at that time says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It was the habit of boats going up stream when they needed fuel to take in tow a barge loaded
                            with wood or coal. If another boat was coming up behind that was thought to be willing to
                            race, all the crew, including the cabin boys, would turn in and help unload the barge so
                            that it could be set adrift at the earliest moment. The crew would also pile the fuel near
                            the firemen to help keep the fires roaring hot.</p>
                        <p>In emergencies when fuel was short it was not unsual for freight to be used for such purpose.
                            When a boat had bacon as freight it was regarded as excellent fuel and in a race was used
                            without hesitancy.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>With the development of the railways the steamboat trade began to decline, yet for years a large
                    amount of business continued to be carried on the river. As late as 1873 the records of the wharf
                    master at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> showed over twenty-five hundred steamboat arrivals at that port during the year, while
                    sixty or more were registered as being owned or controlled there.</p>
            <p>An interesting feature on the river front at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the large dry dock, kept constantly busy repairing boats that came from as far as <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-019-2-075"/> managed by E. C. Murray, who had designed
                    and constructed the Confederate ram, Merrimac.</p>
            <p>Now that a network of railways is spread over the central west, the steamboat traffic has dwindled
                    away, perhaps never to return. Towboats, with strings of coal barges go up and down the river, and
                    little steamers ply on uncertain schedules between settlements that are not reached by rail. But the
                    glory of the old times is gone.</p>
            <p>The present trend of transportation away from the river is shown by the census of 1920, which reports
                    that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, an inland town, has grown more rapidly in the preceding ten years than
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
               </placeName> or any
                    other large town on the river.</p>
            <p>Many attempts have been made to revive the steamboat business. Transportation by water is cheaper
                    than by rail and when the series of dams and locks now being constructed by the Government, is
                    completed, a uniform depth of nine feet of water will be maintained throughout the year, an ideal
                    condition hardly dreamed of in those busy years when boats were delayed for weeks by low water.</p>
            <p>But a great advantage of the railways, with which the boats cannot compete, is their ability to run a
                    switch to every warehouse and factory and load and unload at their door; while freight taken by boat
                    must be reloaded several times, an operation that causes delay and expense.</p>
            <p>Whatever the future commercial use of the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> may be, its great value as
                    an artery of transportation, in the days when the prosperous central west was being transformed from
                    the wilderness, can never be overlooked.</p>
            <p>The charm of the river will always remain. Flowing with a gentle current, between high wooded banks,
                    it has ever been regarded as one of the most beautiful of streams. The earliest French explorers
                    called it the beautiful river, and its appeal is as great today as when, two and a half centuries
                    ago, they first beheld it.</p>
            <p>The views from the hills at <placeName>

                    unsurpassed beauty, and many a traveller who has seen the great valley from these heights has
                    wondered that such scenes are so little known. Once known they are never to be forgotten.</p>

                                    </placeName> on Thursday about 3 P. M. and reached <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on Friday evening, when I had an interview with Dr. D. H. Maxwell, and
                                    I also met with the young doctor who visited us at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. I put up with Mr. Orchard. <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                                    </placeName> is a beautiful town, or rather it is handsomely situated in a country
                                    of rich land. Many of the town lots are well improved with fruit and ornamental
                                    trees, and from all appearances I should suppose that fruit will be abundant there
                                    this year.</p>
                        <p>I left it on Saturday morning and reached <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                                    </placeName> on Sunday morning by breakfast time. <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                                    </placeName> is not as handsome as <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but it is nevertheless a pretty place, and has many well improved
                                    residences made beautiful by pine and cedar trees which decorate some very
                                    indifferent dwelling houses. We remained there about three hours and a half and
                                    intnded to go to meeting, but it happened to be Mr. Rawson's day for
                                    preaching in the country and there was no one to supply his place. They have a fine
                                    brick Presbyterian Church.</p>
                        <p>We reached this place on Monday morning to breakfast, and commenced work yesterday.
                                    Tomorrow, we shall move into camp, and I shall not be in again before Sunday or
                                    Saturday evening when I expect to receive a letter from you. You must not fail to
                                    write to me every <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-019-2-077"/> four or five days, for the
                                    distance is so great that a letter is a long time on the way. I see nothing here to
                                    admire except the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> and some good buildings, and
                                    expect to locate in <placeName>

                        <p>Dr. Maxwell came in this evening and has been telling me some tales about himself and
                                    your father.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet called at the postoffice, for I have no doubt that a letter must be at
                                    least five days on the road from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>

                        <p>I rode with Mr. [Jesse] Williams about thirty-five miles on Tuesday, most of the time
                                    in the rain. I rode again Wednesday, about twenty-five miles, also on Thursday about
                                    twelve miles and then walked until I had to go to camp to dry myself. Was out all
                                    day yesterday and today until the rain compelled us about two o'clock to go
                                    in to dry. And after five o'clock rode eight miles into town; and now after
                                    nine o'clock, am writing to her from whom, with her children, I expect to
                                    derive all the happiness which the world has in store for me. I believe I mentioned
                                    in my last, of having heard Mr. Anderson address a temperance meeting. He is pastor
                                    of the First Presbyterian Church in this place, and with his family, boards at the
                                    house I stop at. I heard him preach Sunday last, twice, and am much pleased with
                                    him. He is a very sensible man, and reasons very logically. He and Mr. McKennon are
                                    fellow students, or have been such. He expects to be in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                                    </placeName> in about a month.</p>
                        <p>I wish I could fix upon the day, when I could see you all in health at <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Logansport</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, but can not now. The country I have to locate the road through is very
                                    much broken with ravines and requires a great many examinations. I hope, however,
                                    that I shall be able to do so in eight or ten days, for if the coming week should
                                    prove favorable I shall be able to do so. I shall probably be twenty miles from this
                                    place on next Sunday. You will therefore direct your next letter to <placeName>

                                    in good health. How soon I may again enjoy that pleasure I can not with any degree

                        <p>This little village is situated on a stream called the muddy fork of Silver Creek. I
                                    don't know whether it has an existence on the map or not, but by reference
                                    to it you will discover the township, and ranges, numbered upon it, and this is the
                                    southwest corner of Clarke County in township one S. of the base line (the line
                                    dividing the township N. and S. and range S. E.). When you receive this letter,

                                    </placeName> a week since but as I found it necessary to send to New <placeName>

                                    </placeName> next day for medicine, it was mailed at the latter place. I expected
                                    the evening after writing to you to have a shake of the ague and therefore sent on
                                    Monday for a dose of calomel and jalap which had so good an effect that I was

                                    </placeName> to this place, between the former place and Havre De Grace. The road

                                    The last two have draw bridges in them to let the boats pass. The road is about 5 or

                                    looked like a large saloon in which all kinds of refreshments were set out, so that

                                    was also pleasant, for although I had on my summer coat we had all the car windows
                                    open and it was not too cool.</p>

                                    of Independence was signed are on Chestnut Street, directly opposite the American
                                    Hotel. The whole two miles is built up, and some of the houses must have cost fifty

                        <p>On Sunday morning Mr. Brooks discovered that his trunk had been robbed and as he had
                                    business in the bank here on Monday which could not be transacted by deputy, I
                                    started back at 4:30 P. M. Sunday and reached the city by 9 (96 miles), in hopes of
                                    securing the depredator, but having conjecture only to act upon. After consulting
                                    the Mayor and police officials, it was considered by them most advisable to rely
                                    upon future developments. Yesterday afternoon Mr. Collins and lady, Mr. Brooks and
                                    daughter, and I went up about 11 miles to the acqueduct which passes the Croton
                                    River over the Harlem River, to supply the city with water. The acqueduct is about
                                    140 high and has 16 arches most of them 90 feet cord, it is between 1500 and 1600
                                    feet long, and I walked over it on the coping of the sidewalks. The water passes
                                    over <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-019-2-081"/> it, in two cylinders, 3 or 4 feet in
                                    diameter. We had from it, a good view of the upper part of the city. This trip of
                                    about 22 miles, cost 31 cents to each, 6 miles by railroad and the residue by

            <p>The Harmonist movement was a practical lesson in sociology and though not entirely successful, it
                    nevertheless has left a marked influence on the people and communities in which it worked. There are
                    four cardinal types in the institutions of civilization, namely: the family, civil society with its
                    division of labor, the state and the church. Society seems to be a "give and take"
                    proposition. It is like a larger individual; an institutional person. Communism or socialism, of
                    which Harmon-ism was a type, aims to substitute civil society for the family and for the state.</p>
            <p>Harmonism in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> began its career in Pennsylvania in 1803, under the leadership of George Rapp, a <placeName>

                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>, and came to America, hoping to find freedom from the religious restraint then existing
                    in their country.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Religion has ever been a powerful motivating force of immeasurable value; it has had strange and
                    various results. In our quiet hours we like to read of the martyrs in the early days of
                    Christianity, who gave their lives for the sake of their religious beliefs; it is interesting to
                    ponder the troublesome days of the Reformation and the outgrowth of them; and again we enjoy
                    teaching our children of the religious motives underlying the coming of the Pilgrims to our shores.
                    All of these movements are carefully chronicled in the world's history and all of them took
                    their rise in religious convictions.</p>
            <p>So it was with this Rappite movement, the forerunner of Harmonism in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
                    Since the initial movement centers about Rapp, a description of the man is of value. He was a <placeName>

                    </placeName> peasant, farmer and vine-dresser by occupation. He was six feet tall, with a long white
                    beard that gave him the bearing of an old patriarch and prophet. He was a cheerful, kindly,
                    sympathetic man and made a strong appeal to the <list type="footnotes">

                    before, George Rapp gained great prestige by working on the superstitions of the peasants. He told
                    his followers of the many visions he had in which the Lord gave him explicit directions for the
                    construction of great buildings. One vision, in particular, revealed to him the plans for
                    constructing a building in the form of a Greek cross. This came directly from heaven, he told his
                        flock.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rapp was a careful Bible student and when he was thirty he gave talks to ardent listeners on
                    religious subjects. He acknowledged no written creed, and insisted on the dual nature of Adam.
                    Interpreting Genesis in his own peculiar way, he believed that Adam contained within his own person
                    both sexual elements and he held that both the creator and the created had this dual nature.
                    Furthermore, Rapp said that if Adam had been allowed to remain in his original state, he would have
                    begotten offspring without the aid of a female. But Adam became discontented and God separated the
                    female part of his body from him, "his is the Rappite interpretation of the fall of man.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Following this deduction on the fall of man, Rapp renounced marriage and celibacy became a rule of
                    their community life. Exception is taken to this statement, however by some authors. One says that
                    when the families in Rapp's community still lived together there were a few marriages.
                    Between 1805 and 1807 John Rapp, the founder's son, was married and there is no doubt that
                    the elder Rapp performed the ceremony. Later there was a deep religious fervor and revival came upon
                    the Rappites, the rule of celibacy was firmly established.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The keynote of Rapp's creed follows: "Love to God above all and thy neighbor as
                    thyself, without laying much stress on ceremony." He, believed in future rewards and
                    punishments but those of the latter were to be but temporary; happiness would ultimately triumph.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In accordance with this creed Rapp taught humility and simplicity, self-sacrifice, neighborly love,

                    no visiting ministers, and thus held an autocratic power over his followers. He was an absolute
                    ruler; he had imbibed this idea of government from Germmy aid he always insisted that he ruled by
                    "divine right."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This phrase "divine right" is not new to us Americans any longer. It is easy to see
                    how Rapp could have tried to implant his sort of rule in a new country. The World war has changed
                    forever the "divine right" of kings and potentates, and all future reformers shall
                    have to adopt new phraseology.</p>
            <p>By 1815 Rapp had developed a thriving community in Pennsylvania and the poor hard-working peasants of
                    a few years before were now living in plenty, although luxury was always barred from the door.
                    Thinking that life was now too easy, Rapp moved his settlement to a new home in Indiana. Toil and
                    suffering had left their traces on the faces of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> peasants and, although they were well-fed and well-clothed they had bought this
                    satisfaction at the cost of heart and soul; with their lives.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rappites moved to a tract of land on the <geogName>Wabash river</geogName>, a few miles above its
                    mouth. They purchased twenty thousand acres of government land, several adjacent improved farms and
                    founded the village of Harmonie. The name chosen for their new home is very suggestive of peace,
                    harmony, and brotherly love, the trinity which symbolized the desire of Father Rapp.</p>
            <p>Harmonie soon showed evident of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>

                    cocoonery, a distillery, woolen mill, saw mill, brick yard, oil well and well built houses testified
                    to the willing spirit of the Rappites. Fred Rapp, the adopted son of George Rapp, looked after the
                    outside affairs of the community, leaving the elder man to give his entire attention to the
                    community itself. Under their joint leadership Harmony became "like some quaint <placeName>

            <p>The Harmonists wore very plain dresses as the Quakers do and made no pretense to style. The cloth was
                    rough homespun and fashioned to give the greatest amount of wear with the least possible amount of
                    attraction.</p>

                    years a fair estimate gave them two thousand dollars each man, woman, and child. This is probably

            <p>To understand more fully the Owenite movement in Indiana it is to the point that we glance back in
                    perspective to the rearing of Robert Owen, this leader.</p>
            <p>From casual readings at different times on the early life of Robert Owen, I have received the
                    impression that as a child he was a serious, sober, eccentric and precocious child. He did not enjoy
                    the plays of childhood as others did; but he would, wander off alone and ponder over great truths
                    and great mysteries of life, some of which the greatest thinkers of the present day have not solved.</p>
            <p>When Robert Owen was ten years old he went to work as an apprentice to a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> draper; hence he got a very limited education. His father had a large library and
                    Robert had liberal facilities for wide reading. It is said he read five hours a day, a great part of
                    the reading being the big <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> daily papers. He was peculiarly gifted in possessing a fine business instinct and a
                    persevering spirit of industry. From the position as apprentice at the age of ten he made his own
                    way and showed remarkable capacity for saving money, helping others and getting things done. He made
                    a number of partnerships <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-019-2-086"/> from time to time as money and
                    experience allowed. He married Miss Dale of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Glasgow</settlement>
                    </placeName>, daughter of David Dale, owner of an extensive manufacturing estate at New Lanark, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. In 1800 when he was twenty-nine years of age, he bought this large manufacturing
                    business from David Dale for three hundred thousand dollars.</p>
            <p>We here see Owen mixing "business and pleasure," as he set about to get himself a
                    wife.</p>
            <p>In 1806 there was a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> embargo declared on cotton and Owen closed his large cotton mill that he had purchased
                    from Dale. During this period of non-employment, Owen paid his workers their wages, thus
                    establishing a very close bond of sympathy and friendship with them. This move on the part of Owen
                    met with the disapproval of his partners and he bought them out for seven hundred seventy-seven
                    thousand dollars. Owen kept fighting bad factory and living conditions and thus inspired manliness,
                    hope and confidence in his employees.</p>
            <p>The industrial revolution in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> then, in the last years of the eighteenth century caused by the competition of machine
                    labor against manual labor, resulted in a great number of unemployed men. The factory workers lived
                    in squalid homes, had no education, ignored sanitation and simply continued to exist, To the fertile
                    mind of Robert Owen these things presented a problem to be investigated; reform was needed along
                    many lines and he felt himself called upon to work out the solution of the problem.</p>
            <p>In the next session of Parliament, Robert Owen urged a bill to regulate child labor and stipulated
                    that no child under ten be employed in factories. The House of Commons took up the matter but it
                    took four years to get its final passage. About this time, Owen made a public declaration of
                    religious principles. From now on his popularity waned; but Owen pushed valiantly on in his studies
                    of social reform.</p>
            <p>Up to this period, Robert Owen had accomplished much good in the way of social reform, especially
                    among the mill workers and their families. However, as soon as he began to air his religious views,
                    his influence lost weight.</p>
            <p>It seemed as if <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName> were in close touch with Owen in his attempts to found a new kind of social world, for
                    at this <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-019-2-087"/> time Richard Flower arrived in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. He had been commissioned by George Rapp to sell the great Harmonist estate and so he
                    suggested to Owen that he purchase Harmony in Indiana. So in 1824 Mr. Flower and Robert Owen
                    returned to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> where the transfer of property was made. By the spring of 1825, Owen became owner of
                    nearly thirty thousand acres of ground, nineteen detached farms, six hundred acres of improved land
                    occupied by tenants and fine orchards, eighteen acres of bearing vines and the village of Harmony.
                    In the village were factories, a church, houses and machinery all waiting for the magic touch of
                    Owen to become the ideal social structure of the world.</p>
            <p>Here we may well take up the thread of our story, forgotten a little distance back when the
                    "Boat-load of Knowledge" arrived from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName>, with Robert Owen as pilot in the grand new adventure.</p>
            <p>Sociologists tell us there are three kinds of reformers in the social work of the world: the pure
                    theorists who picture an ideal state without suggesting practical effort, as Plato in his Republic;
                    the practical architect as the Rappites, Shakers, and others who establish societies in imitation of
                    the supposed communism of early Christians; and the combination of theoretical and practical
                    architects, who have combined social theories with practical experiments. Robert Owen christened his
                    new home <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> and it became the scene of the most notable architects of sociology of two of these
                    three classes given.</p>
            <p>As to the general attitude of Robert Owen to the world, we might quote his words from <hi rend="i">The New Moral World</hi>, a periodical of that day to which he contributed,
                    "Civilization! How the term is misapplied! A state of society based upon ignorance,
                    deranging the faculties of all." It was never evident to Owen that he, himself, might be
                    ignorant of some fields of knowledge, and herein was the cause of his failures.</p>
            <p>On April 27, 1825, Robert Owen called a meeting in the old Rappite church and there changed the name
                    of the settlement to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He pointed out the fact in his address that for a while it would be impossible to
                    avoid a certain degree of inequality because money would have to be spent to <pb n="194" id="VAA4025-019-2-088"/> induce men of big intellectual caliber to settle in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Certainly all will agree that Owen showed wisdom in laying the foundation of his new experiment on
                    the grounds of intellectual guidance and attainments.</p>
            <p>Feeling his way cautiously, Owen organized "The Preliminary Society of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>," thus placing his followers on a term of probation before admitting them as
                    fullfledged communistic members. As a sort of preamble to the constitution of this preliminary
                    society we read: "the society is instituted generally to promote happiness of the
                    world." Again we feel the effect of Owen's altruism in setting forth such an aim
                    for his society. A critic has asked, "Wherein, then, was the failure of such a noble
                    purpose thwarted?" In the constitution itself Owen called himself the proprietor of the
                    settlement and founder of the system; he claimed the right to appoint committees to direct and
                    manage the affairs of the society. The manner of living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> was quite significant of his socialistic tendencies: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The members shall occupy the dwellings which the committee may provide for them.</p>
                        <p>The livestock possessed by members will be taken and placed to their credit if wanted for the
                            society, but if not required it shall not be received.</p>
                        <p>The living shall be upon equal terms for all with the exceptions hereafter to be mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Each member shall, within a fixed amount in value, have the free choice of food and
                        clothing.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>He added further, that as far as possible each family consume products of America in order to build
                    up <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> more speedily.</p>
            <p>To those of us who look for a man's good points and strive to cover up his weak points, the
                    statement of Owen in which he suggests the consumption of home-grown products appeals as a patriotic
                    project and worthy of emulation. It is pleasing to note the difference between George
                    Rapp's egotistic claim to govern by "divine right" and Owen's
                    plea to buy and consume American made goods.</p>
            <p>The religion of Robert Owen was perhaps at the bottom of most of his failures, so far as I am able to
                    judge from reading. <pb n="195" id="VAA4025-019-2-089"/> In speaking of his father's
                    religion, Robert Dale Owen said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>My father, a Deist, or free thinking unitarian was tender of my mother's religious
                            sentiments and did not in those days interfere with instructions to try to undermine our
                            belief-My own father! kind, indulgent to us all, and loved and respected by everybody.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>

            <p>Robert Dale Owen in his autobiography calls his mother: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>a devout Presbyterian, though too gentle to be bigoted and thoroughly imbued with the belief
                            that the most orthodox form of Protestantism is essential to happiness if not to virtue.</p>
                    </quote>
            </p>
            <p>As readers we are interested in the home life of a great man and as we look into Robert
                    Owens' home we find him kind to his wife and four sons, sympathetic and charitable. He
                    liked to read but never made notes or engaged in intensive study of books. He is quoted as saying,
                    "the radical errors shared by all men make books of comparatively little
                        value."<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This statement then seems rather inconsistent when we learn later that Owen wrote a great number of
                    tracts and editorials himself. Surely he thought people would be moved by these messages of his pen,
                    while they might be deaf to the entreaties of other writers.</p>
            <p>Some of Owen's ideas are far in advance of his day, however. In the matter of sanitation it
                    is of interest to note that Owen had worked on the problem of sanitary living conditions for his
                    employees in New Lanark. In 1803 in this mill town of <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>, "each house had a single room and before each door was found a
                    dunghill." Robert Owen added an additional story to each house and saw that the dunghills
                    were removed. The village streets were also swept every night.</p>
            <p>Many people hoped for a better attempt in the second community at Harmony. The people who came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> were a very intelligent, cultured, refined people while those of Rapp's
                    Harmony were ignorant, uncultured, superstitious people. Surely Owen's work would be a

                    to bring forth a new moral world.</p>
            <pb n="197" id="VAA4025-019-2-091"/>
            <p>Robert Dale Owen was for many years in hearty sympathy with his father's plans of social
                    regeneration. As he grew older and studied the situation more closely, he began to inquire into the
                    reasons why his father's plans didn't mature.</p>
            <p>One form of government after the other failed in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> community and the constitution was changed seven times. For business reasons Robert
                    Owen left the community several times and went back to Europe. Each trip seemed to be the cause of
                    dissension among the Harmonists. The executive committees finally asked Owen to become the head of
                    the government, which he did. Still success seemed but temporary. Itinerant preachers were welcomed

                    of religion to the communists. With Owen's unorthodox religious views and many different
                    views of traveling preachers, the minds of the Harmonists were sadly disturbed. Then the most
                    natural thing began to happen; new communities began to form around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> as a nucleus.</p>
            <p>The greatest progress made in the social world according to Owen is made possible when there are no
                    armies, churches, lawyers, doctors, and exclusive universities. He said further that the practice of
                    religion includes a knowledge of the laws of nature and efforts to do good to our fellow men.</p>
            <p>As regards to education, Owen had very original ideas. He did not believe in cramming book knowledge
                    into the child's brain. He aimed to give training that should be vital and harmonize with
                    the social need. He said once in speaking of an educated person, "The bookful blockhead
                    ignorantly read, with loads of learned lumber in his head."<hi rend="sup">12</hi>

            <p>The one innovation in education added by Maclure was the industrial school. He believed there should
                    be free, equal and universal schools to which at an early age children should be surrendered and in
                    which they could be clothed, fed, sheltered and educated at public expense. Properly managed the
                    labor of the child at his trade in the industrial department would more than pay for his maintenance
                    and entirely relieve the public from the financial burden of supporting the schools.</p>
            <p>Having grown up among the laboring classes, Owen always took an active part in the labor questions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had peculiar ideas about the currency in this connection too. He proposed to
                    substitute labor in place of gold or silver as a means of exchange. Little bills were issued saying
                    John Smith was indebted to Samuel Johnson for two hours of labor or its equivalent in corn.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>

            <p>Since the recent prohibition law went into effect it will not be amiss to examine Owens'
                    ideas on this subject. When he was twenty years old he applied to a Mr. Drinkwater in New Lanark for
                    a position. On being asked, "How often do you get drunk," Owen replied,
                    "I was never drunk in my life." It <list type="footnotes">

                    </placeName> he allowed no liquor to be distilled, because he thought it detracted from the
                    possibilities of man's highest development. In a speech he made April 13, 1828, he said:
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I can only feel regret instead of anger because monopolies have been established in certain

            <p>Evidently there were traces of what we term "blind tigers" in Owen's
                    community, though it was much against his wishes.</p>
            <p>With this much understanding of Robert Owen and his Harmonistic plans the question as to the cause
                    for its failure arises. Many answers have been given. A few of these are: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Owen lived too long, had he died in middle life before he earned the antipathy of society by
                            the loud proclamation of his ill-considered moral philosophy his memory would have been
                            revered.</p>
                        <p>The absence of Robert Owen from <placeName>
                                <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                            </placeName> for long and protracted intervals gave rise to dissensions among his people. No
                            central authority perhaps was a factor in the failure of his plans.</p>
                        <p>Robert Owen saw the errors of orthodox theology and felt their mischievous influence; but he
                            did not clearly perceive the religious needs of the world.</p>
                        <p>He limited his view of man to the first three score and ten years of his life, ignoring the
                            illimitable future beyond.</p>
                        <p>The devil is blamed in this poem it seems for Owens work, if not for his failure: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The devil at length scrambled out of his hole,</p>
                                <p>Discovered by Synnes at the freezing North Pole,</p>
                                <p>He mounted an iceberg, spread his wings for a sail,</p>
                                <p>And started for earth with his long barbed tail.</p>

            <p>It is well to see both sides of a question, however, and a word or two that places a different
                    estimate upon Owen's work is to the point.</p>
            <p>Sargeant says: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Owen had a shallow philosophy; he wasted power in his long life; he had a narrowness of

            <p>The co-operative movement in society is rapidly becoming a national movement now, sustained by the
                    development and activity of an ever increasing popular knowledge. Owen's ideas and ideals
                    were passed on and many of them are at work now.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the exact result and influence of the Harmonist movement in Indiana is difficult to
                    state; yet we all may praise Owen for his unfaltering courage in pursuing his ideal steadfastly,
                    through a period of years that ended only with the grave. Robert Owen died in 1858 in the house next
                    to the house in which he was born in the little town of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Newton</settlement>, <country reg="enk">England</country>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Robert Owen left four sons, all sturdy industrious men, who lost nothing of their father's
                    courage and perseverance. Robert Dale Owen came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> with his father when he was twenty-four years and his life is intimately connected with
                    the later life of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He was one of the notable men who signed the second constitution of Indiana. Although
                    by 1830 there was not an association to continue the movement so auspiciously begun five years
                    before by Robert Owen, there are still many landmarks whereby the history of the Harmonist movement
                    can be traced. Robert Dale Owen worked tirelessly in the political interest of Indiana for several
                    years and especially did he urge that women be given the rights due them. He pays a very beautiful
                    tribute to women in the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I owe to woman as wife and friend, all the best, happiest—yes, the purest hours of
                            my life. I have no associations connected with the name of woman save those of esteem and
                            respectful attention. I owe to her a sense of gratitude that can never be paid though my
                            days were extended to the term of life assigned to the ancient patriarchs and though all
                            those days were devoted to the vindication of her rights.</p>

            <p>The One Hundredth Anniversary of the organization of Henry county was celebrated during the week of
                    April 8th to 15th. The Henry county historical society had charge of the <pb n="202" id="VAA4025-019-2-096"/> centennial, and under the direction of Clarence H. Smith, curator of
                    the society, a splendid program was planned, emphasizing the developments that have occurred in
                    Henry county during the past century. Schools, churches, clubs, civic and commercial organizations,
                    business houses, lodges, and other organizations all joined in making the centennial observance a
                    success, and an exhibit of old relics displayed in store windows and shop windows added much to the
                    educational and historical value of the centennial. The closing event of the centennial week was the
                    dedication of a memorial erected to the memory of Wilbur Wright, inventor of the airplane and a
                    native son of Henry county. The memorial, consisting of a bronze tablet mounted on a large boulder,

                    memorial exercises were held did not overlook the educational advantages that should attend such an
                    occasion. Under their direction a number of prizes were offered to the school children for the best
                    essays written on Wilbur Wright and his Inventions. Prizes were awarded to Mary Rogers, Wilbur
                    Williams and Mary Mangold for the best essays. A centennial program in which the educational and
                    historical features are emphasized, rather than the carnival idea can always be made a success.
                    Henry county proved this beyond all question.</p>

            <p>Real, unselfish, patriotic service marks the work which Major David I. McCormick, Superintendent of
                    the Indiana Battle Flag commission has been doing in giving talks before the high school students of
                    Indiana on "The History and Preservation of Flags." That Indiana has the best

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> is due largely to the persistent and never-tiring labor of Major McCormick, who has for
                    a number of years been giving his life to the important work of repairing, mending, and encasing
                    these old battle-scarred emblems. Under his direction 310 Civil war flags, 12 Spanish-American war
                    flags, 6 Mexican war flags, and 25 World war flags have been collected. Of this number approximately
                    160 have been cased. The others are packed away in boxes in the basement of the State House, waiting
                    until more funds and space are provided to enable the flag commission to case and properly display
                    them.</p>

                    Whitewood Tulip tree. In beauty it ranks high among the members of the Magnolia family, to which it
                    belongs; its most magnificent cousin being the Magnolia Grandiflora of the South, and also its more
