                    although they may not be conversant with specific terms or teams, admit that baseball is an integral
                    and influential part of the nation's heritage and popular culture; and increasing numbers
                    of academics and critics hold that the conceptual beliefs of a popular culture must be analyzed and
                    studied in order to understand better a particular age in history. Popular culture, of which
                    baseball is a small segment, penetrates American bones; it surrounds the lives of American citizens
                    even when they are abroad. <placeName>

                    Fulbright scholars who studied in Europe in the 1950s. After weeks of living
                    "pure" in another culture, the scholars gathered together, admitted mutual
                    passions, and shared in a thousand guilty Americanisms: "the Shadow, and the Green Hornet,
                    … James Cagney … and Glenn Miller, ‘Did You Ever See a Dream

                    surface, and slow to realize the potential for serious research in the cultural area. Many

            <p>Still, a few historians did change their perspective. Quite early in the 1950s George H. Palmer wrote
                    that a better perspective of an age was gained by studying not the literary geniuses but the writers
                    of lesser quality. The geniuses "tell of past and future as well as the present. They are
                    for all times…. But in the sensitive, responsive souls of less creative power, current
                    ideals record themselves with clearness."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> As early as 1967 Donald R.
                    McCoy urged that American historians utilize "underdeveloped sources" for writing
                    about the nineteenth century. He did not use the term "popular culture," but he
                    pleaded for historians to make use of "religious tracts, weekly newspapers, pulp novels,
                    posters, handbills, burlesque, social and business clubs, cartoons, comic strips, sermons and
                    speeches" as evidence.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Radical and social historians in the 1960s,
                    such as Jesse Lemisch and Herbert G. Gutman, urged the understanding of "the
                    inarticulate" in history and the need to write history from the "bottom
                        up."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Although a number of scholars have questioned such ideas, if
                    followed they would certainly help to chronicle the totality of human experience, surely the goal of

                    despite these new suggestions an obvious and neglected component of popular culture has been
                    ignored. It is one that affects historians directly: the importance of popular history and popular
                    historians.</p>
            <p>In their analysis of American historiography of the years 1870–1920, historians have
                    always paid due homage to the double-play rhythm of George Bancroft to Frederick Jackson Turner to
                    Charles E. Beard.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Perhaps these scholars are "for all time,"
                    but they were not the only influential historians of their respective generations.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Consider a combination less familiar to the students of American historiography, that of
                    Benson J. Lossing to John S. C. Abbott to John Clark Ridpath. These best-selling historians were
                    household names in their day, and since their works were "popular," their
                    histories may have come closer to recording clearly the historical consciousness of their respective
                    times than do the works of honored historians.</p>
            <p>If knowledge of the past is important for everyone, then all kinds of interpretations, written and
                    oral histories alike, will help a people know themselves: who they are, what their relationship to
                    their world is, and of what races, institutions, and nations they are comprised. Some current
                    scholars suggest that the collective meaning of history for a people consists of individuals
                    developing a consciousness of themselves in historical time.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> If this can be
                    accepted, then the importance of popular histories and popular historians can no longer be ignored,
                    and popular historians such as Lossing, Abbott, and Ridpath have been kept on the bench too long.</p>
            <p>The popular writers of history were not always overlooked or denigrated. Young Abraham Lincoln read

                    Historical Association was founded in 1884 with only forty or forty-one charter members. As did
                    other new professional organizations, it struggled for its existence and for recognition and

                    the new and old interpreters of Clio. Roosevelt, for example, eventually termed the AHA "a

            <p>In addition, a new elite class of editors and journalists emerged. Their judgments helped to define
                    further just who were historians and to exclude from consideration popular ones such as Ridpath and
                    Abbott. E. L. Godkin, for example, said of Abbott—a historian with fifty-four volumes and
                    an immense circulation to his credit: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>I single out Abbott for special hostility, not because I think he is himself or his books
                            worth a half page, but because his histories are fair specimens of a kind of literature of
                            which an immense quantity are issued every year and which the half-educated look on as
                            "solid reading." I suppose neither you nor I have any idea of the enormous
                            number of respectable people who think his histories solid works and it is sickening to see
                            him treated in the newspapers with great deference as Abbott the historian.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                  </p>
                    </quote> Godkin further complained in the same letter of "quack poets, quack novelists and
                    quack historians."</p>
            <p>John Clark Ridpath, one of Abbott's most popular colleagues, also deserves to be remembered
                    more respectfully today. He was probably the best-known historian of his time, bridging the gap
                    between Parson Weems and Samuel Goodrich of the pre-1860 period and H. G. Wells in the 1920s.
                    Ridpath published six major works of history in over nineteen volumes, nearly every one in excess of
                    five-hundred, often double-columned pages. The scope and breadth of Ridpath's works, like
                    those of other popular historians, are so vast that the present-day academic historian would not
                    dare to undertake them. One work was simply <hi rend="i">The Great Races of Mankind</hi> in four
                    volumes; another was the <hi rend="i">History of the World: Being an Account of Principle Events in
                        the Career of the Human Race from the Beginnings of Civilization to the Present Time, Comprising
                        the Development of Social Institutions and the Story of all Nations</hi> in nine volumes.
                    Ridpath obviously was not afraid to tackle large subjects. Monographs, biographies, and textbooks
                    numbered an additional eight volumes; and his published articles, coauthored books, and editorships

            <p>Ridpath's publishers built his massive sales records almost entirely by subscription, as did
                    most of the other popular historians of his era. The story of the subscription trade indicates that
                    subscription selling was a key factor in the diffusion of knowledge during the nineteenth century.

            <p>As do studies of the subscription business and its problems, the work of popular historians of the
                    nineteenth-century as well as that of the current practitioners of the art form need serious
                    scholarly analysis. For close to a century many professional historians have acted as guild masters
                    for the historical discipline. Like Godkin, they continue to speak of popular history as uncritical,
                    superficial, merely colorful, or they label it, with the ultimate dismissal, as being
                        "journalistic."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> They criticize Ridpath and others for
                    not having formal training in the historical discipline. Unlike Bancroft, Ridpath did not have the
                    opportunity to attend a German university; however, what Theodore Mommsen said years ago has special
                    validity when applied to Ridpath's history: "History is one of those academic
                    subjects which cannot be directly acquired through precept and learning…. history is in
                    some measure too easy and in some measure too difficult. The elements of the historical discipline
                    cannot be learned, for every man is endowed with them."<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Carl Becker
                    in the 1930s agreed that "every man is his own historian," and Daniel J.
                    Boorstin's recent advice is also pertinent: "I would like to persuade my fellow
                    Americans today that they, too, are primary sources. The trivia of our daily experience are evidence
                    of the most important questions in our lives: namely what we believe to be real."<hi rend="sup">28</hi> Popular history, then, should be approached without preconceived professional

            <p>One of the outstanding qualities of popular histories was their amazing ability to remain in print
                    and on bookshelves in the home. Ridpath's first book appeared in 1874, and the last major
                    edition of his work appeared in 1941. It is difficult to determine the influence of popular books
                    beyond studying the sales figures that established their availability. A work's impact on
                    the untold thousands, including the farmer waiting for his day at the funeral podium, can only be
                    presumed, but research concerning the readership of the Ridpath volumes can establish that diverse
                    Americans received historical lessons by reading Ridpath or by personal contacts with him. Among
                    prominent individuals who state their intellectual debt to Ridpath are politicans Huey Long of <placeName>

                    avoided the immediacy and moralism of the slavery issue. Ridpath's synthesis indicated five
                    general causes of the war: (1) "The different construction put upon the national
                    constitution by the people of the North and South." (2) "The different system of
                    labor in the North and South." (3) "The want of intercourse between the people of
                    the North and South and the publication of sectional books." (4) "The evil
                    influence of demagogues." (5) "Statesmanship at a low ebb."<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Ridpath was not necessarily correct in these views; but he does indicate that the
                    country was getting ready psychologically to negotiate the Compromise of 1877, and he does quite
                    amazingly anticipate many of the later arguments in Civil War historiography. In regard to other
                    major American historiographical themes, Ridpath in some books seemed at least partially to
                    anticipate Turner's frontier thesis of 1893. Ridpath wrote that "on the border of
                    the primeval forests" in the primitive frontier farmhouses and settlements, "the
                    spirit of liberty pervaded every breast." The American frontiersmen's love of
                    freedom was most "intense," and "hostility to tyranny" was
                    "a universal passion."<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

            <p>Most popular historians attempted to meet Mr. Dooley's criticism of historical works that

                    certainly, were given to verbosity and could not avoid filling pages with their own <hi rend="i">obiter dicta</hi>, which in themselves provide insights. For example, Aryanism was rampant in
                    Ridpath's writings. He felt that the Aryan had "the noblest achievements"

                    stomach. Finally, Ridpath warned missionaries that their children should not remain in the East too
                    long or they might develop slanted eyes. Sexist statements abounded in popular history as well as in

            <p>In regard to style, the subscription histories and writings made literary padding almost a tradition.
                    The rule was the longer the book, the larger the price. Mark Twain, who sold most of his books by
                    subscription and felt any other way was intended merely for private circulation, complained of the
                    agony necessary to expand a 300-page idea to a 600-page one.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
                    Ridpath's memorial biography of James G. Blaine did not really need to say that
                    "the sea is full of inspiration and grandeur," nor was it vital to know that
                    Blaine's coffin rested on beds of roses, violets, ferns, and appropriately arranged palm
                        leaves.<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Nevertheless, Ridpath's age and readers demanded a
                    flowery style and many digressions, and he responded eagerly. Socrates was described as having a
                    "magnificent ugly face" but one with "eyes that darted their Promethean
                    fire into souls of mystery and scorched the wings of falsehood."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>Popular history also made use of illustrations, drawing on the new printing technology which had been

                    Ridpath frequently managed to titillate his audiences with pictures of bare-breasted women. Thomas

                        pictorially before he could read. The pictures of battle delighted him most of all. Exulting in

                        pictures—Cyrus directing the charge, the spear-forest of the Macedonian phalanx, and
                        splintered oars, the numberless huddle of the ships at Salamis, the feasts of Alexander, the

                        who flung his body on the lances, the press of horse and foot, the gloomy forests of Gaul and

            <p>Although popular historians and their histories influenced many Americans, criticism of the genre
                    abounds. The most negative evaluations center on the accusations that popular historians were not
                    original scholars, that they borrowed too heavily from others, that they failed to use their sources
                    critically, and that they put too little emphasis on the use of primary sources. Some were
                    undoubtedly guilty, as some professional historians were and are, but Ridpath, along with Lossing
                    and others, made diligent use of primary sources. Ridpath, for example, read Latin and Greek, and
                    his <hi rend="i">History of the World</hi> shows careful attention to the ancient sources. Like
                    Lossing, Ridpath traveled widely to many historic and geographic areas throughout the world
                    searching for records, and in some areas of methodology he was something of a pioneer. In his
                    biographies of Garfield and Blaine, long before the vogue for oral history, Ridpath made use of
                    interviews with participants in historical events;<hi rend="sup">56</hi> and in his article,
                    "The Mixed Populations of <placeName>

                    uses of census data and an awareness of ethnicity in history. Further, the article broke new ground

            <p>Along with other prominent historians, such as Francis Parkman and John Bach McMaster, Ridpath might
                    be accused of plagiarism by modern scholars. As George H. Callcott notes in his <hi rend="i">History

                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>

               </hi>, however, a reliance on accepted authorities and/or literary masterpieces was
                    the common procedure among many popular writers. Scholars whose investigations attempt to prove
                    nineteenth-century plagiarism often stop with the plagiarized fact and show themselves not
                    sufficiently understanding of the literary tenor of the times.<hi rend="sup">58</hi> That some
                    plagiarism existed should not prevent the study of popular histories, particularly as valuable
                    social evidence for understanding various eras in American history.</p>
            <p>An eventual complete survey of popular history and historians will support, and possibly add a
                    dimension to, Henry Nash Smith's analysis of the fusion of "concept and
                    emotion," a technique Smith used in understanding myth and symbol in literature.<hi rend="sup">59</hi> The general reading public often accepted any historical writing as complete
                    truth because of its factual base. The study of myths that were vividly portrayed in popular history

                            to Gibbon's already exciting details. For example, Ridpath adds five additional
                            gladiator contests for the dissolute Commodus and implies that people loved to see their
                            emperor in combat. (This would perhaps reflect the "waving the bloody
                            shirt" tendency of post-Civil War American politics and help ready a populace for
                            Theodore Roosevelt's bellicosity.) Gibbon says the populace was disgusted. On other

                            lasted well into the twentieth century when the forms of literary plagiarism were not
                            acceptable. Articles such as Richard C. Vitzthum, "The Historian as Editor: Francis

                            miss the point that literary and stylistic borrowings were acceptable practices in the

                    the popularity and tremendous numbers of nineteenth-century almanacs, which hung on a hook in almost

                    historical ideas expressed in the extremely popular county histories should be possible for each

                    encyclopedias and titles in "People's" literature provide an avenue to a
                    literary populism that seems ignored. All of these pertain to the years from 1870 to 1920. Other
                    eras have the same unlimited possibilities. Future results of these investigations should provide
                    historians with greater depth and objectivity when they discuss various components of the American

            <p>Ridpath and other popular historians of the late nineteenth century construed their roles as

                    believed that the historian's most important duty was to engage in a dialogue with the
                    American people. He believed in the intellectual importance of the average American. The role of the

                            the days of Francois Voltaire through Leopold von Ranke to those of the institutional
                            professionals of the twentieth century. Perhaps attention should be given again to George
                            Bancroft's delineation of three types of scholars. The lowest kind sought only
                            personal advancement; a higher group, the "scholar-politician," sought to
                            advance nations. In a broad and deep sense these can be called popular historians. The
                            highest scholars according to Bancroft were the ones of genius who unfolded "truths
                            of universal importance." These genuises will always survive and prosper whether
                            they be the William Faulkners, the Charles and Mary Beards, or the Karl Marxes.

            <p>Kerr did report on local issues, sometimes writing his own editorial comments and sometimes
                    publishing letters to the editor. Among the ofttimes heated and lengthy exchanges of letters were
                    many debates about Christian attitudes toward temperance in all things—drinking, dancing,
                    and other moral issues. Kerr's editorial notes related to such varied local discussions as
                    plank roads and turnpikes, railroads, mail service, fire protection, sanitation, Sabbath schools,
                    gold in <placeName>

                    Commerce" by writing a brief but glowing account of the advantages of "Our
                    Town" for industry and trade. This feeling of pride and confidence was a direct result of
                    the completion of the <placeName>

                    Kerr may well have included such comments as inducements to his many advertisers to continue their
                    support of his efforts to put <placeName>

                    </placeName> might see such notes reprinted in their local newspapers; yet, he made no major attempt

                    the names of candidates for office. He frequently published editorial notes on this page; for
                    example, his May 26, 1849, issue contained an editorial calling for "A Fire
                    Engine" plus a reminder for people to clean "cellars and other noxious
                    places." Page three was generally informational with a number of short
                    items—both facts and suggestions. As might be expected in a rapidly developing farm
                    community, Kerr often published features, news items, and advertisements relating directly to
                    agriculture. Also on page three of the May 26, 1849, issue he reprinted the "Town
                    Regulations," wherein the Board of Trustees called for a careful cleanup so that in
                    "the sickly season" <placeName>

                    four were usually devoted to advertising, including illustrated national advertisements for disease
                    remedies.</p>
            <p>Kerr offered his <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi> to subscribers "at One Dollar a year in advance,
                    or within six months." At least once a year he renewed his plea for support of what he
                    reckoned to be "among the cheapest papers in the State." On April 23, 1846, for
                    example, he discussed competition with the cheap eastern papers heavy with literary writings and
                    sensationalism: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Though it is impossible for country newspapers to compete in respect to cheapness with those
                            we have mentioned, their utility we believe to be incomparably greater to the
                            community…. There are certain things in all communities which can be supplied
                            along by a local paper….</p>
                        <p>[It] should not be forgotten … that an editor does not know by intuition, of all
                            that is transpiring in the community around him…. To be useful a paper should be
                            a medium for the interchanges of practical observations on all subjects connected with
                            science, rural economy, etc.</p>
                    </quote> To keep his costs down Kerr encouraged advertisers as well as readers. On July 28, 1846, he
                    wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>See here neighbors! Can you tell how Dr. Peggs [dealer in staple and fancy dry goods, all
                            kinds of wares, drugs, medicines, and clocks, etc.] comes to sell off goods so fast lately?</p>
                        <p>Yes; that is easily accounted for. He has just advertised his stock in the paper, and it goes
                            to families in all parts of the county, and is read by all members of the family. Each one
                            finds something named in the advertisement that they want. The old farmers, especially those
                            that have daughters, have these articles pointed out, and his memory so repeatedly refreshed
                            on the subject, that he comes to town with two or three daughters under convoy; then a
                            terrible reckoning takes place among laces, ribbons, parasols, bonnets, shawls, lawns,
                            jaconets, etc. That is the way it works. Those who advertise will sell.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    humor; witness his reminder published on January 23, 1849: "WOOD UP! Those in arrears for
                    last year, or wishing to pay their subscription in wood this year, would accommodate us, and perhaps
                    save the county the cost of an inquest, by sending it in before we freeze."</p>
            <p>Kerr frequently commented on his reasons for publishing the <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi> and couched
                    his pleas for support in less open terms. Near the end of the first year (November 17, 1846) he
                    thanked his patrons: "One important object which we had in view in the undertaking was to
                    test the practicability of the establishment of a paper at this place; and we are satisfied from the
                    limited experiment made, that the enterprise is not impracticable, though promising no very enticing
                    reward for the labor necessary to its prosecution." At the close of his third volume
                    (January 9, 1849) he wrote half a column reiterating some of his struggles and even apologizing for
                    any errors which might have appeared. Inviting his patrons to procure additional subscribers, he
                    noted that he would "feel amply rewarded if it yields us a reasonable compensation
                    … and withal that our efforts have been productive of some benefit to the community in
                    which we live."</p>
            <p>Early in 1850 Kerr moved his newspaper office from his home in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> to a second-floor room on the north side of the public square (see Figure 3); his
                    comments about the plight of a country newspaper continued. In his "Prospectus of the Fifth
                    Volume" (January 19, 1850) he repeated a familiar refrain with a rare reference to his own
                    handicap: "Such an enterprise, always perplexing and difficult in a new place, shut out
                    from the advantages of the natural light, we have found peculiarly so. But we have thus far met with
                    encouragement and support sufficient to keep us from sinking under impending
                    embarrassments…." A year later, on February 8, 1851, he wrote: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>If five years of toil—without so much as a day's relaxation from our

                            such as to meet the approbation of our political friends and candid minds generally, it may

                            Midwest during the first fifty years following the Civil War were the result of the

                            and businessmen on the worthiness of an atlas or history project. For a specified amount of
                            cash, the prospective buyer could have a lithographic view of his farm, a portrait, or a
                            biographical sketch published in the "beautiful" volume. The use of Judge
                            Banta's name was a typical selling point to lend an air of authenticity to the
                            proposed book; and, in fact, Banta's works might otherwise not have been published
                            in book format. The uses and abuses of the subscription book business were discussed in 1879
                            in a fascinating little book published ironically (or purposely?) by the Fidelity Press of <placeName>

                            outweighs the errors, embellishments, and prejudices obviously contained in these works.

                    Life and Times of John R. Kerr, the Blind Printer" is reprinted below as a tribute to a man
                    who overcame an enormous personal handicap in order to fulfill a desire to stir the political,
                    economic, social, and moral thought of a people still emerging from the frontier wilderness.</p>
            <p>The lives of Kerr and Banta spanned that remarkable period when central Indiana was transformed
                    geographically from a primitive wilderness of forest and swamp to a man-made landscape with its
                    tile-drained fields, prosperous farms, lively rural and village communities, multifunctional town
                    and city trade centers, integrated transport networks, and burgeoning commercial-industrial
                    facilities—yet some years before the automobile, the airplane, the radio.
                    Banta's memorial was written in part as a reminiscence for those of his own generation who
                    also had witnessed the closing of the Indiana frontier. The essay reveals something of midwestern
                    rural and village life at midnineteenth century by focusing on a pioneer editor who captured in
                    print a portion of the otherwise elusive records of life in the newly developing, ofttimes
                    struggling, communities. From the present perspective of another one hundred years, the Banta sketch
                    also is an indirect commentary on the life of a talented small-town lawyer and writer who served as
                    Kerr's biographer.</p>

                    </placeName> received its share. Among those who came from that quarter was John Robinson Kerr, the
                    founder and publisher of the first newspaper printed in the County, who deserves to be remembered
                    not only because he was the County's first printer, editor and publisher, but because he
                    won success in spite of physical infirmities calculated to appall the stoutest hearted; and did his
                    work with a degree of fidelity worthy of all praise.</p>
            <p>John R. Kerr was born in Green[e] County, East <placeName>

                    fifty pounds when he was ten years old, and so low in stature when he went to the printer's
                    trade, at the age of fifteen, that he was compelled to mount a box that he might reach the case.
                    Notwithstanding his parents were in moderate circumstances even for the times in which they lived,
                    they managed nevertheless to give him such an education as fell to the lot of comparatively few men

                            typographical and editorial error exists. The original handwritten manuscript does not
                            survive, and it seems fair to assume that the obvious errors and other apparent mistakes are

                            of a statement. Certain spelling errors, particularly in the case of proper names, have also
                            been corrected. Ten paragraph indentations have been created in order to improve
                            readability. Titles of books and newspapers have been italicized to distinguish them from

                    sight were yielding to paralysis, he said, and there was no hope. In spite of the impending
                    calamity, however, the little job office was bought and moved into one of the two rooms of his house
                    which stood on the west side of Water street, hard by Abdallah Thompson's Carding Machine,
                    and within a stone's throw of the present [1884] High School building [see <placeName>

            <p>By the time all this was done, one eye had failed entirely, and it was so evident that Dr.
                    Muss[e]y's prediction of a state of total blindness was fast approaching fulfillment that
                    whatever of hope the unfortunate printer may have indulged before now gave way; and, hence forward,

                    Speaking of this very time in his life to the writer, many years after, he said, "The one
                    eye, defective as it was, served me very well for reading and working and I managed quite well to
                    get along with it." And so he went on bravely and even cheerfully at his work. He printed
                    hand bills, circulars, addresses, tickets and whatever else his customers asked for. It must be
                    remembered there was no local newspaper to be circulated in the county at that day, nor for that
                    matter was there any circulation of newspapers at all. A few were no doubt taken and
                    read—more likely to be under, than over, a dozen in all. The legal advertisements were
                    printed in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers, as the old files of these papers in the city library bear testimony; but the
                    merchant who wanted to advertise his wares, the candidate who wanted to distribute a circular letter
                    among his friends and all others, who had a private enterprise to blazon forth in printer's
                    ink, went to John R. Kerr's printing office. And the work to be done was not
                    inconsiderable.</p>
            <p>For several years Mr. Kerr, with one eye gone and the other defective but still answering his purpose
                    for reading, setting his types, and printing his forms, kept on with his job work. The eclipse of
                    one eye prolonged the sight of the other most likely and, while it lasted, he determined to make the
                    most of it. He worked on and read on. Customers were never turned off and every spare hour he gave
                    to his books. He was one of those men who hungered for the printed page, and let those who love
                    their books think how keenly he must have felt his approaching misfortune on that account.</p>
            <p>It would no doubt be an interesting sight to most of us, if to-day, we had in our little book case

                    survives as his widow and who sacrificed her own vision in her unselfish devotion to him, remembers

                    gladdened the heart of their owner. On the 4th day of January 1844, without pain, without an
                    immediate warning of any kind the light went out for him, forever. John R. Kerr was blind and the
                    loved books were piled up on their shelves, and never read more by him.</p>
            <p>Now what was he to do? He was thirty-five years old and dependent upon his press and types for a
                    livelihood for himself and wife. After the first flurry has passed by he begins to recognize that
                    his affliction had come upon him merciful in its manner. For years and years he has been in a slowly
                    deepening twilight and has been literally feeling his way all the time. Had he been suddenly struck
                    blind like Saul of Tarsus, he would have been helpless as he, but his years of twilight had been
                    years of schooling. He had been training himself to do without eyes. He had been educating the hand,
                    the ear, the foot, to serve him in perpetual darkness. Mayhap, he had been developing another and
                    hitherto latent sense—a sense unknown to the schools, for he went right on with his
                    printing work the same as ever. His was the only place where printing could be done and the people
                    continued to come for their bills, their posters, their circulars, their "cards to the
                    public"[;] and the blind printer went on with his type setting, his form making, his press work.
                    Happily, his patrons were as uncritical as they were generous, and his work gave satisfaction and
                    John R. Kerr continued to eat the bread of industry.</p>

                    gubernatorial majority save one had been cast for the Democratic candidate, and that exception was
                    for David Wallace, the Whig candidate in 1837. But when it came to candidates for local offices, men
                    were much in the habit of voting for those they liked best, regardless of partisan politics. Samuel
                    Herrnott [Herriott], who, while serving a term as Clerk of the Circuit Court attended thirty-two log
                    rollings one Spring, and who went to all the house and barn raisings for miles and miles around,
                    never failed of an election when he offered himself as a candidate, outspoken a Whig as he was.

            <p>But in 1840 party lines were laid down so broadly and clearly that there never after was any getting
                    over them. That year was one of the remarkable years in American politics. Its history has never
                    been adequately told. A Democratic editor would have said the people were insane; a Whig, that they
                    were wild with excitement. When the future psychologist comes to discuss the laws that produce and
                    govern the contagion of sentiment, he will give as an example of the existence of such contagion,
                    the "Log Cabin and Hard Cider" campaign of 1840. "<placeName>

                    lasting political changes had taken place meanwhile. Many an old Whig hulk was left high and dry by
                    the receding flood of that year.</p>
            <p>Excitement ran high in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> as elsewhere, and out of it came a bit of political bravado, accompanied by a
                    [long-remembered] fight between two <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizens, Henry Banta, a Whig, and John Ritchey, a Democrat…. The Democrats
                    had run up a flag on the Court House steeple, after which the Whigs run [ran] one above it. This
                    engendered bad blood and while the Democrats were preparing to lower the Whig flag, threats were
                    openly made of shooting the man who attemted it, and as there were a plenty of rifles in the crowd
                    and a great deal of whisky, the cooler heads on both sides were uneasy. Fortunately, Banta and
                    Ritchey became involved in a controversy over the affair which led to a fight between them, and
                    during their engagement the inflamed crowd turned aside to see the result.</p>
            <p>In those days there were but few <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                    </placeName> men even who would not look with a good deal of complacency at an old fashioned fist
                    fight. No one ever anticipated any very serious issue to such a battle. It was expected that a
                    belligerant would knock with his clenched fist with all his might and main; he might in a pinch,
                    bite, would be quite apt to scratch and if the worst came to worst, he would gouge at an eye; but no
                    one every dreamed of a knife or pistol being used, and so most men looked on complacently till one
                    or the other cried "Enough!" That was the case on this occasion, and there came

                    and got in a good humor. There were mud holes sometimes in those days to be seen even in the public
                    square of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and it happened there were some on this occasion.</p>
            <p>During the battle the two belligerants rolled into one [mudhole], of such a depth of soft and
                    slippery mud, that they were compelled to give up the contest and scramble out to dry land to avoid
                    smothering, and when they got out they presented such a pitiable sight in their oozy coats and their
                    ardor was so manifestly cooled, that the crowd, already restored to the best of humor, gave way to
                    uproarious laughter. In the meantime the flags had been so adjusted as to float from a common
                    height, and all were satisfied. To this disturbance old men long afterwards attributed the beginning
                    of that strict drawing of party lines, so long a feature in the political history of <placeName>

                    </placeName>; but it is evident to my mind that the disturbance was a result not a cause. It was due
                    to the same forces that brought about the era of strict partisanship. At any rate, from 1840 on, men

                    twenty-five cents of the subscription money which was not paid in advance, came from a coon skin,
                    which was taken from a hollow ash tree whither its owner had been tracked in a February snow. That
                    coon skin the writer valued at half a dollar, half the price of his paper, but the rascally
                    fur-buyer talked it down to a quarter, mainly on the ground that it was "February
                    fur"; and so the subscriber had to look to the hens for the remainder of his subscription

                            after north-south rail connections had been completed (in 1847), Kerr again commented in the

                    subscribers, but printed fifty-two full size papers for a volume. John R. Kerr was a thoroughly

                        destroyed, noting that courthouse records were saved. In the next issue (May 26, 1849), Kerr

                    The judgement and the good taste he exercised in the selection of prose and poetry, of story and

            <p>John R. Kerr's editorial life was an uneventful one. He was a home stayer, as indeed nearly

                            saying "Zealously pursue the path of duty &amp; you will be happy,"
                            whereas in 1849 he wrote "Zealously pursue the right path &amp; success will

                  <item>
                     <hi rend="sup">65</hi> Kerr did include numerous short reports plus accompanying editorial
                            notes, e.g., the editorial on "A Fire Engine" and health problems. In one
                            of his last issues Kerr alluded in one column to reports in another column of two meetings
                            the same night (January 17, 1852): "Fire Meeting" and "Rat
                            Meeting." The town had lost several business houses and the courthouse in the
                            "Great Fire" of May, 1849, and had just endured another business fire on
                            January 15, 1852. And the town had yet to solve a ten-year-old battle with the Norway rat,

                    the railroad was completed, save the merchant, who went to distant towns to buy his goods for many

                    time—took years. John R. Kerr not only stayed at home because it was the fashion of the
                    times, but also because of his infirmity. There was for him no inducement to go from home. He
                    attended no conventions, made no journeys; but week in and week out was at his post superintending
                    the publication of his <hi rend="i">Examiner.</hi> Nevertheless he enjoyed a sort of fame, the fame
                    that followed in the wake of success achieved as a printer, in spite of blindness. Far and near he
                    was known as the "Blind Printer." Newspapers at home and abroad spoke kindly words
                    of him and his neighbors and patrons, appreciating in some sort the difficulties he had to overcome,
                    not only gave him an appreciative support for the poverty of the times but generously overlooked
                    faults in his printing that they would doubtless have criticised in others.</p>
            <p>In the management of his office there was nothing that he could not turn his hand to except, perhaps,
                    mailing his papers. He always kept one or more assistants, one of whom, his cousin Frank Kerr,<hi rend="sup">68</hi> was with him many years. The "boys" in the office read the
                    exchanges to him and he was thus enabled to make up his selected matter. Sometimes he wrote his
                    editorials, using for the purpose a machine devised for use of the blind, but usually he put his
                    editorials in type without writing. While a boy, I often visited his printing office and saw him
                    "sticking type." If he was working on "copy," Frank Kerr would
                    line out a sentence, which he would slowly reduce to type and when the sentence was finished his
                    Mentor would read another; and thus his work was done at the case.</p>
            <p>By reason of the long continued illness of his wife, he sold the <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi> in 1852
                    and moved to Gosport where he and Frank Kerr, soon after embarked on the publication of the Gosport

            <p>As a rule the ease with which the blind go from place to place and the manual dexterity they exhibit
                    is astonishing to those in full possession of the sense of sight. John R. Kerr not only was
                    dexterous as a printer but carried his cleverness in his other avocations. I copy from a letter
                    written by John R. Kellesq<hi rend="sup">70</hi> a kinsman who knew him well in the last years of
                    his life:</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>"It was wonderful how much he could do for himself in handling the mail, and finding any
                        book he wanted. He knew where everything was, and kept the money so that he was always correct
                        in making change. He never forgot where he put anything, and could find anything when the rest
                        failed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kerr kept a partial set of carpenters tools and could make better use of them, than many
                        persons with the use of eyesight. For years he sawed and split all the fire wood used in the
                        family and carried in all the coal and wood.</p>
                    <p>With use of a straight-edge he could spade a bed in the garden and do it well. He could drive a
                        nail with as much certainty as any one.</p>
                    <p>During the war he secured a Bible in eight volumes printed in raised letters, which he read
                        through three times before he died.</p>
                    <p>In 1878 his wife's sight failed her, and she became a sharer in his blindness. Never
                        more could she read to him as for more than thirty years she had been doing, and as she
                        sacrificed her own sight by doing, but, thence on the reader read for her as well as for him.</p>
                    <p>Sometime in 1879 he had a paralytic stroke and though he recovered measurably from the effect of
                        it, he was never afterwards well. Gradually his vitality left him, until in the summer of 1880,
                        dropsy was developed and it was then apparent that his end was near. He kept on his feet,
                        however, up to the 18th of October, maintaining his habitual cheerfulness all the time, and was
                        able to to go the polls at the October election that year and cast his vote for the Democratic
                        candidates. On the 21st of the month he died, being in the seventy-first year of his age.</p>
                    <p>It is needless to say that John R. Kerr was a deeply religious man. He never forgot his early
                        training and never ceased to maintain his Church relation. He died in the communion of the
                        Southern Methodist Church, the Church of his first love not having an organization accessible to
                        him during his last year[s]."<hi rend="sup">71</hi>

            <p>Here I end. I have written this brief sketch as a labor of love. I had little personal acquaintance
                    with the subject of it—never talked with him face to face but twice in my life, but I
                    cannot forget, that when books, and especially books that boys love to read, were scarce, and when
                    newspapers were rarely found in any country household, John R. Kerr, through the <hi rend="i">Examiner</hi>, did much to enable me to gratify a budding love of reading and if it be sound
                    reading, much toward that. He was not a great man, perhaps not a talented man, as that word
                    now-a-days goes, but he was a true man, a faithful man, an earnest man, a pure man, a conscientious
                    man, an honest man; and is deserving of remembrance by those he benefitted. For all, I bring this
                    tribute and offer it upon the altar of his memory.</p>

            <p>Schramm became a very prosperous farmer, and he was an astute businessman. The condition of roads in

                    no idea what a really bad road is." Between 1850 and 1852 he built a plank road from his
                    farm in Sugar Creek Township northward to the National Road approximately one-and-one-half miles
                    away. Neighbors taking their crops to market paid the toll he charged to use the road.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> In an area where effective drainage was an agricultural necessity Schramm first utilized
                    drainage ditches, then, during the Civil War years, established what must have been a profitable

                    need, necessarily, a driving leader without whom they will inevitably wind up in chaos."
                    From the time of his arrival in 1835 Schramm had seemingly been both attracted and disgusted by the
                    American democratic spirit. Impressed by the wealthy merchant who loaded kegs and packing cases and
                    hauled them to the warehouse himself, he could still comment rather scathingly that
                    "day-laborer" was not a term to use in the New World: "the richest have

                    "ringing coin" being drained off to Europe to pay ever-increasing debts.</p>
            <p>Schramm thought that his "enthusiasm for the American freedom" had
                    "greatly diminished" by 1842; nevertheless, he has by that year tempered his
                    earlier determination to return to <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>

                    would only visit there with my family…." He also poignantly reveals his growing
                    recognition of the worth of his new home: "This lonely life in the wilderness, which hardly
                    permits contact with other human beings, has its good points, in fact, excellent points once one
                    gets used to it." Schramm did indeed return to the Old Country to visit in 1856 and
                    traveled extensively in Europe, the Middle East, and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

                        </salute>
                        <p>The heart begins to swell with joy and nostalgia when I think of you dear ones and
                                    our former life. Just now I have your last letter before me which was brought here
                                    by Mr. Richter. Today it is exactly one year since your letter was written and a day
                                    of rain permits me time to answer it. I should have done so before but I have many
                                    reasons to excuse me, aside from the major one that we always have so much work that
                                    we do not know where to start. Furthermore, I was also not sure whether you would
                                    receive my letter. Since we have so much work, I did not want to spare any time for
                                    such an uncertain endeavor, even though my heart always urged me to do so.</p>
                        <p>Since Fischer came here from Dresden and returned there again, I do not know exactly
                                    where he is staying. He would be the only one to whom I could send letters for you
                                    with confidence, knowing that he would forward them to you, dear Karl, duty-free.
                                    Could you, dear friends of my heart, suggest to me in your next letter a place in
                                    Saxony or Prussia where I could send my letters to you, so that you will not have to
                                    wait six years for an answer again. You can certainly depend on that.</p>
                        <p>Oh, it is indeed a great balm for the heart to receive news from faithful, honest
                                    friends far away! I am sending this letter with a German who will shortly leave here
                                    for <placeName>

                                    Wilsdruff under cover of his own, who will then send it to you duty-free because
                                    this way it will cost him but a few pennies. So, again, dear Karl, name a place
                                    where I can send my letters to you which you will <list type="footnotes">

                                    to a letter from you dear ones, even though that may be a long time from now. But
                                    you must write yourself next time, my best friend, as well as mother—I
                                    only want your own handwriting! Everything coming from you has a special value for
                                    me. Friendship can only endure when founded on mutual respect. You have my respect
                                    in full measure because I am certain that if ever in my life I needed you, you would
                                    help me—if you could—with a benevolent and honest heart. Oh,
                                    how often I think of you during my solitary labors in the fields! How I converse in

                                        Habermeier.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Later on, conditions were still bad for a long
                                    time. There was not much clear land. Therefore, for several years, we had to buy
                                    nearly everything we needed for ourselves and our livestock and get it here under
                                    the most terrible conditions, of which you can have no conception. Often I became
                                    stuck with the wagon in the morass and, to my dismay, did not know how to get out of
                                    it. The greater part of the land was marshland and even after it was cleared one
                                    could not grow much on it. Drainage ditches had to be built to dry out the fields
                                    and eliminate the pestilential swamps which are also very injurious to health.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning we had millions of mosquitoes here. They entered our dwelling and
                                    caused us sleepless nights—after the heavy labors of the
                                    day—because their stings were very painful. Now, that we have the ditch,
                                    we are not bothered with this plague any more.</p>

                        <p>When I first started to plough the many swamps with a badly trained horse, I
                                    accomplished almost nothing although I nearly sweated myself to death. I had a
                                    principle that I would not permit myself to become so discouraged as to give up on
                                    anything in this world which others could achieve by perseverance. I struggled until
                                    things worked out and worked well.</p>
                        <p>Although I often had workmen to help with heavy labors of lumbering and field work,
                                    ditch-digging, and so on, I always had to work ahead of them if I wanted things done
                                    properly because the daily wage is very high but products cost very little. This is
                                    the main reason why nearly all well-to-do people coming here become poor, whereas

                                    acquire some assets. The situation was certainly better three years ago and before
                                    that; products were profitably sold for money, but now it is different. Heaven only
                                    knows what will happen with the financial situation of the State of Indiana which
                                    started to build a multitude of canals and railroads and in doing so wasted money
                                    prodigiously. The laborers there earned one dollar daily and more, beside their
                                    meals and the brandy they swilled. The State borrowed and wasted more money until
                                    these gentlemen were unable to borrow any more and had to stop the projects. Instead
                                    of completing a single railroad or canal which would traverse the State to provide
                                    it with a means of moving its products, they started a number of them and when the
                                    money ran out everything collapsed, leaving no way for transportation east or south.
                                    The State now has a debt of over 13 million dollars which must be repaid with

                                            extensive program of internal improvements to be financed almost entirely by
                                            the sale of state bonds. Largely because of political considerations work
                                            was begun on almost all segments of the project—consisting of
                                            roads, railroads, and canals—at the same time. Scarcity of labor,
                                            inexperience, construction problems, corruption, and perhaps most
                                            importantly the Panic of 1837 caused the collapse of the entire System of
                                            1836. The state itself was unable to complete any of the projects, and
                                            internal improvements creditors lost heavily. In 1847 Governor James
                                            Whitcomb estimated the debt at slightly over eleven million dollars. John D.

                                    dead—and greed, ambition and a host of mean passions have taken over. In
                                    Congress they insult, beat and shoot one another, waste time on trivia, lack the
                                    courage to tackle important business. They are splintered into many factions and are
                                    acting spitefully. Although every one of them receives a daily salary of seven
                                    dollars, they only pursue their own pleasures and when they are supposed to vote on
                                    a law there are often more than 100 men absent. The situation is not better in other
                                    states, possibly worse; therefore most important business remains undone and there

                                    it and, even though I have the right by citizenship, I do not go to the elections.
                                    The whole business repels me because I see nothing but the filthy, self-serving ways
                                    of the money-hungry and unworthy who vie for official positions, which the honest
                                    man is careful indeed to avoid. Thus it appears that human weakness makes it
                                    impossible to sustain a republic on this earth for any length of time and the
                                    majority of people need, necessarily, a driving leader without whom they will
                                    inevitably wind up in chaos. Nevertheless, the Americans are still very proud of
                                    their freedom, even though they are the worst slaves and there is sure to be a
                                    bloody revolution before a monarchic government can gain a foothold here.</p>
                        <p>Congress, which in the year 1830 had close to 30 million dollars cash in the
                                    treasury, is now so indebted that the individual states together owe almost 200
                                    million dollars, mostly in Europe, with interest also flowing there in ringing coin.
                                    It is clear, then, why cash money here must diminish more and more.</p>
                        <p>The character of the government is also reflected in the households of the Americans.
                                    Twice as much is cooked or baked than is eaten and, when mealtime is over, the pigs,
                                    dogs and cats get all the leftovers—ham, baked goods and so on.</p>
                        <p>So this is the situation and one can only draw the conclusion that we must be very
                                    unhappy after investing so much money, effort and time to make a better life for
                                    ourselves. This may be true of many people who are merely interested in getting rich
                                    but it is not the case with us; since we can not sell anything any more, we keep no
                                    laborers, except those who will accept the products of our land as payment. We have
                                    reduced our requirements for luxuries very sharply: we drink coffee on Sundays only,
                                    go barefoot all summer and make our own clothes because we keep sheep and can also
                                    make flax. Up to now we still have some clothes left from <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName> and the little equipment we need for our household is made for us by
                                    workers who are willing to accept our farm products in return.</p>
                        <p>We have a barn and dwellings comfortable enough for us, and a large quantity of food.
                                    We eat young and old chickens, baked and cooked, turkeys, the finest smoked meat,
                                    bread and everything which can be made from wheat. (We have this year again 20 acres
                                    of very good wheat). We also enjoy a variety of good things from our beautiful
                                    garden which has pathways and a picketfence round about. Our apple and peach trees
                                    are growing very rapidly because we are taking very good care of them and in a few
                                    years we shall also have a surplus of those fruits. <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-077-3-082"/> We make our own sugar and, instead of green tea, we
                                    make our own from the root of sassafras, which is very tasty and I even prefer it to
                                    the green tea. Also, it can be had for free from the woods nearby.</p>
                        <p>Since we have enough food, we feed our five horses, four cows and other livestock
                                    well; therefore all of them—chickens, geese and turkeys
                                    included—are so lively and content that it is a joy. Only our 100 pigs
                                    are more meagerly provided for because they are of no value to us at all; still,
                                    they get just enough because, after all, they are living creatures. Also, they
                                    scream fiercely in unison when they want anything.</p>
                        <p>We still have a few hundred dollars in cash and the 2,000 acres of land may be a good
                                    financial cushion for our children in the future, aside from the farm whereon we
                                    live. Although I have to work very hard—we all have to—it has
                                    now become a habit with us, so that without this work we would hardly feel

                                    years ago. She lost so much blood that I had to prepare myself to lose her. It was a
                                    very hard blow for me but it is my firm conviction that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> guides everything and so I accepted God's will with an aching
                                    heart, having already planned what to do with my children, but it pleased the Ruler
                                    of this World to keep her in our midst a little longer so that she would be able to
                                    continue to do many more good deeds. Again, 1 1/2 years ago, this dear one was in
                                    sad condition; she suffered from a bad chest so severely that everyone was sure that
                                    she would die. I wanted to call a doctor but she would not permit it and,
                                    considering the great ignorance of the local physicians, she acted wisely because

                                    following its instructions and taking the simple medications prescribed therein.
                                    Thus, with God's help, she restored her bad chest to health again.
                                    Invariably, when one or the other does not feel well in our house, she knows how to
                                    help by using that book. For this reason she is planting a multitude of useful herbs
                                    in the garden, to make tea with, or for compresses and so on. Only here have I
                                    learned to appreciate the great value of a perceptive and virtuous mother of the
                                    house. It is a great treasure, greater than all the riches a woman can bring to a

                                    They are all healthy children, laughing and thriving, so that it is a pleasure to
                                    see. Nanni, the oldest, is able to help her mother quite a bit and also helps me in
                                    the fields, mainly during the planting of corn and with the first plowing. We have
                                    no school here and, if we did, I would not send her to keep her from seeing or
                                    hearing bad examples from other children. I teach her myself although my many labors
                                    leave me little time, except during winter evenings. Things work out fine then but
                                    even in the summer each child must practice writing or arithmetic daily. I examine
                                    their work when I have a free quarter of an hour and call their attention to any
                                    mistakes. No beatings are given for errors and my approval or disapproval is their
                                    sole reward or punishment and sufficient to let me achieve what I desire. None of
                                    our children have been beaten more than once or twice—there was no need
                                    for more because they obey to the letter. Naturally, one must permit them many
                                    childlike pleasures—often very noisy—to prevent their falling
                                    into evil ways.</p>
                        <p>On winter evenings, after lessons, I play with them, read to them about matters they
                                    can comprehend or I tell them a story which is always wholesome in content and
                                    stresses righteousness. In this way the children find their greatest pleasure in

                        <p>Which decent parents can be indifferent to whether their children are devout and
                                    good, without guile, industrious and content to work, modest in their demands, free
                                    of vanity and compassionate even to animals; are helpful to everyone
                                    and—next to God—love their parents above anything and will
                                    obey their slightest wish even after they are grown. I have seen enough in thickly

                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName> to know that the opposite is often true in spite of the best efforts of
                                    the parents. Therefore, as long as my children are in need of any training I am
                                    content to stay in my wilderness. This is not a trifling matter!</p>
                        <p>If anything is broken in our house or any other mishap occurs, the one responsible
                                    immediately comes forth to admit it. Clearly then, there will be only a loving
                                    admonition instead of physical punishment. Briefly stated, we are building a small
                                    world for ourselves in which there is no selfishness and therefore only contentment.
                                    If only times were better and I could afford a worker to take my place, I would have
                                    more leisure to be with my children. I would teach them more than they could learn
                                    in any school because I would learn from my books about any subject that I am not
                                    quite familiar with. These books are a boundless treasure for me. Admittedly, I can
                                    not read very much because I have no time, but the little that I do read is a balm
                                    for my spirit and I dwell on it during my solitary labors where I am undisturbed.</p>
                        <p>It is quite different when one is surrounded by people, who must be supervised to
                                    some extent, a situation which inevitably tends to bring anger and strife, and to
                                    what purpose? If I gathered great riches for my children by leading a life of
                                    tumult, worry and vexations, they could readily waste their fortune with others when
                                    they are grown and there would be no way for me to stop them. It is better, indeed,
                                    that I enjoy my life with my family. My children—trained in hard
                                    work—will be self-sufficient after my death. They will live content, with
                                    few needs, loving God and their fellow men, and they will bless my memory.</p>

                                    which must take precedence over the heart's desires. My dear ones, I do not

                                    </placeName> wills it. I was thinking of selling my land and farm here and

                                    </placeName>; possibly I would only visit there with my family, circumstances
                                    permitting. This would not be extraordinary, if financial conditions became
                                    stabilized which will be sooner or later. By that time perhaps I will prefer to live
                                    here instead of there because habits are often hard to break; still, it is my firm
                                    intention to see you, dear ones, and the many fine, decent people we had the good
                                    fortune to know there. I am confident that <placeName>

                                    can communicate more truly with other spirits, because there are no distances

                                    us—despite all our labors we have not made progress. These are the ways

                                    </placeName> for which I always have deep respect. I am sure that your difficulties
                                    have increased since your business has grown so much. Problems that you never had
                                    before must have arisen to take the place of those you had solved. This is the way
                                    of life and no earthly power can change it because it is a sign from the great Ruler
                                    of this World that our hearts should not cleave to earthly things too much. He shows
                                    the spirit the transitoriness and constant change of tangible things and the spirit
                                    finally disdains them, returns unto itself and, by becoming independent, attains the
                                    greatest heights of happiness. We are therefore not worried about the future because
                                    our happiness and contentment does not depend on it. We fulfill our obligations and
                                    leave the rest to <placeName>

                              <hi rend="sup">13</hi> Johann Heinrich Daniel Zschokke (1771–1848),
                                        a famous German author of short stories, melodramas, and writings on religious
                                        and moralistic subjects, was a friend of Jacob Schramm. Schramm used
                                        Zschokke's <hi rend="i">Hours of Devotion</hi> for the

                        <p>In the evening hours, it warms my heart to behold the starry sky and I feel closer to
                                    the great Creator, and all our cares on earth appear petty and ridiculous. I seek
                                    out every opportunity to imbue my family with these great and noble joys because I
                                    am convinced that in this way I can build a lasting happiness for them, such as I
                                    experience so often myself. We embrace all mankind with love (within reason, of
                                    course) and in our household there is no anger, hatred, envy, schadenfreude<hi rend="sup">14</hi> or any emotion to impoverish man's life and make it
                                    a hell, albeit it would be in his power to make it a heaven on earth.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, I would often like to drink a glass of wine or beer with you, my best friend,
                                    but since it cannot be done I do not consider it a great loss because I also need
                                    not cope with the frustrations of my former hops trade—may it rest in
                                    peace. While I am on the subject of hops trade—I see from your letter
                                    that your brother lost 3000 Gulden<hi rend="sup">15</hi> in that business. I am
                                    terribly sorry to hear this and I am sure that you, a reasonable man, will not blame
                                    me for this. I am quite certain that I would have earned 4000 Gulden in the same
                                    time and under the same trading conditions that your brother lost 3000. You
                                    don't believe this? I have no doubts about it at all. Unfortunately at the
                                    time I did not know your brother well enough; if I did, I would not have transferred
                                    the business to him even if I had to stay there all my life. In the beginning, I
                                    came to know him as a righteous, reasonable and good-natured man—an
                                    opinion I never had reason to change—but, as I later realized, he lacked
                                    the necessary energy, patience and unrelenting drive, so even then I was reasonably
                                    sure that he would lose 3000 Gulden. Then, I say it was too late for me, as a
                                    rational man, to make a change without becoming a laughing stock before the world
                                    and also losing the confidence of the people—you know that best, my dear
                                    Karl! I am also quite sure that you and your dear wife will not hold this against
                                    me, even though others may. My intentions were honorable and I was sure that in the
                                    future I could earn more than ever in that business because I had the confidence of
                                    both buyers and sellers to a much higher degree than in former years. But enough of
                                    that; it was the will of <placeName>

                                    </placeName> and that comforts me. I would rather give up my last penny than be the
                                    cause of another man's misfortune but I <list type="footnotes">

                                    help him because he is not using the powers that <placeName>

                                    </placeName> has given him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Richter, who brought your letter to me, was here almost the whole winter. He
                                    helped us with the harvesting of our corn and the husking and that was no small
                                    labor because we had nearly 700 Strich. He also helped us with the slaughtering and
                                    processing of our 56 pigs and that was a considerable accomplishment. He learned to
                                    cut wood as well as anyone here and in general he is a very handy and useful person.
                                    He lost his God, however, and his belief in virtue and contentment and with it all
                                    joy from his heart. He must be quite unhappy; I have often noticed it. He appeared
                                    to be happy with our family since at first he intended to stay only a few weeks but
                                    then decided to stay most of the winter. He has written me recently and is now in <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                                    </placeName> to become a shoemaker.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Richter appeared to be drawn by the example set by our family of unity,
                                    contentment and joy but it appears that he has strayed much too far from that path
                                    to be able to return to it again. Love of God and faith in Him does not warm his
                                    heart any more; the moon is just the moon and the stars are merely stars as far as
                                    he is concerned. Beholding them does not fill his heart with the wonder of creation
                                    and so this unfortunate one is not really alive—he is already dead. I and
                                    my good wife tried very hard to restore in him the holy faith in God but it was in
                                    vain; his heart remained cold as ice. The cause appears to lie with the training he
                                    received in his youth and his experiences in later years must have compounded the
                                    problem. Heavens, how miserable such a man must be! I shudder when I think of it and
                                    cannot understand how he can bear this kind of life.</p>
                        <p>Oh, best Karl, in your spare time turn your greatest attention to the education of
                                    your children! Make them enjoy your company lest they fall under the bad influence
                                    of others. Impress their young hearts and entertain them with stories from books, or
                                    thought up by you, it does not matter as long as they are effective. Dear friends of
                                    my heart, build a small world for yourselves in your leisure time and need one
                                    another! You will soon feel in your heart the blessings to follow. Only here have I
                                    come to appreciate the joys of family life and the beauty of it.</p>
                        <p>Finally I see in your letter a small addition from my little Karl! That really
                                    pleases me that you still think of me because I very often think of you! You are
                                    wondering if there is anything <pb n="286" id="VAA4025-077-3-088"/> that you could
                                    do here. The answer is no! You can tell about conditions here from this letter and
                                    this state is still too young and new for factories, which are in the eastern states
                                    where I have no connections. I am sure there is no need for you to leave because if
                                    you are—as I hope—a hardworking, handy and hopeful young man
                                    worthy of your righteous and good parents, there must be plenty for you to do in
                                    your father's house and you can relieve that good man of many a burden he
                                    had to carry alone up to now. If your parents think it desirable, you might go
                                    abroad in <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName> to look around and learn something.</p>
                        <p>Do not, my true friend, concern yourself with harmful desires! Cast them off like
                                    vipers! Live only for your calling and seek your pleasure in God's approval
                                    and that of your conscience and your parents. It is the greatest pleasure, greater
                                    than all the tickling of the senses. Believe this, my young friend! I mean well and
                                    I have more experience than anyone could have at your age.</p>
                        <p>Be dedicated to your obligations and persevere during long and difficult tasks.
                                    Always be of good cheer, making a happy face, and everyone will like you. To achieve
                                    contentment and satisfaction, deny yourself some pleasure occasionally and impose on
                                    yourself voluntarily more effort and labor than would be necessary. Live modestly
                                    and partake of the simplest food and drink in preference to that which is spicy and
                                    strong and—above everything—get some decent books, such as The
                                    Hours of Meditation. Read it every free hour and you will find refreshment for your
                                    spirit and joy in the fulfillment of your duties. If your co-workers should laugh,
                                    let them; the loss is theirs and the great blissful gain is yours! Oh, my Karl! If
                                    only I could be with you, my young friend! If I could only keep you from the
                                    poisonous pursuits which spoil body and soul, and could implant in you an
                                    appreciation for the finer enjoyments, my time would be spent well indeed! You would
                                    thank me, once you experienced the overwhelmingly blessed feeling of having
                                    faithfully discharged your duties. Since we are so far away from each other, I can
                                    only convey to you this way my own experiences and hope that you will heed them. If
                                    you do, you will have a feeling of self-respect and one day, when you will be
                                    honored—as your dear father is now—by your fellow citizens for
                                    your knowledge and your integrity, I shall embrace the well turned out son of my
                                    best friend with tears of joy if fate decrees that I should return to <placeName>
                                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                                    </placeName> again.</p>

                        <p>To be truly content, dear Karl, you must free yourself of all unnecessary desires and
                                    use always less than you gain; then you will have abundance. You will be rich,
                                    independent of others, and able to do good deeds where you see the need for it. Not
                                    dancing and gambling must be your entertainments, which murder virtue and innocence
                                    unless enjoyed in wise company—rarely found in places catering to these
                                    diversions. Your inner strength and your sense of dignity must let you disdain such
                                    mindless amusements. Nature, the rising and setting of the sun and moon and the
                                    starlit sky should give you much joy. During the night hours, remember the great
                                    Creator who made these heavenly bodies maintains and rules them; they were not
                                    created without purpose. In all likelihood they are peopled with spirit beings and
                                    one of them is probably intended for our functioning in the future but we can only
                                    be as happy there as we were before leaving this planet earth to start anew. These
                                    are great, uplifting joys and profound reasons for being devout and righteous and I
                                    have been, and still am, practicing these virtues happily.</p>
                        <p>I will be pleased, my dear young friend, if you will write me more about your
                                    circumstances, the state of your spirit and your general situation. You can be
                                    assured of my continuing great interest in you.</p>
                        <p>Now, all my dear friends, I must close. Although there is much more I could write
                                    about America which is worth knowing, I must not do so all at once, or I will not
                                    have anything to write about next time. Do write about what Nanni and Julichen are
                                    doing! Send both of them our hearty greetings. Do you have any more I don't
                                    know about? Let me know! I am now looking forward to your answer in six
                                    months—a long one! We are all eagerly waiting for it!</p>
                        <p>My good wife and the grandfather would have liked to add a few words but they are not

               <hi rend="i">Being Lucky: Reminiscences and Reflections.</hi> By Herman B Wells. (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName>: Indiana University Press, 1980. Pp. xiii, 493. Illustrations, notes, appendix, index.
                    $17.50.)</head>
            <p>A chronicle of the life, times, and achievements of an outstanding person in any field of endeavor
                    makes for stimulating and informative reading. The exciting volume, <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>,
                    written by Herman B Wells belongs in this category. It has been said that a college or university is
                    the lengthened shadow of the man who guides the institution during a particular point in history.
                    The history of Indiana University from 1937 to 1962 does indeed represent the lengthened shadow of
                    Wells. The qualitative and quantitative development of the university is directly attributable to
                    the energy and effort of this outstanding educator.</p>
            <p>The volume is comprehensive yet is written in a spirit of light-hearted reminiscence. It is scholarly
                    in its accuracy but is personal in style. It is an autobiography yet has the impact of history. Its
                    subject matter is Indiana University, but its scope relates to the state of Indiana, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and the world. Wells's humor, wit, and humanness pervade every chapter.
                    Indiana University's chancellor undertakes a serious subject but is not serious about
                    himself. Characteristically, he minimizes his contribution to the enterprise and gives others the
                    credit for its success; indeed, one of the weaknesses of the volume is its failure to put into
                    proper perspective the tremendous role which Wells played in the endeavors he describes. The title
                    itself, <hi rend="i">Being Lucky</hi>, characterizes the author's modesty. One must probe
                    and project in order to sense Wells's full impact.</p>
            <p>The chapters on "The Presidency" constitute a handbook for college administrators.
                    They clearly demonstrate the problems, challenges, and opportunities facing a college administrator
                    today. Wells's skill in solving problems, facing challenges, and converting opportunities
                    is immediately apparent to the reader. The author is, indeed, "a president's
                    president."</p>
            <p>Hoosier pride is ever present in the volume. It is particularly evident in those chapters in which
                    Wells describes his youth in Jamestown, Indiana, his college years, and his apprenticeship in
                    academic administration. He loves his state just as he loves his university.</p>
            <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-077-3-091"/>
            <p>Wells may regard himself as lucky; however, those who know him and who know of his accomplishments
                    believe that they are the ones who are lucky because they have been fortunate to observe his genius
                    at work through the decades.</p>

                    </placeName>'s autobiography, "Life as I Remember It—As a Slave and
                    Freeman," began its one-year run in the black weekly. Willard B. Gatewood, Jr., has
                    transformed this poorly written, disjointed story into a well-edited, thoroughly documented research
                    source of nineteenth-century Indiana history. Blended together are ample doses of local history,
                    Civil War narrative, Methodist church history, Afro-American history, late-nineteenth-century
                    Hoosier politics, oratory, and <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s go-getter, "up from the bootstraps" philosophy.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the ex-slave's self-serving success story is not as even as

            <p>When one reads the subtitle to <hi rend="i">Overland By Auto in 1913: Diary of a Family Tour from <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                        </placeName> to Indiana</hi>, one is taken aback; did the Copeland family really move from west
                    to east? Indeed they did, all five of them: Guy and Estella, aged forty-one <pb n="291" id="VAA4025-077-3-093"/> and thirty-four respectively; their two sons, William (eleven) and Burl
                    (eight); and Guy's mother, Nancy Wells Cope-land, who was sixty-seven at the time. They
                    were not the only ones to make the reverse trip from west to east. Many others also returned home to
                    the East or Midwest, having discovered that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="cau">California</region>
                    </placeName> was not the Utopia they had anticipated.</p>
            <p>There is more going on in Estella Copeland's diary, however, than the decision of the family
                    to leave the charms of the Golden State, or "city life," as they called it, to
                    return to their farm in Indiana. The book is also an interesting account of the development (or, as
                    was often the case, the nondevelopment) of American highways in this early period. With the highways
                    as the tie that binds, readers learn about the landscape, the weather, the camaraderie of fellow
                    travelers, and the attitude of the twentieth-century settlers toward Indians.</p>
            <p>Having decided to journey by automobile rather than by train, the Copelands turned to the American
                    Automobile Association for help. The association, founded in 1902, furnished maps and advice.
                    Although it tried to minimize the difficulties of the journey by automobile, the AAA advised that
                    "at least two cars should travel fairly well together, especially in the West in case of
                    accident to one, the other car could either render immediate aid and/or go for medical assistance,
                    water, gasoline, oil or food" (p. 15).</p>
            <p>Fortunately the Copelands did encounter another family en route, one of whom was a doctor who proved
                    a source of sound advice when William Copeland became ill, probably from heat and exhaustion (it
                    registered as high as 110° in the shade). Mrs. Copeland wrote about her son's
                    illness in this interesting entry, which also shows her distrust of Indians:<text>

            <p>Editorial comment adds the continuity of personality to the Copeland diary, which often understates
                    what must have been formidable obstacles: "A desert dust storm is not pleasant"

                    wakened from a nap this afternoon by an earthquake" (p. 32). When the Copelands reach home,
                    the diary simply reads: "Thus the long journey is done" (p. 79).</p>
            <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-077-3-094"/>
            <p>But the picturesqueness is there. The Copelands, for all their quiet words, were adventuresome: it
                    was in many ways as dramatic to travel half way across the continent in 1913 by automobile as it had
                    been by covered wagon three quarters of a century earlier. Too few records of such families exist.
                    This is a welcome addition to the social history of that period.</p>

            <p>Professor Ballard C. Campbell states quite accurately that his book is "based on
                    observations about houses of representatives" in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="iau">Iowa</region>
                    </placeName> between 1886 and 1895 (p. 3). The result is an excellent study of the lower house in
                    each state for those years. The book is not, however, a study of midwestern legislatures as implied
                    by the title. The senates of the three states are excluded from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s analysis. Also, such midwestern states as <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> are not even mentioned.</p>
            <p>Despite the inaccuracies in the title the book is worthwhile. It analyzes representative democracy as
                    reflected in the lower houses during fifteen sessions (five sessions in each state). An introductory
                    chapter explains the limits of the study and gives an overview. The book then proceeds methodically
                    and logically with nine chapters that include such topics as getting elected, lawmakers and
                    lawmaking, the contested issues, parties and partisanship, and fiscal policy. Specialists in
                    legislative history will be impressed by the thoroughness of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s research. Generalists will learn all they want to know about each
                    state's house of representatives during the decade covered.</p>
            <p>For those fascinated by quantification <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> includes twenty-four tables. Readers unfamiliar with the techniques and language of
                    statistical analysis, however, should be forewarned. The tables depict such things as the
                    "Cumulative percentage of variance explained and beta values for scales on Community Mores
                    and economic policy" (Table 7.3). They also abound with complicated explanatory footnotes:
                    "The Pearson correlation (r) differs from its reciprocal ('variance
                    explained') because of the <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-077-3-095"/> three-party circumstance in <placeName>

                    138).</p>
            <p>Sumptuary legislation dominated the sessions that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> covers. (This was true during the same years in sessions in other states, including
                    Indiana). <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> considers "blue laws" in Chapter 6, "Legislating Community
                    Mores." He offers detailed information on the ethnic, religious, and political backgrounds
                    of those on all sides of the temperance issue and of laws that forbade dancing, card-playing, and
                    Sabbath-breaking. Similar analyses are offered for legislation affecting social minorities such as
                    women, foreign language groups, blacks, and children.</p>

               <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Campbell</settlement>
                    </placeName> concludes that individual lawmakers should not be reduced to mere ciphers on a computer
                    printout. While admitting that party and background played important roles in determining how
                    legislators voted, he nonetheless writes: "Close inspection of roll call voting shows that
                    beneath the larger behavioral uniformities lay instructive deviations from state to state, from year
                    to year, and from issue to issue" (p. 105). The point is well taken and should be
                    remembered by those who study the legislature of any state. Lawmakers in Indiana certainly conformed
                    to "larger behavioral uniformities" in the 1880s and 1890s. There is too great a
                    correlation between voting patterns and party, district, ethnicity, and religious affiliation to say
                    otherwise. In the final analysis, however, laws were made by flesh-and-blood human beings whose
                    motivations were as different and numerous as there were representatives and senators in the Indiana
                    General Assembly. <placeName>

            <p>On December 8, 1969, 116 delegates convened in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> to rewrite the 1870 <placeName>

                    </placeName> constitution. Over the next ten months they accomplished their task and submitted the
                    new document to the people for ratification on December <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-077-3-096"/> 15,
                    1970. The people approved the work, which became effective on July 1, 1971. The Institute of
                    Government and Public Affairs of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> authorized the writing of a series of ten monographs to record and analyze the revision
                    process. <hi rend="i">Charter for a New Age</hi> is the final and capstone volume. The authors were
                    intimately involved with the convention, Joseph P. Pisciotte as executive director and Elmer Gertz
                    as a delegate and chairman of the Bill of Rights Committee.</p>
            <p>The first eight chapters provide summary information on the movement to alter the constitution; the
                    selection of delegates; the structure of the body, including officers and committees; the role of
                    outside groups, including lobbyists, interest groups, and the media; and controversies within the
                    convention. Chapters 9 through 17 present a brief synopsis of the activities of the nine substantive
                    standing committees. Each chapter contains an analysis of the membership, significant contributions
                    of key individuals or groups, the major differences and controversies, and the final result. The
                    final three chapters cover the hectic closing days and adoption of the document by the convention,
                    the approval by the people, and a brief review of the successes and failures of the convention.</p>
            <p>Although the authors were aligned closely with the convention, they fairly and impartially identify
                    the contributions of the delegates—in particular those of Samuel W. Witwer who served as
                    president—the disputes, and the compromises. Non-contributors are also recognized.</p>
            <p>The nine specialized monographs plus this summary volume provide the most comprehensive analysis of
                    any state and constitutional convention in American history. It would have been useful, however, to
                    have included a copy of the constitution in the appendixes of the volume.</p>

                    majority of the crimes were due to poverty and over-population. Plagued by this situation, he
                    obtained a leave of absence to study medicine at the University of Bonn. Because of ill health and
                    the desire to visit America, he requested a release from his duties in 1823.</p>

            <p>Capturing a "mood" can be at least as challenging as bottling a
                    will-o'-the-wisp. Here, a dedicated and ingenious author has consciously attempted it.
                    Exploiting the diaries, letters, and <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-077-3-098"/> "commonplace
                    jottings" of some two thousand "ordinary" Americans, Lewis O. Saum
                    constructs a narrative of the popular mood in the pre-Civil War period. Since he wants to record the
                    views of common folk, he appropriately excludes the work of professionals—journalists,
                    ministers, and educators—and of "subcultural or alien elements" deemed
                    to be unrepresentative (p. 237).</p>
            <p>Dividing his book into two parts, "Things Spiritual" and "Things
                    Temporal," Saum records popular opinions and beliefs about providence, religion, death,
                    self and society, politics, nature and art, and the West. His energetic research provides insightful
                    observations phrased in vigorous, idiomatic speech. In a thoughtful appendix on methodology he
                    predicts that some may pronounce his "approach" novel and that others will call it
                    "fruitless, if not impossible" (p. 230). Despite his successful search for
                    fugitive materials he testifies to the "vexations entailed in locating and analyzing the
                    written remains of a couple thousand unelevated mainstream Americans" (p. 237).</p>
            <p>Saum is bold enough to generalize, and his conclusions sometimes challenge textbook wisdom.
                    "The writings of the plain folk," he insists, "reveal almost
                    none" of that ebullient and assertive spirit that is found in the works of many scholars
                    (p. 138). Emphasis on illness and death in his sources provides a lugubrious damper for the
                    exuberant moods of Davy Crockett and the ring-tailed roarers featured in some studies. "Our
                    Western prairie," Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "shakes with fever and ague"
                    (p. 181); and people knew death "by its existential proximity as well as by its actuarial
                    prevalence" (p. 83). But, says Saum, they "left it to the Emersons to tame or
                    circumvent such agencies" as providence and circumstance (p. 138).</p>
            <p>The "overwhelming consideration in our ancestor's minds," Saum concludes,
                    was "the subduing of nature" (p. 176). He contradicts the notion of Carl Russell
                    Fish and others that politics was their "main preoccupation" (p. 144). From the
                    "scant remarks" he found concerning slavery Saum "gathers that the
                    average northerner felt no moral outrage over the ‘peculiar institution’ or
                    any intense solicitude for those fettered by it" (p. 172). Although people praised life in
                    the country, not everyone saw a "harsh intrusion" after the "machine had
                    gotten loose in the garden." Vermonter Zuar Jameson, for example, loved to hear the engines
                    and hoped for the day when he and his neighbors might hear "the steam whistle sound through
                    these values" (p. 182). Pioneers were "disarmingly <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-077-3-099"/> straightforward" in discussing their motivation for westward
                    migration. Saum concludes that "they sought lucre" (pp. 202, 203). As one
                    Californian said simply, "there is nothing like a new country for poor folks" (p.
                    205).</p>
            <p>Although at times Saum must struggle to give coherence to his diverse materials, he has nevertheless
                    approached his objective of describing the mood of pre-Civil War America in the idiom, commonplaces,
                    and "tone of voice" of the period (p. 240).</p>

            <p>Practically every Civil War battle has been credited by one or more authors as constituting
                    "the turning point of the war." <placeName>

               </placeName>, to name a few, have had their proponents over the years.
                    James Lee McDonough makes no such claim in this fine study of one of the war's most tragic
                    but unheralded struggles. He does, however, present a strong case to credit the battle as ranking
                    among the great engagements of the war.</p>
            <p>In the fall of 1862 the two great western armies faced each other barely thirty miles apart in middle <placeName>

                    </placeName>; the Confederate Army of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> under Braxton Bragg at Murfreesboro below Stones River. Heavy Union lossess in the East
                    at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, forced the Lincoln government to pressure Rosecrans to move
                    against Bragg and gain a victory.</p>
            <p>Though a particularly cold winter had settled over the region, Rosecrans, with 45,000 men, finally
                    started for Murfreesboro on December 29. In the early dawn of December 31, Bragg, commanding 37,000
                    effectives, almost pulverized him with a heavy strike on the Union right, doubling back the blue
                    line but failing to drive Rosecrans completely from the frozen field. Characteristically, Bragg did
                    not follow up his great victory with another blow the following day.</p>
            <p>Strangely, on January 2, with the northern army somewhat rested, Bragg sent 4,500 men across open
                    field against Union lines positioned on an elevated ridge. Initial success against the Union
                    infantry proved fruitless, however, when the attacking force was practically torn apart by a
                    punishing artillery <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-077-3-100"/> bombardment from across the river. Bragg
                    was thus forced to retreat southward again. Though suffering heavy casualties, the Union could claim
                    a great victory at a time when the fortunes of war were ebbing, and most of middle <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> was closed forever to reoccupation by the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>Though McDonough raises some interesting questions about what went wrong with the Confederates at
                    Stones River, he provides few answers, a small weakness of the study, though not an unexpected one
                    considering the 118 years since the battle was fought. McDonough asks a number of questions. Why was
                    a 7,500-man Confederate division detached from Bragg's army and sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="msu">Mississippi</region>
                    </placeName> on the eve of the battle? Would the presence of the division have made any difference
                    in the outcome? Why did Bragg permit Rosecrans on January 1 to regain a strategic hill overlooking
                    Confederate lines, then, abruptly, the next day try to regain it with heavy losses? So go the
                    unanswered queries which will fascinate Civil War buffs in years to come.</p>
            <p>The author quotes extensively from personal diaries, recollections, and regimental histories to give
                    the reader an "on the scene" picture of the battle and its terrible consequences.
                    Some of this material is quite effective, though portions of it at times interfere with the orderly
                    flow of the text. The author's occasional reliance on secondary sources when original
                    material is readily available detracts from the credit given his own thought and effort. For
                    example, William C. Davis's shallow study, <hi rend="i">Breckenridge: Statesman, Soldier,
                        Symbol</hi> (1974), is utilized much too frequently.</p>
            <p>Indiana was well represented with at least forty-five infantry, cavalry, and artillery units present.
                    Among those participating were Captain Eli Lilly, who would found the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical
                    Company in 1876; Colonel Abel D. Streight, who would lead a daring raid across north <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName> five months later; and Colonel Benjamin Harrison, who would become president of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Considering the magnitude of the battle, and its implications to the future course of the war, it is
                    surprising that McDonough's work is its first documented account since the early 1900s. His
                    serious, perceptive study, following his earlier impressive work on <placeName>

                    Stratton, to complete her task.</p>
            <p>Stratton has organized her material topically. The chapters include discussions of the westward
                    journey; problems of pioneer settlement; daily life; battles against Indians, prairie fires, and the
                    elements; family and community social activities; childhood experiences; schools, education, and
                    teachers; religious institutions; town as well as rural life; cowboys; immigrants; antislavery
                    campaigns and the Civil War; temperance; and suffrage. Stratton provides a continuity throughout the
                    volume by placing the reminiscences into a historical as well as topical framework and identifying
                    important people and events mentioned in or closely connected to the main themes of the narrative.</p>
            <p>Stratton's methodology, although aesthetically pleasing, is historically frustrating.
                    Reminiscences should be always subject to close scrutiny, but the materials in Stratton's
                    book pose special problems. The memoirs are divided among the various chapters so that it is
                    impossible to gain a sense of any one woman's experiences or the reliability of an
                    individual account. The majority of the reminiscences came from relatives or friends rather than the
                    women themselves, and some accounts are third-or even fourth-hand. Moreover, the women confined
                    themselves to subjects they considered "appropriate for publication" (p. 25), and
                    they may often have added subjects they believed should be in a pioneer reminiscence (such as a
                    grasshopper plague, Indian raid, or prairie fire) whether or not they directly experienced such
                    events. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>'s collection included only reminiscences of middle-class, literate,
                    Protestant, white women and a small number of European immigrants. Black and Indian women were not
                    included, nor were working women, barmaids, or prostitutes.</p>

            <p>This volume by Professor William Graebner has nothing to do with the joys and problems of people
                    living in retirement, nor does the author endeavor to review fully retirement legislation of the
                    past. Rather the book is an orderly survey of the relationship of retirement to unemployment and the
                    development of social security during the past century of a changing American capitalism. The
                    problem of retirement for an aging population became more difficult as the rural America of the
                    midnineteenth century gradually shifted to the urban industrial economy of the twentieth century.
                    Retirement on the family farm or to the nearby village was one thing—retiring to a big
                    city tenement was far different.</p>
            <p>Early in the present century a definite discrimination against the older worker began to appear. The
                    shorter work day, the use of new expensive complex machinery, and an increased emphasis upon greater
                    productivity often seemed to bring grief to the older worker. Herbert Hoover's Committee on
                    Recent Economic Changes found that the new job climate placed a premium upon the vigor of youth. The
                    author presents three case studies covering early efforts in the twentieth century to obtain
                    improved retirement programs in federal civil service, education, and industry.</p>
            <p>A major change appeared during the Great Depression with the passage of the Social Security Act in
                    1935. Most historians agree with Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., who held that the new welfare
                    legislation "began a new phase of national history" (p. 181). The 1935 act clearly
                    helped relieve unemployment by encouraging the earlier retirement of older workers, and it also
                    contributed to the ease of Franklin D. <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-077-3-103"/> Roosevelt's
                    reelection in 1936. Graebner sees the twenty years after World War II as the "triumph of
                    retirement." In those years many private pension plans were established to supplement the
                    minimum support levels provided by Social Security. There developed a general feeling that
                    retirement was an appropriate reward for a lifetime of work.</p>
            <p>By the 1970s, however, a serious reconsideration of retirement was underway. New programs of coverage
                    added to the original Social Security Act plus the ravages of inflation made the current and
                    projected costs of the program far exceed the highest cost estimates made during the 1930s. By the
                    1970s many state and municipal governments found that their retirement programs were seriously
                    underfunded. Mandatory retirement became a dirty word to many older Americans, who sought the same
                    kind of antidiscrimination legislation which earlier had helped liberate blacks and women. Victory
                    for this point of view came in the spring of 1978 with the passage of federal legislation that
                    raised the mandatory age of retirement from sixty-five to seventy both for public and private
                    employment.</p>
            <p>Graebner's history of retirement is a tightly reasoned study of the changing views on
                    retirement and aging during the last century. Sound in scholarship, the work is fully documented and
                    based upon primary sources, records, and periodicals of labor unions and federal agencies. <hi rend="i">A History of Retirement</hi> makes an important contribution in a field of great
                    topical interest and should be of particular value to social and economic historians.</p>

            <p>The many prehistoric mounds, geometric enclosures, and earthwork complexes in the eastern <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> have been major foci for archaeological research for more than 150 years. This book,
                    perhaps at variance with what might be inferred from the title, is concerned with such earthwork
                    features and has as a major objective the creation of a greater appreciation of their significance
                    and the cultural attainment that they represent.</p>
            <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-077-3-104"/>
            <p>Of the more than four hundred sites studied eighty-two were selected for inclusion in the volume.
                    Selection was stated to have been determined by the adequacy of current information and the desire
                    for temporal and geographic representation. Each site is documented by a short statement emphasizing
                    its salient locational, cultural, and physical features and maps and isometric drawings that depict
                    the earthworks and intrasite spatial relationships. The text organization is broadly chronological
                    by geographic area, and most of the eastern states are represented. There is also a brief outline of
                    the cultural history of the region. The author is an architect and provides an overview of the site
                    data from his professional perspective.</p>
            <p>Two well-known Indiana sites are included: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> earthwork group (pp. 32–33) and Angel Mounds State Memorial (pp.
                    58–60). The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Castle</settlement>
                    </placeName> map is with one exception a simplified version of that originally published by Eli
                    Lilly (<hi rend="i">Prehistoric Antiquities of Indiana</hi>, 1937, p. 71). The drawings for Angel
                    Mounds are in some ways more a work of art than an accurate representation of site features. For
                    example, contrary to all existing evidence, the town is depicted as being situated on an island; the
                    island that presently fronts the site has been eliminated. The main plaza definition is more than
                    ten times its actual size, and comparable functional areas are indicated where they could not have
                    existed. In addition a segment of the stockade is not included, and the structural relationship of
                    the conical offset to the largest mound is misrepresented.</p>
            <p>Though one would have hoped for more accuracy on this and other maps, the book does provide a useful
                    popular introduction to prehistoric earth structures in the eastern <placeName>

                    $15.95.) This large book surveys the history of small towns from colonial New <placeName>

                    America. Indiana readers will doubtless be especially interested in the author's several
                    chapters on the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, when the small town reached its
                    apotheosis in the Midwest. As have other authors, Richard Lingeman makes extensive use of literary
                    sources, including the work of Meredith Nicholson, Booth Tarkington, Sherwood Anderson, and Sinclair
                    Lewis. Some other kinds of sources are less ably handled, but this history provides a good
                    introduction to a most important subject. <hi rend="i">James H. Madison, Indiana University, <placeName>
