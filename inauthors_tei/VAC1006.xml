				<p>What land under the skies has that perfect abandon of beauty and wonder and variety of
					scenery that America possesses? The home of my forebears-the long-ago called Mona, the
					Isle of Beauty. And knowing the Isle of Man happily well, and knowing America--the
					Republic --happily well, I call America, Mona, the Land of Prevailing Beauty.</p>
				<p>I have worn foot-paths through much of this beloved America, desert, mountain, lake
					region, far-goings of far streams and fair, plunge of cataract, torture of canyons born
					when the world was in travail, prairies leaning from the winds, supreme forests where
					night slumbered softly at high noon, gentle forests where the asters glowed along the edge
					and strange blue flowers sprung unawares through the swaying shadows of the woods--all
					these wheres are footprints of mine. Upon long mountains tired of the earth, along their
					aspiring peaks which watch the eastern horizon to take on their shining foreheads the
					muezzin call, "The day is come", there are my foot-prints.</p>
				<p>America, dear land of loveliness, I love thee well! My heart roams thy unaccustomed
					wastes what time my feet are fettered to many tasks. I exult in thee as the eagle exults
					in the toppling mountain crag.</p>
				<p>"Where rolls the Oregon!" That phrase had alway to my ears Miltonic music. It gave the
					sense of distance, of urgency irresistible, and of mountain origin. From that melodious
					poet-phrase I think Oregon has been to me a land of wonder, of awaking poetry, though I
					knew not the land and scenes; and since, I have trodden many of its valleys and mountains,
					and have camped on its cascade <pb id="VAC1006-031" n="30"/> summits pinnacled with pine,
					and have watched for days the ever shifting, never-tiring coigne of vantage and beauty of
					meadow-silence and river-music and mountain- solace.</p>
				<p>I remember so vividly the golden day I first came to Ashland. On one side, a wide valley,
					and great summer meadows smelling like hay in harvest-time, and on its other side, a
					nearby-mountain shadow,--an invitation, and stream at song. The mountain and the stream
					and the long winding ravine receding upward called me, "When are you coming?", and my glad
					feet answered, "Now", and my heart said to my feet, "Hurry up and on".</p>
				<p>Up and on where the mountain led whose shadows held the stream-sources in their cool
					hiding places, and the mountain now and then would flash a look upon me vigilantly and
					then vanish as it were a coquette woman- mountain. Ah, but that day was sweet to my heart,
					and all these years increasingly sweet to my memory.</p>
				<p>And now comes a man of affairs, a reformer, and as far wandering a traveler, who has
					spoken at this mountain's foot, and who has listened to this mountain's stream a-
					murmuring in its wanderings to the sunlight and subdued shadow, and the mountain has
					clambered into his heart, and the stream is found winding away across the meadow of his
					dream.</p>
				<p>May he make them fling shadows and music through mystic years across the dreams of the
					lovers of loveliness who are yet to be.</p>

				<p>God's out-of-doors! How I love it! The trees, the mountains and the sea! They possess the
					very soul of me--the majesty, the glory and the sublimity of them all.</p>
				<p>The beauty, the silence and the far-zoned splendor of the night; the effulgence of the
					full-orbed day; the still, enchanting tenderness of the twilight--these are wonders
					anywhere, but seen and experienced among the Siskiyous they transcend description, lift me
					out of myself, and link me with the Infinite.</p>
				<p>Here is the story of such a day, such a twilight, such a night, and such a morning--a day
					and a night in the Siskiyous!</p>
				<p>If in the following pages I have conveyed even a little of what I saw and felt, there is
					justification for this book. It has been written in the midst of a busy life, through a
					period of four years, as the mood would seize me, in hotels, in railroad trains and in the
					still small hours. I am conscious of its imperfections, but its writing has beem a joy,
					and I give it to the public with the hope that others may catch at least a glimpse of what
					I saw, and share with me the exaltation and the rapture of an elate and Godful hour.</p>
				<p>The photographs for the illustrations were not taken by me. For these I am indebted above
					all others to Mr. Homer Billings, who was my companion on the trip up Ashland Way to
					Ashland Mountain, and who, with Mr. L. W. Marble, both of Ashland, made two trips to
					obtain for me the necessary views. Their work was largely a labor of love and of
					friendship.</p>
				<p>Other illustrations were furnished by Mr. F. L. Camps, of Ashland ; by Mr. C. R. Miller,
					of Klamath Falls; the Commercial Club of Ashland, and the Commercial Club of Medford. The
					illustration of the "hidden far-away falls" <pb id="VAC1006-041" n="38"/> was furnished by
					the Commercial Club of Medford, and is a photograph of a waterfall near that city, and is
					not found on Ashland Way.</p>
				<p>"A Bank of White Heather" is by Mr. Asahel Curtis, of Seattle, Wash. ; "Lupines" is the
					work of Mr. Herbert W. Gleason, of Boston, Mass.; "Mountain Pine" was furnished by Miss
					Elizabeth S. Curtis, of Seattle, Wash. These three are from Mr. John H. Williams' book,
					"The Mountain That Was God."</p>
				<p>"A Wind-Buffeted Sentinel" is by Mrs. H. A. Towne, of Harvard, Illinois, and is from a
					scene on Mt. Tacoma. The plates for the multi-colored illustrations were made by the
					Stafford Engraving Company, of Indianapolis, Indiana. Their excellence is due to the care
					and skill of Mr. E. E. Stafford.</p>
				<p>The book itself is done by the Art Press, of Indianapolis, Indiana, to the President of
					which, Mr. Ray D. Barnes, I am under special obligation for many helpful suggestions.</p>
				<p>The introduction is by Bishop William A. Quayle, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, poet,
					orator and churchman, who himself has taken much of the same journey and who in a peculiar
					sense is a child of the out-of-doors.</p>
				<p>I would not be just if I were to omit from this foreword, recognition of my obligation to
					my Secretary, Miss Hallie McNeil, whose thoughtful, discriminating care in the preparation
					of the text and in the selection of the quotations used has been constant and
					unremitting.</p>
				<p>To all of these friends I make grateful acknowledgment.</p>

					<p>Ashland is a city beautiful, built two thousand feet above the level of the sea--</p>
					<p>A jewel set in the bosom of an enchanted valley, surrounded by the encircling peaks of
						the Siskiyous and the protecting parapets of the Cascades, in the midst of all but
						endless summer, in sight of eternal snows--</p>
					<p>An aquarelle of contentment, river-bordered, mountain- framed, lighted by perennial
						sunshine--</p>
					<p>A prodigal dowered with an unspendable portion-a perpetual, recurring heritage of
						flowers and fruits and grains--</p>
					<p>A siren, sentient with charm and lure; held in the sensuous arms of enamoring,
						desire-fulfilling hills; coaxed into forgetfulness by soft, consoling winds, sweet and
						lingering as the memory of a cradle-lullaby, and canopied by skies, chaste and tender as
						a maiden's soul.</p>
					<p>I knew her fewer than an hundred hours. But in that brief while she broke down every
						barrier time had set about my heart; woke my somnolent soul; called dead affection back
						to life, and taught me how to love, again.</p>
					<p>I cannot forget her, and if I could, I would not. The witchery of her form and the
						charm and color of her setting haunt me. I have thought of her until the memory of her
						is entwined with every vital fiber of my better self.</p>
					<p>The knowing of her has so sensitized my mind and enriched and intensified my

						Creek, and hear the romantic tales its garrulous waters tell.</p>

					<p>From the city's street, stretching between the sinuous windings of Ashland Creek and
						the weather-pitted cliffs that mark the tortuous limits of Ashland Canyon, lies Ashland
						Way--a road of dreams, of wonder-wildness, quiet grandeur and multitudinous delights.
						Crossing and re-crossing the turbulent Creek again and again; winding in and out through
						forest temples reared in faith, not fear, and brooding, dateless woods; across tender
						valleys and brook-lulled meadows; beneath sentinel pines and solemn hemlocks; through
						fir-dark solitudes; along floral terraces and powdery slopes; up rugged steeps, under
						Italian skies; it contracts finally into a narrow, shadowy trail and loses itself at
						last among the peaks and snows of Ashland Mountain.</p>
					<p>Its length from city-gate to mountain-peak is fifteen miles and every step a
						revelation. Halfway between the noontide and the end of a matchless day in mid-July,
						we-- my new-found friend and I--left the city and faced the calm-fronted hills and the
						far-blue bulwarks of the moun- tains. Passing through the outlying-sections of the town,
						with their segregated houses, luxurious gardens, and fruit- ladened orchards; along the
						Creek beyond the Over- Hanging Rock and the Pumping Station of the Water Plant; we were
						soon in the midst of a primal solitude, hemmed in on either side by vertical,

					<p>To the brink of the walls, along the horizon's azure- tinctured rim, clung attenuated

						soft as eider-down, wandering in aimless journeyings toward shoreless, illimitable
						seas.</p>

					<p>With the burial of the Sovereign of Time and Light there came a soul-enchanting change.
						In the West the world was shut with a golden bar; its portals, closed with portieres of
						clouds; its altars, set about with filigrees of gold and veiled with curtains of rose
						and of pearl, fibered with shades of orange and intermingled with yellow, red and brown.
						In the zenith twin beams, delicate and fragile, met and kissed and embraced and
						dissolved, consumed by the rapture of their own passion. Here and there a few lights
						still lingered, "dim, hovering on the skirts of space". The brilliancies changed to
						palors touching sky and cloud with soft and tender hues. The splendors melted into
						dissolving, expiring fires; the ebbing rays, into chastened afterglows, clinging with
						trembling, attenuated tendrils to vanishing coronals of air.</p>
					<p>About the fir-purpled slopes gathered omens of oblivion. The hills were sepulchers of
						dying splendors. The mountain-peaks, late wrapped in rose and pink, and hued with
						crimson, were shadow-edged, compassed by mystery and solitude, and haunted with strange,
						vague forms. The twilight slowly robbed the clouds of glory. The sky became a bloomy
						purple, broken here and there with patches of blended peace and flame, darkening near
						the horizon into a velvety pall. Other preludes of the night were not wanting. And yet
						there hung over and about everything-- mountain, sky and cloud--a fine serenity, a
						tranquilizing glory, like the benignity of Omniscience.</p>
					<p>There was a holy hush. The forest's hymn was staid. <q rend="blockquote center">
							<p rend="i">Everything seems to settle in conscious repose. The winds breathe gently

						</q> The light, subdued and soft. A serene and utter peace had fallen-a silence touched
						with tenderness--unbroken save by bird-call and water-fall, and they, half-hushed and
						prayerful. The very atmosphere was hallowed; the winds, quieting. A fragment of God's
						changeless calm enveloped all--the pause that comes between the day and night, an hour
						of equal kin to both; a segment filled with mystery-spells and hints of wondrous,
						unguessed things; a moment of worship and of adoration, of worship deep and sweet as
						silence, of adoration profound and reverent as unsaid prayer--when silence speaks to
						silence, and the heart of things and of men beats in rhythm with the heart of the
						Infinite--the one sweet moment in which man is pure enough to be God's medium and in
						which it is easy to be clean of soul; a cup filled with peace and inspiration, pressed
						in mercy to man's dry lips.</p>
					<p>We stood bedreamed, yet acutely conscious, our souls answering to the vibrations of the
						hour and scene as from a touch divine.</p>
					<p>But an hour like that could not abide. The day was already done. The night was come.
						Its falling shadows broke the spell. We had lived a glorious, soul-filled day.
						Throughout its every hour Nature's wondrous voices had held for us "a varied language",
						and we had heard and almost understood. Depth, heighth, space, color, mystery and calm
						had wrought in us their will.</p>

					<p>Before the twilight could deepen into night, the moon --changeful nurseling of our
						little, space-flung world-- swung out of the eastern mountains and assumed dominion.</p>
					<p>We made a bed beneath the pines, of fir and hemlock boughs, and stretched ourselves to
						rest and dreams. Immediately about and surrounding us the gloom intensified until it
						became obscure, preternatural and mys- terious, filled with whimsical, fantastic forms
						and peopled with ludicrous, misshapen, distorted apparitions. But outside our immediate
						environment beyond the trees the light fell, soft and meditative, and along the forest's
						edge phantom shadows and quivering moonbeams met and mingled, danced hand in hand, and
						leaped and romped together.</p>
					<p>In the ravines below, the congregating waters, fresh from the melted snows above,
						whispered intermittent and broken confidences of expectant, far-away journey- ings by
						brook and creek and river and sea and cloud, ere they returned to wrap again in virgin
						white the bosom of the mountains that long had held them; and in the distance the
						moon-dimmed cliffs, like ghostly sentinels, kept silent ward and calm but wakeful
						vigil.</p>

							shining needles, the brown, sturdy trunk grasping an outswelling mossy bank, and a
							fringe of illuminated bushes within a few feet of the tree with the fire- light on the
							tips of the sprays.</p>

					<p>Lulled by the scent of broken fir and hemlock, the sigh of the pines and the tongueless
						tattle of journeying waters, we fell asleep, and slept until the moon had climbed and
						passed the zenith of its course and hung midway in the upper arc of the western sky.
						Then we awoke, arose and girded ourselves, and begun the final ascent of the mountain.
						Our goal was the crest of its loftiest pinnacle, that we might from thence behold the
						miracle of the making of a morning and see the glory of a Siskiyou sunrise.</p>
					<p>At times the way was shadowy and indistinct, and the ascent so steep that the exertion
						of climbing took our breath; our trembling knees refused our weight and we fell and lay
						prone upon the mountainside until breath and strength returned; then we clambered
						on.</p>
					<p>At other times we walked almost erect, up easy ascents and over comparatively level
						stretches, picking our way among rocks and boulders and between gnarled and stunted
						firs, crooked and bent by mountain winds and the weight of winter snows.</p>
					<p>My companion, younger and lither of form, and more accustomed to mountain climbing,

					<p>Another short but clambering climb and we stood among the cliffs and pinnacles of the
						summit. We were none too soon, for the moon, even as we attained them, was surrendering
						to the night. Its empery was over. Its sovereignty, gone. The far-away peaks of the
						distant Coast Range, were reaching their arms, impatient to give it sepulcher. For a
						moment it hung above them, a molten, suspended disc, reluctant, but regal; then suddenly
						dropped into their bosom-gone in an instant as if fallen into a grave. Its light paled
						and waned, faded and dissolved, absorbed by the deepening shadows, eaten by the
						blackness of the night.</p>
					<p>Things grew strange and indistinct. The crags became apparitions. The mountains
						disappeared. The ranges were lost in oblivion; wrapped in the darkness and solitude of
						an isolation deep and weird; enveloped in a silence absolute and profound, vast and
						abysmal. There was no sound; no cry of bird; or murmur of insect; no sigh of pine or
						fir. The wind itself was motionless, its breath hushed in lonesomeness, stayed by dread.
						The darkness chilled. The isolation oppressed. The silence hurt. But only for a moment.
						The miracle of morning was at hand. We were entangled only in the remnant of the
						night.</p>

					<p>Its triumph, though black and intense, was brief. It could not hold the citadels it had
						captured. The soldiers of the dawn were already marshaling and soon would be marching to
						the rescue. As yet they could neither be seen nor heard. But there was a prescience in
						the air, a telepathy that our souls could not misinterpret. The news, though impalpable
						and intangible, was too good to be suppressed. The birds sensed it and told the secret

						open. Across them still were bolts and rods and bars--bolts of burnished steel, rods of
						hammered brass and bars of turquoise and of gold--keeping the imprisoned glories back,
						staying the virgin-footed, silent-sandaled morning until the King should come.</p>
					<p>There was, however, no delay. For no sovereign ever measured time with the accuracy of

					<p>There, seventy miles away, towered Shasta, granite- founded, glacier-ploughed,
						summit-lifted--cloud wrapped, mist-mantled, snow-crested Shasta--shouldering out the
						sky; gleaming above the clouds in primal grandeur; an island in a sapphire sea; a
						far-flung, space-throned wonder, panoplied in glory.</p>
					<p>For a moment it seemed a sculptured vision; an Himalaya of the air; a luminous,
						majestic fantasy; an apparition woven of the morning's purple bloom and changing
						tides;--then, a living entity, palpable and real; a creature vast and superlative; a
						goddess of the sky, clad in folds of shimmering light, veiled in filmy, airy nothings,
						attended by troupes of courtesying, dancing phantoms whimsical as dreams.</p>
					<p>An instant later, breaking through the thinned and tattered lilac films, it stood
						exposed in natal nakedness, disrobed of shadows, limned in the crystal air, clear-cut
						and vivid; girth, aflame with crunes of rubies and crumbling avalanches of gold;
						shoulders, scintillant with amethysts and with diamonds; breasts, lustrous and
						irridescent with mother-of-pearls and with opals; brow, resplendent with white-crowned
						magnificence; presence, regal with the solemnity of isolation, sublime with the
						sovereignty of silence.</p>
