                    <p>Four years at Wellesley; two years about equally divided among Paris, Dresden
                        and Florence. And now Jane Hastings was at home again. At home in the
                        unchanged housespacious, old-fashionedlooking down from its steeply sloping
                        lawns and terraced gardens upon the sooty, smoky activities of Remsen City,
                        looking out upon a charming panorama of hills and valleys in the heart of
                        South Central Indiana. Six years of striving in the East and abroad to
                        satisfy the restless energy she inherited from her father; and here she was,
                        as restless as everyet with everything done that a woman could do in the way
                        of an active career. She looked back upon her years of elaborate
                        preparation; she looked forward uponnothing. That is, nothing but
                        marriagedropping her name, dropping her personality, disappearing in the
                        personality of another. She had never seen a man for whom she would make
                        such a sacrifice; she did not believe that such a man existed.</p>
                    <p>She meditated bitterly upon that cruel arrangement of Nature&apos;s
                        whereby the father transmits his vigorous <pb id="VAA2368-006" n="2"/>
                        qualities in twofold measure to the daughter, not in order that she may be a
                        somebody, but solely in order that she may transmit them to sons.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot; she decided.
                        &quot;There&apos;s something for <hi rend="i">me</hi> to
                        do.&quot; But what? She gazed down at Remsen City, connected by
                        factories and pierced from east, west and south by railways. She gazed out
                        over the fields and woods. Yes, there must be something for her besides
                        merely marrying and breedingjust as much for her as for a man. But what? If
                        she should marry a man who would let her rule him, she would despise him. If
                        she should marry a man she could respecta man who was of the master class
                        like her fatherhow she would hate him for ignoring her and putting her in
                        her ordained inferior feminine place. She glanced down at her skirts with an
                        angry sense of enforced masquerade. And then she laughedfor she had a keen
                        sense of humor that always came to her rescue when she was in danger of
                        taking herself too seriously.</p>
                    <p>Through the foliage between her and the last of the stretches of highroad
                        winding up from Remsen City she spied a man climbing in her directiona long,
                        slim figure in cap, Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers. Instantlyand long
                        before he saw herthere was a grotesque whisking out of sight of the serious
                        personality upon which we have been intruding. In its stead there stood
                        ready to receive the young man a woman of the type that possesses physical
                        charm and knows <pb id="VAA2368-007" n="3"/> how to use itand does not
                        scruple to use it. For a woman to conquer man by physical charm is far and
                        away the easiest, the most fleeting and the emptiest of victories. But for
                        woman thus to conquer without herself yielding anything whatsoever, even so
                        little as an alluring glance of the eyethat is quite another matter. It was
                        this sort of conquest that Jane Hastings delighted inand sought to gain with
                        any man who came within range. If the men had known what she was about, they
                        would have denounced her conduct as contemptible and herself as immoral,
                        even brazen. But in their innocence they accused only their sophisticated
                        and superbly masculine selves and regarded her as the soul of innocence.
                        This was the more absurd in them because she obviously excelled in the
                        feminine art of inviting display of charm. To glance at her was to realize
                        at once the beauty of her figure, the exceeding grace of her long back and
                        waist. A keen observer would have seen the mockery lurking in her
                        light-brown eyes, and about the corners of her full red lips. She arranged
                        her thick dark hair to make a secret, half-revealed charm of her fascinating
                        pink ears and to reveal in dazzling unexpectedness the soft, round whiteness
                        of the nape of her neck.</p>
                    <p>Because you are thus let into Miss Hastings&apos; naughty secret, so well
                        veiled behind an air of earnest and almost cold dignity, you must not do her
                        the injustice of thinking her unusually artful. Such artfulness is common
                        enough; it secures husbands by the thousand and <pb id="VAA2368-008" n="4"/>
                        by the tens of thousands. No, only in the skill of artfulness was Miss
                        Hastings unusual.</p>
                    <p>As the long strides of the tall, slender man brought him rapidly nearer, his
                        face came into plain view. A refined, handsome face, dark and serious. He
                        had dark-brown eyesand Miss Hastings did not like brown eyes in a man. She
                        thought that men should have gray or blue or greenish eyes, and if they were
                        cruel in their love of power she liked it the better.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Dave,&quot; she cried in a pleasant, friendly voice. She
                        was posedin the most unconscious of attitudesupon a rustic bench so that her
                        extraordinary figure was revealed at its most attractive.</p>
                    <p>The young man halted before her, his breath coming quicklynot altogether from
                        the exertion of his steep and rapid climb. &quot;Jen, I&apos;m mad
                        about you,&quot; he said, his brown eyes soft and luminous with passion.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve done nothing but think about you in the week
                        you&apos;ve been back. I didn&apos;t sleep last night, and
                        I&apos;ve come up here as early as I dared to tell youto ask you to
                        marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not see the triumph she felt, the joy in having subdued another of
                        these insolently superior males. Her eyes were discreetly veiled; her
                        delightful mouth was arranged to express sadness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought I was an ambition incarnate,&quot; continued the
                        young man, unwittingly adding to her delight by detailing how brilliant her
                        conquest was. &quot;I&apos;ve never cared a rap about womenuntil I
                        saw you. I was all <pb id="VAA2368-009" n="5"/> for politicsfor trying to do
                        something to make my fellow men the better for my having lived.
                        Nowit&apos;s all gone. I want you, Jen. Nothing else matters.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As he paused, gazing at her in speechless longing, she lifted her eyessimply
                        a glance. With a stifled cry he darted forward, dropped beside her on the
                        bench and tried to enfold her in his arms. The veins stood out in his
                        forehead; the expression of his eyes was terrifying.</p>
                    <p>She shrank, sprang up. His baffled hands had not even touched her.
                        &quot;David Hull!&quot; she cried, and the indignation and the
                        repulsion in her tone and in her manner were not simulated, though her
                        artfulness hastened to make real use of them. She loved to rouse men to
                        frenzy. She knew that the sight of their frenzy would chill herwould fill
                        her with an emotion that would enable her to remain mistress of the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>At sight of her aversion his eyes sank. &quot;Forgive me,&quot; he
                        muttered. &quot;You make me<hi rend="i">crazy.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;I!&quot; she cried, laughing in angry derision. &quot;What
                        have I ever done to encourage you to beimpertinent?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; he admitted. &quot;That is, nothing but just
                        being yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t help that, can I?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, adding doggedly: &quot;But neither can
                        men help going crazy about you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him sitting there at once penitent and impenitent; and her mind
                        went back to the thoughts <pb id="VAA2368-010" n="6"/> that had engaged it
                        before he came into view. Marriageto marry one of these men, with their
                        coarse physical ideas of women, with their pitiful weakness before an
                        emotion that seemed to her to have no charm whatever. And these were the
                        creatures who ruled the world and compelled women to be their playthings and
                        mere appendages! Wellno doubt it was the women&apos;s own fault, for
                        were they not a poor, spiritless lot, trembling with fright lest they should
                        not find a man to lean on and then, having found the man, settling down into
                        fat and stupid vacuity or playing the cat at the silly game of social
                        position? But not Jane Hastings! Her bosom heaved and her eyes blazed scorn
                        as she looked at this person who had dared think the touch of his coarse
                        hands would be welcome. Welcome!</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I have been thinking what a delightful friendship ours
                        was,&quot; said she, disgustedly. &quot;And all the time, your talk
                        about your ambitionthe speeches you were going to makethe offices you were
                        going to holdthe good you were going to do in purifying politicsit was all a
                        blind!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All a blind,&quot; admitted he. &quot;From the first night
                        that you came to our house to dinnerJen, I&apos;ll never forget that
                        dress you woreor the way you looked in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Jane had thought extremely well of that toilet herself. She had heard
                        how impervious this David Hull, the best catch in the town, was to feminine
                        charm; and she had gone prepared to give battle. But she said <pb
                            id="VAA2368-011" n="7"/> dejectedly, &quot;You don&apos;t know
                        what a shock you&apos;ve given me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; cried he. &quot;I&apos;m ashamed of
                        myself. ButI love you, Jen! Can&apos;t you learn to love me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t even thought of you in that way,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;I haven&apos;t bothered my head about marriage. Of
                        course, most girls have to think about it, because they must get some one to
                        support them&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish to God you were one of that sort,&quot; interrupted he.
                        &quot;Then I could have some hope.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hope of what,&quot; said she disdainfully. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t mean that you&apos;d marry a girl who was marrying you
                        because she had to have food, clothing and shelter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d marry the woman I loved. ThenI&apos;d <hi rend="i"
                            >make</hi> her love me. She simply couldn&apos;t help it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane Hastings shuddered. &quot;Thank heaven, I don&apos;t have to
                        marry!&quot; Her eyes flashed. &quot;But I wouldn&apos;t, even
                        if I were poor. I&apos;d rather go to work. Why shouldn&apos;t a
                        woman work, anyhow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At what?&quot; inquired Hull. &quot;Except the men who do
                        manual labor, there are precious few men who can make a living honestly and
                        self-respectingly. It&apos;s fortunate the women can hold aloof and
                        remain pure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed unpleasantly. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure that the women
                        who live with men just for shelter are pure,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jen,&quot; the young man burst out, &quot;you&apos;re
                        ambitiousaren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-012" n="8"/>
                    <p>&quot;And you like the sort of thing I&apos;m trying to dolike it and
                        approve of it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe a man ought to succeedget to the top.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do Iif he can do it honorably.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane hesitateddared. &quot;To be quite frank,&quot; said she,
                        &quot;I worship success and I despise failure. Success means strength.
                        Failure means weaknessand I abominate weakness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked quietly disapproving. &quot;You don&apos;t mean that. You
                        don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re saying.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfectly,&quot; she assured him. &quot;I&apos;m not a
                        bit good. Education has taken all the namby-pamby nonsense out of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he was not really hearing; besides, what had women to do with the
                        realities of life? They were made to be the property of menthat was the
                        truth, though he would never have confessed it to any woman. They were made
                        to be possessed. &quot;And I must possess this woman,&quot; he
                        thought, his blood running hot. He said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not help me to make a career? I can do it, Jen, with you to
                        help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had thought of this beforeof making a career for herself, of doing the
                        &quot;something&quot; her intense energy craved, through a man. The
                        &quot;something&quot; must be big if it were to satisfy her; and
                        what that was big could a woman do except through a man? Butthis man. Her
                        eyes turned thoughtfully upon hima look that encouraged him to go on: <pb
                            id="VAA2368-013" n="9"/> &quot;Politics interest you, Jen.
                        I&apos;ve seen that in the way you listen and in the questions you
                        ask.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiledbut not at the surface. In fact, his political talk had bored her.
                        She knew nothing about the subject, and, so, had been as one listening to an
                        unknown language. But, like all women, having only the narrowest range of
                        interests herself and the things that would enable her to show off to
                        advantage, she was used to being bored by the conversational efforts of men
                        and to concealing her boredom. She had listened patiently and had led the
                        conversation by slow, imperceptible stages round to the interesting
                        personalto the struggle for dominion over this difficult male.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow,&quot; he went on, &quot;no intelligent person could
                        fail to be interested in politics, once he or she appreciated what it meant.
                        And people of our class owe it to society to take part in politics. Victor
                        Dorn is a crank, but he&apos;s right about some thingsand he&apos;s
                        right in saying that we of the upper class are parasites upon the masses.
                        They earn all the wealth, and we take a large part of it away from them. And
                        it&apos;s plain stealing unless we give some service in return. For
                        instance, you and Iwhat have we done, what are we doing that entitles us to
                        draw so much? Somebody must earn by hard labor all that is produced. We are
                        not earning. So&quot;he was looking handsome now in his manly
                        earnestness&quot;Jen, it&apos;s up to us to do our shareto stop
                        stealingisn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-014" n="10"/>
                    <p>She was genuinely interested. &quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of these
                        things,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dorn says we ought to go to work like laborers,&quot;
                        pursued David. &quot;But that&apos;s where he&apos;s a crank.
                        The truth is, we ought to give the service of leadershipespecially in
                        politics. And I&apos;m going to do it, Jane Hastings!&quot;</p>
                    <p>For the first time she had an interest in him other than that of conquest.
                        &quot;Just what are you going to do?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not upset everything and tear everything to pieces, as Victor Dorn
                        wants to do,&quot; replied he. &quot;But reform the abuses and
                        wrongsmake it so that every one shall have a fair chancemake politics
                        straight and honest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This sounded hazy to her. &quot;And what will <hi rend="i">you</hi> get
                        out of it?&quot; asked she.</p>
                    <p>He colored and was a little uneasy as he thus faced a direct demand for his
                        innermost secretthe secret of selfishness he tried to hide even from
                        himself. But there was no evading; if he would interest her he must show her
                        the practical advantages of his proposal. &quot;If I&apos;m to do
                        any good,&quot; said he, putting the best face, and really not a bad
                        face, upon a difficult and delicate matter&quot;if I&apos;m to do
                        any good I must win a commanding positionmust get to be a popular leadermust
                        hold high officesandandall that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said she. &quot;That sounds attractive.
                        Yes, David, you ought to make a career. If I were a man that&apos;s the
                        career I&apos;d choose.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-015" n="11"/>
                    <p>&quot;You can choose it, though you&apos;re a woman,&quot;
                        rejoined he. &quot;Marry me, and we&apos;ll go up together.
                        You&apos;ve no idea how exciting campaigns and elections are. A little
                        while, and you&apos;ll be crazy about it all. The women are taking part,
                        more and more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s Victor Dorn?&quot; she suddenly asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must remember him. It was his father that was killed by the
                        railway the day we all went on that excursion to Indianapolis.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorn the carpenter,&quot; said Jane. &quot;YesI
                        remember.&quot; Her face grew dreamy with the effort of memory.
                        &quot;I see it all again. And there was a boy with a very white face who
                        knelt and held his head.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was Victor,&quot; said Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI remember him. He was a bad boyalways fighting and robbing
                        orchards and getting kept after school.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he&apos;s still a bad boybut in a different way.
                        He&apos;s out against everything civilized and everybody that&apos;s
                        got money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does he do? Keep a saloon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, but he spends a lot of time at them. I must say for him that he
                        doesn&apos;t drinkand professes not to believe in drink. When I pointed
                        out to him what a bad example he set, loafing round saloons, he laughed at
                        me and said he was spending his spare time exactly as Jesus Christ did.
                        &apos;You&apos;ll find, Davy, old man,&apos; he said,
                        &apos;if you&apos;ll take the trouble to read your Bible, that <pb
                            id="VAA2368-016" n="12"/> Jesus traveled with publicans and sinnersand a
                        publican is in plain English a saloonkeeper.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was very originalwasn&apos;t it?&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;I&apos;m interested in this man. He&apos;sdifferent. I
                        like people who are different.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think you&apos;d like him, Victor
                        Dorn,&quot; said David.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yesin a way. I admire him,&quot; graciously.
                        &quot;He&apos;s really a remarkable fellow, considering his
                        opportunities.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He calls you &apos;Davy, old man,&apos;&quot; suggested
                        Jane.</p>
                    <p>Hull flushed. &quot;That&apos;s his way. He&apos;s free and easy
                        with every one. He thinks conventionality is a joke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And it is,&quot; cried Miss Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d not think so,&quot; laughed Hull, &quot;if
                        he called you Jane or Jenny or my dear Jenny half an hour after he met
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wouldn&apos;t,&quot; said Miss Hastings in a peculiar
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He would if he felt like it,&quot; replied Hull. &quot;And
                        if you resented it, he&apos;d laugh at you and walk away. I suspect him
                        of being a good deal of a poseur and a fakir. All those revolutionary chaps
                        are. But I honestly think that he really doesn&apos;t care a rap for
                        classesor for moneyor for any of the substantial things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He sounds common,&quot; said Miss Hastings.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve lost interest in him.&quot; Then in the same
                        breath: &quot;How does he live? Is he a carpenter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wasfor several years. You see, he and his <pb id="VAA2368-017"
                            n="13"/> mother together brought up the Dorn family after the father was
                        killed. They didn&apos;t get a cent of damages from the railroad. It was
                        an outrage&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But my father was the largest owner of the railroad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull colored violently. &quot;You don&apos;t understand about
                        business, Jen. The railroad is a corporation. It fought the caseand the
                        Dorns had no moneyand the railway owned the judge and bribed several jurors
                        at each trial. Dorn says that was what started him to thinkingto being a
                        revolutionistthough he doesn&apos;t call himself that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think it would!&quot; cried Miss Hastings.
                        &quot;If my father had known&quot; She caught her breath.
                        &quot;But he <hi rend="i">must</hi> have known! He was on the train that
                        day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t understand business, Jen. Your father
                        wouldn&apos;t interfere with the management of the
                        corporation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He makes money out of itdoesn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do we all get money out of corporations that are compelled to do
                        all sorts of queer things. But we can&apos;t abolish the
                        systemwe&apos;ve got to reform it. That&apos;s why I&apos;m in
                        politicsand want you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something must be done about that,&quot; interrupted Jane.
                        &quot;I shall talk to father&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For heaven&apos;s sake, Jen,&quot; cried David in alarm,
                        &quot;don&apos;t tell your father <hi rend="i">I&apos;ve</hi>
                        been stirring you up. He&apos;s one of the powers in politics in this
                        State, and&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-018" n="14"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not give you away, Davy,&quot; said Miss Hastings
                        a little contemptuously. &quot;I want to hear more about this Victor
                        Dorn. I&apos;ll get that money for him and his mother. Is he very
                        poor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellyou&apos;d call him poor. But he says he has plenty. He
                        runs a small paper. I think he makes about twenty-five dollars a week out of
                        itand a little more out of lecturing. Thenevery once in a while he goes back
                        to his tradeto keep his hand in and enjoy the luxury of earning honest
                        money, as he puts it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How queer!&quot; exclaimed Miss Hastings. &quot;I would
                        like to meet him. Is hevery ignorant?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nono, indeed. He&apos;s worked his way through collegeand
                        law school afterward. Supported the family all the time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He must be tremendously clever.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve given you an exaggerated idea of him,&quot; Davy
                        hastened to say. &quot;He&apos;s really an ordinary sort of
                        chap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think he&apos;d get rich,&quot; said Miss
                        Hastings. &quot;Most of the men that doso far as I&apos;ve met
                        themseem ordinary enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He says he could get rich, but that he wouldn&apos;t waste time
                        that way. But he&apos;s fond of boasting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t think he could make moneyafter all he didgoing
                        to college and everything?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI guess he could,&quot; reluctantly admitted Davy. Then in a
                        burst of candor: &quot;Perhaps I&apos;m a little jealous <pb
                            id="VAA2368-019" n="15"/> of him. If <hi rend="i">I</hi> were thrown on
                        my own resources, I&apos;m afraid I&apos;d make a pretty wretched
                        showing. Butdon&apos;t get an exaggerated idea of him. The things
                        I&apos;ve told you sound romantic and unusual. If you met himsaw him
                        every dayyou&apos;d realize he&apos;s not at allat least, not
                        muchout of the ordinary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Miss Hastings shrewdly, &quot;perhaps
                        I&apos;m getting a better idea of him than you who see him so
                        often.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you&apos;ll run across him sometime,&quot; said Davy,
                        who was bearing up no better than would the next man under the strain of a
                        woman&apos;s interest in and excitement about another man.
                        &quot;When you do, you&apos;ll get enough in about five minutes. You
                        see, he&apos;s not a gentleman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not sure that I&apos;m wildly crazy about
                            gentlemen<hi rend="i">as</hi> gentlemen,&quot; replied the girl.
                        &quot;Very few of the interesting people I&apos;ve read about in
                        history and biography have been gentlemen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And very few of them would have been pleasant to associate
                        with,&quot; rejoined Hull. &quot;You&apos;ll admire Victor as I
                        do. But you&apos;ll feelas I dothat there&apos;s small excuse for a
                        man who has been educated, who has associated with upper class people,
                        turning round and inciting the lower classes against everything
                        that&apos;s fine and improving.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was now apparent to the girl that David Hull was irritatedly jealous of
                        this queer Victor Dornwas jealous of her interest in him. Her obvious cue
                            <pb id="VAA2368-020" n="16"/> was to fan this flame. In no other way
                        could she get any amusement out of Davy&apos;s society; for his tendency
                        was to be heavily seriousand she wanted no more of the too strenuous love
                        making, yet wanted to keep him &quot;on the string.&quot; This
                        jealousy was just the means for her end. Said she innocently: &quot;If
                        it irritates you, Davy, we won&apos;t talk about him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not at allnot at all,&quot; cried Hull. &quot;I simply
                        thought you&apos;d be getting tired of hearing so much about a man
                        you&apos;d never known.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I feel as if I did know him,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;Your account of him was so vivid. I thought of asking you to bring
                        him to call.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull laughed heartily. &quot;Victor Dorncalling!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t do that sort of thing. And if he did, how could
                        I bring him here?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellin the first place, you are a ladyand he is not in your class.
                        Of course, men can associate with each other in politics and business. But
                        the social side of lifethat&apos;s different.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But a while ago you were talking about my going in for
                        politics,&quot; said Miss Hastings demurely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Still, you&apos;d not have to meet <hi rend="i">socially</hi>
                        queer and rough characters&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is Victor Dorn very rough?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The interrupting question was like the bite of a big fly to a sweating horse.
                        &quot;I&apos;m getting sick of hearing <pb id="VAA2368-021" n="17"/>
                        about him from you,&quot; cried Hull with the pettishness of the spoiled
                        children of the upper class.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In what way is he rough?&quot; persisted Miss Hastings.
                        &quot;If you didn&apos;t wish to talk about Victor Dorn, why did you
                        bring the subject up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohall right,&quot; cried Hull, restraining himself.
                        &quot;Victor isn&apos;t exactly rough. He can act like a
                        gentlemanwhen he happens to want to. But you never can tell what
                        he&apos;ll do next.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">must</hi> bring him to call!&quot; exclaimed
                        Miss Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Impossible,&quot; said Hull angrily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he&apos;s the only man I&apos;ve heard about since
                        I&apos;ve been home that I&apos;ve taken the least interest
                        in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he did come, your father would have the servants throw him off
                        the place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Hiss Hastings haughtily. &quot;My father
                        wouldn&apos;t insult a guest of mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you don&apos;t know, Jen,&quot; cried David.
                        &quot;Why, Victor Dorn attacks your father in the most outrageous way in
                        his miserable little anarchist papercalls him a thief, a briber, a
                        blood-suckeraI&apos;d not venture to repeat to you the things he
                        says.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt he got a false impression of father because of that damage
                        suit,&quot; said Miss Hastings mildly. &quot;That was a frightful
                        thing. I can&apos;t be so unjust as to blame him, Davycan you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I guess father does have to do a lot of things <pb
                            id="VAA2368-022" n="18"/> in the course of business Don&apos;t all
                        the big menthe leaders?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesunfortunately they do,&quot; said Hull.
                        &quot;That&apos;s what gives plausibility to the shrieks of
                        demagogues like Victor Dornthough Victor is too well educated not to know
                        better than to stir up the ignorant classes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder why he does it,&quot; said Miss Hastings,
                        reflectively. &quot;I must ask him. I want to hear what he says to
                        excuse himself.&quot; In fact, she had not the faintest interest in the
                        views of this queer unknown; her chief reason for saying she had was to
                        enjoy David Hull&apos;s jealousy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Before you try to meet Victor,&quot; said Hull, in a
                        constrained, desperate way, &quot;please speak to your father about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I certainly shall,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;As soon as
                        he comes home this afternoon, I&apos;m going to talk to him about that
                        damage suit. That has got to be straightened out.&quot; An expression of
                        resolution, of gentleness and justice abruptly transformed her face.
                        &quot;You may not believe it, but I have a conscience.&quot;
                        Absently, &quot;A curious sort of a conscienceone that might become very
                        troublesome, I&apos;m afraidin some circumstances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Instantly the fine side of David Hull&apos;s nature was to the forethe
                        dominant side, for at the first appeal it always responded. &quot;So
                        have I, Jen,&quot; said he. &quot;I think our similarity in that
                        respect is what draws me so strongly to you. And it&apos;s that that
                        makes me hope I can win you. Oh, Jenthere&apos;s so much to be done <pb
                            id="VAA2368-023" n="19"/> in the worldand you and I could have such a
                        splendid happy life doing our share of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was once more looking at him with an encouraging interest. But she said,
                        gently: &quot;Let&apos;s not talk about that any more to-day,
                        Davy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ll think about it?&quot; urged he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she. &quot;Let&apos;s be friendsandand
                        see what happens.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull strolled up to the house with her, but refused to stop for lunch. He
                        pleaded an engagement; but it was one that couldand in other circumstances
                        wouldhave been broken by telephone. His real reason for hurrying away was
                        fear lest Jane should open out on the subject of Victor Dorn with her
                        father, and, in her ignorance of the truth as to the situation, should
                        implicate him. She found her father already at home and having a bowl of
                        crackers and milk in a shady corner of the west veranda. He was chewing in
                        the manner of those whose teeth are few and not too secure. His brows were
                        knitted and he looked as if not merely joy but everything except
                        disagreeable sensation had long since fled his life beyond hope of returnan
                        air not uncommon among the world&apos;s successful men. However, at
                        sight of his lovely young daughter his face cleared somewhat and he shot at
                        her from under his wildly and savagely narrowed eyebrows a glance of
                        admiration and tendernessa quaint expression for those cold, hard features.</p>
                    <p>Everyone spoke of him behind his back as &quot;Old Morton <pb
                            id="VAA2368-024" n="20"/> Hastings.&quot; In fact, he was barely
                        past sixty, was at an age at which city men of the modern style count
                        themselves young and even entertainnot without reasonhope of being desired
                        of women for other than purely practical reasons. He was born on a farmwas
                        born with an aversion to physical exertion as profound as was his passion
                        for mental exertion. We never shall know how much of its progress the world
                        owes to the physically lazy, mentally tireless men. Those are they who, to
                        save themselves physical exertion, have devised all manner of schemes and
                        machines to save labor. And, at bottom, what is progress but man&apos;s
                        success in his effort to free himself from manual laborto get everything for
                        himself by the labor of other men and animals and of machines? Naturally his
                        boyhood of toil on the farm did not lessen Martin Hastings&apos; innate
                        horror of &quot;real work.&quot; He was not twenty when he dropped
                        tools never to take them up again. He was shoeing a horse in the heat of the
                        cool side of the barn on a frightful August day. Suddenly he threw down the
                        hammer and said loudly: &quot;A man that works is a damn fool.
                        I&apos;ll never work again.&quot; And he never did.</p>
                    <p>As soon as he could get together the moneyand it was not long after he set
                        about making others work for himhe bought a buggy, a kind of phaeton, and a
                        safe horse. Thenceforth he never walked a step that could be driven. The
                        result of thirty-five years of this life, so unnatural to an animal that is
                        designed by <pb id="VAA2368-025" n="21"/> Nature for walking and is punished
                        for not doing sothe result of a lifetime of this folly was a body shrivelled
                        to a lean brown husk, legs incredibly meagre and so tottery that they
                        scarcely could bear him about. His headlarge and finely shapedseemed so out
                        of proportion that he looked at a glance senile. But no one who had business
                        dealings with him suspected him of senility or any degree of weakness. He
                        spoke in a thin dry voice, shrouded in sardonic humor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care for lunch,&quot; said Jane, dropping to a
                        chair near the side of the table opposite her father. &quot;I had
                        breakfast too late. Besides, I&apos;ve got to look out for my figure.
                        There&apos;s a tendency to fat in our family.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man chuckled. &quot;Me, for instance,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Martha, for instance,&quot; replied Jane. Martha was her one
                        sistermarried and ten years older than she and spaciously matronly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wasn&apos;t that Davy Hull you were talking to, down in the
                        woods?&quot; inquired her father.</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed. &quot;You see everything,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>I didn&apos;t see much when I saw him,&quot; said her father.</p>
                    <p>Jane was hugely amused. Her father watched her laughterthe dazzling display
                        of fine teethwith delighted eyes. &quot;You&apos;ve got mighty good
                        teeth, Jenny,&quot; observed he. &quot;Take care of &apos;em,
                        You&apos;ll never know what misery is till you&apos;ve got no
                        teethor next to none.&quot; He looked disgustedly into his bowl.
                        &quot;Crackers and milk!&quot; grunted he. &quot;No teeth and no
                        digestion. <pb id="VAA2368-026" n="22"/> The only pleasure a man of my age
                        can have left is eating, and I&apos;m cheated out of that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So, you wouldn&apos;t approve of my marrying Davy?&quot;
                        said the girl.</p>
                    <p>Her father gruntedchuckled. &quot;I didn&apos;t say that. Does he
                        want to marry you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say that,&quot; retorted Jane.
                        &quot;He&apos;s an unattached young manand I, being merely a woman,
                        have got to look out for a husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Martin looked gloomy. &quot;There&apos;s no hurry,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve been away six years. Seems to me you might stay at
                        home a while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;d bring him here, popsy. I&apos;ve no intention
                        of leaving you. You were in an awful state, when I came home. That
                        mustn&apos;t ever happen again. And as you won&apos;t live with
                        Martha and Hugowhy, I&apos;ve got to be the victim.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesit&apos;s up to you, Miss, to take care of me in my
                        declining years. ... You can marry Davyif you want to. Davyor anybody. I
                        trust to your good sense.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I don&apos;t like him, I can get rid of him,&quot; said
                        the girl.</p>
                    <p>Her father smiled indulgently. &quot;That&apos;s <hi rend="i">a
                            leetle</hi> too up-to-date for an old man like me,&quot; observed
                        he. &quot;The world&apos;s moving fast nowadays. It&apos;s got a
                        long ways from where it was when your ma and I were young.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you think Davy Hull will make a career?&quot; asked Jane.
                        She had heard from time to time as much as <pb id="VAA2368-027" n="23"/> she
                        cared to hear about the world of a generation beforeof its bareness and
                        discomfort, its primness, its repulsive piety, its ignorance of all that
                        made life bright and attractivehow it quite overlooked this life in its
                        agitation about the extremely problematic life to come. &quot;I mean a
                        career in politics,&quot; she explained.</p>
                    <p>The old man munched and smacked for full a minute before he said,
                        &quot;Well, he can make a pretty good speech. YesI reckon he could be
                        taken in hand and pushed. He&apos;s got a lot of fool college-bred ideas
                        about reforming things. But he&apos;d soon drop them, if he got into the
                        practical swing. As soon as he had a taste of success, he&apos;d stop
                        being finicky. Just now, he&apos;s one of those nice, pure chaps who
                        stand off and tell how things ought to be done. But he&apos;d get over
                        that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane smiled peculiarlyhalf to herself. &quot;YesI think he would. In
                        fact, I&apos;m sure he would.&quot; She looked at her father.
                        &quot;Do you think he amounts to as much as Victor Dorn?&quot; she
                        asked, innocently.</p>
                    <p>The old man dropped a half raised spoonful of milk and crackers into the bowl
                        with a splash. &quot;Dornhe&apos;s a scoundrel!&quot; he
                        exclaimed, shaking with passion. &quot;I&apos;m going to have that
                        dirty little paper of his stopped and him put out of town. Impudent
                        puppy!foulmouthed demagogue! I&apos;ll <hi rend="i">show</hi>
                        him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, he doesn&apos;t amount to anything, father,&quot;
                        remonstrated the girl. &quot;He&apos;s nothing but a common working
                        manisn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all he isthe hound!&quot; replied Martin
                        Hastings. <pb id="VAA2368-028" n="24"/> A look of cruelty, of tenacious
                        cruelty, had come into his face. It would have startled a stranger. But his
                        daughter had often seen it; and it did not disturb her, as it had never
                        appeared for anything that in any way touched her life.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve let him hang on here too long,&quot; went on the
                        old man, to himself rather than to her. &quot;First thing I know
                        he&apos;ll be dangerous.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If he&apos;s worth while I should think you&apos;d hire
                        him,&quot; remarked Jane shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wouldn&apos;t have such a scoundrel in my employ,&quot;
                        cried her father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, maybe,&quot; pursued the daughter, &quot;maybe you
                        couldn&apos;t hire him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I could,&quot; scoffed Hastings. &quot;Anybody
                        can be hired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot; said the girl bluntly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;One way or another,&quot; declared the old man. &quot;That
                        Dorn boy isn&apos;t worth the price he&apos;d want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What price would he want?&quot; asked Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How should I know?&quot; retorted her father angrily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve tried to hire himhaven&apos;t you?&quot;
                        persisted she.</p>
                    <p>The father concentrated on his crackers and milk. Presently he said:
                        &quot;What did that fool Hull boy say about Dorn to you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He doesn&apos;t like him,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;He
                        seems to be jealous of himand opposed to his political views.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorn&apos;s views ain&apos;t politics.
                        They&apos;retheft and <pb id="VAA2368-029" n="25"/> murder and
                        highfalutin nonsense,&quot; said Hastings, not unconscious of his feeble
                        anti-climax.</p>
                    <p>&quot;All the same, heor rather, his motherought to have got damages from
                        the railway,&quot; said the girl. And there was a sudden and startling
                        shift in her expressionto a tenacity as formidable as her father&apos;s
                        own, but a quiet and secret tenacity.</p>
                    <p>Old Hastings wiped his mouth and began fussing uncomfortably with a cigar.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t blame him for getting bitter and turning against
                        society,&quot; continued she. &quot;I&apos;d have done the same
                        thingand so would you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings lit the cigar. &quot;They wanted ten thousand dollars,&quot;
                        he said, almost apologetically. &quot;Why, they never saw ten thousand
                        cents they could call their own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they lost their bread-winner, father,&quot; pleaded the
                        girl. &quot;And there were young children to bring up and educate. Oh, I
                        hate to think thatthat <hi rend="i">we</hi> had anything to do with such a
                        wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t a wrong, Jenas I used to tell your ma,&quot;
                        said the old man, much agitated and shrill of voice. &quot;It was just
                        the course of business. The law was with our company.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane said nothing. She simply gazed steadily at her father. He avoided her
                        glance.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to hear no more about it,&quot; he burst
                        out with abrupt violence. &quot;Not another word!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father, I want it settledand settled right,&quot; said <pb
                            id="VAA2368-030" n="26"/> the girl. &quot;I ask it as a favor.
                        Don&apos;t do it as a matter of business, but as a matter of
                        sentiment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shifted uneasily, debating. When he spoke he was even more explosive than
                        before. &quot;Not a cent! Not a red! Give that whelp money to run his
                        crazy paper on? Not your father, while he keeps his mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Butmightn&apos;t that quiet him?&quot; pleaded she.
                        &quot;What&apos;s the use of having war when you can have peace?
                        You&apos;ve always laughed at people who let their prejudices stand in
                        the way of their interests. You&apos;ve always laughed at how silly and
                        stupid and costly enmities and revenges are. Now&apos;s your chance to
                        illustrate, popsy.&quot; And she smiled charmingly at him.</p>
                    <p>He was greatly softened by her mannerand by the wisdom of what she saida
                        wisdom in which, as in a mirror, he recognized with pleasure her strong
                        resemblance to himself. &quot;That wouldn&apos;t be a bad idea,
                        Jen,&quot; said he after reflection, &quot;<hi rend="i">if</hi> I
                        could get a guarantee.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But why not do it generously?&quot; urged the girl.
                        &quot;Generosity inspires generosity. You&apos;ll make him ashamed
                        of himself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a cynical smile on his shrivelled face the old man slowly shook his big
                        head that made him look as top-heavy as a newborn baby. &quot;That
                        isn&apos;t as smart, child, as what you said before. It&apos;s in
                        them things that the difference between theory and practice shows.
                        He&apos;d take the money and laugh at me. No, I&apos;ll try to get a
                        guarantee.&quot; He nodded and chuckled. &quot;Yes, that was a good
                        idea of yours, Jen.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-031" n="27"/>
                    <p>&quot;Butisn&apos;t it just possible that he is a man withwith
                        principles of a certain kind?&quot; suggested she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course, he <hi rend="i">thinks</hi> so,&quot; said Hastings.
                        &quot;They all do. But you don&apos;t suppose a man of any sense at
                        all could really care about and respect working class people?ignorant,
                        ungrateful fools. <hi rend="i">I</hi> know &apos;em. Didn&apos;t I
                        come from among &apos;em? Ain&apos;t I dealt with &apos;em all
                        my life? No, that there guy Dorn&apos;s simply trying to get up, and is
                        using them to step up on. I did the same thing, only I did it in a decent,
                        law-abiding way. I didn&apos;t want to tear down those that was up. I
                        wanted to go up and join &apos;em. And I did.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And his eyes glistened fondly and proudly as he gazed at his daughter. She
                        represented the climax of his risingshe, the lady born and bred, in her
                        beautiful clothes, with her lovely, delicate charms. Yes, he had indeed
                        &quot;come up,&quot; and there before him was the superb tangible
                        evidence of it.</p>
                    <p>Jane had the strongest belief in her father&apos;s worldly wisdom. At the
                        same time, from what David Hull said she had got an impression of a
                        something different from the ordinary human being in this queer Victor Dorn.
                        &quot;You&apos;d better move slowly,&quot; she said to her
                        father. &quot;There&apos;s no hurry, and you might be mistaken in
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Plenty of time,&quot; asserted her father.
                        &quot;There&apos;s never any need to hurry about giving up
                        money.&quot; Then, with one of those uncanny flashes of intuition for
                        which he, who was never caught napping, was famous, <pb id="VAA2368-032"
                            n="28"/> he said to her sharply: &quot;You keep your hands off,
                        miss.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was thrown into confusionand her embarrassment enraged her against
                        herself. &quot;What could <hi rend="i">I</hi> do?&quot; she retorted
                        with a brave attempt at indifference.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellkeep your hands off, miss,&quot; said the old man.
                        &quot;No female meddling in business. I&apos;ll stand for most
                        anything, but not for that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was now all eagerness for dropping the subject. She wished no further
                        prying of that shrewd mind into her secret thoughts. &quot;It&apos;s
                        hardly likely I&apos;d meddle where I know nothing about the
                        circumstances,&quot; said she. &quot;Will you drive me down to
                        Martha&apos;s?&quot;</p>
                    <p>This request was made solely to change the subject, to shift her father to
                        his favorite topic for family conversationhis daughter Martha, Mrs. Hugo
                        Galland, her weakness for fashionable pastimes, her incessant hints and
                        naggings at her father about his dowdy dress, his vulgar mannerisms of
                        speech and of conduct, especially at table. Jane had not the remotest
                        intention of letting her father drive her to Mrs. Galland&apos;s, or
                        anywhere, in the melancholy old phaeton-buggy, behind the fat old nag whose
                        coat was as shabby as the coat of the master or as the top and the side
                        curtains of the sorrowful vehicle it drew along at caterpillar pace.</p>
                    <p>When her father was ready to depart for his office in the Hastings Blockthe
                        most imposing office building in Remsen City, Jane announced a change of
                        mind. <pb id="VAA2368-033" n="29"/> &quot;I&apos;ll ride,
                        instead,&quot; said she. &quot;I need the exercise, and the day
                        isn&apos;t too warm.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Martin Hastings grumpily. He soon got
                        enough of anyone&apos;s company, even of his favorite
                        daughter&apos;s. Through years of habit he liked to jog about alone,
                        revolving in his mind his business affairscounting in fancy his big bundles
                        of securities, one by one, calculating their returns past, present and
                        prospectivereviewing the various enterprises in which he was dominant
                        factor, working out schemes for getting more profit here, for paying less
                        wages there, for tightening his grip upon this enterprise, for dumping his
                        associates in that, for escaping with all the valuable assets from another.
                        His appearance, as he and his nag dozed along the highroad, was as deceptive
                        as that of a hive of bees on a hot dayno signs of life except a few sleepy
                        workers crawling languidly in and out at the low, broad crack-door, yet
                        within myriads toiling like mad.</p>
                    <p>Jane went up to dress. She had brought an Italian maid with her from
                        Florence, and a mass of baggage that had given the station loungers at
                        Remsen City something to talk about, when there was a dearth of new
                        subjects, for the rest of their lives. She had transformed her own suite in
                        the second story of the big old house into an appearance of the quarters of
                        a twentieth century woman of wealth and leisure. In the sitting room were
                        books in four languages; on the walls were tasteful reproductions of her
                        favorite old masters. The <pb id="VAA2368-034" n="30"/> excellence of her
                        education was attested not by the books and pictures but by the absence of
                        those fussy, commonplace draperies and bits of bric-a-brac wherewith people
                        of no taste and no imagination furnish their houses because they can think
                        of nothing else to fill in the gaps.</p>
                    <p>Many of Jane&apos;s ways made Sister Martha uneasy. For Martha, while
                        admitting that Jane through superior opportunity ought to know, could not
                        believe that the &quot;right sort&quot; of people on the other side
                        had thrown over all her beloved formalities and were conducting themselves
                        distressingly like tenement-house people. For instance, Martha could not
                        approve Jane&apos;s habit of smoking cigarettesa habit which, by one of
                        those curious freaks of character, enormously pleased her father. Butexcept
                        in one matterMartha entirely approved Jane&apos;s style of dress. She
                        hastened to pronounce it &quot;just too elegant&quot; and repeated
                        that phrase until Jane, tried beyond endurance, warned her that the word
                        elegant was not used seriously by people of the &quot;right
                        sort&quot; and that its use was regarded as one of those small but
                        subtle signs of the loathsome &quot;middle class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The one thing in Jane&apos;s dress that Martha disapprovedor, rather,
                        shied atwas her riding suit. This was an extremely noisy plaid
                        man&apos;s suitfor Jane rode astride. Martha could not deny that Jane
                        looked &quot;simply stunning&quot; when seated on her horse and
                        dressed in that garb with her long slim feet and graceful calves <pb
                            id="VAA2368-035" n="31"/> encased in a pair of riding boots that looked
                        as if they must have cost &quot;something fierce.&quot; But was it
                        really &quot;ladylike&quot;? Hadn&apos;t Jane made a mistake and
                        adopted a costume worn only by the fashionables among the demi-mondaines of
                        whom Martha had read and had heard such dreadful, delightful stories?</p>
                    <p>It was the lively plaid that Miss Hastings now clad herself in. She loved
                        that suit. Not only did it give her figure a superb opportunity but also it
                        brought out new beauties in her contour and coloring. And her head was so
                        well shaped and her hair grew so thickly about brow and ears and nape of
                        neck that it looked full as well plaited and done close as when it was
                        framing her face and half concealing, half revealing her charming ears in
                        waves of changeable auburn. After a lingeringand pardonably pleasedlook at
                        herself in a long mirror, she descended, mounted and rode slowly down toward
                        town.</p>
                    <p>The old Galland homestead was at the western end of townin a quarter that had
                        become almost poor. But it was so dignified and its grounds were so
                        extensive that it suggested a manor house with the humble homes of the
                        lord&apos;s dependents clustering about it for shelter. To reach it Jane
                        had to ride through two filthy streets lined with factories. As she rode she
                        glanced at the windows, where could be seen in dusty air girls and boys busy
                        at furiously driven machinesmachines that compelled their human slaves to
                        strain every nerve in the monotonous task of keeping them <pb
                            id="VAA2368-036" n="32"/> occupied. Many of the girls and boys paused
                        long enough for a glance at the figure of the man-clad girl on the big
                        horse.</p>
                    <p>Jane, happy in the pleasant sunshine, in her beauty and health and fine
                        raiment and secure and luxurious position in the world, gave a thought of
                        pity to these imprisoned young people. &quot;How lucky I am,&quot;
                        she thought, &quot;not to have been born like that. Of course, we all
                        have our falls now and then. But while they always strike on the hard
                        ground, I&apos;ve got a feather bed to fall on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she reached Martha&apos;s and was ushered into the cool upstairs
                        sitting room, in somehow ghastly contrast to the hot rooms where the young
                        working people sweated and strained, the subject persisted in its hold on
                        her thoughts. There was Martha, in comfortable, corsetless expansivenessan
                        ideal illustration of the worthless idler fattening in purposelessness. She
                        was engaged with all her energies in preparing for the ball Hugo
                        Galland&apos;s sister, Mrs. Bertrand, was giving at the assembly rooms
                        that night.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been hard at it for several days now,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;I think at last I see daylight. But I want your
                        opinion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane gazed absently at the dress and accompanying articles that had been
                        assembled with so much labor. &quot;All right,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll look fine and dandy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Martha twitched. &quot;Jane, deardon&apos;t say thatdon&apos;t
                        use such an expression. I know it&apos;s your way of <pb
                            id="VAA2368-037" n="33"/> joking. But lots of people would think you
                        didn&apos;t know any better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let &apos;em think,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I say and do
                        as I please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Martha sighed. Here was one member of her family who could be a credit, who
                        could make people forget the unquestionably common origin of the Hastingses
                        and of the Morleys. Yet this member was always breaking out into something
                        mortifying, something reminiscent of the farm and of the livery stablefor
                        the deceased Mrs. Hastings had been daughter of a livery stable keeperin
                        fact, had caught Martin Hastings by the way she rode her father&apos;s
                        horses at a sale at a county fair. Said Martha:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t really looked at my clothes, Jane. Why <hi
                            rend="i">did</hi> you go back to calling yourself Jane?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because it&apos;s my name,&quot; replied her sister.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know that. But you hated it and changed it to Jeanne, which is so
                        much prettier.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t think so any more,&quot; replied Miss
                        Hastings. &quot;My taste has improved. Don&apos;t be so horribly
                        middle class, Marthaashamed of everything simple and natural.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think you know it alldon&apos;t you?just because
                        you&apos;ve lived abroad,&quot; said Martha peevishly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, I don&apos;t know one-tenth as much as I
                        thought I did, when I came back from Wellesley with a diploma.&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-038" n="34"/> &quot;Do you like my costume?&quot;
                        inquired Martha, eying her finery with the fond yet dubious expression of
                        the woman who likes her own taste but is not sure about its being good
                        taste.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a lazy, worthless pair we are!&quot; exclaimed Jane,
                        hitting her boot leg a tremendous rap with her little cane.</p>
                    <p>Martha startled. &quot;Good GodJanewhat is it?&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the way here I passed a lot of factories,&quot; pursued
                        Jane. &quot;Why should those people have to work likelike the devil,
                        while we sit about planning ball dresses?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Martha settled back comfortably. &quot;I feel so sorry for those poor
                        people,&quot; said she, absently sympathetic.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But why?&quot; demanded Jane. <hi rend="i">&quot;Why?</hi>
                        Why should we be allowed to idle while they have to slave? What have we
                        donewhat are we doingto entitle us to ease? What have they done to condemn
                        them to pain and toil?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know very well, Jane, that we represent the finer side of
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Slop!&quot; ejaculated Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For pity&apos;s sake, don&apos;t let&apos;s talk
                        politics,&quot; wailed Martha. &quot;I know nothing about politics.
                        I haven&apos;t any brains for that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that politics?&quot; inquired Jane. &quot;I thought
                        politics meant whether the Democrats or the Republicans <pb id="VAA2368-039"
                            n="35"/> or the reformers were to get the offices and the chance to
                        steal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything&apos;s politics, nowadays,&quot; said Martha,
                        comparing the color of the material of her dress with the color of her fat
                        white arm. &quot;As Hugo says, that Victor Dorn is dragging everything
                        into politicseven our private business of how we make and spend our own
                        money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane sat down abruptly. &quot;Victor Dorn,&quot; she said in a
                        strange voice. <hi rend="i">&quot;Who</hi> is Victor Dorn? <hi rend="i"
                            >What</hi> is Victor Dorn? It seems that I can hear of nothing but
                        Victor Dorn to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s too low to talk about,&quot; said Martha, amiable
                        and absent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Politics,&quot; replied Martha. &quot;Really, he is horrid,
                        Jane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To look at?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonot to look at. He&apos;s handsome in a way. Not at all
                        common looking. You might take him for a gentleman, if you didn&apos;t
                        know. Stillhe always dresses peculiarlyalways wears soft hats. I think soft
                        hats are <hi rend="i">so</hi> vulgardon&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How hopelessly middle-class you are, Martha,&quot; mocked Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hugo would as soon think of going in the street in ain aI
                        don&apos;t know what.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hugo is the finest flower of American gentleman. That is,
                        he&apos;s the quintessence of everything that&apos;s nice <pb
                            id="VAA2368-040" n="36"/> and &apos;nasty.&apos; I wish I were
                        married to him for a week. I love Hugo, but he gives me the
                        creeps.&quot; She rose and tramped restlessly about the room.
                        &quot;You both give me the creeps. Everything conventional gives me the
                        creeps. If I&apos;m not careful I&apos;ll dress myself in a long
                        shirt, let down my hair and run wild.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What nonsense you do talk,&quot; said Martha composedly.</p>
                    <p>Jane sat down abruptly. &quot;So I do!&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I&apos;m as poor a creature as you at bottom. I simply like to
                        beat against the bars of my cage to make myself think I&apos;m a wild,
                        free bird by nature. If you opened the door, I&apos;d not fly out, but
                        would hop meekly back to my perch and fall to smoothing my feathers. ...Tell
                        me some more about Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you he isn&apos;t fit to talk about,&quot; said
                        Martha. &quot;Do you know, they say now that he is carrying on with that
                        shameless, brazen thing who writes for his paper, that Selma
                        Gordon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma Gordon,&quot; echoed Jane. Her brows came down in a
                        gesture reminiscent of her father, and there was a disagreeable expression
                        about her mouth and in her light brown eyes. &quot;Who&apos;s Selma
                        Gordon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;She makes speechesand writes articles against rich peopleandoh,
                        she&apos;s horrid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pretty?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noa scrawny, black thing. The mensome of themsay she&apos;s got
                        a kind of uncanny fascination. Some even insist that she&apos;s
                        beautiful.&quot; Martha <pb id="VAA2368-041" n="37"/> laughed.
                        &quot;Beautiful! How could a woman with black hair and a dark skin and
                        no flesh on her bones be beautiful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It has been known to happen,&quot; said Jane curtly.
                        &quot;Is she one of <hi rend="i">the</hi> Gordons?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mercy, no!&quot; cried Martha Galland. &quot;She simply
                        took the name of Gordonthat is, her father did. He was a Russian peasanta
                        Jew. And he fell in love with a girl who was of noble familya princess, I
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Princess doesn&apos;t mean much in Russia,&quot; said Jane
                        sourly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow, they ran away to this country. And he worked in the rolling
                        mill hereand they both diedand Selma became a factory girland then took to
                        writing for the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi>that&apos;s Victor
                        Dorn&apos;s paper, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How romantic,&quot; said Jane sarcastically. &quot;And now
                        Victor Dorn&apos;s in love with her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t say that,&quot; replied Martha, with a
                        scandal-smile.</p>
                    <p>Jane Hastings went to the window and gazed out into the garden. Martha
                        resumed her habitual warm day existencesat rocking gently and fanning
                        herself and looking leisurely about the room. Presently she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jane, why don&apos;t you marry Davy Hull?&quot;</p>
                    <p>No answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s got an independent incomeso there&apos;s no <pb
                            id="VAA2368-042" n="38"/> question of his marrying for money. And there
                        isn&apos;t any family anywhere that&apos;s better than hismighty few
                        as good. And he&apos;s <hi rend="i">dead</hi> in love with you,
                        Jen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With her back still turned Jane snapped, &quot;I&apos;d rather marry
                        Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">outrageous</hi> things you do say!&quot;
                        cried Martha.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I envy that black Jewessthatwhat&apos;s her name? that Selma
                        Gordon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t even know them,&quot; said Martha.</p>
                    <p>Jane wheeled round with a strange laugh. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        I?&quot; cried she. &quot;I don&apos;t know anyone
                        else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She strode to her sister and tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the
                        riding stick.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be careful,&quot; cautioned Martha. &quot;You know how
                        easily my flesh marsand I&apos;m going to wear my low neck
                        to-night.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane did not head. &quot;David Hull is a boreand a fraud,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I tell you I&apos;d rather marry Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do be careful about my skin, dear,&quot; pleaded Martha.
                        &quot;Hugo&apos;ll be <hi rend="i">so</hi> put out if
                        there&apos;s a mark on it. He&apos;s very proud of my
                        skin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane looked at her quizzically. &quot;What a dear, fat old rotter of a
                        respectability it is, to be sure,&quot; said sheand strode from the
                        room, and from the house.</p>
                    <p>Her mood of perversity and defiance did not yield to a ten mile gallop over
                        the gentle hills of that lovely part of Indiana, but held on through the
                        afternoon and controlled her toilet for the ball. She knew that every <pb
                            id="VAA2368-043" n="39"/> girl in town would appear at that most
                        fashionable party of the summer season in the best clothing she could get
                        together. As she had several dresses from Paris which she not without reason
                        regarded as notable works of art, the opportunity to outshine was hersthe
                        sort of opportunity she took pleasure in using to the uttermost, as a rule.
                        But to be the best dressed woman at Mrs. Bertram&apos;s party was too
                        easy and too commonplace. To be the worst dressed would call for courageof
                        just the sort she prided herself on having. Also, it would look original,
                        would cause talkwould give her the coveted sense of achievement.</p>
                    <p>When she descended to show herself to her father and say good night to him,
                        she was certainly dressed by the same pattern that caused him to be talked
                        about throughout that region. Her gown was mussed, had been mended obviously
                        in several places, had not been in its best day becoming. But this was not
                        all. Her hair looked stringy and dishevelled. She was delighted with
                        herself. Except during an illness two years before never had she come so
                        near to being downright homely. &quot;Martha will die of
                        shame,&quot; said she to herself. &quot;And Mrs. Bertram will spend
                        the evening explaining me to everybody.&quot; She did not definitely
                        formulate the thought, &quot;And I shall be the most talked about person
                        of the evening&quot;; but it was in her mind none the less.</p>
                    <p>Her father always smoked his after-dinner cigar in a little room just off the
                        library. It was filled up with the plain cheap furniture and the chromos and
                        mottoes <pb id="VAA2368-044" n="40"/> which he and his wife had bought when
                        they first went to housekeepingin their early days of poverty and struggle.
                        On the south wall was a crude and cheap, but startlingly large enlargement
                        of an old daguerreotype of Letitia Hastings at twenty-fourthe year after her
                        marriage and the year before the birth of the oldest child, Robert, called
                        Dock, now piling up a fortune as an insider in the Chicago
                        &quot;brave&quot; game of wheat and pork, which it is absurd to call
                        gambling because gambling involves chance. To smoke the one cigar the doctor
                        allowed him, old Martin Hastings always seated himself before this picture.
                        He found it and his thoughts the best company in the world, just as he had
                        found her silent self and her thoughts the best company in their twenty-one
                        years of married life. As he sat there, sometimes he thought of herof what
                        they had been through together, of the various advances in his fortunehow
                        this one had been made near such and such anniversary, and that one between
                        two other anniversariesand what he had said to her and what she had said to
                        him. Againperhaps oftenerhe did not think of her directly, any more than he
                        had thought of her when they sat together evening after evening, year in and
                        year out, through those twenty-one years of contented and prosperous life.</p>
                    <p>As Jane entered he, seated back to the door, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;About that there Dorn damage suit&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane started, caught her breath. Really, it <hi rend="i">was</hi> uncanny,
                        this continual thrusting of Victor Dorn at her.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-045" n="41"/>
                    <p>&quot;It wasn&apos;t so bad as it looked,&quot; continued her
                        father. He was speaking in the quiet voicequiet and old and sadhe always
                        used when seated before the picture.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You see, Jenny, in them days&quot;also, in presence of the
                        picture he lapsed completely into the dialect of his youth&quot;in them
                        days the railroad was teetering and I couldn&apos;t tell which way
                        things&apos;d jump. Every cent counted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand perfectly, father,&quot; said Jane, her hands on
                        his shoulders from behind. She felt immensely relieved. She did not realize
                        that every doer of a mean act always has an excellent excuse for it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then afterwards,&quot; the old man went on, &quot;the
                        family was getting along so wellthe boy was working steady and making good
                        money and pushing aheadand I was afeared I&apos;d do harm instead of
                        good. It&apos;s mighty dangerous, Jen, to give money sudden to folks
                        that ain&apos;t used to it. I&apos;ve seen many a smash-up come that
                        way. And your mashe thought so, tookind of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The &quot;kind of&quot; was advanced hesitatingly, with an apologetic
                        side glance at the big crayon portrait. But Jane was entirety convinced. She
                        was average human; therefore, she believed what she wished to believe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were quite right, father,&quot; said she. &quot;I knew
                        you couldn&apos;t do a bad thingwouldn&apos;t deliberately strike at
                        weak, helpless people. And now, it can be straightened out and the Dorns
                        will be all the better for not having been tempted in the days when it might
                        have ruined them.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-046" n="42"/>
                    <p>She had walked round where her father could see her, as she delivered herself
                        of this speech so redolent of the fumes of collegiate smugness. He proceeded
                        to examine herwith an expression of growing dissatisfaction. Said he
                        fretfully:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t calculate to go out, looking like
                        that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Out to the swellest blow-out of the year, popsy,&quot; said
                        she.</p>
                    <p>The big heavy looking head wobbled about uneasily. &quot;You look too
                        much like your old pappy&apos;s daughter,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can afford to,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>The head shook positively. &quot;You ma wouldn&apos;t &apos;a
                        liked it. She was mighty partic&apos;lar how she dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed gayly. &quot;Why, when did you become a critic of
                        women&apos;s dress?&quot; cried she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I always used to buy yer ma dresses and hats when I went to the
                        city,&quot; said he. &quot;And she looked as good as the bestnot for
                        these days, but for them times.&quot; He looked critically at the
                        portrait. &quot;I bought them clothesand awful dear they seemed to
                        me.&quot; His glance returned to his daughter. &quot;Go get yourself
                        up proper,&quot; said he, between request and command. &quot;She
                        wouldn&apos;t &apos;a liked it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane gazed at the common old crayon, suddenly flung her arms round the old
                        man&apos;s neck. &quot;Yesfather,&quot; she murmured.
                        &quot;To please <hi rend="i">her.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>She fled; the old man wiped his eyes, blew his nose and resumed the careful
                        smoking of the cheap, smelly <pb id="VAA2368-047" n="43"/> cigar. He said he
                        preferred that brand of his days of poverty; and it was probably true, as he
                        would refuse better cigars offered him by fastidious men who hoped to save
                        themselves from the horrors of his. He waited restlessly, though it was long
                        past his bedtime; he yawned and pretended to listen while Davy Hull, who had
                        called for Jane in the Hull brougham, tried to make a favorable impression
                        upon him. At last Jane reappearedand certainly Letitia Hastings would have
                        been more than satisfied.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; said she to Hull, who was
                        speechless and tremulous before her voluptuous radiance. &quot;But
                        father didn&apos;t like the way I was rigged out. Maybe I&apos;ll
                        have to change again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Take her along, Davy,&quot; said Hastings, his big head wagging
                        with delight. &quot;She&apos;s a caution<hi rend="i">she
                            is!&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Hull could not control himself to speak. As they sat in the carriage, she
                        finishing the pulling on of her gloves, he stared out into the heavy rain
                        that was deluging the earth and bending low the boughs. Said she, half way
                        down the hill:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellcan&apos;t you talk about anything but Victor
                        Dorn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw him this afternoon,&quot; said Hull, glad that the
                        tension of the silence was broken.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you&apos;ve got something to talk about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The big street car strike is on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So father said at dinner. I suppose Victor Dorn caused
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-048" n="44"/>
                    <p>&apos;&quot;Nohe&apos;s opposed to it. He&apos;s queer. I
                        don&apos;t exactly understand his ideas. He says strikes are
                        ridiculousthat it&apos;s like trying to cure smallpox by healing up one
                        single sore.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane gave a shiver of lady-like disgust. &quot;Hownasty,&quot; said
                        she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m telling you what he said. But he says that the only
                        way human beings learn how to do things right is by doing them wrongso while
                        he&apos;s opposed to strikes he&apos;s also in favor of
                        them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Even <hi rend="i">I</hi> understand that,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s difficult.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Doesn&apos;t it strike you asas inconsistent?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohbother consistency!&quot; scoffed the girl.
                        &quot;That&apos;s another middle class virtue that sensible people
                        loathe as a vice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Anyhow, he&apos;s helping the strikers all he canand fighting <hi
                            rend="i">us.</hi> You know, your father and my father&apos;s estate
                        are the two biggest owners of the street railways.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must get his paper,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        have a lot of fun reading the truth about us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But David wasn&apos;t listening. He was deep in thought. After a while he
                        said: &quot;It&apos;s amazingand splendidand terrible, what power
                        he&apos;s getting in our town. Victor Dorn, I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Always Victor Dorn,&quot; mocked Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When he startedtwelve years ago as a boy of twenty, just out of
                        college and working as a carpenterwhen he started, he was alone and poor,
                        and without <pb id="VAA2368-049" n="45"/> friends or anything. He built up
                        little by little, winning one man at a timethe fellow working next him on
                        his right, then the chap working on his leftin the shopand so on, one man
                        after another. And whenever he got a man he held himmade him as devoted asas
                        fanatical as he is himself. Now he&apos;s got a band of nearly a
                        thousand. There are ten thousand voters in this town. So, he&apos;s got
                        only one in ten. But what a thousand!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was gazing out into the rain, her eyes bright, her lips parted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you listening?&quot; asked Hull. &quot;Or, am I boring
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;re a thousand missionariesapostlesyes, apostle is the
                        name for them. They live and breathe and think and talk only the ideas
                        Victor Dorn believes and fights for. And whenever he wants anything
                        doneanything for the causewhy, there are a thousand men ready to do
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dorn,&quot; said Hull. &quot;Do you wonder that he
                        interests me? For instance, to-night: you see how it&apos;s raining.
                        Well, Victor Dorn had them print to-day fifty thousand leaflets about this
                        strikewhat it means to his cause. And he has asked five hundred of his men
                        to stand on the corners and patrol the streets and distribute those dodgers.
                        I&apos;ll bet not a man will be missing.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-050" n="46"/>
                    <p>&quot;But why?&quot; repeated Jane. &quot;What for?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wants to conquer this town. He says the world has to be
                        conqueredand that the way to begin is to beginand that he has
                        begun.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Conquer it for what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For himself, I guess,&quot; said Hull. &quot;Of course, he
                        professes that it&apos;s for the public good. They all do. But
                        what&apos;s the truth?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I saw him I could tell you,&quot; said Jane in the full
                        pride of her belief in her woman&apos;s power of divination in
                        character.</p>
                    <p>&quot;However, he can&apos;t succeed,&quot; observed Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, he can,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;And will. Even
                        if every idea he had were foolish and wrong. And it isn&apos;tis
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>David laughed peculiarly. &quot;He&apos;s infernally uncomfortably
                        right in most of the things he charges and proposes. I don&apos;t like
                        to think about it.&quot; He shut his teeth together. &quot;I <hi
                            rend="i">won&apos;t</hi> think about it,&quot; he muttered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noyou&apos;d better stick to your own road, Davy,&quot;
                        said Jane with irritating mockery. &quot;You were born to be thoroughly
                        conventional and respectable. As a reformer you&apos;re ideal. As aan
                        imitator of Victor Dorn, you&apos;d be a joke.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s one of his men now,&quot; exclaimed Hull,
                        leaning forward excitedly.</p>
                    <p>Jane looked. A working man, a commonplace enough object, was standing under
                        the corner street lamp, the <pb id="VAA2368-051" n="47"/> water running off
                        his hat, his shoulders, his coat tail. His package of dodgers was carefully
                        shielded by an oilcloth from the wet which had full swing at the man. To
                        every passer-by he presented a dodger, accompanying the polite gesture with
                        some phrase which seemed to move the man or woman to take what was offered
                        and to put it away instead of dropping it.</p>
                    <p>Jane sank back in the carriage, disappointed. &quot;Is that
                        all?&quot; said she disdainfully.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;All?&quot;</hi> cried Hull. &quot;Use your
                        imagination, Jen. But I forgotyou&apos;re a woman. They see only
                        surfaces.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And are snared into marrying by complexions and pretty features and
                        dresses and silly flirting tricks,&quot; retorted the girl
                        sarcastically.</p>
                    <p>Hull laughed. &quot;I spoke too quick that time,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;I suppose you expected to see something out of a fifteenth century
                        Italian old master! Wellit was there, all right.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane shrugged her shoulders. &quot;And your Victor Dorn,&quot; said
                        she, &quot;no doubt he&apos;s seated in some dry, comfortable place
                        enjoying the thought of his men making fools of themselves for
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were drawing up to the curb before the Opera House where were the
                        assembly rooms. &quot;There he is now,&quot; cried Hull.</p>
                    <p>Jane, startled, leaned eagerly forward. In the rain beyond the edge of the
                        awning stood a dripping figure not unlike that other which had so
                        disappointed her. Underneath the brim of the hat she could see a
                        smoothshaven <pb id="VAA2368-052" n="48"/> youngish facealmost boyish. But
                        the rain streaming from the brim made satisfactory scrutiny impossible.</p>
                    <p>Jane again sank back. &quot;How many carriages before us?&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re disappointed in him, too, I suppose,&quot; said
                        Hull. &quot;I knew you would be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought he was tall,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only middling,&quot; replied Hull, curiously delighted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought he was serious,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, he&apos;s always laughing. He&apos;s the
                        best natured man I know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As they descended and started along the carpet under the middle of the
                        awning, Jane halted. She glanced toward the dripping figure whom the police
                        would not permit under the shelter. Said she: &quot;I want one of those
                        papers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy moved toward the drenched distributor of strike literature.
                        &quot;Give me one, Dorn,&quot; he said in his most elegant manner.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sure, Davy,&quot; said Dorn in a tone that was a subtle
                        commentary on Hull&apos;s aristocratic tone and manner. As he spoke he
                        glanced at Jane; she was looking at him. Both smiledat Davy&apos;s
                        expense.</p>
                    <p>Davy and Jane passed on in, Jane folding the dodger to tuck it away for
                        future reading. She said to him: &quot;But you didn&apos;t tell me
                        about his eyes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s the matter with them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Everything,&quot; replied sheand said no more.</p>
                </div2>

                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>II</head>
                    <p>The dance was even more tiresome than Jane had anticipated. There had been
                        little pleasure in outshining the easily outshone belles of Remsen City. She
                        had felt humiliated by having to divide the honors with a brilliantly
                        beautiful and scandalously audacious Chicago girl, a Yvonne Herefordwhose
                        style, in looks, in dress and in wit, was more comfortable to the standard
                        of the best young men of Remsen Citya standard which Miss Hastings,
                        cultivated by foreign travel and social adventure, regarded as distinctly
                        poor, not to say low. Miss Hereford&apos;s audacities were especially
                        offensive to Jane. Jane was audacious herself, but she flattered herself
                        that she had a delicate sense of that baffling distinction between the
                        audacity that is the hall mark of the lady and the audacity that proclaims
                        the not-lady. For example, in such apparently trifling matters as the way of
                        smoking a cigarette, the way of crossing the legs or putting the elbows on
                        the table or using slang, Jane found a difference, abysmal though narrow,
                        between herself and Yvonne Hereford. &quot;But then, her very name gives
                        her away,&quot; reflected Jane. &quot;There&apos;d surely be a
                        frightfully cheap streak in a mother who in this country would name her
                        daughter Yvonneor in a girl who would name herself that.&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-054" n="50"/> However, Jane Hastings was not deeply annoyed
                        either by the shortcomings of Remsen City young men or by the rivalry of
                        Miss Hereford. Her dissatisfaction was personalthe feeling of futility, of
                        cheapness, in having dressed herself in her best and spent a whole evening
                        at such unworthy business. &quot;Whatever I am or am not fit
                        for,&quot; said she to herself, &quot;I&apos;m not for
                        societyany kind of society. At least I&apos;m too much grown-up mentally
                        for that.&quot; Her disdainful thoughts about others were, on this
                        occasion as almost always, merely a mode of expressing her self-scorn.</p>
                    <p>As she was undressing she found in her party bag the dodger Hull had got for
                        her from Victor Dorn. She, sitting at her dressing table, started to read it
                        at once. But her attention soon wandered. &quot;I&apos;m not in the
                        mood,&quot; she said. &quot;To-morrow.&quot; And she tossed it
                        into the top drawer. The fact was, the subject of politics interested her
                        only when some man in whom she was interested was talking it to her. In a
                        general way she understood things political, but like almost all women and
                        all but a few men she could fasten her attention only on things directly and
                        clearly and nearly related to her own interests. Politics seemed to her to
                        be not at all related to heror, indeed, to anybody but the men running for
                        office. This dodger was politics, pure and simple. A plea to workingmen to
                        awaken to the fact that their <hi rend="i">strikes</hi> were stupid and
                        wasteful, that the way to get better pay and decent hours of labor was by
                        uniting, taking possession of the power <pb id="VAA2368-055" n="51"/> that
                        was rightfully theirs and regulating their own affairs.</p>
                    <p>She resumed fixing her hair for the night. Her glance bent steadily downward
                        at one stage of this performance, rested unseeingly upon the handbill folded
                        printed side out and on top of the contents of the open drawer. She happened
                        to see two capital lettersS. G.in a line by themselves at the end of the
                        print. She repeated them mechanically several times&quot;S. G.S. G.S.
                        G.S. G.&quot;then her hands fell from her hair upon the handbill. She
                        settled herself to read in earnest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma Gordon,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s
                        different.&quot; She would have had some difficulty in explaining to
                        herself why it was &quot;different.&quot; She read closely,
                        concentratedly now. She tried to read in an attitude of unfriendly
                        criticism, but she could not. A dozen lines, and the clear, earnest, honest
                        sentences had taken hold of her. How sensible the statements were, and how
                        obviously true. Why, it wasn&apos;t the writing of an
                        &quot;anarchistic crank&quot; at allon the contrary, the writer was
                        if anything more excusing toward the men who were giving the drivers and
                        motormen a dollar and ten cents a day for fourteen hours&apos;
                        work&quot;fourteen hours!&quot; cried Jane, her cheeks burningyes,
                        Selma Gordon was more tolerant of the owners of the street car line than
                        Jane herself would have been.</p>
                    <p>When Jane had read, she gazed at the print with sad envy in her eyes.
                        &quot;Selma Gordon can thinkand <pb id="VAA2368-056" n="52"/> she can
                        write, too,&quot; said she half aloud. &quot;I want to know
                        hertoo.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That &quot;too&quot; was the first admission to herself of a
                        curiously intense desire to meet Victor Dorn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, to be in earnest about something! To have a real interest! To
                        find something to do besides the nursery games disguised under new forms for
                        the grown-up yet never to be grown-up infants of the world. &quot;And
                            <hi rend="i">that</hi> kind of politics doesn&apos;t sound shallow
                        and dull. There&apos;s heart in itand brainsreal brainsnot merely nasty
                        little self-seeking cunning.&quot; She took up the handbill again and
                        read a paragraph set in bolder type:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The reason we of the working class are slaves is because we
                        haven&apos;t intelligence enough to be our own masters, let alone
                        masters of anybody else. The talk of equality, workingmen, is nonsense to
                        flatter your silly, ignorant vanity. We are not the equals of our masters.
                        They know more than we do, and naturally they use that knowledge to make us
                        work for them. So, even if you win in this strike or in all your strikes,
                        you will not much better yourselves. Because you are ignorant and foolish,
                        your masters will scheme around and take from you in some other way what you
                        have wrenched from them in the strike.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Organize! Think! Learn! Then you will rise out of the dirt where
                        you wallow with your wives and your children. Don&apos;t blame your
                        masters; they don&apos;t enslave you. They don&apos;t keep you in
                        slavery. Your chains <pb id="VAA2368-057" n="53"/> are of your own forging
                        and only you can strike them off!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Certainly no tenement house woman could be lazier, emptier of head, more
                        inane of life than her sister Martha. &quot;She wouldn&apos;t even
                        keep clean if it wasn&apos;t the easiest thing in the world for her to
                        do, and a help at filling in her long idle day.&quot; YetMartha Galland
                        had every comfort and most of the luxuries, was as sheltered from all the
                        hardships as a hot-house flower. Then there was Hugoto go no further afield
                        than the family. Had he ever done an honest hour&apos;s work in his
                        life? Could anyone have less brains than he? Yet Hugo was rich and
                        respected, was a director in big corporations, was a member of a first-class
                        law firm. &quot;It isn&apos;t fair,&quot; thought the girl.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve always felt it. I see now why. It&apos;s a bad
                        system of taking from the many for the benefit of us few. And it&apos;s
                        kept going by a few clever, strong men like father. They work for themselves
                        and their families and relatives and for their classand the rest of the
                        people have to suffer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not fall asleep for several hours, such was the tumult in her aroused
                        brain. The first thing the next morning she went down town, bought copies of
                        the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi>for that week and for a few preceding weeksand
                        retreated to her favorite nook in her father&apos;s grounds to read and
                        to thinkand to plan. She searched the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> in vain for
                        any of the wild, wandering things Davy and her father had told her Victor
                        Dorn was putting forth. The four pages of <pb id="VAA2368-058" n="54"/> each
                        number were given over either to philosophical articles no more
                        &quot;anarchistic&quot; than Emerson&apos;s essays, not so much
                        so as Carlyle&apos;s, or to plain accounts of the current stealing by
                        the politicians of Remsen City, of the squalor and disease-danger in the
                        tenements, of the outrages by the gas and water and street car companies.
                        There was much that was terrible, much that was sad, much that was
                        calculated to make an honest heart burn with indignation against those who
                        were cheerily sacrificing the whole community to their desire for profits
                        and dividends and graft, public and private. But there was also a great deal
                        of humorof rather a sardonic kind, but still seeing the fantastic side of
                        this grand game of swindle.</p>
                    <p>Two paragraphs made an especial impression on her: &quot;Remsen City is
                        no worseand no betterthan other American cities. It&apos;s typical. But
                        we who live here needn&apos;t worry about the rest of the country. The
                        thing for us to do is to <hi rend="i">clean up at home.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;We are more careful than any paper in this town about verifying
                        every statement we make, before we make it. If we should publish a single
                        statement about anyone that was false even in part we would be suppressed.
                        The judges, the bosses, the owners of the big blood-sucking public service
                        corporations, the whole ruling class, are eager to put us out of existence.
                        Don&apos;t forget this fact when you hear the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi>
                        called a lying, demagogical sheet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With the paper beside her on the rustic bench, she <pb id="VAA2368-059"
                            n="55"/> fell to dreamingnot of a brighter and better world, of a wiser
                        and freer race, but of Victor Dorn, the personality that had unaided become
                        such a power in Remsen City, the personality that sparkled and glowed in the
                        interesting pages of the <hi rend="i">New Day,</hi> that made its sentences
                        read as if they were spoken into your very ears by an earnest, honest voice
                        issuing from a fascinating, humor-loving, intensely human and natural person
                        before your very eyes. But it was not round Victor Dorn&apos;s brain
                        that her imagination played.</p>
                    <p>&quot;After all,&quot; thought she, &quot;Napoleon
                        wasn&apos;t much over five feet. Most of the big men have been little
                        men. Of course, there were Alexanderand Washingtonand Lincoln, buthow silly
                        to bother about a few inches of height, more or less! And he wasn&apos;t
                        really <hi rend="i">short.</hi> Let me seehow high did he come on Davy when
                        Davy was standing near him? Above his shoulderand Davy&apos;s six feet
                        two or three. He&apos;s at least as tall as I amanyhow, in my ordinary
                        heels.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was attracted by both the personalities she discovered in the little
                        journal. She believed she could tell them apart. About some of the articles,
                        the shorter ones, she was doubtful. But in those of any length she could
                        feel that difference which enables one to distinguish the piano touch of a
                        player in another roomwhether it is male or female. Presently she was
                        searching for an excuse for scraping acquaintance with this pair of
                        pariahspariahs so far as her world was concerned. And soon she found it. The
                            <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> was <pb id="VAA2368-060" n="56"/> taking
                        subscriptions for a fund to send sick children and their mothers to the
                        country for a vacation from the dirt and heat of the tenementsfor Remsen
                        City, proud though it was and boastful of its prosperity, housed most of its
                        inhabitants in slumsthough of course that low sort of people
                        oughtn&apos;t really to be countedexcept for purposes of swelling census
                        figuresand to do all the rough and dirty work necessary to keep civilization
                        going.</p>
                    <p>She would subscribe to this worthy charityand would take her subscription,
                        herself. Settledeasily and well settled. She did not involve herself, or
                        commit herself in any way. Besides, those who might find out and might think
                        she had overstepped the bounds would excuse her on the ground that she had
                        not been back at home long and did not realize what she was doing.</p>
                    <p>What should she wear?</p>
                    <p>Her instinct was for an elaborate toileta descent in stateor such state as
                        the extremely limited resources of Martin Hastings&apos; stables would
                        permit. The traps he had ordered for her had not yet come; she had been glad
                        to accept David Hull&apos;s offer of a lift the night before. Still,
                        without a carriage or a motor she could make quite an impression with a
                        Paris walking dress and hat, properly supported by fashionable accessories
                        of the toilet. Good sense and good taste forbade these promptings of nature.
                        No, she would dress most simplyin her very plainest thingstaking care to
                        maintain all her advantages of face and figure. <pb id="VAA2368-061" n="57"
                        /> If she overwhelmed Dorn and Miss Gordon, she would defeat her own
                        purposewould not become acquainted with them.</p>
                    <p>In the end she rejected both courses and decided for the riding costume. The
                        reason she gave for this decisionthe reason she gave herselfwas that the
                        riding costume would invest the call with an air of accident, of impulse.
                        The real reason.</p>
                    <p>It may be that some feminine reader can guess why she chose the most
                        startling, the most gracefully becoming, the most artlessly physical apparel
                        in her wardrobe.</p>
                    <p>She said nothing to her father at lunch about her plans. Why should she speak
                        of them? He might oppose; also, she might change her mind. After lunch she
                        set out on her usual ride, galloping away into the hillsbut she had put
                        twenty-five dollars in bills in her trousers pocket. She rode until she felt
                        that her color was at its best, and then she made for towna swift, direct
                        ride, her heart beating high as if she were upon a most daring and fateful
                        adventure. And, as a matter of fact, never in her life had she done anything
                        that so intensely interested her. She felt that she was for the first time
                        slackening rein upon those unconventional instincts, of unknown strength and
                        purpose, which had been making her restless with their vague stirrings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How silly of me!&quot; she thought. &quot;I&apos;m
                        doing a commonplace, rather common thingand I&apos;m trying to <pb
                            id="VAA2368-062" n="58"/> make it seem a daring, romantic adventure. I
                            <hi rend="i">must</hi> be hard up for excitement!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Toward the middle of the afternoon she dropped from her horse before the
                        office of the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> and gave a boy the bridle.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll be back in a minute,&quot; she explained. It was
                        a two-story frame building, dingy and in disrepair. On the street floor was
                        a grocery. Access to the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> was by a rickety
                        stairway. As she ascended this, making a great noise on its unsteady boards
                        with her boots, she began to feel cheap and foolish. She recalled what Hull
                        had said in the carriage. &quot;No doubt,&quot; replied she,
                        &quot;I&apos;d feel much the same way if I were going to see Jesus
                        Christa carpenter&apos;s son, sitting in some hovel, talking with his
                        friends the fishermen and camel driversnot to speak of the women.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> occupied two small roomsan editorial work room,
                        and a printing work room behind it. Jane Hastings, in the doorway at the
                        head of the stairs, was seeing all there was to see. In the editorial room
                        were two tableskitchen tables, littered with papers and journals, as was the
                        floor, also. At the table directly opposite the door no one was
                        sitting&quot;Victor Dorn&apos;s desk,&quot; Jane decided. At the
                        table by the open window sat a girl, bent over her writing. Jane saw that
                        the figure was below, probably much below, the medium height for woman, that
                        it was slight and strong, that it was clad in a simple, clean gray linen
                        dress. The girl&apos;s black hair, drawn into a plain <pb
                            id="VAA2368-063" n="59"/> but distinctly graceful knot, was of that
                        dense and wavy thickness which is a characteristic and a beauty of the
                        Hebrew race. The skin at the nape of her neck, on her hands, on her arms
                        bare to the elbows was of a beautiful dead-whitethe skin that so admirably
                        compliments dead-black hair.</p>
                    <p>Before disturbing this busy writer Jane glanced round. There was nothing to
                        detain her in the view of the busy printing plant in the room beyond. But on
                        the walls of the room before her were four pictureslithographs, cheap, not
                        framed, held in place by a tack at each corner. There was Washingtonthen
                        Lincolnthen a copy of Leonardo&apos;s Jesus in the Last Supper frescoand
                        a fourth face, bearded, powerful, imperious, yet wonderfully kind and good
                        humoreda face she did not know. Pointing her riding stick at it she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;And who is that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>With a quick but not in the least a startled movement the girl at the table
                        straightened her form, turned in her chair, saying, as she did so, without
                        having seen the pointing stick:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is MarxKarl Marx.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was so astonished by the face she was now seeingthe face of the girlthat
                        she did not hear the reply. The girl&apos;s hair and skin had reminded
                        her of what Martha had told her about the Jewish, or half-Jewish, origin of
                        Selma Gordon. Thus, she assumed that she would see a frankly Jewish face.
                        Instead, <pb id="VAA2368-064" n="60"/> the face looking at her from beneath
                        the wealth of thick black hair, carelessly parted near the centre, was
                        Russianwas Cossackstrange and primeval, intense, dark, as superbly alive as
                        one of those exuberant tropical flowers that seem to cry out the mad joy of
                        life. Only, those flowers suggest the evanescent, the flame burning so
                        fiercely that it must soon burn out, while this Russian girl declared that
                        life was eternal. You could not think of her as sick, as old, as anything
                        but young and vigorous and vivid, as full of energy as a healthy baby that
                        kicks its dresses into rags and wears out the strength of its strapping
                        nurse. Her nose was as straight as Jane&apos;s own particularly fine
                        example of nose. Her dark gray eyes, beneath long, slender, coal black lines
                        of brow, were brimming with life and with fun. She had a wide, frank,
                        scarlet mouth; her teeth were small and sharp and regular, and of the strong
                        and healthy shade of white. She had a very small, but a very resolute chin.
                        With another quick, free movement she stood up. She was indeed small, but
                        formed in proportion. She seemed out of harmony with her linen dress. She
                        looked as if she ought to be careening on the steppes in some romantic,
                        half-savage costume. Jane&apos;s first and instant thought was,
                        &quot;There&apos;s not another like her in the whole world.
                        She&apos;s the only living specimen of her kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Gracious!&quot; exclaimed Jane. &quot;But you <hi rend="i"
                            >are</hi> healthy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The smile took full advantage of the opportunity to broaden into a laugh. A
                        most flattering expression of <pb id="VAA2368-065" n="61"/> frank, childlike
                        admiration came into the dark gray eyes. &quot;You&apos;re not
                        sickly, yourself,&quot; replied Selma. Jane was disappointed that the
                        voice was not untamed Cossack, but was musically civilized.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, but I don&apos;t flaunt it as you do,&quot; rejoined
                        Jane. &quot;You&apos;d make anyone who was the least bit off,
                        furious.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma, still with the child-like expression, but now one of curiosity, was
                        examining Jane&apos;s masculine riding dress. &quot;What a sensible
                        suit!&quot; she cried, delightedly. &quot;I&apos;d wear
                        something like that all the time, if I dared.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dared?&quot; said Jane. &quot;You don&apos;t look like
                        the frightened sort.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not on account of myself,&quot; explained Selma. &quot;On
                        account of the cause. You see, we are fighting for a new idea. So, we have
                        to be careful not to offend people&apos;s prejudices about ideas not so
                        important. If we went in for everything that&apos;s sensible,
                        we&apos;d be regarded as cranks. One thing at a time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s glance shifted to the fourth picture.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t you say that wasKarl Marx?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He wrote a book on political economy. I tried to read it at
                        college. But I couldn&apos;t. It was too heavy for me. He was a
                        Socialistwasn&apos;t he?the founder of Socialism?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A great deal more than that,&quot; replied Selma. &quot;He
                        was the most important man for human liberty that ever livedexcept perhaps
                        one.&quot; And she looked at <pb id="VAA2368-066" n="62"/>
                        Leonardo&apos;s &quot;man of sorrows and acquainted with
                        grief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marx was aa Hebrewwasn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s eyes danced, and Jane felt that she was laughing at her
                        hesitation and choice of the softer word. Selma said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yeshe was a Jew. Both were Jews.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Both?&quot; inquired Jane, puzzled.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Marx and Jesus,&quot; explained Selma.</p>
                    <p>Jane was startled. &quot;So <hi rend="i">He</hi> was a Jewwasn&apos;t
                        He?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And they were both labor leaderslabor agitators. The first one
                        proclaimed the brotherhood of man. But he regarded this world as hopeless
                        and called on the weary and heavy laden masses to look to the next world for
                        the righting of their wrongs. Theneighteen centuries aftercame that second
                        Jew&quot;Selma looked passionate, reverent admiration at the powerful,
                        bearded face, so masterful, yet so kind&quot;and he said: &apos;No!
                        not in the hereafter, but in the here. Here and now, my brothers. Let us
                        make this world a heaven. Let us redeem ourselves and destroy the devil of
                        ignorance who is holding us in this hell.&apos; It was three hundred
                        years before that first Jew began to triumph. It won&apos;t be so long
                        before there are monuments to Marx in clean and beautiful and free cities
                        all over the earth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane listened intensely. There was admiring envy in her eyes as she cried:
                        &quot;How splendidto believe in somethingand work for it and live for
                        itas you do!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-067" n="63"/>
                    <p>Selma laughed, with a charming little gesture of the shoulders and the hands
                        that reminded Jane of her foreign parentage. &quot;Nothing else seems
                        worth while,&quot; said she. &quot;Nothing else is worth while.
                        There are only two entirely great careersto be a teacher of the right kind
                        and work to ease men&apos;s mindsas those four didor to be a doctor of
                        the right kind and work to make mankind healthy. All the suffering, all the
                        crime, all the wickedness, comes from ignorance or bad healthor both.
                        Usually it&apos;s simply bad health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane felt as if she were devoured of thirst and drinking at a fresh,
                        sparkling spring. &quot;I never thought of that before,&quot; said
                        she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you find out all about any criminal, big or little,
                        you&apos;ll discover that he had bad healthpoisons in his blood that
                        goaded him on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane nodded. &quot;Whenever I&apos;m difficult to get on with,
                        I&apos;m always not quite well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can see that your disposition is perfect, when you are
                        well,&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And yours,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;m never out of humor,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;You see, I&apos;m never sicknot the least bit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are Miss Gordon, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI&apos;m Selma Gordon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My name is Jane Hastings.&quot; Then as this seemed to convey
                        nothing to Selma, Jane added: &quot;I&apos;m not like you. I
                        haven&apos;t an individuality of my ownthat <pb id="VAA2368-068" n="64"
                        /> anybody knows about. So, I&apos;ll have to identify myself by saying
                        that I&apos;m Martin Hastings&apos; daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane confidently expected that this announcement would cause some sort of
                        emotionperhaps of awe, perhaps of horror, certainly of interest. She was
                        disappointed. If Selma felt anything she did not show itand Jane was of the
                        opinion that it would be well nigh impossible for so direct and natural a
                        person to conceal. Jane went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I read in your paper about your fund for sick children. I was
                        riding past your officesaw the signand I&apos;ve come in to give what I
                        happen to have about me.&quot; She drew out the small roll of bills and
                        handed it to Selma.</p>
                    <p>The Russian girlif it is fair thus to characterize one so intensely American
                        in manner, in accent and in speechtook the money and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll acknowledge it in the paper next week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane flushed and a thrill of alarm ran through her.
                        &quot;Ohpleaseno,&quot; she urged. &quot;I&apos;d not like
                        to have my name mentioned. That would look as if I had done it to seem
                        charitable. Besides, it&apos;s such a trifle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma was calm and apparently unsuspicious. &quot;Very well,&quot;
                        said she. &quot;We&apos;ll write, telling what we did with the
                        money, so that you can investigate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I trust you entirely,&quot; cried Jane.</p>
                    <p>Selma shook her head. &quot;But we don&apos;t wish to be
                        trusted,&quot; said she. &quot;Only dishonest people wish to be <pb
                            id="VAA2368-069" n="65"/> trusted when it&apos;s possible to avoid
                        trusting. And we all need watching. It helps us to keep straight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t agree with you,&quot; protested Miss
                        Hastings. &quot;Lots of the time I&apos;d hate to be watched. I
                        don&apos;t want everybody to know <hi rend="i">all</hi> I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s eyes opened. &quot;Why not?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Jane cast about for a way to explain what seemed to her a self-evident truth.
                        &quot;I meanprivacy,&quot; she said. &quot;For instance, if you
                        were in love, you&apos;d not want everybody to know about it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; declared Selma. &quot;I&apos;d be
                        tremendously proud of it. It must be wonderful to be in love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In one of those curious twists of feminine nature, Miss Hastings suddenly
                        felt the glow of a strong, unreserved liking for this strange, candid girl.</p>
                    <p>Selma went on: &quot;But I&apos;m afraid I never shall be. I get no
                        time to think about myself. From rising till bed time my work pushes at
                        me.&quot; She glanced uneasily at her desk, apologetically at Miss
                        Hastings. &quot;I ought to be writing this minute. The strike is
                        occupying Victor, and I&apos;m helping out with his work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m interrupting,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll go.&quot; She put out her hand with her best,
                        her sweetest smile. &quot;We&apos;re going to be
                        friendsaren&apos;t we?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma clasped her hand heartily and said: &quot;We <hi rend="i">are</hi>
                        friends. I like everybody. There&apos;s always something to like in
                        everyoneand the bad part isn&apos;t their fault. But it isn&apos;t
                        often that I like anyone so much as I do <pb id="VAA2368-070" n="66"/> you.
                        You are so direct and honestquite different from the other women of your
                        class that I&apos;ve met.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane felt unaccountably grateful and humble. &quot;I&apos;m afraid
                        you&apos;re too generous. I guess you&apos;re not a very good judge
                        of people,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So VictorVictor Dornsays,&quot; laughed Selma. &quot;He
                        says I&apos;m too confiding. Wellwhy not? And really, he trusts
                        everybody, tooexcept with the cause. Then
                        he&apos;she&apos;s&quot;she glanced from face to face of the
                        four pictures&quot;he&apos;s like those men.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s glance followed Selma&apos;s. She said: &quot;YesI
                        should imagine sofrom what I&apos;ve heard.&quot; She startled,
                        flushed, hid behind a somewhat constrained manner. &quot;Will you come
                        up to my house to lunch?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I can find time,&quot; said Selma. &quot;But
                        I&apos;d rather come and take you for a walk. I have to walk two hours
                        every day. It&apos;s the only thing that&apos;ll keep my head
                        clear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When will you come?to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is nine o&apos;clock too early?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane reflected that her father left for business at half-past eight.
                        &quot;Nine to-morrow,&quot; she said. &quot;Goodby
                        again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she was mounting her horse, she saw &quot;the Cossack girl,&quot;
                        as she was calling her, writing away at the window hardly three feet above
                        the level of Jane&apos;s head when she was mounted, so low was the first
                        story of the battered old frame house. But Selma did not see her; she was
                        all intent upon the writing. &quot;She&apos;s forgotten me <pb
                            id="VAA2368-071" n="67"/> already,&quot; thought Jane with a pang of
                        jealous vanity. She added: &quot;But <hi rend="i">she</hi> has <hi
                            rend="i">something</hi> to think aboutshe and Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was so preoccupied that she rode away with only an absent thank you for
                        the small boy, in an older and much larger and wider brother&apos;s
                        cast-off shirt, suspenders and trousers. At the corner of the avenue she
                        remembered and turned her horse. There stood the boy gazing after her with a
                        hypnotic intensity that made her smile. She rode back fumbling in her
                        pockets. &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said she to the boy. Then
                        she called up to Selma Gordon:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Gordonpleasewill you lend me a quarter until
                        to-morrow?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma looked up, stared dazedly at her, smiled absently at Miss Hastingsand
                        Miss Hastings had the strongest confirmation of her suspicion that Selma had
                        forgotten her and her visit the instant she vanished from the threshold of
                        the office. Said Selma: &quot;A quarter?oh, yescertainly.&quot; She
                        seemed to be searching a drawer or a purse out of sight. &quot;I
                        haven&apos;t anything but a five dollar bill. I&apos;m so
                        sorry&quot;this in an absent manner, with most of her thoughts evidently
                        still upon her work. She rose, leaned from the window, glanced up the
                        street, then down. She went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;There comes Victor Dorn. He&apos;ll lend it to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Along the ragged brick walk at a quick pace the man who had in such abrupt
                        fashion stormed Jane <pb id="VAA2368-072" n="68"/> Hasting&apos;s fancy
                        and taken possession of her curiosity was advancing with a basket on his
                        arm. He was indeed a man of small statureabout the medium height for a
                        womanabout the height of Jane Hastings. But his figure was so well put
                        together and his walk so easy and free from self-consciousness that the
                        question of stature no sooner arose than it was dismissed. His head
                        commanded all the attentionits poise and the remarkable face that fronted
                        it. The features were bold, the skin was clear and healthy and rather fair.
                        His eyesgray or green blue and set neither prominently nor retreatedlyseemed
                        to be seeing and understanding all that was going on about him. He had a
                        strong, rather relentless mouththe mouth of men who make and compel
                        sacrifices for their ambitions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor,&quot; cried Selma as soon as he was within easy range
                        of her voice, &quot;please lend Miss Hastings a quarter.&quot; And
                        she immediately sat down and went to work again, with the incident dismissed
                        from mind.</p>
                    <p>The young manfor he was plainly not far beyond thirtyhalted and regarded the
                        young woman on the horse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wish to give this young gentleman here a quarter,&quot; said
                        Jane. &quot;He was very good about holding my horse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The words were not spoken before the young gentleman darted across the narrow
                        street and into a yard hidden by masses of clematis, morning glory and sweet
                            <pb id="VAA2368-073" n="69"/> peas. And Jane realized that she had
                        wholly mistaken the meaning of that hypnotic stare.</p>
                    <p>Victor laughedthe small figure, the vast clothes, the bare feet with
                        voluminous trousers about them made a ludicrous sight. &quot;He
                        doesn&apos;t want it,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Thank you just
                        the same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I want him to have it,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>With a significant unconscious glance at her costume Dorn said:
                        &quot;Those costumes haven&apos;t reached our town yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He did some work for me. I owe it to him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s my sister&apos;s little boy,&quot; said Dorn,
                        with his amiable, friendly smile. &quot;We mustn&apos;t start him in
                        the bad way of expecting pay for politeness.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane colored as if she had been rebuked, when in fact his tone forbade the
                        suggestion of rebuke. There was an unpleasant sparkle in her eyes as she
                        regarded the young man in the baggy suit, with the basket on his arm.
                        &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said she coldly. &quot;I
                        naturally didn&apos;t know your peculiar point of view.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all right,&quot; said Dorn carelessly.
                        &quot;Thank you, and good day.&quot; And with a polite raising of
                        the hat and a manner of good humored friendliness that showed how utterly
                        unconscious he was of her being offended at him, he hastened across the
                        street and went in at the gate where the boy had vanished. And Jane had the
                        sense that he had forgotten her. She glanced nervously up at the window to
                        see whether Selma Gordon was witnessing her humiliationfor so she regarded
                            <pb id="VAA2368-074" n="70"/> it. But Selma was evidently lost in a
                        world of her own. &quot;She doesn&apos;t love him,&quot; Jane
                        decided. &quot;For, even though she is a strange kind of person,
                        she&apos;s a womanand if she had loved him she couldn&apos;t have
                        helped watching while he talked with another womanespecially with one of my
                        appearance and class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane rode slowly away. At the cornerit was a long blockshe glanced toward the
                        scene she had just quitted. Involuntarily she drew rein. Victor and the boy
                        had come out into the street and were playing catches. The game did not last
                        long. Dorn let the boy corner him and seize him, then gave him a great toss
                        into the air, catching him as he came down and giving him a hug and a kiss.
                        The boy ran shouting merrily into the yard; Victor disappeared in the
                        entrance to the offices of the <hi rend="i">New Day.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>That evening, as she pretended to listen to Hull on national politics, and
                        while dressing the following morning Jane reflected upon her adventure. She
                        decided that Dorn and the &quot;wild girl&quot; were a low,
                        ill-mannered pair with whom she had nothing in common, that her fantastic,
                        impulsive interest in them had been killed, that for the future she would
                        avoid &quot;all that sort of cattle.&quot; She would receive Selma
                        Gordon politely, of coursewould plead headache as an excuse for not walking,
                        would get rid of her as soon as possible. &quot;No doubt,&quot;
                        thought Jane, with the familiar, though indignantly denied, complacence of
                        her class, &quot;as soon as she gets in here she&apos;ll want to
                        hang on. She played <pb id="VAA2368-075" n="71"/> it very well, but she must
                        have been crazy with delight at my noticing her and offering to take her
                        up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The postman came as Jane was finishing breakfast. He brought a note from
                        Selmaa hasty pencil scrawl on a sheet of printer&apos;s copy paper: <text>
                            <body>
                                <div type="letter">
                                    <opener>&quot;Dear Miss Hastings:</opener>
                                    <p>For the present I&apos;m too busy to take my walks. So,
                                        I&apos;ll not be there to-morrow. With best regards,</p>
                                    <closer>
                                        <signed>S. G.&apos;</signed>
                                    </closer>
                                </div>
                            </body>
                        </text>
                    </p>
                    <p>Such a fury rose up in Jane that the undigested breakfast went wrong and put
                        her in condition to give such exhibition as chance might tempt of that
                        ugliness of disposition which appears from time to time in all of us not of
                        the meek and worm-like class, and which we usually attribute to any cause
                        under the sun but the vulgar right one. &quot;The
                        impertinence!&quot; muttered Jane, with a second glance at the note
                        which conveyed, among other humiliating things, an impression of her own
                        absolute lack of importance to Selma Gordon. &quot;Serves me right for
                        lowering myself to such people. If I wanted to try to do anything for the
                        working class I&apos;d have to keep away from them. They&apos;re so
                        unattractive to look at and to associate withnot like those shrewd,
                        respectful, interesting peasants one finds on the other side.
                        They&apos;re better in the East. They know their place in a way. But out
                        here they&apos;re insufferable.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she spent the morning quarrelling with her maid and the other servants,
                        issuing orders right and left, working herself into a horrible mood
                        dominated by a <pb id="VAA2368-076" n="72"/> headache that was anything but
                        a pretense. As she wandered about the house and gardens, she trailed a
                        beautiful negligee with that carelessness which in a woman of clean and
                        orderly habits invariably indicates the possession of many clothes and of a
                        maid who can be counted on to freshen things up before they shall be used
                        again. Her father came home to lunch in high good humor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not go down town again for a few days,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;I reckon I&apos;d best keep out of the way. That
                        scoundrelly Victor Dorn has done so much lying and inciting these last four
                        or five years that it ain&apos;t safe for a man like me to go about when
                        there&apos;s trouble with the hands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it outrageous!&quot; exclaimed Jane.
                        &quot;He ought to be stopped.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings chuckled and nodded. &quot;And he will be,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Wait till this strike&apos;s over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When will that be?&quot; asked Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mighty soon,&quot; replied her father. &quot;I was ready
                        for &apos;em this timegood and ready. I&apos;ve sent word to the
                        governor that I want the militia down here tomorrow&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Has there been a riot?&quot; cried Jane anxiously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Hastings. He was laughing to himself.
                        &quot;But there will be to-night. Then the governor&apos;ll send the
                        troops in to-morrow afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But maybe the men&apos;ll be quiet, and then&quot; began
                        Jane, sick inside and trembling.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-077" n="73"/>
                    <p>&quot;When I say a thing&apos;ll happen, it&apos;ll
                        happen,&quot; interrupted her father. &quot;We&apos;ve made up
                        our minds it&apos;s time to give these fellows a lesson. It&apos;s
                        got to be done. A milder lesson&apos;ll serve now, where later on
                        it&apos;d have to be hard. I tell you these things because I want you to
                        remember &apos;em. They&apos;ll come in handywhen you&apos;ll
                        have to look after your own property.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She knew how her father hated the thought of his own death; this was the
                        nearest he had ever come to speaking of it. &quot;Of course,
                        there&apos;s your brother William,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;William&apos;s a good boyand a mighty good business manthough
                        he does take risks I&apos;d never &apos;a tooknot even when I was
                        young and had nothing to lose. Yesand Billy&apos;s honest. <hi rend="i"
                            >But&quot;</hi>the big head shook
                        impressively&quot;William&apos;s human, Jennydon&apos;t ever
                        forget that. The love of money&apos;s an awful thing.&quot; A
                        lustful glitter like the shine of an inextinguishable fire made his eyes
                        fascinating and terrible. &quot;It takes hold of a man and never lets
                        go. To see the money pile upand upand up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The girl turned away her gaze. She did not wish to see so far into her
                        father&apos;s soul. It seemed a hideous indecency.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So, Jennydon&apos;t trust William, but look after your own
                        property.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t care anything about it, popsy,&quot; she
                        cried, fighting to think of him and to speak to him as simply the living
                        father she had always insisted on seeing.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-078" n="74"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yesyou do care,&quot; said Hastings sharply.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve got to have your money, because that&apos;s
                        your foundationwhat you&apos;re built on. And I&apos;m going to
                        train you. This here strike&apos;s a good time to begin.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a long silence she said: &quot;Yes, money&apos;s what
                        I&apos;m built on. I might as well recognize the truth and act
                        accordingly. I want you to teach me, father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to educate you so as, when you get control, you
                        won&apos;t go and do fool sentimental things like some womenand some men
                        that warn&apos;t trained practicallymen like that Davy Hull you think so
                        well of. Things that&apos;d do no good and &apos;d make you smaller
                        and weaker.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said the girl. &quot;About this
                            strike<hi rend="i">why</hi> won&apos;t you give the men shorter
                        hours and better pay?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because the company can&apos;t afford it. As things are now,
                        there&apos;s only enough left for a three per cent dividend after the
                        interest on the bonds is paid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had read in the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> that by a series of tricks the
                        &quot;traction ring&quot; had quadrupled the bonded indebtedness of
                        the roads and multiplied the stock by six, and had pocketed the proceeds of
                        the steal; that three per cent on the enormously inflated capital was in
                        fact eighteen per cent on the actual stock value; that seven per cent on the
                        bonds was in fact twenty-eight per cent on the actual bonded indebtedness;
                        that this traction steal was a fair illustration of how in a score of ways
                        in Remsen City, in a thousand and one <pb id="VAA2368-079" n="75"/> ways in
                        all parts of the country, the upper class was draining away the substance of
                        the masses, was swindling them out of their just wages, was forcing them to
                        pay many times the just prices for every article of civilized use. She had
                        read these thingsshe had thought about themshe had realized that they were
                        true.</p>
                    <p>She did not put to her father the question that was on her lipsthe next
                        logical question after his answer that the company could not afford to cut
                        the hours lower than fourteen or to raise wages to what was necessary for a
                        man to have if he and his family were to live, not in decency and comfort,
                        but in something less than squalor. She did not put the question because she
                        wished to spare her fatherto spare herself the shame of hearing his tricky
                        answerto spare herself the discomfort of squarely facing a nasty truth.</p>
                    <p>Instead she said: &quot;I understand. And you have got to look out for
                        the rights of the people who have invested their money.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I didn&apos;t I&apos;d be cheating them,&quot; said
                        Hastings. &quot;And if the men don&apos;t like their jobs, why, they
                        can quit and get jobs they do like.&quot; He added, in absolute
                        unconsciousness of his inconsistency, in absolute belief in his own honesty
                        and goodness, &quot;The truth is our company pays as high wages as can
                        be got anywhere. As for them hourswhen <hi rend="i">I</hi> was working my
                        way up, <hi rend="i">I</hi> used to put in sixteen and eighteen hours a day,
                        and was mighty glad to do it. This lazy talk of <pb id="VAA2368-080" n="76"
                        /> cutting down hours makes me sick. And these fellows that&apos;re
                        always kicking on their jobs, I&apos;d like to know what&apos;d
                        become of them and their families if I and men like me didn&apos;t
                        provide work for &apos;em.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; cried Jane, eagerly seizing upon this
                        attractive view of the situationand resolutely accepting it without
                        question.</p>
                    <p>In came one of the maids, saying: &quot;There&apos;s a man wants to
                        see you, Mr. Hastings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s his name? What does he want?&quot; inquired
                        Hastings, while Jane made a mental note that she must try to inject at least
                        a little order and form into the manners of announcing visitors.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t give a name. He just said, &apos;Tell the
                        old man I want to see him.&apos; I ain&apos;t sure, but I think
                        it&apos;s Dick Kelly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Lizzie was an ardent Democrat, she spoke the name contemptuouslyfor Dick
                        Kelly was the Republican boss. If it had been House, the Democratic boss and
                        Kelly&apos;s secret dependent and henchman, she would have said
                        &quot;Mr. Joseph House&quot; in a tone of deep respect.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kelly,&quot; said Hastings. &quot;Must be something
                        important or he&apos;d &apos;a telephoned or asked me to see him at
                        my office or at the Lincoln Club. He never came out here before. Bring him
                        in, Lizzie.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A moment and there appeared in the doorway a man of perhaps forty years who
                        looked like a prosperous contractor who had risen from the ranks. His figure
                            <pb id="VAA2368-081" n="77"/> was notable for its solidity and for the
                        power of the shoulders; but already there were indications that the
                        solidity, come of hard manual labor in early life, was soon to soften into
                        fat under the melting influence of prosperity and the dissipation it put
                        within too easy reach. The striking features of his face were a pair of
                        keen, hard, greenish eyes and a jaw that protruded uglilythe jaw of
                        aggressiveness, not the too prominent jaw of weakness. At sight of Jane he
                        halted awkwardly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How&apos;re you, Mr. Hastings?&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Dick,&quot; said the old man. &quot;This is my
                        daughter Jane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane smiled a pleasant recognition of the introduction. Kelly said stiffly,
                        &quot;How&apos;re you, ma&apos;am?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Want to see me alone, I suppose?&quot; Hastings went on.
                        &quot;You go out on the porch, Jenny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As soon as Jane disappeared Kelly&apos;s stiffness and clumsiness
                        vanished. To head off Hastings&apos; coming offer of a cigar, he drew
                        one from his pocket and lighted it. &quot;There&apos;s hell to pay,
                        Mr. Hastings,&quot; he began, seating himself near the old man, tilting
                        back in his chair and crossing his legs.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I reckon you can take care of it,&quot; said Hastings
                        calmly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, we kin take care of it, all right. Only, I don&apos;t
                        want to do nothing without consulting you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In these two statements Mr. Kelly summed up the <pb id="VAA2368-082" n="78"/>
                        whole of politics in Remsen City, in any city anywhere, in the country at
                        large.</p>
                    <p>Kelly had started life as a blacksmith. But he soon tired of the dullness and
                        toil and started forth to find some path up to where men live by making
                        others work for them instead of plodding along at the hand-to-mouth
                        existence that is the lot of those who live by their own labors alone. He
                        was a safe blower for a while, but wisely soon abandoned that fascinating
                        but precarious and unremunerative career. From card sharp following the
                        circus and sheet-writer to a bookmaker he graduated into bartender, into
                        proprietor of a doggery. As every saloon is a political club, every
                        saloon-keeper is of necessity a politician. Kelly&apos;s woodbox
                        happened to be a convenient place for directing the floaters and the
                        repeaters. Kelly&apos;s political importance grew apace. His
                        respectability grew more slowly. But it had grown and was growing.</p>
                    <p>If you had asked Lizzie, the maid, why she was a Democrat, she would have
                        given no such foolish reason as the average man gives. She would not have
                        twaddled about principleswhen everyone with eyeteeth cut ought to know that
                        principles have departed from politics, now that both parties have been
                        harmonized and organized into agencies of the plutocracy. She would not have
                        said she was a Democrat because her father was, or because all her friends
                        and associates were. She would have repliedin pleasantly Americanized Irish:</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-083" n="79"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m a Democrat because when my father got too old to work,
                        Mr. House, the Democrat leader, gave him a job on the elevator at the Court
                        Housethough that dirty thief and scoundrel, Kelly, the Republican boss,
                        owned all the judges and county officers. And when my brother lost his place
                        as porter because he took a drink too many, Mr. House gave him a card to the
                        foreman of the gas company, and he went to work at eight a week and is there
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kelly and Mr. House belong to a maligned and much misunderstood class.
                        Whenever you find anywhere in nature an activity of any kind, however
                        pestiferous its activity may seem to youor however goodyou may be sure that
                        if you look deep enough you will find that that activity has a use, arises
                        from a need. The &quot;robber trusts&quot; and the political bosses
                        are interesting examples of this basic truth. They have arisen because
                        science, revolutionizing human society, has compelled it to organize. The
                        organization is crude and clumsy and stupid, as yet, because men are
                        ignorant, are experimenting, are working in the dark. So, the organizing
                        forces are necessarily crude and clumsy and stupid.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hastings wasall unconsciouslyorganizing society industrially. Mr.
                        Kellyequally unconscious of the true nature of his activitieswas organizing
                        society politically. And as industry and politics areand ever have beenat
                        bottom two names for identically the same thing, Mr. Hastings <pb
                            id="VAA2368-084" n="80"/> and Mr. Kelly were bound sooner or later to
                        get together.</p>
                    <p>Remsen City was organized like every other large or largish community. There
                        were two clubsthe Lincoln and the Jeffersonwhich well enough represented the
                        &quot;respectable elements&quot;that is, those citizens who were of
                        the upper class. There were two other clubsthe Blaine and the Tildenwhich
                        were similarly representative of the &quot;rank and file&quot; and,
                        rather, of the petty officers who managed the rank and file and voted it and
                        told it what to think and what not to think, in exchange taking care of the
                        needy sick, of the aged, of those out of work and so on. Martin Hastingsthe
                        leading Republican citizen of Remsen City, though for obvious reasons his
                        political activities were wholly secret and stealthywas the leading spirit
                        in the Lincoln Club. Jared OldsRemsen City&apos;s richest and most
                        influential Democrat, the head of the gas company and the water companywas
                        foremost in the Jefferson Club. At the Lincoln and the Jefferson you rarely
                        saw any but &quot;gentlemen&quot;men of established position and
                        fortune, deacons and vestrymen, judges, corporation lawyers and the like.
                        The Blaine and the Tilden housed a livelier and a far less select classthe
                        &quot;boys&quot;the active politicians, the big saloon keepers, the
                        criminal lawyers, the gamblers, the chaps who knew how to round up floaters
                        and to handle gangs of repeaters, the active young sports working for
                        political position, by pitching and <pb id="VAA2368-085" n="81"/> carrying
                        for the political leaders, by doing their errands of charity or crookedness
                        or what not. Joe House was the &quot;big shout&quot; at the Tilden;
                        Dick Kelly could be found every evening on the thirdor
                        &quot;wine,&quot; or plottingfloor of the Blainefound holding court.
                        And very respectful indeed were even the most eminent of Lincoln, or
                        Jefferson, respectabilities who sought him out there to ask favors of him
                        out there to ask favors of him.</p>
                    <p>The bosses tend more and more to become mere flunkeys of the plutocrats.
                        Kelly belonged to the old school of boss, dating from the days when social
                        organization was in the early stages, when the political organizer was
                        feared and even served by the industrial organizer, the embryo plutocrats.
                        He realized how necessary he was to his plutocratic master, and he made that
                        master treat him almost as an equal. He was exacting ever larger pay for
                        taking care of the voters and keeping them fooled; he was getting rich, and
                        had as yet vague aspirations to respectability and fashion. He had stopped
                        drinking, had &quot;cut out the women,&quot; had made a beginning
                        toward a less inelegant way of speaking the language. His view of life was
                        what is called cynical. That is, he regarded himself as morally the equal of
                        the respectable rulers of societyor of the preachers who attended to the
                        religious part of the grand industry of &quot;keeping the cow quiet
                        while it was being milked.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Mr. Kelly was explaining to Martin Hastings <pb id="VAA2368-086" n="82"/>
                        what he meant when he said that there was &quot;hell to pay&quot;:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That infernal little cuss, Victor Dorn,&quot; said he
                        &quot;made a speech in the Court House Square to-day. Of course, none of
                        the decent papersand they&apos;re all decent except his&apos;nwill
                        publish any of it. Still, there was about a thousand people there before he
                        got throughand the thing&apos;ll spread.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Speech?what about?&quot; said Hastings. &quot;He&apos;s
                        always shooting off his mouth. He&apos;d better stop talking and go to
                        work at some honest business.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s got on to the fact that this strike is a put-up
                        jobthat the company hired labor detectives in Chicago last winter to come
                        down here and get hold of the union. He gave namesamounts paidthe whole damn
                        thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um,&quot; said Hastings, rubbing his skinny hands along the
                        shiny pantaloons over his meagre legs. &quot;Um.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But that ain&apos;t all,&quot; pursued Kelly. &quot;He
                        read out a list of the men told off to pretend to set fire to the car barns
                        and start the riotthose Chicago chaps, you know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know anything about it,&quot; said Hastings
                        sharply.</p>
                    <p>Kelly smiled slightlyamused scorn. It seemed absurd to him for the old man to
                        keep up the pretense of ignorance. In fact, Hastings was ignorantof the
                        details. He was not quite the aloof plutocrat of the modern school, who
                        permits himself to know nothing <pb id="VAA2368-087" n="83"/> of details
                        beyond the dividend rate and similar innocent looking results of causes at
                        which sometimes hell itself would shudder. But, while he was more active
                        than the conscience-easing devices now working smoothly made necessary, he
                        never permitted himself to know any unnecessary criminal or wicked fact
                        about his enterprises.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he repeated. &quot;And I
                        don&apos;t want to know.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anyhow, Dorn gave away the whole thing. He even read a copy of your
                        letter of introduction to the governorthe one youaccording to Dorngave
                        Fillmore when you sent him up to the Capitol to arrange for the invitation
                        to come after the riot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings knew that the boss was deliberately &quot;rubbing it
                        in&quot; because Hastingsthat is, Hastings&apos; agents had not
                        invited Kelly to assist in the project for &quot;teaching the labor
                        element a much needed lesson.&quot; But knowledge of Kelly&apos;s
                        motive did not make the truth he was telling any less truethe absurd
                        mismanagement of the whole affair, with the result that Dorn seemed in the
                        way to change it from a lesson to labor on the folly of revolt against their
                        kind and generous but firm employers into a provoker of fresh and fiercer
                        revolteffective revoltpolitical revolt. So, as Kelly
                        &quot;rubbed,&quot; Hastings visibly winced and writhed.</p>
                    <p>Kelly ended his recital with: &quot;The speech created a hell of a
                        sensation, Mr. Hastings. That young chap can talk.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-088" n="84"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; snapped Hastings. &quot;But he can&apos;t do
                        anything else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not so sure of that,&quot; replied Kelly, who was
                        wise enough to realize the value of a bogey like Dornits usefulness for
                        purposes of &quot;throwing a scare into the silk-stocking
                        crowd.&quot; &quot;Dorn&apos;s getting mighty strong with the
                        people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; retorted Hastings.
                        &quot;They&apos;ll listen to any slick tongued rascal that roasts
                        those that are more prosperous than they are. But when it comes to doing
                        anything, they know better. They envy and hate those that give them jobs,
                        but they need the jobs.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s a good deal of
                        truth in that, Mr. Hastings,&quot; said Kelly, who was nothing if not
                        judicial. &quot;But Dorn&apos;s mighty plausible. I hear sensible
                        men saying there&apos;s something more&apos;n hot air in his facts
                        and figgures.&quot; Kelly paused, and made the pause significant.
                        &quot;About that last block of traction stock, Mr. Hastings. I thought
                        you were going to let me in on the ground floor. But I ain&apos;t heard
                        nothing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">are</hi> in,&quot; said Hastings, who knew
                        when to yield. &quot;Hasn&apos;t Barker been to see you?
                        I&apos;ll attend to it, myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Hastings,&quot; said Kellydry and brief as
                        always when receipting with a polite phrase for pay for services rendered.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been a good friend to your people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you have, Dick,&quot; said the old man heartily.
                        &quot;And I want you to jump in and take charge.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-089" n="85"/>
                    <p>Hastings more than suspected that Kelly, to bring him to terms and to force
                        him to employ directly the high-priced Kelly or Republico-Democratic machine
                        as well as the State Republico-Democratic machine, which was cheaper, had
                        got together the inside information and had ordered one of his henchmen to
                        convey it to Dorn. But of what use to quarrel with Kelly? Of course, he
                        could depose him; but that would simply mean putting another boss in his
                        placeperhaps one more expensive and less efficient. The time had been when
                        heand the plutocracy generallywere compelled to come to the political bosses
                        almost hat in hand. That time was past, never to return. But still a
                        competent political agent was even harder to find than a competent business
                        managerand was far more necessary; for, while a big business might stagger
                        along under poor financial or organizing management within, it could not
                        live at all without political favors, immunities, and licenses. A band of
                        pickpockets might as well try to work a town without having first
                        &quot;squared&quot; the police. Not that Mr. Hastings and his
                        friends <hi rend="i">themselves</hi> compared themselves to a band of
                        pickpockets. No, indeed. It was simply legitimate business to blackjack your
                        competitors, corner a supply, create a monopoly and fix prices and wages to
                        suit your own notions of what was your due for taking the
                        &quot;hazardous risks of business enterprise.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Leave everything to me,&quot; said Kelly briskly. &quot;I
                            <pb id="VAA2368-090" n="86"/> can put the thing through. Just tell your
                        lawyer to apply late this afternoon to Judge Lansing for an injunction
                        forbidding the strikers to assemble anywhere within the county. We
                        don&apos;t want no more of this speechifying. This is a peaceable
                        community, and it won&apos;t stand for no agitators.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hadn&apos;t the lawyers better go to Judge Freilig?&quot;
                        said Hastings. &quot;He&apos;s shown himself to be a man of sound
                        ideas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;NoLansing,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;He don&apos;t come
                        up for re-election for five years. Freilig comes up next fall, and
                        we&apos;ll have hard work to pull him through, though House is going to
                        put him on the ticket, too. Dorn&apos;s going to make a hot
                        campaignconcentrate on judges.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s nothing in that Dorn talk,&quot; said
                        Hastings. &quot;You can&apos;t scare me again, Dick, as you did with
                        that Populist mare&apos;s nest ten years ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>That had been Kelly&apos;s first &quot;big killing&quot; by
                        working on the fears of the plutocracy. Its success had put him in a
                        position to buy a carriage and a diamond necklace for Mrs. Kelly and to make
                        first payments on a large block of real estate. &quot;It was no
                        mare&apos;s nest, Mr. Hastings,&quot; gravely declared the boss.
                        &quot;If I hadn&apos;t &apos;a knowed just how to use the money
                        we collected, there&apos;d &apos;a been a crowd in office for four
                        years that wouldn&apos;t &apos;a been easy to manage, I can tell
                        you. But they was nothing to this here Dorn crowd. Dorn is &quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-091" n="87"/>
                    <p>&quot;We must get rid of him, Dick,&quot; interrupted Hastings.</p>
                    <p>The two men looked at each othera curious glancetelegraphy. No method was
                        suggested, no price was offered or accepted. But in the circumstances those
                        matters became details that would settle themselves; the bargain was struck.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He certainly ought to be stopped,&quot; said Kelly carelessly.
                        &quot;He&apos;s the worst enemy the labor element has had in my
                        time.&quot; He rose. &quot;Well, Mr. Hastings, I must be
                        going.&quot; He extended his heavy, strong hand, which Hastings rose to
                        grasp. &quot;I&apos;m glad we&apos;re working together again
                        without any hitches. You won&apos;t forget about that there
                        stock?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll telephone about it right away, Dickand about Judge
                        Lansing. You&apos;re sure Lansing&apos;s all right? I
                        didn&apos;t like those decisions of his last yearthe railway cases, I
                        mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was all right, Mr. Hastings,&quot; said Kelly with a wave
                        of the hand. &quot;I had to have &apos;em in the interests of the
                        party. I knowed the upper court&apos;d reverse. No, Lansing&apos;s a
                        good party mana good, sound man in every way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad to hear it,&quot; said Hastings.</p>
                    <p>Before going into his private room to think and plan and telephone, he looked
                        out on the west veranda. There sat his daughter, and a few feet away was
                        David Hull, his long form stretched in a hammock while he discoursed of his
                        projects for a career as a <pb id="VAA2368-092" n="88"/> political reformer.
                        The sight immensely pleased the old man. When he was a boy David
                        Hull&apos;s grandfather, Brainerd Hull, had been the great man of that
                        region; and Martin Hastings, a farm hand and the son of a farm hand, had
                        looked up at him as the embodiment of all that was grand and aristocratic.
                        As Hastings had never travelled, his notions of rank and position all
                        centred about Remsen City. Had he realized the extent of the world, he would
                        have regarded his ambition for a match between the daughter and
                        granddaughter of a farm hand and the son and grandson of a Remsen City
                        aristocrat as small and ridiculous. But he did not realize.</p>
                    <p>Davy saw him and sprang to his feet.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonodon&apos;t disturb yourselves,&quot; cried the old man.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got some things to &apos;tend to. You and Jenny
                        go right ahead.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he was off to his own little room where he conducted his own business in
                        his own primitive but highly efficacious way. A corps of expert accountants
                        could not have disentangled those crabbed, criss-crossed figures; no solver
                        of puzzles could have unravelled the mystery of those strange hieroglyphics.
                        But to the old man there wasn&apos;t a difficultor a dullmark in that
                        entire set of dirty, dog-eared little account books. He spent hours in
                        poring over them. Just to turn the pages gave him keen pleasure; to read,
                        and to reconstruct from those hints the whole story of some agitating and
                        profitable operation, made in comparison <pb id="VAA2368-093" n="89"/> the
                        delight of an imaginative boy in Monte Cristo or Crusoe seem a cold and tame
                        emotion.</p>
                    <p>David talked on and on, fancying that Jane was listening and admiring, when
                        in fact she was busy with her own entirely different train of thought. She
                        kept the young man going because she did not wish to be bored with her own
                        solitude, because a man about always made life at least a little more
                        interesting than if she were alone or with a woman, and because Davy was
                        good to look at and had an agreeable voice.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, who&apos;s that?&quot; she suddenly exclaimed, gazing
                        off to the right.</p>
                    <p>Davy turned and looked. &quot;I don&apos;t know her,&quot; he
                        said. &quot;Isn&apos;t she queer lookingyet I don&apos;t know
                        just why.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Selma Gordon,&quot; said Jane, who had recognized
                        Selma the instant her eyes caught a figure moving across the lawn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The girl that helps Victor Dorn?&quot; said Davy, astonished.
                        &quot;What&apos;s <hi rend="i">she</hi> coming <hi rend="i"
                        >here</hi> for? You don&apos;t know herdo you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you?&quot; evaded Jane. &quot;I thought you
                        and Mr. Dorn were such pals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pals?&quot; laughed Hull. &quot;Hardly that. We meet now
                        and then at a workingman&apos;s club I&apos;m interested inand at a
                        caf where I go to get in touch with the people occasionallyand in the
                        street. But I never go to his office. I couldn&apos;t afford to do that.
                        And I&apos;ve never seen Miss Gordon.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-094" n="90"/>
                    <p>&quot;Well, she&apos;s worth seeing,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll never see another like her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They rose and watched her advancing. To the usual person, acutely conscious
                        of self, walking is not easy in such circumstances. But Selma, who never
                        bothered about herself, came on with that matchless steady grace which
                        peasant girls often get through carrying burdens on the head. Jane called
                        out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;So, you&apos;ve come, after all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma smiled gravely. Not until she was within a few feet of the steps did
                        she answer: &quot;Yesbut on business.&quot; She was wearing the same
                        linen dress. On her head was a sailor hat, beneath the brim of which her
                        amazingly thick hair stood out in a kind of defiance. This hat, this further
                        article of Western civilization&apos;s dress, added to the suggestion of
                        the absurdity of such a person in such clothing. But in her strange Cossack
                        way she certainly was beautifuland as healthy and hardy as if she had never
                        before been away from the high, wind-swept plateaus where disease is unknown
                        and where nothing is thought of living to be a hundred or a hundred and
                        twenty-five. Both before and after the introduction Davy Hull gazed at her
                        with fascinated curiosity too plainly written upon his long, sallow, serious
                        face. She, intent upon her mission, ignored him as the arrow ignores the
                        other birds of the flock in its flight to the one at which it is aimed.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-095" n="91"/>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll give me a minute or two alone?&quot; she said
                        to Jane. &quot;We can walk on the lawn here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull caught up his hat. &quot;I was just going,&quot; said he. Then
                        he hesitated, looked at Selma, stammered: &quot;I&apos;ll go to the
                        edge of the lawn and inspect the view.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Neither girl noted this abrupt and absurd change of plan. He departed. As
                        soon as he had gone half a dozen steps, Selma said in her quick, direct
                        fashion:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve come to see you about the strike.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane tried to look cool and reserved. But that sort of expression seemed
                        foolish in face of the simplicity and candor of Selma Gordon. Also, Jane was
                        not now so well pleased with her father&apos;s ideas and those of her
                        own interest as she had been while she was talking with him. The most
                        exasperating thing about the truth is that, once one has begun to see ithas
                        begun to see what is for him the truththe honest truthhe can not hide from
                        it ever again. So, instead of looking cold and repellant, Jane looked uneasy
                        and guilty. &quot;Oh, yesthe strike,&quot; she murmured.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It is over,&quot; said Selma. &quot;The union met a half
                        hour ago and revoked its actionon Victor Dorn&apos;s advice. He showed
                        the men that they had been trapped into striking by the companythat a riot
                        was to be started and blamed upon themthat the militia was to be called in
                        and they were to be shot down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, nonot that!&quot; cried Jane eagerly. &quot;It
                        wouldn&apos;t have gone as far as that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesas far as that,&quot; said Selma calmly. &quot;That <pb
                            id="VAA2368-096" n="92"/> sort of thing is an old story. It&apos;s
                        been done so oftenand worse. You see, the respectable gentlemen who run
                        things hire disreputable creatures. They don&apos;t tell them what to
                        do. They don&apos;t need to. The poor wretches understand
                        what&apos;s expected of themand they do it. So, the respectable
                        gentlemen can hold up white hands and say quite truthfully, &apos;No
                        bloodno filth on thesesee!&apos;&quot; Selma was laughing drearily.
                        Her superb, primitive eyes, set ever so little aslant, were flashing with an
                        intensity of emotion that gave Jane Hastings a sensation of terrormuch as if
                        a man who has always lived where there were no storms, but such gentle
                        little rains with restrained and refined thunder as usually visit the
                        British Isles, were to find himself in the midst of one of those awful
                        convulsions that come crashing down the gorges of the Rockies. She marveled
                        that one so small of body could contain such big emotions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t be unjust,&quot; she pleaded.
                            &quot;<hi rend="i">We</hi> aren&apos;t <hi rend="i">that</hi>
                        wicked, my dear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma looked at her. &quot;No matter,&quot; she said. &quot;I am
                        not trying to convert youor to denounce your friends to you. I&apos;ll
                        explain what I&apos;ve come for. In his speech to-day and in inducing
                        the union to change, Victor has shown how much power he has. The men whose
                        plans he has upset will be hating him as men hate only those whom they
                        fear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;YesI believe that,&quot; said Jane. &quot;So, you see,
                        I&apos;m not blindly prejudiced.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-097" n="93"/>
                    <p>&quot;For a long time there have been rumors that they might kill
                        him&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Absurd!&quot; cried Jane angrily. &quot;Miss Gordon, no
                        matter how prejudiced you may beand I&apos;ll admit there are many
                        things to justify you in feeling stronglybut no matter how you may feel,
                        your good sense must tell you that men like my father don&apos;t commit
                        murder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand perfectly,&quot; replied Selma. &quot;They
                        don&apos;t commit murder, and they don&apos;t order murder.
                        I&apos;ll even say that I don&apos;t think they would tolerate
                        murder, even for their benefit. But you don&apos;t know how things are
                        done in business nowadays. The men like your father have to use men of the
                        Kelly and the House sortyou know who they are?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The Kellys and the Houses give general orders to their lieutenants.
                        The lieutenants pass the orders alongand down. And so on, until all sorts of
                        men are engaged in doing all sorts of work. Dirty, clean, criminalall sorts.
                        Some of these men, baffled in what they are trying to do to earn their
                        paybaffled by Victor Dornplot against him.&quot; Again that sad, bitter
                        laugh. &quot;My dear Miss Hastings, to kill a cat there are a thousand
                        ways besides skinning it alive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are prejudiced,&quot; said Jane, in the manner of one who
                        could not be convinced.</p>
                    <p>Selma made an impatient gesture. &quot;Again I say, no matter. Victor
                        laughs at our fears&quot;</p>

                    <p>&quot;I knew it,&quot; said Jane triumphantly. &quot;He is less
                        foolish than his followers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He simply does not think about himself,&quot; replied Selma.
                        &quot;And he is right. But it is our business to think about him,
                        because we need him. Where could we find another like him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I suppose your movement <hi rend="i">would</hi> die out, if he
                        were not behind it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma smiled peculiarly. &quot;I think you don&apos;t quite
                        understand what we are about,&quot; said she. &quot;You&apos;ve
                        accepted the ignorant notion of your class that we are a lot of silly
                        roosters trying to crow one sun out of the heavens and another into it. The
                        facts are somewhat different. Your class is saying, &apos;To-day will
                        last forever,&apos; while we are saying, &apos;No, to-day will run
                        its coursewill be succeeded by to-morrow. Let us not live like the fool who
                        thinks only of the day. Let us be sensible, intelligent, let us realize that
                        there will be to-morrow and that it, too, must be lived. Let us get ready to
                        live it sensibly. Let us build our social system so that it will stand the
                        wear and tear of another day and will not fall in ruins about our
                        heads.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am terribly ignorant about all these things,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;What a ridiculous thing my education has been!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it hasn&apos;t spoiled your heart,&quot; cried Selma.
                        And all at once her eyes were wonderfully soft and tender, and into her
                        voice came a tone so sweet that Jane&apos;s eyes filled with tears.
                        &quot;It was to your heart <pb id="VAA2368-099" n="95"/> that I came to
                        appeal,&quot; she went on. &quot;Oh, Miss Hastingswe will do all we
                        can to protect Victor Dornand we guard him day and night without his knowing
                        it. But I am afraidafraid! And I want you to help. Will you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll do anything I can,&quot; said Janea Jane very
                        different from the various Janes Miss Hastings knewa Jane who seemed to be
                        conjuring of Selma Gordon&apos;s enchantments.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want you to ask your father to give him a fair show. We
                        don&apos;t ask any favorsfor ourselvesfor him. But we don&apos;t
                        want to see him&quot; Selma shuddered and covered her eyes with her
                        hands &quot;lying dead in some alley, shot or stabbed by some unknown
                        thug!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma made it so vivid that Jane saw the whole tragedy before her very eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The real reason why they hate him,&quot; Selma went on,
                        &quot;is because he preaches up education and preaches down violenceand
                        is building his party on intelligence instead of on force. The masters want
                        the workingman who burns and kills and riots. They can shoot him down. They
                        can make people accept any tyranny in preference to the danger of fire and
                        murder let loose. But Victor is teaching the workingmen to stop playing the
                        masters&apos; game for them. No wonder they hate him! He makes them
                        afraid of the day when the united workingmen will have their way by
                        organizing and voting. And they know that if Victor Dorn lives, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-100" n="96"/> that day will come in this city very, very
                        soon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma saw Davy Hull, impatient at his long wait, advancing toward them. She
                        said: &quot;You will talk to your father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane. &quot;And I assure you he will do
                        what he can. You don&apos;t know him, Miss Gordon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know he loves youI know he <hi rend="i">must</hi> love
                        you,&quot; said Selma. &quot;Now, I must go. Good-by. I knew you
                        would be glad of the chance to do something worth while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane had been rather expecting to be thanked for her generosity and goodness.
                        Selma&apos;s remark seemed at first blush an irritating attempt to shift
                        a favor asked into a favor given. But it was impossible for her to fail to
                        see Selma&apos;s sensible statement of the actual truth. So, she said
                        honestly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you for coming, Miss Gordon. I <hi rend="i">am</hi> glad of
                        the chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They shook hands. Selma, holding her hand, looked up at her, suddenly kissed
                        her. Jane returned the kiss. David Hull, advancing with his gaze upon them
                        stopped short. Selma, without a glancebecause without a thoughtin his
                        direction, hastened away.</p>
                    <p>When David rejoined Jane, she was gazing tenderly after the small, graceful
                        figure moving toward the distant entrance gates. Said David:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think that girl has got you hypnotized.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed and sent him home. &quot;I&apos;m busy,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I&apos;ve got something to do, at last.&quot;</p>
                </div2>
                <pb id="VAA2368-101" n="97"/>
                <div2 type="chapter">
                    <head>III</head>
                    <p>Jane knocked at the door of her father&apos;s little office.
                        &quot;Are you there, father?&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yescome in, Jinny.&quot; As she entered, he went on,
                        &quot;But you must go right away again. I&apos;ve got to
                        &apos;tend to this strike.&quot; He took on an injured, melancholy
                        tone. &quot;Those fool workingmen! They&apos;re certain to lose. And
                        what&apos;ll come of it all? Why, they&apos;ll be out their wages
                        and their jobs, and the company&apos;ll lose so much money that it
                        can&apos;t put on the new cars the public&apos;s clamorin&apos;
                        for. The old cars&apos;ll have to do for another year, anyhowmaybe
                        two.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane had heard that lugubrious tone from time to time, and she knew what it
                        meantan air of sorrow concealing secret joy. So, here was another benefit
                        the companyshe preferred to think of it as the company rather than as her
                        fatherexpected to gain from the strike. It could put off replacing the
                        miserable old cars in which it was compelling people to ride. Instead of
                        losing money by the strike, it would make money by it. This was
                        Jane&apos;s first glimpse of one of the most interesting and important
                        truths of modern lifehow it is often to the advantage of business men to
                        have their own business crippled, hampered, stopped altogether.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-102" n="98"/>
                    <p>&quot;You needn&apos;t worry, father,&quot; said she cheerfully.
                        &quot;The strike&apos;s been declared off.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; cried her father.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A girl from down town just called. She says the union has called
                        the strike off and the men have accepted the company&apos;s
                        terms.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But them terms is withdrawn!&quot; cried Hastings, as if his
                        daughter were the union. He seized the telephone. &quot;I&apos;ll
                        call up the office and order &apos;em withdrawn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s too late,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>Just then the telephone bell rang, and Hastings was soon hearing confirmation
                        of the news his daughter had brought him. She could not bear watching his
                        face as he listened. She turned her back, stood gazing out at the window.
                        Her father, beside himself, was shrieking into the telephone curses,
                        denunciations, impossible orders. The one emergency against which he had not
                        provided was the union&apos;s ending the strike. When you have struck
                        the line of battle of a general, however able and self-controlled, in the
                        one spot where he has not arranged a defense, you have thrown himand his
                        armyinto a panic. Some of the greatest tactitians in history have given way
                        in those circumstances; so, Martin Hastings&apos; utter loss of
                        self-control and of control of the situation only proves that he had his
                        share of human nature. He had provided against the unexpected; he had not
                        provided against the impossible.</p>
                    <p>Jane let her father rave on into the telephone until <pb id="VAA2368-103"
                            n="99"/> his voice grew hoarse and squeaky. Then she turned and said:
                        &quot;Now, fatherwhat&apos;s the use of making yourself sick? You
                        can&apos;t do any goodcan you?&quot; She laid one hand on his arm,
                        with the other hand caressed his head. &quot;Hang up the receiver and
                        think of your health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care to live, with such goings-on,&quot;
                        declared he. But he hung up the receiver and sank back in his chair,
                        exhausted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come out on the porch,&quot; she went on, tugging gently at
                        him. &quot;The air&apos;s stuffy in here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He rose obediently. She led him to the veranda and seated him comfortably,
                        with a cushion in his back at the exact spot at which it was most
                        comfortable. She patted his shrunken cheeks, stood off and looked at him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;s your sense of humor?&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;You used to be able to laugh when things went against you.
                        You&apos;re getting to be as solemn and to take yourself as seriously as
                        Davy Hull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man made a not unsuccessful attempt to smile. &quot;That there
                        Victor Dorn!&quot; said he. &quot;He&apos;ll be the death of me,
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What has he done now?&quot; said Jane, innocently.</p>
                    <p>Hastings rubbed his big bald forehead with his scrawny hand.
                        &quot;He&apos;s tryin&apos; to run this townto run it to the
                        devil,&quot; replied he, by way of evasion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Something&apos;s got to be done about himeh?&quot; observed
                        she, in a fine imitation of a business-like voice.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-104" n="100"/>
                    <p>&quot;Something <hi rend="i">will</hi> be done,&quot; retorted he.</p>
                    <p>Jane wincedhid her distressreturned to the course she had mapped out for
                        herself. &quot;I hope it won&apos;t be something stupid,&quot;
                        said she. Then she seated herself and went on. &quot;Fatherdid you ever
                        stop to wonder whether it is Victor Dorn or the changed times?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man looked up abruptly and sharplythe expression of a shrewd man when
                        he catches a hint of a new idea that sounds as if it might have something in
                        it.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You blame Victor Dorn,&quot; she went on to explain.
                        &quot;But if there were no Victor Dorn, wouldn&apos;t you be having
                        just the same trouble? Aren&apos;t men of affairs having them
                        everywherein Europe as well as on this sidenowadays?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man rubbed his browhis nosehis chinpulled at the tufts of hair in his
                        earsfumbled with his cuffs. All of these gestures indicated interest and
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t the real truth not Victor Dorn or Victor Dorns but a
                        changed and changing world?&quot; pursued the girl. &quot;And if
                        that&apos;s so, haven&apos;t you either got to adopt new methods or
                        fall back? That&apos;s the way it looks to meand we women have got
                        intuitions if we haven&apos;t got sense.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">I</hi> never said women hadn&apos;t got
                        sense,&quot; replied the old man. &quot;I&apos;ve sometimes said
                            <hi rend="i">men</hi> ain&apos;t got no sense, but not women. Not to
                        go no further, the women make <pb id="VAA2368-105" n="101"/> the men work
                        for &apos;emdon&apos;t they? <hi rend="i">That&apos;s</hi> a
                        pretty good quality of sense, <hi rend="i">I</hi> guess.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she knew he was busily thinking all the time about what she had said. So
                        she did not hesitate to go on: &quot;Instead of helping Victor Dorn by
                        giving him things to talk about, it seems to me I&apos;d <hi rend="i"
                            >use</hi> him, father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t do anything with him. He&apos;s crazy,&quot;
                        declared Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe it,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t believe he&apos;s crazy. And I don&apos;t believe you
                        can&apos;t manage him. A man like thata man as clever as he
                        isdoesn&apos;t belong with a lot of ignorant tenement-house people.
                        He&apos;s out of place. And when anything or anybody is out of place,
                        they can be put in their right place. Isn&apos;t that sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man shook his headnot in negation, but in uncertainty.</p>
                    <p>&quot;These men are always edging you on against Victor
                        Dornwhat&apos;s the matter with them?&quot; pursued Jane. <hi
                            rend="i">&quot;I</hi> saw, when Davy Hull talked about him.
                        They&apos;re envious and jealous of him, father. They&apos;re afraid
                        he&apos;ll distance them. And they don&apos;t want you to realize
                        what a useful man he could behow he could help you if you helped himmade
                        friends with himroused the right kind of ambition in him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When a man&apos;s ambitious,&quot; observed Hastings, out
                        of the fullness of his own personal experience, &quot;it means
                        he&apos;s got something inside him, teasing and nagiging <pb

                        rest, but keeps pushing and pullingand he&apos;s got to keep fighting,
                        trying to satisfy itand he can&apos;t wait to pick his ground or his
                        weapons.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And Victor Dorn,&quot; said Jane, to make it clearer to her
                        father by putting his implied thought into words, &quot;Victor Dorn is
                        doing the best he canfighting on the only ground that offers and with the
                        only weapons he can lay hands on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man nodded. &quot;I never have blamed himnot really,&quot;
                        declared he. &quot;A practical mana man that&apos;s been through
                        thingshe understands how these things are,&quot; in the tone of a
                        philosopher. &quot;Yes, I reckon Victor&apos;s doing the best he
                        cangetting up by the only ladder he&apos;s got a chance at.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The way to get him off that ladder is to give him
                        another,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>A long silence, the girl letting her father thresh the matter out in his
                        slow, thorough way. Finally her young impatience conquered her restraint.
                        &quot;Wellwhat do you think, popsy?&quot; inquired she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That I&apos;ve got about as smart a gel as there is in Remsen
                        City,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t lay it on too thick,&quot; laughed she.</p>
                    <p>He understood why she was laughing, though he did not show it. He knew what
                        his much-traveled daughter thought of Remsen City, but he held to his own
                        provincial opinion, nevertheless. Nor, perhaps, was he so far wrong as she
                        believed. A cross section <pb id="VAA2368-107" n="103"/> of human society,
                        taken almost anywhere, will reveal about the same quantity of brain, and the
                        quality of the mill is the thing, not of the material it may happen to be
                        grinding.</p>
                    <p>She understood that his remark was his way of letting her know that he had
                        taken her suggestion under advisement. This meant that she had said enough.
                        And Jane Hastings had made herself an adept in the art of handling her
                        fatheran accomplishment she could by no means have achieved had she not
                        loved him; it is only when a woman deeply and strongly loves a man that she
                        can learn to influence him, for only love can put the necessary
                        sensitiveness into the nerves with which moods and prejudices and whims and
                        such subtle uncertainties can be felt out.</p>
                    <p>The next day but one, coming out on the front veranda a few minutes before
                        lunch time she was startled rather than surprised to see Victor Dorn seated
                        on a wicker sofa, hat off and gaze wandering delightedly over the extensive
                        view of the beautiful farming country round Remsen City. She paused in the
                        doorway to take advantage of the chance to look at him when he was off his
                        guard. Certainly that profile view of the young man was impressive. It is
                        only in the profile that we get a chance to measure the will or propelling
                        force behind a character. In each of the two main curves of Dorn&apos;s
                        headthat from the top of the brow downward over the nose, the lips, the chin
                        and under, and that from the back of the head round under the <pb
                            id="VAA2368-108" n="104"/> car and forward along the lower jawin each of
                        these curves Dorn excelled.</p>
                    <p>She was about to draw back and make a formal entry, when he said, without
                        looking toward her:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welldon&apos;t you think it would be safe to draw
                        near?&quot;</p>
                    <p>The tone was so easy and natural and so sympatheticthe tone of Selma
                        Gordonthe tone of all natural persons not disturbed about themselves or
                        about othersthat Jane felt no embarrassment whatever.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve heard you were very clever,&quot; said she,
                        advancing. &quot;So, I wanted to have the advantage of knowing you a
                        little better at the outset than you would know me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But Selma Gordon has told me all about you,&quot; said hehe had
                        risen as she advanced and was shaking hands with her as if they were old
                        friends. &quot;Besides, I saw you the other dayin spite of your effort
                        to prevent yourself from being seen.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked, completely mystified.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean your clothes,&quot; explained he. &quot;They were
                        unusual for this part of the world. And when anyone wears unusual clothes,
                        they act as a disguise. Everyone neglects the person to center on the
                        clothes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wore them to be comfortable,&quot; protested Jane, wondering
                        why she was not angry at this young man whose manner ought to be regarded as
                        presuming and whose speech ought to be rebuked as impertinent. <pb
                            id="VAA2368-109" n="105"/> &quot;Altogether?&quot; said Dorn,
                        his intensely blue eyes dancing.</p>
                    <p>In spite of herself she smiled. &quot;Nonot altogether,&quot; she
                        admitted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, it may please you to learn that you scored tremendously as
                        far as one person is concerned. My small nephew talks of you all the timethe
                        &apos;lady in the lovely pants.&apos; &quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane colored deeply and angrily. She bent upon Victor a glance that ought to
                        have put him in his placewell down in his place. But he continued to look at
                        her with unchanged, laughing, friendly blue eyes, and went on: &quot;By
                        the way, his mother asked me to apologize for <hi rend="i">his</hi>
                        extraordinary appearance. I suppose neither of you would recognize the other
                        in any dress but the one each had on that day. He doesn&apos;t always
                        dress that way. His mother has been ill. He wore out his play-clothes. If
                        you&apos;ve had experience of children you&apos;ll know how suddenly
                        they demolish clothes. She wasn&apos;t well enough to do any tailoring,
                        so there was nothing to do but send Leonard forth in his big
                        brother&apos;s unchanged cast-offs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s anger had quite passed away before Dorn finished this simple,
                        ingenuous recital of poverty unashamed, this somehow fine laying open of the
                        inmost family secrets. &quot;What a splendid person your sister must
                        be!&quot; exclaimed she.</p>
                    <p>She more than liked the look that now came into his face. He said:
                        &quot;Indeed she is!more so than anyone <pb id="VAA2368-110" n="106"/>
                        except us of the family can realize. Mother&apos;s getting old and
                        almost helpless. My brother-in-law was paralyzed by an accident at the
                        rolling mill where he worked. My sister takes care of both of them and her
                        two boysand of mekeeps the house in band-box order, manages a big garden
                        that gives us most of what we eatand has time to listen to the woes of all
                        the neighbors and to give them the best advice I ever heard.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How <hi rend="i">can</hi> she?&quot; cried Jane. &quot;Why,
                        the day isn&apos;t long enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn laughed. &quot;You&apos;ll never realize how much time there is
                        in a day, Miss Jane Hastings, until you try to make use of it all.
                        It&apos;s very interestinghow much there is in a minute and in a dollar
                        if you&apos;re intelligent about them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane looked at him in undisguised wonder and admiration. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t know what a pleasure it is,&quot; she said, &quot;to
                        meet anyone whose sentences you couldn&apos;t finish for him before
                        he&apos;s a quarter the way through them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor threw back his head and laugheda boyish outburst that would have
                        seemed boorish in another, but came as naturally from him as song from a
                        bird. &quot;You mean Davy Hull,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>Jane felt herself coloring even more. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean him
                        especially,&quot; replied she. &quot;But he&apos;s a good
                        example.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The best I know,&quot; declared Victor. &quot;You see, the
                            <pb id="VAA2368-111" n="107"/> trouble with Davy is that he is one kind
                        of a person, wants to be another kind, thinks he ought to be a third kind,
                        and believes he fools people into thinking he is still a fourth
                        kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane reflected on this, smiled understandingly. &quot;That sounds like a
                        description of <hi rend="i">me,</hi>&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Probably,&quot; said Victor. &quot;It&apos;s a very
                        usual type in the second generation in your class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My class?&quot; said Jane, somewhat affectedly. &quot;What
                        do you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The upper class,&quot; explained Victor.</p>
                    <p>Jane felt that this was an opportunity for a fine exhibition of her
                        democracy. &quot;I don&apos;t like that,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;I&apos;m a good American, and I don&apos;t believe in
                        classes. I don&apos;t feelat least I try not to feelany sense of
                        inequality between myself and thosethose lesslessfortunately off.
                        I&apos;m not expressing myself well, but you know what I mean.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I know what you mean,&quot; rejoined Victor. &quot;But
                        that wasn&apos;t what I meant, at all. You are talking about social
                        classes in the narrow sense. That sort of thing isn&apos;t important.
                        One associates with the kind of people that pleases oneand one has a perfect
                        right to do so. If I choose to have my leisure time with people who dress a
                        certain way, or with those who have more than a certain amount of money, or
                        more than a certain number of servants or what notwhy, that&apos;s my
                        own lookout.&quot; <pb id="VAA2368-112" n="108"/> &quot;I&apos;m
                            <hi rend="i">so</hi> glad to hear you say that,&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;That&apos;s <hi rend="i">so</hi> sensible.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Snobbishness may be amusing,&quot; continued Dorn, &quot;or
                        it may be repulsiveor pitiful. But it isn&apos;t either interesting or
                        important. The classes I had in mind were the economic classesupper, middle,
                        lower. The upper class includes all those who live without workaristocrats,
                        gamblers, thieves, preachers, women living off men in or out of marriage,
                        grown children living off their parents or off inheritances. All the
                        idlers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane looked almost as uncomfortable as she felt. She had long taken a secret
                        delight in being regarded and spoken of as an &quot;upper
                        class&quot; person. Henceforth this delight would be at least alloyed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The middle class,&quot; pursued Victor, &quot;is those who
                        are in part parasites and in part workers. The lower class is those who live
                        by what they earn only. For example, you are upper class, your father is
                        middle class and I am lower class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Jane demurely, &quot;for an
                        interesting lesson in political economy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You invited it,&quot; laughed Victor. &quot;And I guess it
                        wasn&apos;t much more tiresome to you than talk about the weather would
                        have been. The weather&apos;s probably about the only other subject you
                        and I have in common.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s rude,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as I meant it,&quot; said he. &quot;I wasn&apos;t
                        exalting my <pb id="VAA2368-113" n="109"/> subjects or sneering at yours.
                        It&apos;s obvious that you and I lead wholly different lives.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d much rather lead your life than my own,&quot; said
                        Jane. &quot;Butyou are impatient to see father. You came to see
                        him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He telephoned asking me to come to dinnerthat is, lunch. I believe
                        it&apos;s called lunch when it&apos;s second in this sort of
                        house.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Father calls it dinner, and I call it lunch, and the servants call
                        it <hi rend="i">it.</hi> They simply say, &apos;It&apos;s
                        ready.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane went in search of her father, found him asleep in his chair in the
                        little office, one of his dirty little account books clasped in his long,
                        thin fingers with their rheumatic side curve. The maid had seen him there
                        and had held back dinner until he should awaken. Perhaps Jane&apos;s
                        entrance roused him; or, perhaps it was the odor of the sachet powder
                        wherewith her garments were liberally scented, for he had a singularly
                        delicate sense of smell. He lifted his head and, after the manner of aged
                        and confirmed cat-nappers, was instantly wide awake.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell me Victor Dorn was coming for
                        dinner?&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohhe&apos;s here, is he?&quot; said Hastings, chuckling.
                        &quot;You see I took your advice. Tell Lizzie to lay an extra
                        plate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings regarded this invitation as evidence of his breadth of mind, his
                        freedom from prejudice, his disposition to do the generous and the helpful
                        thing. In <pb id="VAA2368-114" n="110"/> fact, it was evidence of little
                        more than his dominant and most valuable traithis shrewdness. After one
                        careful glance over the ruins of his plan, he appreciated that Victor Dorn
                        was at last a force to be reckoned with. He had been growing,
                        growingsomewhat above the surface, a great deal more beneath the surface.
                        His astonishing victory demonstrated his power over Remsen City laborin a
                        single afternoon he had persuaded the street car union to give up without
                        hesitation a strike it had been planningat least, it thought it had been
                        doing the planningfor months. The Remsen City plutocracy was by no means
                        dependent upon the city government of Remsen City. It had the county
                        courtsthe district courtsthe State courts even, except where favoring the
                        plutocracy would be too obviously outrageous for judges who still considered
                        themselves men of honest and just mind to decide that way. The plutocracy,
                        further, controlled all the legislative and executive machinery. To dislodge
                        it from these fortresses would mean a campaign of years upon years,
                        conducted by men of the highest ability, and enlisting a majority of the
                        voters of the State. Still, possession of the Remsen City government was a
                        most valuable asset. A hostile government could &quot;upset
                        business,&quot; could &quot;hamper the profitable investment of
                        capital,&quot; in other words could establish justice to a highly
                        uncomfortable degree. This victory of Dorn&apos;s made it clear to
                        Hastings that at last Dorn was about to unite the labor vote under his
                        bannerwhich meant <pb id="VAA2368-115" n="111"/> that he was about to
                        conquer the city government. It was high time to stop him and, if possible,
                        to give his talents better employment.</p>
                    <p>However, Hastings, after the familiar human fashion, honestly thought he was
                        showing generosity, was going out of his way to &quot;give a likely
                        young fellow a chance.&quot; When he came out on the veranda he
                        stretched forth a graciously friendly hand and, looking shrewdly into
                        Victor&apos;s boyishly candid eyes, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Glad to see you, young man. I want to thank you for ending that
                        strike. I was born a working man, and I&apos;ve been one all my life
                        and, when I can&apos;t work any more, I want to quit the earth. So,
                        being a working man, I hate to see working men make fools of
                        themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was watching the young man anxiously. She instinctively knew that this
                        speech must be rousing his passion for plain and direct speaking. Before he
                        had time to answer she said: &quot;Dinner&apos;s waiting.
                        Let&apos;s go in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And on the way she made an opportunity to say to him in an undertone:
                        &quot;I do hope you&apos;ll be careful not to say anything
                        that&apos;ll upset father. I have to warn every one who comes here. His
                        digestion&apos;s bad, and the least thing makes him ill, and&quot;
                        she smiled charmingly at him &quot;I <hi rend="i">hate</hi> nursing.
                        It&apos;s too much like work to suit an upper-class person.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was no resisting such an appeal as that. Victor sat silent and ate, and
                        let the old man talk <pb id="VAA2368-116" n="112"/> on and on. Jane saw that
                        it was a severe trial to him to seem to be assenting to her
                        father&apos;s views. Whenever he showed signs of casting off his
                        restraint, she gave him a pleading glance. And the old man, so weazened, so
                        bent and shaky, with his bowl of crackers and milk, wasor seemed to beproof
                        that the girl was asking of him only what was humane. Jane relieved the
                        situation by talking volubly about herselfher college experiences, what she
                        had seen and done in Europe.</p>
                    <p>After dinner Hastings said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll drive you back to town, young man. I&apos;m going
                        in to work, as usual. I never took a vacation in my life. Can you beat that
                        record?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I knock off every once in a while for a month or so,&quot;
                        said Dorn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The young fellows growing up nowadays ain&apos;t equal to us of
                        the old stock,&quot; said Martin. &quot;They can&apos;t stand
                        the strain. Well, if you&apos;re ready, we&apos;ll pull
                        out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Dorn&apos;s going to stop a while with me,
                        father,&quot; interposed Jane with a significant glance at Victor.
                        &quot;I want to show him the grounds and the views.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All rightall right,&quot; said her father. He never liked
                        company in his drives; company interfered with his thinking out what he was
                        going to do at the office. &quot;I&apos;m mighty glad to know you,
                        young man. I hope we&apos;ll know each other better. I think
                        you&apos;ll find out that for a devil I&apos;m not half
                        badeh?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-117" n="113"/>
                    <p>Victor bowed, murmured something inarticulate, shook his host&apos;s
                        hand, and when the ceremony of parting was over drew a stealthy breath of
                        reliefwhich Jane observed. She excused herself to accompany her father to
                        his trap. As he was climbing in she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you rather like him, father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Hastings gathered the reins in his lean, distorted hands. &quot;So
                        so,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s got brains, hasn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes; he&apos;s smart; mighty smart.&quot; The old
                        man&apos;s face relaxed in a shrewd grin. &quot;Too damn smart.
                        Giddap, Bet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he was gone. Jane stood looking after the ancient phaeton with an
                        expression half of amusement, half of discomfiture. &quot;I might have
                        known,&quot; reflected she, &quot;that popsy would see through it
                        all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When she reappeared in the front doorway Victor Dorn was at the
                        edge of the veranda, ready to depart. As soon as he saw her he said gravely:
                        &quot;I must be off, Miss Hastings. Thank you for the very interesting
                        dinner.&quot; He extended his hand. &quot;Good day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put her hands behind her back, and stood smiling gently at him.
                        &quot;You mustn&apos;t gonot just yet. I&apos;m about to show
                        you the trees and the grass, the bees, the chickens and the cows. Also,
                        I&apos;ve something important to say to you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but I must go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stiffened slightly; her smile changed from <pb id="VAA2368-118" n="114"/>
                        friendly to cold. &quot;Ohpardon me,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Goodby.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He bowed, and was on the walk, and running rapidly toward the entrance gates.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Dorn!&quot; she called.</p>
                    <p>He turned.</p>
                    <p>She was afraid to risk asking him to come back for a moment. He might refuse.
                        Standing there, looking so resolute, so completley master of himself, so
                        devoid of all suggestion of need for any one or anything, he seemed just the
                        man to turn on his heel and depart. She descended to the walk and went to
                        him. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why are you acting so peculiarly? Why did you come?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I understood that your father wished to propose some
                        changes in the way of better hours and better wages for the men,&quot;
                        replied he. &quot;I find that the purpose wasnot that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do not care to go into that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was about to go onon out of her life forever, she felt.
                        &quot;Wait,&quot; she cried. &quot;The men will get better hours
                        and wages. You don&apos;t understand father&apos;s ways. He was
                        really discussing that very thingin his own mind. You&apos;ll see. He
                        has a great admiration for you. You can do a lot with him. You owe it to the
                        men to make use of his liking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her in silence for a moment. Then he <pb id="VAA2368-119"
                            n="115"/> said: &quot;I&apos;ll have to be at least partly frank
                        with you. In all his life no one has ever gotten anything out of your
                        father. He uses men. They do not use him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Believe me, that is unjust,&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll tell you another thing that was on his mind. He
                        wants toto make reparation forthat accident to your father. He wants to pay
                        your mother and you the money the road didn&apos;t pay you when it
                        ought.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn&apos;s candid face showed how much he was impressed. This beautiful,
                        earnest girl, sweet and frank, seemed herself to be another view of Martin
                        Hastings&apos; characterone more in accord with her strong belief in the
                        essential goodness of human nature. Said he: &quot;Your father owes us
                        nothing. As for the roadits debt never existed legallyonly morally. And it
                        has been outlawed long agofor there&apos;s a moral statute of
                        limitations, too. The best thing that ever happened to us was our not
                        getting that money. It put us on our mettle. It might have crushed us. It
                        happened to be just the thing that was needed to make us.</p>
                    <p>Jane marveled at this view of his family, at the verge of poverty, as
                        successful. But she could not doubt his sincerity. Said she sadly,
                        &quot;But it&apos;s not to the credit of the roador of father. He
                        must payand he knows he must.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can&apos;t accept,&quot; said Dorna finality.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you could use it to build up the paper,&quot; urged Jane,
                        to detain him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The paper was started without money. It lives <pb id="VAA2368-120"
                            n="116"/> without moneyand it will go on living without money, or it
                        ought to die.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t understand,&quot; said Jane. &quot;But I
                        want to understand. I want to help. Won&apos;t you let me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head laughingly. &quot;Help what?&quot; inquired he.
                        &quot;Help raise the sun? It doesn&apos;t need help.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane began to see. &quot;I mean, I want to be helped,&quot; she
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, that&apos;s another matter,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;And very simple.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Will <hi rend="i">you</hi> help me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t. No one can. You&apos;ve got to help yourself.
                        Each one of us is working for himselfworking not to be rich or to be famous
                        or to be envied, but to be free.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Working for himselfthat sounds selfish, doesn&apos;t
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you are wise, Jane Hastings,&quot; said Dorn, &quot;you
                        will distrustdisbelieve inanything that is not selfish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane reflected. &quot;YesI see,&quot; she cried. &quot;I never
                        thought of that!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A friend of mine, Wentworth,&quot; Victor went on,
                        &quot;has put it wonderfully clearly. He said, &apos;Some day we
                        shall realize that no man can be free until all men are
                        free.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">have</hi> helped mein spite of your fierce
                        refusal,&quot; laughed Jane. &quot;You are very impatient to go, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-121" n="117"/> aren&apos;t you? Well, since you
                        won&apos;t stay I&apos;ll walk with youas far as the end of the
                        shade.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was slightly uneasy lest her overtures should be misunderstood. By the
                        time they reached the first long, sunny stretch of the road down to town she
                        was so afraid that those overtures would not be
                        &quot;misunderstood&quot; that she marched on beside him in the hot
                        sun. She did not leave him until they reached the corner of Pike avenueand
                        then it was he that left her, for she could cudgel out no excuse for going
                        further in his direction. The only hold she had got upon him for a future
                        attempt was slight indeedhe had vaguely agreed to lend her some books.</p>
                    <p>People who have nothing to do get rid of a great deal of time in trying to
                        make impressions and in speculating as to what impressions they have made.
                        Janehastening toward Martha&apos;s to get out of the sun which could not
                        but injure a complexion so delicately fine as hersgave herself up to this
                        form of occupation. What did he think of her? Did he really have as little
                        sense of her physical charm as he seemed? No woman could hope to be
                        attractive to every man. Stillthis man surely must be at least not
                        altogether insensible. &quot;If he sends me those books to-dayor
                        tomorrowor even next day,&quot; thought Jane, &quot;it will be a
                        pretty sure sign that he was impressedwhether he knows it or not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had now definitely passed beyond the stage where she wondered at
                        herselfand reproached herselffor <pb id="VAA2368-122" n="118"/> wishing to
                        win a man of such common origin and surroundings. She could not doubt Victor
                        Dorn&apos;s superiority. Such a man as that didn&apos;t need birth
                        or wealth or even fame. He simply <hi rend="i">was</hi> the man worth
                        whileworth any woman&apos;s while. How could Selma be associated so
                        intimately with him without trying to get him in love with her? Perhaps she
                        had tried and had given up? NoSelma was as strange in her way as he was in
                        his way. What a strangeoriginal<hi rend="i">individual</hi> pair they were!</p>
                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; concluded Jane, &quot;he belongs with <hi

                        interesting to do itso interesting that I&apos;ll be sorry when
                        it&apos;s done, and I&apos;ll be looking about for something else to
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was not without hope that the books would come that same evening. But
                        they did not. The next day passed, and the next, and still no books.
                        Apparently he had meant nothing by his remark, &quot;I&apos;ve some
                        books you&apos;d be interested to read.&quot; Was his silence
                        indifference, or was it shyness? Probably she could only faintly appreciate
                        the effect her position, her surroundings produced in this man whose
                        physical surroundings had always been as poor as her mental
                        surroundingsthose created by that marvelous mind of hishad been splendid.</p>
                    <p>She tried to draw out her father on the subject of the young man, with a view
                        to getting a hint as to whether he purposed doing anything further. But old
                        Hastings would not talk about it; he was still debating, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-123" n="119"/> was looking at the matter from a standpoint
                        where his daughter&apos;s purely theoretical acumen could not help him
                        to a decision. Jane rather feared that where her father was evidently so
                        doubtful he would follow his invariable rule in doubtful cases.</p>
                    <p>On the fourth day, being still unable to think of anything but her project
                        for showing her prowess by conquering this man with no time for women, she
                        donned a severely plain walking costume and went to his office.</p>
                    <p>At the threshold of the &quot;Sanctum&quot; she stopped short. Selma,
                        pencil poised over her block of copy paper and every indication of
                        impatience, albeit polite impatience, in her fascinating Cossack face, was
                        talking toor, rather, listening toDavid Hull. Like not a few young menand
                        young womenbrought up in circumstances that surround them with people
                        deferential for the sake of what there is, or may possibly be, in itDavy
                        Hull had the habit of assuming that all the world was as fond of listening
                        to him as he was of listening to himself. So it did not often occur to him
                        to observe his audience for signs of a willingness to end the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Selma, turning a little further in her nervousness, saw Jane and sprang up
                        with a radiant smile of welcome. &quot;I&apos;m <hi rend="i">so</hi>
                        glad!&quot; she cried, rushing toward her and kissing her.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve thought about you often, and wished I could find
                        time to come to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was suddenly as delighted as Selma. For Selma&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2368-124" n="120"/> burst of friendliness, so genuine, so
                        unaffected, in this life of blackness and cold always had the effect of sun
                        suddenly making summer out of a chill autumnal day. Nor, curiously enough,
                        was her delight lessened by Davy Hull&apos;s blundering betrayal of
                        himself. His color, his eccentric twitchings of the lips and the hands would
                        have let a far less astute young woman than Jane Hastings into the secret of
                        the reason for his presence in that office when he had said he
                        couldn&apos;t &quot;afford&quot; to go. So guilty did he feel
                        that he stammered out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I dropped in to see Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wished to see Victor?&quot; exclaimed the guileless Selma.
                        &quot;Why didn&apos;t you say so? I&apos;d have told you at once
                        that he was in Indianapolis and wouldn&apos;t be back for two or three
                        days.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane straightway felt still better. The disgusting mystery of the books that
                        did not come was now cleared up. Secure in the certainty of Selma&apos;s
                        indifference to Davy she proceeded to punish him. &quot;What a stupid
                        you are, Davy!&quot; she cried mockingly. &quot;The instant I saw
                        your face I knew you were here to flirt with Miss Gordon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, no, Miss Hastings,&quot; protested Selma with quaint
                        intensity of seriousness, &quot;I assure you he was not flirting. He was
                        telling me about the reform movement he and his friends are
                        organizing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is his way of flirting,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Every
                        animal has its own wayand an elephant&apos;s way is different from a
                        mosquito&apos;s.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-125" n="121"/>
                    <p>Selma was eyeing Hull dubiously. It was bad enough for him to have taken her
                        time in a well-meaning attempt to enlighten her as to a new phase of local
                        politics; to take her time, to waste it, in flirtingthat was too
                        exasperating!</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hastings has a sense of humor that runs riot at
                        times,&quot; said Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t save yourself, Davy,&quot; mocked Jane.
                        &quot;Come along. Miss Gordon has no time for either of us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do want <hi rend="i">you</hi> to stay,&quot; she said to
                        Jane. &quot;But, unfortunately, with Victor away&quot; She looked
                        disconsolately at the half-finished page of copy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I came only to snatch Davy away,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;Next thing we know, he&apos;ll be one of Mr. Dorn&apos;s
                        lieutenants.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus Jane escaped without having to betray why she had come. In the street
                        she kept up her raillery. &quot;And a <hi rend="i">working</hi> girl,
                        Davy! What would our friends say! And you who are always boasting of your
                        fastidiousness! Flirting with a girl whoI&apos;ve seen her three times,
                        and each time she has had on exactly the same plain, cheap little
                        dress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a nastiness, a vulgarity in this that was as unworthy of Jane as
                        are all the unlovely emotions of us who are always sweet and refined when we
                        are our true selvesbut have a bad habit of only too often not being what we
                        flatter ourselves is our true selves. Jane was growing angry as she, away
                        from Selma, <pb id="VAA2368-126" n="122"/> resumed her normal place in the
                        world and her normal point of view. Davy Hull belonged to her; he had no
                        right to be hanging about another, anywayespecially an attractive woman. Her
                        anger was not lessened by Davy&apos;s retort. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Her dress may have been the same. But her face wasn&apos;tand
                        her mind wasn&apos;t. Those things are more difficult to change than a
                        dress.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was so angry that she did not take warning from this reminder that Davy
                        was by no means merely a tedious retailer of stale commonplaces. She said
                        with fine ironyand with no show of anger: &quot;It is always a shock to
                        a lady to realize how coarse men arehow they don&apos;t
                        discriminate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy laughed. &quot;Women get their rank from men,&quot; said he
                        coolly. &quot;In themselves they have none. That&apos;s the
                        philosophy of the peculiarity you&apos;ve noted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This truth, so galling to a lady, silenced Jane, made her bite her lips with
                        rage. &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; she finally said. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t realize that you were in love with Selma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I am in love with her,&quot; was Davy&apos;s
                        astounding reply. &quot;She&apos;s the noblest and simplest creature
                        I&apos;ve ever met.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t mean you want to marry her!&quot; exclaimed
                        Jane, so amazed that she for the moment lost sight of her own personal
                        interest in this affair.</p>
                    <p>Davy looked at her sadly, and a little contemptuously. <pb id="VAA2368-127"
                            n="123"/> &quot;What a poor opinion at bottom you womenyour sort of
                        womenhave of woman,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a poor opinion of men yon mean,&quot; retorted she.
                        &quot;After a little experience of them a girleven a girllearns that
                        they are incapable of any emotion that isn&apos;t gross.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be so ladylike, Jane,&quot; said Hull.</p>
                    <p>Miss Hastings was recovering control of herself. She took a new tack.
                        &quot;You haven&apos;t asked her yet?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hardly. This is the second time I&apos;ve seen her. I suspected
                        that she was the woman for me the moment I saw her. To-day I confirmed my
                        idea. She is all that I thoughtand more. And, Jane, I know that you
                        appreciate her, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane now saw that Davy was being thus abruptly and speedily confiding because
                        he had decided it was the best way out of his entanglement with her. Behind
                        his coolness she could see an uneasy watchfulnessthe fear that she might try
                        to hold him. Up boiled her ragethe higher because she knew that if there
                        were any possible way of holding Davy, she would take itnot because she
                        wished to, or would, marry him, but because she had put her mark upon him.
                        But this new rage was of the kind a clever woman has small difficulty in
                        dissembling.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I do appreciate her, Davy,&quot; said she sweetly.
                        &quot;And I hope you will be happy with her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think I can get her?&quot; said he, fatuously eager.
                        &quot;You think she likes me? I&apos;ve been rather hoping that <pb
                            id="VAA2368-128" n="124"/> because it seized me so suddenly and so
                        powerfully it must have seized her, too. I think often things occur that
                        way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In novels,&quot; said Jane, pleasantly judicial. &quot;But
                        in real life about the hardest thing to do is for a man to make a woman care
                        for himreally care for him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, no matter how hard I have to try&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; pursued Miss Hastings, ignoring his
                        interruption, &quot;when a man who has wealth and position asks a woman
                        who hasn&apos;t to marry him, she usually acceptsunless he happens to be
                        downright repulsive, or she happens to be deeply and hopefully in love with
                        another man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy winced satisfactorily. &quot;Do you suspect,&quot; he presently
                        asked, &quot;that she&apos;s in love with Victor Dorn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Jane reflectively. &quot;Probably. But
                        I&apos;d not feel discouraged by that if I were you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dorn&apos;s a rather attractive chap in some ways.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy&apos;s manner was so superior that Jane almost laughed in his face.
                        What fools men were. If Victor Dorn had position, weren&apos;t
                        surrounded by his unquestionably, hopelessly common family, weren&apos;t
                        deliberately keeping himself commonwas there a woman in the world who
                        wouldn&apos;t choose him without a second thought being necessary, in
                        preference to a Davy Hull? How few men there were who could reasonably hope
                        to hold their women against all comers. Victor Dorn might possibly be of
                        those few. But Davy Hullthe idea was ridiculous. All his advantagesheight,
                        looks, money, <pb id="VAA2368-129" n="125"/> positionwere excellent
                        qualities in a show piece; but they weren&apos;t the qualities that make
                        a woman want to live her life with a man, that make her hope he will be able
                        to give her the emotions woman-nature craves beyond anything.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is very attractive,&quot; said Jane, &quot;and
                        I&apos;ve small doubt that Selma Gordon is infatuated with him. ButI
                        shouldn&apos;t let that worry me if I were you.&quot; She paused to
                        enjoy his anxiety, then proceeded: &quot;She is a level-headed girl. The
                        girls of the working classthe intelligent oneshave had the silly
                        sentimentalities knocked out of them by experience. So, when you ask her to
                        marry you, she will accept.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a low opinion you have of her!&quot; exclaimed Davy.
                        &quot;What a low view you take of life!&quot;most inconsistent of
                        him, since he was himself more than half convinced that Jane&apos;s
                        observations were not far from the truth.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Women are sensible,&quot; said Jane tranquilly. &quot;They
                        appreciate that they&apos;ve got to get a man to support them.
                        Don&apos;t forget, my dear Davy, that marriage is a woman&apos;s
                        career.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You lived abroad too long,&quot; said Hull bitterly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve lived at home and abroad long enough and
                        intelligently enough not to think stupid hypocrisies, even if I do sometimes
                        imitate other people and <hi rend="i">say</hi> them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am sure that Selma Gordon would no more think of marrying me for
                        any other reason but lovewould no more think of it thanthan <hi rend="i"
                        >you</hi> would!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-130" n="126"/>
                    <p>&quot;No more,&quot; was Jane&apos;s unruffled reply.
                        &quot;But just as much. I didn&apos;t absolutely refuse you, when
                        you asked me the other day, partly because I saw no other way of stopping
                        your tiresome talkand your unattractive way of trying to lay hands on me. I
                            <hi rend="i">detest</hi> being handled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy was looking so uncomfortable that he attracted the attention of the
                        people they were passing in wide, shady Lincoln Avenue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But my principal reason,&quot; continued Jane, mercilessly
                        amiable and candid, &quot;was that I didn&apos;t know but that you
                        might prove to be about the best I could get, as a means to realizing my
                        ambition.&quot; She looked laughingly at the unhappy young man.
                        &quot;You didn&apos;t think I was in love with you, did you, Davy
                        dear?&quot; Then, while the confusion following this blow was at its
                        height, she added: &quot;You&apos;ll remember one of your chief
                        arguments for my accepting you was ambition. You didn&apos;t think it
                        low thendid you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull was one of the dry-skinned people. But if he had been sweating profusely
                        he would have looked and would have been less wretched than burning up in
                        the smothered heat of his misery.</p>
                    <p>They were nearing Martha&apos;s gates. Jane said: &quot;Yes, Davy,
                        you&apos;ve got a good chance. And as soon as she gets used to our way
                        of living, she&apos;ll make you a good wife.&quot; She laughed
                        gayly. &quot;She&apos;ll not be quite so pretty when she settles
                        down and takes on flesh. I wonder how she&apos;ll look in fine clothes
                        and jewels.&quot; She <pb id="VAA2368-131" n="127"/> measured
                        Hull&apos;s stature with a critical eye. &quot;She&apos;s only
                        about half as tall as you. How funny you&apos;ll look
                        together!&quot; With sudden soberness and sweetness, &quot;But,
                        seriously, David, I&apos;m proud of your courage in taking a girl for
                        herself regardless of her surroundings. So few men would be willing to face
                        the ridicule and the criticism, and all the social difficulties.&quot;
                        She nodded encouragingly. &quot;Go in and win! You can count on my
                        friendshipfor I&apos;m in love with her myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She left him standing dazedly, looking up and down the street as if it were
                        some strange and pine-beset highway in a foreign land. After taking a few
                        steps she returned to the gates and called him: &quot;I forgot to askdo
                        you want me to regard what you&apos;ve told me as confidential? I was
                        thinking of telling Martha and Hugo, and it occurred to me that you might
                        not like it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t say anything about it,&quot; said he with
                        panicky eagerness. &quot;You seenothing&apos;s settled
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, she&apos;ll accept you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I haven&apos;t even asked her,&quot; pleaded Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohall rightas you please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she was safely within doors she dropped to a chair and burst out
                        laughing. It was part of Jane&apos;s passion for the sense of triumph
                        over the male sex to find keen delight in making a fool of a man. And she
                        felt that she had made a &quot;perfect jumping jack of a fool&quot;
                        of David Hull. &quot;And I rather think,&quot; said she to herself,
                        &quot;that he&apos;ll soon be back where he belongs.&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-132" n="128"/> This with a glance at the tall heels of the
                        slippers on the good-looking feet she was thrusting out for her own
                        inspection. &quot;How absurd for him to imagine he could do anything
                        unconventional. Is there any coward anywhere so cowardly as an American
                        conventional man? No wonder I hate to think of marrying one of them. ButI
                        suppose I&apos;ll have to do it some day. What&apos;s a woman to do?
                        She&apos;s <hi rend="i">got</hi> to marry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>So pleased with herself was she that she behaved with unusual forbearance
                        toward Martha whose conduct of late had been most trying. Not
                        Martha&apos;s sometimes peevish, sometimes plaintive criticisms of her;
                        these she did not mind. But Martha&apos;s way of ordering her own life.
                        Jane, moving about in the world with a good mind eager to improve, had got a
                        horror of a woman&apos;s going to piecesand that was what Martha was
                        doing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m losing my looks rapidly,&quot; was her constant
                        complaint. As she had just passed thirty there was, in Jane&apos;s
                        opinion, not the smallest excuse for this. The remedy, the preventive, was
                        obviousdiet and exercise. But Martha, being lazy and self-indulgent and not
                        imaginative enough to foresee to what a pass a few years more of lounging
                        and stuffing would bring her, regarded exercise as unladylike and dieting as
                        unhealthful. She would not weaken her system by taking less than was
                        demanded by &quot;nature&apos;s infallible guide, the healthy
                        appetite.&quot; She would not give up the venerable and aristocratic
                        tradition that a lady should ever be reposeful. <pb id="VAA2368-133" n="129"
                        /> &quot;Another year or so,&quot; warned Jane, &quot;and
                        you&apos;ll be as steatopygous as the bride of a Hottentot
                        chief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What does steatthat word mean?&quot; said Martha suspiciously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look in the dictionary,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Its synonyms
                        aren&apos;t used by refined people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew it was something insulting,&quot; said Martha with an
                        injured sniff.</p>
                    <p>The only concessions Martha would make to the latter-day craze of women for
                        youthfulness were buying a foolish chin-strap of a beauty quack and
                        consulting him as to whether, if her hair continued to gray, she would
                        better take to peroxide or to henna.</p>
                    <p>Jane had come down that day with a severe lecture on fat and wrinkles laid
                        out in her mind for energetic delivery to the fast-seeding Martha. She put
                        off the lecture and allowed the time to be used by Martha in telling Jane
                        what were her (Jane&apos;s) strongest and less strongnot weaker but less
                        strong, points of physical charm.</p>
                    <p>It was cool and beautiful in the shade of the big gardens behind the old
                        Galland house. Jane, listening to Martha&apos;s honest and just
                        compliments and to the faint murmurs of the city&apos;s dusty, sweaty
                        toil, had a delicious sense of the superiority of her lota feeling that
                        somehow there must be something in the theory of rightfully superior and
                        inferior classesthat in taking what she had not earned she was not robbing
                        those who had earned it, as her reason so often asserted, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-134" n="130"/> but was being supported by the toil of others
                        for high purposes of aesthetic beauty. Anyhow, why heat one&apos;s self
                        wrestling with these problems?</p>
                    <p>When she was sure that Victor Dorn must have returned she called him on the
                        telephone. &quot;Can&apos;t you come out to see me
                        to-night?&quot; said she. &quot;I&apos;ve something
                        importantsomething <hi rend="i">you&apos;ll</hi> think importantto
                        consult you about.&quot; She felt a refusal forming at the other end of
                        the wire and hastened to add: &quot;You must know I&apos;d not ask
                        this if I weren&apos;t certain you would be glad you came.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not drop in here when you&apos;re down town?&quot;
                        suggested Victor.</p>
                    <p>She wondered why she did not hang up the receiver and forget him. But she did
                        not. She murmured, &quot;In due time I&apos;ll punish you for this,
                        sir,&quot; and said to him: &quot;There are reasons why
                        it&apos;s impossible for me to go there just now. And you know I
                        can&apos;t meet you in a saloon or on a street corner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not so sure of that,&quot; laughed he.
                        &quot;Let me see. I&apos;m very busy. But I could come for half an
                        hour this afternoon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had planned an evening session, being well aware of the favorable
                        qualities of air and light after the matter-of-fact sun has withdrawn his
                        last rays. But she promptly decided to accept what offered. &quot;At
                        three?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At four,&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You haven&apos;t forgotten those books?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-135" n="131"/>
                    <p>&quot;Books? Oh, yesyes, I remember. I&apos;ll bring them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; said she sweetly.
                        &quot;Goodby.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And at four she was waiting for him on the front veranda in a house dress
                        that waswell, it was not quite the proper costume for such an occasion, but
                        no one else was to see, and he didn&apos;t know about that sort of
                        thingand the gown gave her charms their best possible exposure except
                        evening dress, which was out of the question. She had not long to wait. One
                        of the clocks within hearing had struck and another was just beginning to
                        strike when she saw him coming toward the house. She furtively watched him,
                        admiring his walk without quite knowing why. You may perhaps know the walk
                        that was Victor&apos;sa steady forward advance of the whole body held
                        firmly, almost rigidlythe walk of a man leading another to the scaffold, or
                        of a man being led there in conscious innocence, or of a man ready to go
                        wherever his purposes may orderready to go without any heroics or fuss of
                        any kind, but simply in the course of the day&apos;s business. When a
                        man walks like that, he is worth observingand it is well to think twice
                        before obstructing his way.</p>
                    <p>That steady, inevitable advance gave Jane Hastings an absurd feeling of
                        nervousness. She had an impulse to fly, as from some oncoming danger. Yet
                        what was coming, in fact? A clever young man of the working class, dressed
                        in garments of the kind his class dressed <pb id="VAA2368-136" n="132"/> in
                        on Sunday, and plebeianly carrying a bundle under his arm.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our clock says you are three seconds late,&quot; cried she,
                        laughing and extending her hand in a friendly, equal way that would have
                        immensely flattered almost any man of her own class. &quot;But another
                        protests that you are one second early.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m one of those fools who waste their time and their
                        nerves by being punctual,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>He laid the books on the wicker sofa. But instead of sitting Jane said:
                        &quot;We might be interrupted here. Come to the west veranda.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There she had him in a leafy solitudehe facing her as she posed in
                        fascinating grace in a big chair. He looked at hernot the look of a man at a
                        woman, but the look of a busy person at one who is about to show cause for
                        having asked for a portion of his valuable time. She laughedand laughter was
                        her best gesture. &quot;I can never talk to you if you pose like
                        that,&quot; said she. &quot;Honestly now, is your time so
                        pricelessly precious?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He echoed her laugh and settled himself more at his ease. &quot;What did
                        you want of me?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I intend to try to get better hours and better wages for the street
                        car men,&quot; said she. &quot;To do it, I must know just what is
                        rightwhat I can hope to get. General talk is foolish. If I go at father I
                        must have definite proposals to make, with reasons for them. I
                        don&apos;t want him to evade. I would have gotten my information <pb
                            id="VAA2368-137" n="133"/> elsewhere, but I could think of no one but
                        you who might not mislead me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She had confidently expected that this carefully thought out scheme would do
                        the trick. He would admire her, would be interested, would be drawn into a
                        position where she could enlist him as a constant adviser. He moved toward
                        the edge of his chair as if about to rise. He said, pleasantly enough but
                        without a spark of enthusiasm:</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s very nice of you, Miss Hastings. But I
                        can&apos;t advise youbeyond saying that if I were you, I
                        shouldn&apos;t meddle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Shethat is, her vanitywas cut to the quick. &quot;Oh!&quot; said she
                        with irony, &quot;I fancied you wished the laboring men to have a better
                        sort of life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he. &quot;But I&apos;m not in favor of
                        running hysterically about with a foolish little atomizer in the great
                        stable. You are talking charity. I am working for justice. It will not
                        really benefit the working man for the company, at the urging of a sweet and
                        lovely young Lady Bountiful, to deign graciously to grant a little less
                        slavery to them. In fact, a well fed, well cared for slave is worse off than
                        one who&apos;s badly treatedworse off because farther from his freedom.
                        The only things that do our class any good, Miss Hastings, are the things
                        they <hi rend="i">compel</hi>compel by their increased intelligence and
                        increased unity and power. They get what they deserve. They won&apos;t
                        deserve more until they compel more. Gifts won&apos;t helpnot even gifts
                            <pb id="VAA2368-138" n="134"/> from&quot; His intensely blue eyes
                        danced&quot;from such charming white hands so beautifully
                        manicured.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She rose with an angry toss of the head. &quot;I didn&apos;t ask you
                        here to annoy me with impertinences about my finger nails.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He rose, at his ease, good-humored, ready to go. &quot;Then you should
                        have worn gloves,&quot; said he carelessly, &quot;for I&apos;ve
                        been able to think only of your finger nailsand to wonder <hi rend="i"
                        >what</hi> can be done with hands like that. Thank you for a pleasant
                        talk.&quot; He bowed and smiled. &quot;Good-by. OhMiss Gordon sent
                        you her love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> the matter, Mr. Dorn?&quot; cried the
                        girl desperately. &quot;I want your friendshipyour respect. <hi rend="i"
                            >Can&apos;t</hi> I get it? Am I utterly hopeless in your
                        eyes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A curious kind of color rose in his cheeks. His eyes regarded her with a
                        mysterious steadiness. &quot;You want neither my respect nor my
                        friendship,&quot; said he, &quot;You want to amuse
                        yourself.&quot; He pointed at her hands. &quot;Those nails betray
                        you.&quot; He shrugged his shoulders, laughed, said as if to a child:
                        &quot;You are a nice girl, Jane Hastings. It&apos;s a pity you
                        weren&apos;t brought up to be of some use. But you weren&apos;tand
                        it&apos;s too late.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes flashed, her bosom heaved. <hi rend="i">&quot;Why</hi> do I take
                        these things from you? <hi rend="i">Why</hi> do I invite them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because you inherit your father&apos;s magnificent
                        persistenceand you&apos;ve set your heart on the whim of making a fool
                        of meand you hate to give up.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-139" n="135"/>
                    <p>&quot;You wrong meindeed you do,&quot; cried she. &quot;I want to
                        learnI want to be of use in the world. I want to have some kind of a real
                        life.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really?&quot; mocked he good-humoredly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really,&quot; said she with all her power of sweet earnestness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thencut your nails and go to work. And when you have become a
                        genuine laborer, you&apos;ll begin to try to improve not the condition
                        of others, but your own. The way to help workers is to abolish the idlers
                        who hang like a millstone about their necks. You can help only by abolishing
                        the one idler under your control.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She stood nearer him, very near him. She threw out her lovely arms in a
                        gesture of humility. &quot;I will do whatever you say,&quot; she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>They looked each into the other&apos;s eyes. The color fled from her
                        face, the blood poured into hiswave upon wave, until he was like a man who
                        has been set on fire by the furious heat of long years of equatorial sun. He
                        muttered, wheeled about and strode awayin resolute and relentless flight.
                        She dropped down where he had been sitting and hid her face in her perfumed
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I care for him,&quot; she moaned, &quot;and he sawand he
                        despises me! How <hi rend="i">could</hi> Ihow <hi rend="i">could</hi>
                        I!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, within a quarter of an hour she was in her dressing room,
                        standing at the table, eyes carefully avoiding her mirrored eyesas she cut
                        her finger nails.</p>

                    <head>IV</head>
                    <p>Jane was mistaken in her guess at the cause of Victor Dorn&apos;s
                        agitation and abrupt flight. If he had any sense whatever of the secret she
                        had betrayed to him and to herself at the same instant it was wholly
                        unconscious. He had become panic-stricken and had fled because he, faced
                        with her exuberance and tempting wealth of physical charm, had become
                        suddenly conscious of her and of himself in a way as new to him as if he had
                        been fresh from a monkery where no woman had ever been seen. Thus far the
                        world had been peopled for him with human beings without any reference to
                        sex. The phenomena of sex had not interested him because his mind had been
                        entirely taken up with the other aspects of life; and he had not yet reached
                        the stage of development where a thinker grasps the truth that all questions
                        are at bottom questions of the sex relation, and that, therefore, no
                        question can be settled right until the sex relations are settled right.</p>
                    <p>Jane Hastings was the first girl he had met in his whole life who was in a
                        position to awaken that side of his nature. And when his brain suddenly
                        filled with a torrent of mad longings and of sensuous appreciations of her
                        laces and silk, of her perfume and smoothness and roundness, of the ecstasy
                        that would come <pb id="VAA2368-141" n="137"/> from contact with those warm,
                        rosy lipswhen Victor Dorn found himself all in a flash eager impetuosity to
                        seize this woman whom he did not approve of, whom he did not even like, he
                        felt bowed with shame. He would not have believed himself capable of such a
                        thing. He fled.</p>
                    <p>He fled, but she pursued. And when he sat down in the garden behind his
                        mother&apos;s cottage, to work at a table where bees and butterflies had
                        been his only disturbers, there was this <hi rend="i">she</hi> before himher
                        soft, shining gaze fascinating his gaze, her useless but lovely white hands
                        extended tantalizingly toward him. As he continued to look at her, his
                        disapproval and dislike melted. &quot;I was brutally harsh to
                        her,&quot; he thought repentantly. &quot;She was honestly trying to
                        do the decent thing. How was she to know? And wasn&apos;t I as much
                        wrong as right in advising her not to help the men?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Beyond question, it was theoretically best for the two opposing forces,
                        capital and labor, to fight their battle to its inevitable end without
                        interference, without truce, with quarter neither given nor taken on either
                        side. But practicallywasn&apos;t there something to be said for such
                        humane proposals of that of Jane Hastings? They would put off the day of
                        right conditions rightly and therefore permanently foundedconditions in
                        which master and slave or serf or wage-taker would be no more; but, on the
                        other hand, slaves with shorter hours of toil and better surroundings could
                        be enlightened <pb id="VAA2368-142" n="138"/> more easily. Perhaps. He was
                        by no means sure; he could not but fear that anything that tended to make
                        the slave comfortable in his degradation must of necessity weaken his
                        aversion to degradation. Just as the worst kings were the best kings because
                        they hastened the fall of monarchy, so the worst capitalists, the most
                        rapacious, the most rigid enforcers of the economic laws of a capitalistic
                        society were the best capitalists, were helping to hasten the day when men
                        would work for what they earned and would earn what they worked forwhen
                        every man&apos;s pay envelope would contain his wages, his full wages,
                        and nothing but his wages.</p>
                    <p>Still, where judgment was uncertain, he certainly had been unjust to that
                        well meaning girl. And was she really so worthless as he had on first sight
                        adjudged her? There might be exceptions to the rule that a parasite born and
                        bred can have no other instructor or idea but those of parasitism. She was
                        honest and earnest, was eager to learn the truth. She might be put to some
                        use. At any rate he had been unworthy of his own ideals when he, assuming
                        without question that she was the usual capitalistic snob with the itch for
                        gratifying vanity by patronizing the &quot;poor dear lower
                        classes,&quot; had been almost insultingly curt and mocking.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What was the matter with me?&quot; he asked himself.
                        &quot;I never acted in that way before.&quot; And then he saw that
                        his brusqueness had been the cover for fear of of herfear of the allure of
                        her luxury and her beauty. <pb id="VAA2368-143" n="139"/> In love with her?
                        He knew that he was not. No, his feeling toward her was merely the crudest
                        form of the tribute of man to womanthough apparently woman as a rule
                        preferred this form to any other.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I owe her an apology,&quot; he said to himself. And so it came
                        to pass that at three the following afternoon he was once more facing her in
                        that creeper-walled seclusion whose soft lights were almost equal to light
                        of gloaming or moon or stars in romantic charm.</p>
                    <p>Said healways direct and simple, whether dealing with man or woman, with
                        devious person or straight:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve come to beg your pardon for what I said
                        yesterday.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You certainly were wild and strange,&quot; laughed she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was supercilious,&quot; said he. &quot;And worse than
                        that there is not. However, as I have apologized, and you have accepted my
                        apology, we need waste no more time about that. You wished to persuade your
                        father to&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just a moment!&quot; interrupted she. &quot;I&apos;ve a
                        question to ask. <hi rend="i">Why</hi> did you treat mewhy have you been
                        treating me soso harshly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I was afraid of you,&quot; replied he. &quot;I did
                        not realize it, but that was the reason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Afraid of <hi rend="i">me,&quot;</hi> said she.
                        &quot;That&apos;s very flattering.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he, coloring. &quot;In some mysterious way I
                        had been betrayed into thinking of you as no man ought to think of a woman
                        unless he is in love with her and she with him. I am ashamed of myself. But
                            <pb id="VAA2368-144" n="140"/> I shall conquer that feelingor keep away
                        from you... Do you understand what the street car situation is?&quot;</p>
                    <p>But she was not to be deflected from the main question, now that it had been
                        brought to the front so unexpectedly and in exactly the way most favorable
                        to her purposes. &quot;You&apos;ve made me uneasy,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;I don&apos;t in the least understand what you mean. I
                        have wanted, and I still want, to be friends with yougood friendsjust as you
                        and Selma Gordon arethough of course I couldn&apos;t hope to be as close
                        a friend as she is. I&apos;m too ignoranttoo useless.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his headwith him, a gesture that conveyed the full strength of
                        negation. &quot;We are on opposite sides of a line across which
                        friendship is impossible. I could not be your friend without being false to
                        myself. You couldn&apos;t be mine unless you were by some accident flung
                        into the working class and forced to adopt it as your own. Even then
                        you&apos;d probably remain what you are. Only a small part of the
                        working class as yet is at heart of the working class. Most of us
                        secretlyalmost openlydespise the life of work, and dream and hope a time of
                        fortune that will put us up among the masters and the idlers.&quot; His
                        expressive eyes became eloquent. &quot;The false and shallow ideas that
                        have been educated into us for ages can&apos;t be uprooted in a few
                        brief years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She felt the admiration she did not try to conceal. She saw the proud and
                        splendid conception of the <pb id="VAA2368-145" n="141"/> dignity of laborof
                        labor as a blessing, not a curse, as a badge of aristocracy and not of
                        slavery and shame. &quot;You really believe that, don&apos;t
                        you?&quot; she said. &quot;I know it&apos;s true. I say I
                        believe itwho doesn&apos;t <hi rend="i">say</hi> so? But I
                        don&apos;t <hi rend="i">feel</hi> it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s honest,&quot; said he heartily.
                        &quot;That&apos;s something to build on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;m going to build!&quot; cried she.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll help mewon&apos;t you? I know, it&apos;s a
                        great deal to ask. Why should you take the time and the trouble to bother
                        with one single unimportant person.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way I spend my lifein adding one man or one
                        woman to our partyone at a time. It&apos;s slow building, but
                        it&apos;s the only kind that endures. There are twelve hundred of us
                        nowtwelve hundred voters, I mean. Ten years ago there were only three
                        hundred. We&apos;d expand much more rapidly if it weren&apos;t for
                        the constant shifts of population. Our men are forced to go elsewhere as the
                        pressure of capitalism gets too strong. And in place of them come raw
                        emigrants, ignorant, full of dreams of becoming capitalists and exploiters
                        of their fellow men and idlers. Ambition they call it. Ambition!&quot;
                        He laughed. &quot;What a vulgar, what a cruel notion of rising in the
                        world! To cease to be useful, to become a burden to others! ... Did you ever
                        think how many poor creatures have to toil longer hours, how many children
                        have to go to the factory instead of to school, in order that there may be
                        two hundred and seven automobiles privately <pb id="VAA2368-146" n="142"/>
                        kept in this town and seventy-four chauffeurs doing nothing but wait upon
                        their masters? Money doesn&apos;t grow on bushes, you know. Every cent
                        of it has to be earned by somebodyand earned by <hi rend="i">manual</hi>
                        labor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must think about that,&quot; she saidfor the first time as
                        much interested in what he was saying as in the man himself. No small
                        triumph for Victor over the mind of a woman dominated, as was Jane Hastings,
                        by the sex instinct that determines the thoughts and actions of practically
                        the entire female sex.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesthink about it,&quot; he urged. &quot;You will never see
                        itor anythinguntil you see it for yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the way your party is builtisn&apos;t
                        it?&quot; inquired she. &quot;Of those who see it for
                        themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Only those,&quot; replied he. &quot;We want no
                        others.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not even their votes?&quot; said she shrewdly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not even their votes,&quot; he answered.
                        &quot;We&apos;ve no desire to get the offices until we get them to
                        keep. And when we shall have conquered the city, we&apos;ll move on to
                        the conquest of the countythen of the districtthen of the state. Our kind of
                        movement is building in every city now, and in most of the towns and many of
                        the vilages. The old parties are falling to pieces because they stand for
                        the old politics of the two factions of the upper class quarreling over
                        which of them should superintend the exploiting of the people. Very few of
                        us realize what is going on before our very eyes <pb id="VAA2368-147"
                            n="143"/> that we&apos;re seeing the death agonies of one form of
                        civilization and the birth-throes of a newer form.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what will it be?&quot; asked the girl.</p>
                    <p>She had been waiting for some sign of the &quot;crank,&quot; the
                        impractical dreamer. She wax confident that this question would reveal the
                        man she had been warned againstthat in answering it he would betray his true
                        self. But he disappointed and surprised her.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How can I tell what it will be?&quot; said he.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not a prophet. All I can say is I am sure it will be
                        human, full of imperfections, full of opportunities for improvementsand that
                        I hope it will be better than what we have now. Probably not much better,
                        but a littleand that little, however small it may be, will be a gain.
                        Doesn&apos;t history show a slow but steady advance of the idea that the
                        world is for the people who live in it, a slow retreat of the idea that the
                        world and the people and all its and their resources are for a favored few
                        of some kind of an upper class? YesI think it is reasonable to hope that out
                        of the throes will come a freer and a happier and a more intelligent
                        race.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she burst out, apparently irrelevantly: &quot;But I
                        can&apos;tI really can&apos;t agree with you that everyone ought to
                        do physical labor. That would drag the world downyes, I&apos;m sure it
                        would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you haven&apos;t thought about that,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Painters do physical laborand sculptorsand writersand all the
                        scientific menand the inventors <pb id="VAA2368-148" n="144"/> and&quot;
                        He laughed at her &quot;Who doesn&apos;t do physical labor that does
                        anything really useful? Why, you yourselfat tennis and riding and such
                        thingsdo heavy physical labor. I&apos;ve only to look at your body to
                        see that. But it&apos;s of a foolish kindfoolish and narrowly
                        selfish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see I&apos;d better not try to argue with you,&quot; said
                        she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nodon&apos;t arguewith me or with anybody,&quot; rejoined
                        he. &quot;Sit down quietly and think about lifeabout your life. Think
                        how it is best to live so that you may get the most out of lifethe most
                        substantial happiness. Don&apos;t go on doing the silly customary things
                        simply because a silly customary world says they are amusing and worth
                        while. Thinkand dofor yourself, Jane Hastings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She nodded slowly and thoughtfully. &quot;I&apos;ll try to,&quot;
                        she said. She looked at him with the expression of the mind aroused. It was
                        an expression that often rewarded him after a long straight talk with a
                        fellow being. She went on: &quot;I probably shan&apos;t do what
                        you&apos;d approve. You see, I&apos;ve got to be myselfgot to live
                        to a certain extent the kind of a life fate has made for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You couldn&apos;t successfully live any other,&quot; said
                        he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, while it won&apos;t be at all what you&apos;d regard
                        as a model lifeor even perhaps usefulit&apos;ll be very differentvery
                        much betterthan it would have been, if I hadn&apos;t met youVictor
                        Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-149" n="145"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I&apos;ve done nothing,&quot; said he. &quot;All I
                        try to do is to encourage my fellow beings to be themselves. So live your
                        own lifethe life you can live bestjust as you wear the clothes that fit and
                        become you. ... And nowabout the street car question. What do you want of
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell me what to say to father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head. &quot;Can&apos;t do it,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;There&apos;s a good place for you to make a beginning. Put on
                        an old dress and go down town and get acquainted with the family life of the
                        street-car men. Talk to their wives and their children. Look into the whole
                        business yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m notnot competent to judge,&quot; objected she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, make yourself competent,&quot; advised he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I might get Miss Gordon to go with me,&quot; suggested she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll learn more thoroughly if you go alone,&quot;
                        declared he.</p>
                    <p>She hesitatedventured with a winning smile: &quot;You won&apos;t go
                        with mejust to get me started right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;You&apos;ve got to learn for
                        yourselfor not at all. If I go with you&apos;ll get my point of view,
                        and it will take you so much the longer to get your own.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps you&apos;d prefer I didn&apos;t go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not a matter of much importance, one way or the
                        otherexcept perhaps to yourself,&quot; replied he <pb id="VAA2368-150"
                            n="146"/> &quot;Any one individual can do the human race little good
                        by learning the truth about life. The only benefit is to himself.
                        Don&apos;t forget that in your sweet enthusiasm for doing something
                        noble and generous and helpful. Don&apos;t become a Davy Hull. You know,
                        Davy is on earth for the benefit of the human race. Ever since he was born
                        he has been taken care ofsupplied with food, clothing, shelter, everything.
                        Yet he imagines that he is somehow a Godappointed guardian of the people who
                        have gathered and cooked his food, made his clothing, served him in every
                        way. It&apos;s very funny, that attitude of your class toward
                        mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They look up to us,&quot; said Jane. &quot;You
                        can&apos;t blame us for allowing itfor becoming pleased with
                        ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s the worst of itwe do look up to you,&quot;
                        admitted he. &quot;Butwe&apos;re learning better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">You&apos;ve</hi> already learned betteryou personally, I
                        mean. I think that when you compare me, for instance, with a girl like Selma
                        Gordon, you look down on me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you, yourself, feel that any woman who is
                        self-supporting and free is your superior?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;In some moods, I do,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;In other
                        moods, I feel as I was brought up to feel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They talked on and on, she detaining him without seeming to do so. She felt
                        proud of her adroitness. But the truth was that his stopping on for nearly
                        two hours was almost altogether a tribute to her physical <pb
                            id="VAA2368-151" n="147"/> charmthough Victor was unconscious of it.
                        When the afternoon was drawing on toward the time for her father to come,
                        she reluctantly let him go. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But you&apos;ll come again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t do that,&quot; replied he regretfully.
                        &quot;I could not come to your father&apos;s house and continue
                        free. I must be able to say what I honestly think, without any
                        restraint.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said she. &quot;And I want you to say
                        and to write what you believe to be true and right. Butwe&apos;ll see
                        each other again. I&apos;m sure we are going to be friends.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His expression as he bade her good-by told her that she had won his respect
                        and his liking. She had a suspicion that she did not deserve either; but she
                        was full of good resolutions, and assured herself she soon would be what she
                        had pretendedthat her pretenses were not exactly false, only somewhat
                        premature.</p>
                    <p>At dinner that evening she said to her father:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I ought to do something beside enjoy myself. I&apos;ve
                        decided to go down among the poor people and see whether I can&apos;t
                        help them in some way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;d better keep away from that part of town,&quot;
                        advised her father. &quot;They live awful dirty, and you might ectch
                        some disease. If you want to do anything for the poor, send a check to our
                        minister or to the charity society. There&apos;s two kinds of poorthose
                        that are working hard and saving their money and getting up out of the dirt,
                        and those that haven&apos;t got no spunk <pb id="VAA2368-152" n="148"/>
                        or get-up. The first kind don&apos;t need help, and the second
                        don&apos;t deserve it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But there are the children, popsy,&quot; urged Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The children of the no-account poor ought to have a
                        chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t reckon there ever was a more shiftless, do-easy
                        pair than my father and mother,&quot; rejoined Martin Hastings.
                        &quot;They were what set me to jumping.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She saw that his view was hopelessly narrowthat, while he regarded himself
                        justly as an extraordinary man, he also, for purposes of prejudice and
                        selfishness, regarded his own achievements in overcoming what would have
                        been hopeless handicaps to any but a giant in character and in physical
                        endurance as an instance of what any one could do if he would but work. She
                        never argued with him when she wished to carry her point. She now said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seems to me that, in our own interest, we ought to do what we
                        can to make the poor live better. As you say, it&apos;s positively
                        dangerous to go about in the tenement part of townand those people are
                        always coming among us. For instance, our servants have relatives living in
                        Cooper Street, where there&apos;s a pest of consumption.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Old Hastings nodded. &quot;That&apos;s part of Davy Hull&apos;s
                        reform programme,&quot; said he. &quot;And I&apos;m in favor of
                        it. The city government ought to make them people clean up.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-153" n="149"/>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dora wants that done, toodoesn&apos;t he?&quot; said
                        Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied the old man sourly. &quot;He says
                        it&apos;s no use to clean up the slums unless you raise wagesand that
                        then the slum people&apos;d clean themselves up. The idea of giving
                        those worthless trash more money to spend for beer and whisky and finery for
                        their fool daughters. Why, they don&apos;t earn what we give
                        &apos;em now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane couldn&apos;t resist the temptation to say, &quot;I guess the
                        laziest of them earn more than Davy Hull or I.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because some gets more than they earn ain&apos;t a reason why
                        others should.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Maybe you and Davy ought to
                        have less, but Victor Dorn and his riffraff oughtn&apos;t to be
                        pampered. ... Do you want me to cut your allowance down?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was ready for him. &quot;If you can get as satisfactory a housekeeper
                        for less, you&apos;re a fool to overpay the one you have.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The old man was delighted. &quot;I&apos;ve been cheating
                        you,&quot; said he. &quot;I&apos;ll double your pay.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re doing it just in time to stop a strike,&quot;
                        laughed the girl.</p>
                    <p>After a not unknown fashion she was most obedient to her father when his
                        commands happened to coincide with her own inclinations. Her ardor for an
                        excursion into the slums and the tenements died almost with Victor
                        Dorn&apos;s departure. Her father&apos;s reasons for forbidding her
                        to go did not impress her as convincing, but <pb id="VAA2368-154" n="150"/>
                        she felt that she owed it to him to respect his wishes. Anyhow, what could
                        she find out that she did not know already? Yes, Dorn and her father were
                        right in the conclusion each reached by a different road. She would do well
                        not to meddle where she could not possibly accomplish any good. She could
                        question the servants and could get from them all the facts she needed for
                        urging her father at least to cut down the hours of labor.</p>
                    <p>The more she thought about Victor Dorn the more uneasy she became. She had
                        made more progress with him than she had hoped to make in so short a time.
                        But she had made it at an unexpected cost. If she had softened him, he had
                        established a disquieting influence over her. She was not sure, but she was
                        afraid, that he was stronger than shethat, if she persisted in her whim, she
                        would soon be liking him entirely too well for her own comfort. Except as a
                        pastime, Victor Dorn did not fit into her scheme of life. If she continued
                        to see him, to yield to the delight of his magnetic voice, of his fresh and
                        original mind, of his energetic and dominating personality, might he not
                        become arousedbegin to assert power over her, compel her totoshe could not
                        imagine what; only, it was foolish to deny that he was a dangerous man.
                        &quot;If I&apos;ve got good sense,&quot; decided she,
                        &quot;I&apos;ll let him alone. I&apos;ve nothing to gain and
                        everything to lose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her motorthe one her father had ordered as a birthday presentcame the next
                        day; and on the following <pb id="VAA2368-155" n="151"/> day two girl
                        friends from Cincinnati arrived for a long visit. So, Jane Hastings had the
                        help she felt she perhaps needed in resisting the temptings of her whim.</p>
                    <p>To aid her in giving her friends a good time she impressed Davy Hull, in
                        spite of his protests that his political work made social fooling about
                        impossible. The truth was that the reform movement, of which he was one of
                        the figureheads, was being organized by far more skillful and expert hands
                        than hisand for purposes of which he had no notion. So, he really had all
                        the time in the world to look after Ellen Clearwater and Josie Arthur, and
                        to pose as a serious man bent upon doing his duty as an upper class person
                        of leisure. All that the reform machine wished of him was to talk and to
                        poseand to ride on the show seat of the pretty, new political wagon.</p>
                    <p>The new movement had not yet been &quot;sprung&quot; upon the public.
                        It was still an open secret among the young men of the &quot;better
                        element&quot; in the Lincoln, the Jefferson and the University clubs.
                        Money was being subscribed liberally by persons of good family who hoped for
                        political preferment and could not get it from the old parties, and by
                        corporations tired of being &quot;blackmailed&quot; by Kelly and
                        House, and desirous of getting into office men who would give them what they
                        wanted because it was for the public good that they should not be hampered
                        in any way. With plenty of money an excellent machine could be built and set
                        to running. <pb id="VAA2368-156" n="152"/> Also, there was talk of a fusion
                        with the Democratic machine, House to order the wholesale indorsement of the
                        reform ticket in exchange for a few minor places.</p>
                    <p>When the excitement among the young gentlemen over the approaching moral
                        regeneration of Remsen City politics was at the boiling point Victor Dorn
                        sent for David Hullasked him to come to the Baker Avenue caf, which was the
                        social headquarters of Dorn&apos;s Workingmen&apos;s League. As Hull
                        was rather counting on Dorn&apos;s support, or at least neutrality, in
                        the approaching contest, he accepted promptly. As he entered the caf he saw
                        Dorn seated at a table in a far corner listening calmly to a man who was
                        obviously angrily in earnest. At second glance he recognized Tony Rivers,
                        one of Dick Kelly&apos;s shrewdest lieutenants and a labor leader of
                        great influence in the unions of factory workers. Among those in
                        &quot;the know&quot; it was understood that Rivers could come nearer
                        to delivering the labor vote than any man in Remsen City. He knew whom to
                        corrupt with bribes and whom to entrap by subtle appeals to ignorant
                        prejudice. As a large part of his herd was intensely Catholic, Rivers was a
                        devout Catholic. To quote his own phrase, used in a company on whose
                        discretion he could count, &quot;Many&apos;s the pair of pants
                        I&apos;ve worn out doing the stations of the Cross.&quot; In fact,
                        Rivers had been brought up a Presbyterian, and under the name of Blakehis
                        correct namehad &quot;done a stretch&quot; in Joliet for picking
                        pockets.</p>
                    <p>Dorn caught sight of Davy Hull, hanging uncertainly <pb id="VAA2368-157"
                            n="153"/> in the offing. He rose at once, said a few words in a quiet,
                        emphatic way to Riverswords of conclusion and dismissaland advanced to meet
                        Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to interrupt. I can wait,&quot; said
                        Hull, who saw Rivers&apos; angry scowl at him. He did not wish to offend
                        the great labor leader.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That fellow pushed himself on me,&quot; said Dorn.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve nothing to say to him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tony Riverswasn&apos;t it?&quot; said Davy as they seated
                        themselves at another table.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to expose him in next week&apos;s <hi
                            rend="i">New Day,&quot;</hi> replied Victor. &quot;When I sent
                        him a copy of the article for his corrections if he could make any, he came
                        threatening.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve heard he&apos;s a dangerous man,&quot; said
                        Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;ll not be so dangerous after Saturday,&quot;
                        replied Victor. &quot;One by one I&apos;m putting the labor agents
                        of your friends out of business. The best onesthe chaps like Riversare hard
                        to catch. And if I should attack one of them before I had him dead to
                        rights, I&apos;d only strengthen him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think you can destroy Rivers&apos; influence?&quot;
                        said Davy incredulously.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I were not sure of it I&apos;d not publish a line,&quot;
                        said Victor. &quot;But to get to the subject I wish to talk to you
                        about. You are to be the reform candidate for Mayor in the fall?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy looked important and self-conscious. &quot;There has been some talk
                        of&quot; he began.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-158" n="154"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve sent for you to ask you to withdraw from the
                        movement, Hull,&quot; interrupted Victor.</p>
                    <p>Hull smiled. &quot;And I&apos;ve come to ask you to support
                        it,&quot; said Hull. &quot;We&apos;ll win, anyhow. But
                        I&apos;d like to see all the forces against corruption united in this
                        campaign. I am even urging my people to put one or two of your men on the
                        ticket.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;None of us would accept,&quot; said Victor. &quot;That
                        isn&apos;t our kind of politics. We&apos;ll take nothing until we
                        get everything. ... What do you know about this movement you&apos;re
                        lending your name to?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I organized it,&quot; said Hull proudly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Pardon meDick Kelly organized it,&quot; replied Victor.
                        &quot;They&apos;re simply using you, Davy, to play their rotten
                        game. Kelly knew he was certain to be beaten this fall. He doesn&apos;t
                        care especially for that, because House and his gang are just as much Kelly
                        as Kelly himself. But he&apos;s alarmed about the judgeship.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy Hull reddened, though he tried hard to look indifferent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s given up hope of pulling through the scoundrel
                        who&apos;s on the bench now. He knows that our man would be elected,
                        though his tool had the support of the Republicans, the Democrats and the
                        new reform crowd.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn had been watching Hull&apos;s embarrassed face keenly. He now said:
                        &quot;You understand, I see, why Judge Freilig changed his mind and
                        decided that he <pb id="VAA2368-159" n="155"/> must stop devoting himself to
                        the public and think of the welfare of his family and resume the practice of
                        the law?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Judge Freilig is an honorable gentleman,&quot; said Davy with
                        much dignity. &quot;I&apos;m sorry, Dorn, that you listen to the
                        lies of demagogues.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If Freilig had persisted in running,&quot; said Victor,
                        &quot;I should have published the list of stocks and bonds of
                        corporations benefiting by his decisions that his brother and his father
                        have come into possession of during his two terms on the bench. Many of our
                        judges are simply mentally crooked. But Freilig is a bribe taker. He
                        probably believes his decisions are just. All you fellows believe that
                        upper-class rule is really best for the people&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And so it is,&quot; said Davy. &quot;And you, an educated
                        man, know it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not argue that now,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;As I was saying, while Freilig decides for what he honestly thinks
                        is right, he also feels he is entitled to a share of the substantial
                        benefits. Most of the judges, after serving the upper class faithfully for
                        years, retire to an old age of comparative poverty. Freilig thinks that is
                        foolish.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you agree with him,&quot; said Hull sarcastically.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I sympathize with him,&quot; said Victor. &quot;He retires
                        with reputation unstained and with plenty of money. If I should publish the
                        truth about him, would he lose <pb id="VAA2368-160" n="156"/> a single one
                        of his friends? You know he wouldn&apos;. That isn&apos;t the way
                        the world is run at present.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt it would be run much better if your crowd were in
                        charge,&quot; sneered Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, much worse,&quot; replied Victor unruffled.
                        &quot;But we&apos;re educating ourselves so that, when our time
                        comes, we&apos;ll not do so badly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have plenty of time for education,&quot; said
                        Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Plenty,&quot; said Victor. &quot;But why are you angry?
                        Because you realize now that your reform candidate for judge is of Dick
                        Kelly&apos;s selecting?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Kelly didn&apos;t propose Hugo Galland,&quot; cried Davy
                        hotly. &quot;I proposed him myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was his the first name you proposed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Something in Dorn&apos;s tone made Davy feel that it would be unwise to
                        yield to the impulse to tell a liefor the highly moral purpose of silencing
                        this agitator and demagogue.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will remember,&quot; pursued Victor, &quot;that Galland
                        was the sixth or seventh name you proposedand that Joe House rejected the
                        others. He did it, after consuing with Kelly. You recalldon&apos;t
                        you?that every time you brought him a name he took time to
                        consider?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know so much about all this?&quot; cried Davy, his
                        tone suggesting that Victor was wholly mistaken, but his manner betraying
                        that he knew Victor was right.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-161" n="157"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, politicians are human,&quot; replied Dorn. &quot;And
                        the human race is loose-mouthed. I saw years ago that if I was to build my
                        party I must have full and accurate information as to all that was going on.
                        I made my plans accordingly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Galland is an honest manrichabove suspicionabove corruptionan ideal
                        candidate,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is a corporation owner, a corporation lawyerand a
                        fool,&quot; said Victor, &quot;As I&apos;ve told you, all Dick
                        Kelly&apos;s interest in this fall&apos;s local election is that
                        judgeship.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Galland is my man. I want to see him elected. If Kelly&apos;s
                        for Galland, so much the better. Then we&apos;re sure of electing himof
                        getting the right sort of a man on the bench.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not here to argue with you about politics,
                        Davy,&quot; said Victor. &quot;I brought you here because I like
                        youbelieve in your honestyand don&apos;t want to see you humiliated.
                        I&apos;m giving you a chance to save yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;From what?&quot; inquired Hull, not so valiant as he pretended
                        to be.</p>
                    <p>&quot;From the ridicule and disgrace that will cover this reform
                        movement, If you persist in it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull burst out laughing. &quot;Of all the damned impudence!&quot; he
                        exclaimed. &quot;Dorn, I think you&apos;ve gone crazy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can&apos;t irritate me, Hull. I&apos;ve been giving you
                        the benefit of the doubt. I think you are falling into <pb id="VAA2368-162"
                            n="158"/> the commonest kind of errordoing evil and winking at evil in
                        order that a good end may be gained. Now, listen. What are the things you
                        reformers are counting on to get you votes this fall&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy maintained a haughty silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The traction scandals, the gas scandals and the paving
                        scandalsisn&apos;t that it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thenwhy have the gas crowd, the traction crowd and the paving crowd
                        each contributed twenty-five thousand dollars to your campaign
                        fund?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull stared at Victor Dorn in amazement. &quot;Who told you that
                        lie?&quot; he blustered.</p>
                    <p>Dorn looked at him sadly. &quot;Then you knew? I hoped you
                        didn&apos;t, Hull. Butnow that you&apos;re facing the situation
                        squarely, don&apos;t you see that you&apos;re being made a fool of?
                        Would those people put up for your election if they weren&apos;t <hi
                            rend="i">sure</hi> you and your crowd were <hi rend="i">their</hi>
                        crowd?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;ll find out!&quot; cried Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll find out, you mean,&quot; replied Victor.
                        &quot;I see your whole programme, Davy. They&apos;ll put you in, and
                        they&apos;ll say, &apos;Let us alone and we&apos;ll make you
                        governor of the State. Annoy us, and you&apos;ll have no political
                        future.&apos; And you&apos;ll say to yourself, &apos;The wise
                        thing for me to do is to wait until I&apos;m governor before I begin to
                        serve the people. <hi rend="i">Then</hi> I can really do
                        something.&apos; And so, you&apos;ll be <hi rend="i">their</hi>
                        mayorand afterward <hi rend="i">their</hi> governorbecause they&apos;ll
                        hold out another inducement <pb id="VAA2368-163" n="159"/> Anyhow, by that
                        time you&apos;ll be so completely theirs that you&apos;ll have no
                        hope of a career except through them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After reading how some famous oration wrought upon its audience we turn to it
                        and wonder that such tempests of emotion could have been produced by such
                        simple, perhaps almost commonplace words. The key to the mystery is usually
                        a magic quality in the tone of the orator, evoking before its hypnotized
                        hearers a series of vivid pictures, just as the notes of a violin, with no
                        aid from words or even from musical form seem to materialize into visions.
                        This uncommon yet by no means rare power was in Victor Dorn&apos;s
                        voice, and explained his extraordinary influence over people of all kinds
                        and classes; it wove a spell that enmeshed even those who disliked him for
                        his detestable views. Davy Hull, listening to Victor&apos;s simple
                        recital of his prospective career, was so wrought upon that he sat staring
                        before him in a kind of terror.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Davy,&quot; said Victor gently, &quot;you&apos;re at
                        the parting of the ways. The time for honest halfway reformersfor political
                        amateurs has passed. &apos;Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or
                        die!&apos;that&apos;s the situation today.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And Hull knew that it was so. &quot;What do you propose, Dorn?&quot;
                        he said. &quot;I want to do what&apos;s rightwhat&apos;s best
                        for the people.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about the people, Hull,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;Upper classes come and pass, but the people remain <pb
                            id="VAA2368-164" n="160"/> bigger and stronger and more aggressive with
                        every century. And they dictate language and art, and politics and
                        religionwhat we shall all eat and wear and think and do. Only what they
                        approve, only that yoke even which they themselves accept, has any chance of
                        enduring. Don&apos;t worry about the people, Davy. Worry about
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I admit,&quot; said Hull, &quot;that I don&apos;t like
                        a lot of things about thethe forces I find I&apos;ve got to use in order
                        to carry through my plans. I admit that even the sincere young fellows
                        I&apos;ve grouped together to head this movement are
                        narrowsuperciliousself-satisfiedthat they irritate me and are not
                        trustworthy. But I feel that, if I once get the office, I&apos;ll be
                        strong enough to put my plans through,&quot; Nervously,
                        &quot;I&apos;m giving you my full confidenceas I&apos;ve given
                        it to no one else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve told me nothing I didn&apos;t know
                        already,&quot; said Victor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve got to choose between this reform party and your
                        party,&quot; continued Hull. &quot;That is, I&apos;ve got no
                        choice. For, candidly, I&apos;ve no confidence in the working class.
                        It&apos;s too ignorant to do the ruling. It&apos;s too credulous to
                        build onfor its credulity makes it fickle. And I believe in the better
                        class, too. It may be sordid and greedy and tyrannical, but by appealing to
                        its good instinctsand to its fear of the money kings and the monopolists,
                        something good can be got through it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you want to get office,&quot; said Dorn,
                        &quot;you&apos;re <pb id="VAA2368-165" n="161"/> right. But if you
                        want to <hi rend="i">be</hi> somebody, if you want to develop yourself, to
                        have the joy of being utterly unafraid in speech and in actionwhy, come with
                        us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a pause Hull said, &quot;I&apos;d like to do it. I&apos;d
                        like to help you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor laid his hand on Davy&apos;s arm. &quot;Get it straight,
                        Davy,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t help us. We
                        don&apos;t need you. It&apos;s you that needs us. We&apos;ll
                        make an honest man of youinstead of a trimming politician, trying to say or
                        to do something more or less honest once in a while and winking at or
                        abetting crookedness most of the time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve done nothing, and I&apos;ll do nothing, to be
                        ashamed of,&quot; protested Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not ashamed of the way your movement is financed?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy moved uncomfortably. &quot;The money&apos;s ours now,&quot;
                        said he. &quot;They gave it unconditionally.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But he could not meet Victor&apos;s eyes. Victor said: &quot;They
                        paid a hundred thousand dollars for a judgeship and for a blanket mortgage
                        on your party. And if you should win, you&apos;d find you could do
                        little showy things that were of no value, but nothing that would seriously
                        disturb a single leech sucking the blood of this community.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t agree with you,&quot; said Davy. He roused
                        himself into angerhis only remaining refuge. &quot;Your prejudices blind
                        you to all the meansthe <hi rend="i">practical</hi>
                        <pb id="VAA2368-166" n="162"/> meansof doing good, Dorn. I&apos;ve
                        listened patiently to you because I respect your sincerity. But I&apos;m
                        not going to waste my life in mere criticism. I&apos;m going to <hi
                            rend="i">do</hi> something.&quot;</p>
                    <p>An expression of profound sadness came into Victor&apos;s face.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t decide now,&quot; he said. &quot;Think it
                        over. Remember what I&apos;ve told you about what we&apos;ll be
                        compelled to do if you launch this party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull was tempted to burst out violently. Was not this swollen-headed upstart
                        trying to intimidate him by threats? But his strong instinct for prudence
                        persuaded him to conceal his resentment. &quot;Why the devil should you
                        attack <hi rend="i">us?</hi>&quot; he demanded. &quot;Surely
                        we&apos;re nearer your kind of thing than the old partiesand we, too,
                        are against themtheir rotten machines.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We purpose to keep the issue clear in this town,&quot; replied
                        Victor. &quot;So, we can&apos;t allow a party to grow up that <hi
                            rend="i">pretends</hi> to be just as good as ours but is really a cover
                        behind which the old parties we&apos;ve been battering to pieces can
                        reorganize.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is, you&apos;ll tolerate in this market no brand of honest
                        politics but your own?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you wish to put it that way,&quot; replied Victor coolly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suppose you&apos;d rather see Kelly or House win?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ll see that House does win,&quot; replied Victor.
                        &quot;When we have shot your movement full of holes and sunk it, House
                        will put up a straight Democratic ticket, and it will win.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-167" n="163"/>
                    <p>&quot;And House means Kellyand Kelly means corruption rampant.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And corruption rampant means further and much needed education in
                        the school of hard experience for the voters,&quot; said Dorn.
                        &quot;And the more education, the larger our party and the quicker its
                        triumph.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull laughed angrily. &quot;Talk about low self-seeking! Talk about
                        rotten practical politics!&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Dorn held his good humor of the man who has the power and knows it.
                        &quot;Think it over, Davy,&quot; counseled he.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll see you&apos;ve got to come with us or join
                        Kelly. For your own sake I&apos;d like to see you with us. For the
                        party&apos;s sake you&apos;d better be with Kelly, for
                        you&apos;re not really a workingman, and our fellows would be uneasy
                        about you for a long time. You see, we&apos;ve had experience of rich
                        young men whose hearts beat for the wrongs of the working classand that
                        experience has not been fortunate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Before you definitely decide to break with the decent element of
                        the better class, Victor, I want <hi rend="i">you</hi> to think it
                        over,&quot; said Davy. &quot;WeI, myselfhave befriended you more
                        than once. But for a few of us who still have hope that demagoguery will die
                        of itself, your paper would have been suppressed long ago.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor laughed. &quot;I wish they would suppress it,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;The result would give the &apos;better element&apos; in
                        this town a very bad quarter of an hour, at least.&quot; He rose.
                        &quot;We&apos;ve both said all we&apos;ve got to say to each
                        other. I see I&apos;ve done no good. I feared it would be <pb
                            id="VAA2368-168" n="164"/> so.&quot; He was looking into
                        Hull&apos;s eyesinto his very soul. &quot;When we meet again, you
                        will probably be my open and bitter enemy. It&apos;s a pity. It makes me
                        sad. Good-by, anddo think it over, Davy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn moved rapidly away. Hull looked after him in surprise. At first blush he
                        was astonished that Dorn should care so much about him as this curious
                        interview and his emotion at its end indicated. But on reflecting his
                        astonishment disappeared, and he took the view that Dorn was simply
                        impressed by his personality and by his abilitywas perhaps craftily trying
                        to disarm him and to destroy his political movement which was threatening to
                        destroy the Workingmen&apos;s League. &quot;A very shrewd chap is
                        Dorn,&quot; thought Davywhy do we always generously concede at least
                        acumen to those we suspect of having a good opinion of us?&quot;A <hi
                            rend="i">very</hi> shrewd chap. It&apos;s unfortunate he&apos;s
                        cursed with that miserable envy of those better born and better off than he
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy spent the early evening at the University Club, where he was an
                        important figure. Later on he went to a dance at Mrs. Venable&apos;sand
                        there he was indeed a lion, as an unmarried man with money cannot but be in
                        a company of ladiesfor money to a lady is what soil and sun and rain are to
                        a floweris that without which she must cease to exist. But still later, when
                        he was alone in bedperhaps with the supper he ate at Mrs. Venable&apos;s
                        not sitting as lightly as comfort requiredthe things Victor Dorn had said
                        came trailing <pb id="VAA2368-169" n="165"/> drearily through his mind. What
                        kind of an article would Dorn print? Those facts about the campaign fund
                        certainly would look badly in cold typeespecially if Dorn had the proofs.
                        And Hugo Galland Beyond question the mere list of the corporations in which
                        Hugo was director or large stockholder would make him absurd as a judge,
                        sitting in that district. And Hugo the son-in-law of the most offensive
                        capitalist in that section of the State! And the deal with House, endorsed
                        by Kellyhow nasty that would look, <hi rend="i">if</hi> Victor had the
                        proofs. <hi rend="i">If</hi> Victor had the proofs. But had he?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I <hi rend="i">must</hi> have a talk with Kelly,&quot; said
                        Davy, aloud.</p>
                    <p>The words startled himnot his voice suddenly sounding in the profound
                        stillness of his bedroom, but the words themselves. It was his first
                        admission to himself of the vicious truth he had known from the outset and
                        had been pretending to himself that he did not knowthe truth that his reform
                        movement was a fraud contrived by Dick Kelly to further the interests of the
                        company of financiers and the gang of politico-criminal thugs who owned the
                        party machinery. It is a nice question whether a man is ever allowed to go
                        in <hi rend="i">honest</hi> self-deception decisively far along a wrong
                        road. However this may be, certain it is that David Hull, reformer, was not
                        so allowed. And he was glad of the darkness that hid him at least physically
                        from himself as he strove to convince himself that, if he was doing wrong,
                        it was from the highest motives and for the <pb id="VAA2368-170" n="166"/>
                        noblest purposes and would result in the public goodand not merely in fame
                        and office for David Hull.</p>
                    <p>The struggle ended as struggles usually end in the famous arena of moral sham
                        battles called conscience; and toward the middle of the following morning
                        Davy, at peace with himself and prepared to make any sacrifice of personal
                        squeamishness or moral idealism for the sake of the public good, sought out
                        Dick Kelly.</p>
                    <p>Kelly&apos;s original headquarters had, of course, been the doggery in
                        and through which he had established himself as a political power. As his
                        power grew and his relations with more respectable elements of society
                        extended he shifted to a saloon and beer garden kept by a reputable German
                        and frequented by all kinds of peoplea place where his friends of the
                        avowedly criminal class and his newer friends of the class that does nothing
                        legally criminal, except in emergencies, would feel equally at ease. He
                        retained ownership of the doggery, but took his name down and put up that of
                        his barkeeper. When he won his first big political fight and took charge of
                        the public affairs of Remsen City and made an arrangement with Joe House
                        where-under Remsen City, whenever it wearied or sickened of Kelly, could
                        take instead Kelly disguised as Joe Housewhen he thus became a full blown
                        boss he established a secondary headquarters in addition to that at
                        Herrmann&apos;s Garden. Every morning at ten o&apos;clock he took
                        his stand in the main corridor of the City Hall, really a thoroughfare and
                        short cut for the busiest part of <pb id="VAA2368-171" n="167"/> town. With
                        a cigar in his mouth he stood there for an hour or so, holding court, making
                        appointments, attending to all sorts of political business.</p>
                    <p>Presently his importance and his ideas of etiquette expanded to such an
                        extent that he had to establish the Blaine Club. Joe House&apos;s Tilden
                        Club was established two years later, in imitation of Kelly. If you had very
                        private and important business with Kellybusiness of the kind of which the
                        public must get no inkling, you madepreferably by telephonean appointment to
                        meet him in his real estate offices in the Hastings Buildinga suite with
                        entrances and exits into three separated corridors. If you wished to see him
                        about ordinary matters and were a person who could
                        &quot;confer&quot; with Kelly without its causing talk you met him
                        at the Blaine Club. If you wished to cultivate him, to pay court to him, you
                        saw him at Herrmann&apos;sor in the general rooms of the club. If you
                        were a busy man and had time only to exchange greetings with himto
                        &quot;keep in touch&quot;you passed through the City Hall now and
                        then at his hour. Some bosses soon grow too proud for the vulgar democracy
                        of such a public stand; but Kelly, partly through shrewdness, partly through
                        inclination, clung to the City Hall stand and encouraged the humblest
                        citizens to seek him there and tell him the news or ask his aid or his
                        advice.</p>
                    <p>It was at the City Hall that Davy Hull sought him, and found him. Twice he
                        walked briskly to the boss; <pb id="VAA2368-172" n="168"/> the third time he
                        went by slowly. Kelly, who saw everything, had known from the first glance
                        at Hull&apos;s grave, anxious face, that the young leader of the
                        &quot;holy boys&quot; was there to see him. But he ignored Davy
                        until Davy addressed him directly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Howdy, Mr. Hull!&quot; said he, observing the young man with
                        eyes that twinkled cynically. &quot;What&apos;s the good
                        word?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I want to have a little talk with you,&quot; Davy blurted out.
                        &quot;Where could I see you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here I am,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;Talk away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couldn&apos;t I see you at somesome place where we&apos;d
                        not be interrupted? I saw Victor Dorn yesterday, and he said some things
                        that I think you ought to know about.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do know about &apos;em,&quot; replied Kelly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you sure? I mean his threats toto&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Davy paused in an embarrassed search for a word that would not hurt his
                        own but recently soothed conscience, Kelly laughed. &quot;To expose you
                        holy boys?&quot; inquired he. &quot;To upset the nice moral campaign
                        you and Joe House have laid out? Yes, I know all about Mr. Victor Dorn.
                        ButJoe House is the man you want to see. You boys are trying to do me
                        uptrying to break up the party. You can&apos;t expect <hi rend="i"
                        >me</hi> to help you. I&apos;ve got great respect for you personally,
                        Mr. Hull. Your fatherhe was a fine old Republican wheel-horse. He stood by
                        the party through thick and thinand the party stood by him. <pb
                            id="VAA2368-173" n="169"/> So, I respect his sonpersonally. But
                        politicallythat&apos;s another matter. Politically I respect straight
                        organization men of either party, but I&apos;ve got no use for amateurs
                        and reformers. Sogo to Joe House.&quot; All this in perfect good humor,
                        and in a tone of banter that might have ruffled a man with a keener sense of
                        humor than Davy&apos;s.</p>
                    <p>Davy was red to his eyes, not because Kelly was laughing at him, but because
                        he stood convicted of such a stupid political blunder as coming direct to
                        Kelly when obviously he should have gone to Kelly&apos;s secret partner.
                        &quot;Dorn means to attack us allRepublicans, Democrats and
                        Citizens&apos; Alliance,&quot; stammered Davy, trying to justify
                        himself.</p>
                    <p>Kelly shifted his cigar and shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        worry about his attacks on meon <hi rend="i">us,</hi>&quot; said he.
                        &quot;We&apos;re used to being attacked. We haven&apos;t got no
                        reputation for superior virtue to lose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he says he can prove that our whole campaign is simply a deal
                        between you and House and me to fool the people and elect a bad
                        judge.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So I&apos;ve heard,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;But what of
                        it? You know it ain&apos;t so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I don&apos;t, Mr. Kelly,&quot; replied Hull,
                        desperately. &quot;On the contrary, I think it is so. And I may add I
                        think we are justified in making such a deal, when that&apos;s the only
                        way to save the community from Victor Dorn and his crowd ofof
                        anarchists.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kelly looked at him silently with amused eyes.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-174" n="170"/>
                    <p>&quot;House can&apos;t do anything,&quot; pursued Davy.
                        &quot;Maybe <hi rend="i">you,</hi> can. So I came straight to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;re getting a little political sense,
                        my boy,&quot; said Kelly. &quot;Perhaps you&apos;re beginning to
                        see that a politician has got to be practicalthat it&apos;s the
                        organizations that keeps this city from being the prey to Victor
                        Dorns.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see that,&quot; said Davy. &quot;I&apos;m willing to
                        admit that I&apos;ve misjudged you, Mr. Kellythat the better classes owe
                        you a heavy debtand that you are one of the men we&apos;ve got to rely
                        on chiefly to stem the tide of anarchy that&apos;s risingthe attack on
                        the propertied classesthe intelligent classes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see your eyes are being opened, my boy,&quot; said Kelly in a
                        kindly tone that showed how deeply he appreciated this unexpected
                        recognition of his own notion of his mission. &quot;You young silk
                        stocking fellows up at the University Club, and the Lincoln and the
                        Jefferson, have been indulging in a lot of loose talk against the fellows
                        that do the hard work in politicsthe fellows that helped your fathers to
                        make fortunes and that are helping you boys to keep &apos;em. If I
                        didn&apos;t have a pretty level head on me, I&apos;d take my hands
                        off and give Dorn and his gang a chance at you. I tell you, when you fool
                        with that reform nonsense, you play with fire in a powder mill.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But II had an idea that you wanted me to go ahead,&quot; said
                        Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not the way you started last spring,&quot; replied Kelly. <pb
                            id="VAA2368-175" n="171"/> &quot;Not the way you&apos;d
                        &apos;a gone if I hadn&apos;t taken hold. I&apos;ve been saving
                        you in spite of yourselves. Thanks to me, your party&apos;s on a sound,
                        conservative basis and won&apos;t do any harm and may do some good in
                        teaching a lesson to those of our boys that&apos;ve been going a little
                        too far. It ain&apos;t good for an organization to win always.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dorn seemed to be sureabsolutely sure,&quot; said Hull.
                        &quot;And he&apos;s pretty shrewd at politicsisn&apos;t
                        he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry about him, I tell you,&quot; replied
                        Kelly.</p>
                    <p>The sudden hardening of his voice and of his never notably soft face was
                        tribute stronger than any words to Dorn&apos;s ability as a politician,
                        to his power as an antagonist. Davy felt a sinister intentand he knew that
                        Dick Kelly had risen because he would stop at nothing. He was as eager to
                        get away from the boss as the boss was to be rid of him. The intrusion of a
                        henchman, to whom Kelly had no doubt signaled, gave him the excuse. As soon
                        as he had turned from the City Hall into Morton Street he slackened to as
                        slow a walk as his length of leg would permit. Moving along, absorbed in
                        uncomfortable thoughts, he startled violently when he heard Selma
                        Gordon&apos;s voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How d&apos;you do, Mr. Hull? I was hoping I&apos;d see you
                        to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was standing before himthe same fascinating embodiment of life and health
                        and untamed energy; the direct, honest glance.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-176" n="172"/>
                    <p>&quot;I want to talk to you,&quot; she went on, &quot;and I
                        can&apos;t, walking beside you. You&apos;re far too tall. Come into
                        the park and we&apos;ll sit on that bench under the big maple.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He had mechanically lifted his hat, but he had not spoken. He did not find
                        words until they were seated side by side, and then all he could say was:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m very glad to see you againvery glad, indeed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In fact, he was the reverse of glad, for he was afraid of her, afraid of
                        himself when under the spell of her presence. He who prided himself on his
                        self-control, he could not account for the effect this girl had upon him. As
                        he sat there beside her the impulse Jane Hastings had so adroitly checked
                        came surging back. He had believed, had hoped it was gone for good and all.
                        He found that in its mysterious hiding place it had been gaining strength.
                        Quite clearly he saw how absurd was the idea of making this girl his wifehe
                        tall and she not much above the bend of his elbow; he conventional, and she
                        the incarnation of passionate revolt against the restraints of class and
                        form and custom which he not only conformed to but religiously believed in.
                        And she set stirring in him all kinds of vague, wild longings to run amuck
                        socially and politicallylongings that, if indulged, would ruin him for any
                        career worthy of the name.</p>
                    <p>He stood up. &quot;I must goI really must,&quot; he said, confusedly.</p>
                    <p>She laid her small, strong hand on his arma natural, <pb id="VAA2368-177"
                            n="173"/> friendly gesture with her, and giving no suggestion of
                        familiarity. Even as she was saying, &quot;Pleaseonly a
                        moment,&quot; he dropped back to the seat.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellwhat is it?&quot; he said abruptly, his gaze resolutely
                        away from her face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor was telling me this morning about his talk with
                        you,&quot; she said in her rapid, energetic way. &quot;He was
                        depressed because he had failed. But I felt sureI feel surethat he
                        hasn&apos;t. In our talk the other day, Mr. Hull, I got a clear idea of
                        your character. A woman understands better. And I know that, after Victor
                        told you the plain truth about the situation, you couldn&apos;t go
                        on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>David looked round rather wildly, swallowed hard several times, said
                        hoarsely: &quot;I won&apos;t, if you&apos;ll marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But for a slight change of expression or of color Davy would have thought she
                        had not heardor perhaps that he had imagined he was uttering the words that
                        forced themselves to his lips in spite of his efforts to suppress them. For
                        she went on in the same impetuous, friendly way:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It seemed to me that you have an instinct for the right
                        that&apos;s unusual in men of your class. At least, I think
                        it&apos;s unusual. I confess I&apos;ve not known any man of your
                        class except youand I know you very slightly. It was I that persuaded Victor
                        to go to you. He believes that a man&apos;s class feeling controls
                        himmakes his moral sensecompels his actions. But I <pb id="VAA2368-178"
                            n="174"/> thought you were an exceptionand he yielded after I urged him
                        a while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know <hi rend="i">what</hi> I am,&quot; said
                        Hull gloomily. &quot;I think I want to do right. Butwhat is right? Not
                        theoretical right, but the practical, workable thing?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s true,&quot; conceded Selma. &quot;We
                        can&apos;t always be certain what&apos;s right. But can&apos;t
                        we always know what&apos;s wrong? And, Mr. Hull, it is wrongaltogether
                        wrongand <hi rend="i">you</hi> know it&apos;s wrongto lend your name and
                        your influence and your reputation to that crowd. They&apos;d let you do
                        a little goodwhy? To make their professions of reform seem plausible. To
                        fool the people into trusting them again. And under cover of the little good
                        you were showily doing, how much mischief they&apos;d do! If
                        you&apos;ll go back over the history of this townof any townof any

                        figureheads.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I want to build up a new partya party of honest men, honestly
                        led,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Led by your sort of young men? I mean young men of your class. Led
                        by young lawyers and merchants and young fellows living on inherited
                        incomes? Don&apos;t you see that&apos;s impossible,&quot; cried
                        Selma. &quot;They are all living off the labor of others. Their whole
                        idea of life is exploiting the massesis reaping where they have not sown or
                        reaping not only what they&apos;ve sown <pb id="VAA2368-179" n="175"/>
                        but also what others have sownfor they couldn&apos;t buy luxury and all
                        the so-called refinements of life for themselves and their idle families
                        merely with what they themselves could earn. How can you build up a really
                            <hi rend="i">honest</hi> party with such men? They may mean well. They
                        no doubt are honest, up to a certain point. But they will side with their
                        class, in every crisis. And their class is the exploiting class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t agree with you,&quot; said Davy. &quot;You
                        are not fair to us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How!&quot; demanded Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t argue with you,&quot; replied Hull.
                        &quot;All I&apos;ll say is that you&apos;ve seen only the one
                        sideonly the side of the working class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That toils without ceasingits men, its women, its
                        children&quot; said the girl with heaving bosom and flashing eyes
                        &quot;only to have most of what it earns filched away from it by your
                        class to waste in foolish luxury!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And whose fault is that?&quot; pleaded Hull.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The fault of my class,&quot; replied she. &quot;Their
                        ignorance, their stupidityyes, and their foolish cunning that overreaches
                        itself. For they tolerate the abuses of the present system because each
                        manat least, each man of the ones who think themselves
                        &apos;smart&apos;imagines that the day is coming when he can escape
                        from the working class and gain the ranks of the despoilers.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you ask <hi rend="i">me</hi> to come into the party of those
                        people!&quot; scoffed Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Hull,&quot; said sheand until then he had <pb
                            id="VAA2368-180" n="176"/> not appreciated how lovely her voice was.
                        &quot;Yesthat is the party for youfor all honest, sincere men who want
                        to have their own respect through and through. To teach those peopleto lead
                        them rightto be truthful and just with themthat is the life worth
                        while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they won&apos;t learn. They won&apos;t be led right.
                        They are as ungrateful as they are foolish. If they weren&apos;t, men
                        like me trying to make a decent career wouldn&apos;t have to compromise
                        with the Kellys and the Houses and their masters. What are Kelly and House
                        but leaders of your class? And they lead ten to Victor Dorn&apos;s one.
                        Why, any day Dorn&apos;s followers may turn on himand you know
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what of that?&quot; cried Selma. &quot;He&apos;s
                        not working to be their leader, but to do what he thinks is right,
                        regardless of consequences. Why is he a happy man, as happiness goes? Why
                        has he gone on his way steadily all these years, never minding setbacks and
                        failures and defeats and dangers? I needn&apos;t tell you why.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Hull, powerfully moved by her earnestness.
                        &quot;I understand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The finest sentence that ever fell from human lips,&quot; Selma
                        went on, &quot;was &apos;Father, forgive them; they know not what
                        they do.&apos; Forgive themforgive us allfor when we go astray it is
                        because we are in the dark. And I want you to come with us, Mr. Hull, and
                        help to make it a little less dark. At least, you will then be <pb
                            id="VAA2368-181" n="177"/> looking toward the lightand every one turned
                        in that direction counts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a long pause, Hull said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Gordon, may I ask you a very personal question?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you in love with Victor Dorn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma laughed merrily. &quot;Jane Hastings had that same
                        curiosity,&quot; said she. &quot;I&apos;ll answer you as I
                        answered herthough she didn&apos;t ask me quite so directly. No, I am
                        not in love with him. We are too busy to bother about those things. We have
                        too much to do to think about ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thenthere is no reason why I should not ask you to be my wifewhy I
                        should not hopeand try?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him with a peculiar smile. &quot;Yes, there is a very good
                        reason. I do not love you, and I shall not love you. I shall not have time
                        for that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you believe in love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t believe in much else,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;Butnot the kind of love you offer me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How do you know?&quot; cried he. &quot;I have not told you
                        yet how I feel toward you. I have not&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, you have,&quot; interrupted she. &quot;This is the
                        secondno, the third time you have seen me. So, the love you offer me can
                        only be of a kind it is not in the least flattering to a woman to inspire.
                        You needn&apos;t apologize,&quot; she went on, laughingly.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve no doubt <pb id="VAA2368-182" n="178"/> you mean
                        well. You simply don&apos;t understand memy sort of woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s you that don&apos;t understand, Selma,&quot;
                        cried he. &quot;You don&apos;t realize how wonderful you arehow much
                        you reveal of yourself at once. I was all but engaged to another woman when
                        I saw you. I&apos;ve been fighting against my love for youfighting
                        against the truth that suddenly came to me that you were the only woman I
                        had ever seen who appealed to and aroused and made strong all that is brave
                        and honest in me. Selma, I need you. I am not infatuated. I am
                        clearer-headed than I ever was in my life. I need you. You can make a man of
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was regarding him with a friendly and even tender sympathy. &quot;I
                        understand now,&quot; she said. &quot;I thought it was simply the
                        ordinary outburst of passion. But I see that it was the result of your
                        struggle with yourself about which road to take in making a
                        career.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If she had not been absorbed in developing her theory she might have seen
                        that Davy was not altogether satisfied with this analysis of his feelings.
                        But he deemed it wise to hold his peace.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You do need some onesome woman,&quot; she went on.
                        &quot;And I am anxious to help you all I can. I couldn&apos;t help
                        you by marrying you. To me marriage means&quot; She checked herself
                        abruptly. &quot;No matter. I can help you, I think, as a friend. But if
                        you wish to marry, you should take some one in your own classsome one
                        who&apos;s in sympathy with you. Then you and <pb id="VAA2368-183"
                            n="179"/> she could work it out togethercould help each other. You see,
                        I don&apos;t need youand there&apos;s nothing in one-sided
                        marriages. ... No, you couldn&apos;t give me anything I need, so far as
                        I can see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe that&apos;s true,&quot; said Davy miserably.</p>
                    <p>She reflected, then continued: &quot;But there&apos;s Jane Hastings.
                        Why not marry her? She is having the same sort of struggle with herself. You
                        and she could help each other. And you&apos;re, both of you, fine
                        characters. I like each of you for exactly the same reasons. ... YesJane
                        needs you, and you need her.&quot; She looked at him with her sweet,
                        frank smile like a breeze straight from the sweep of a vast plateau.
                        &quot;Why, it&apos;s so obvious that I wonder you and she
                        haven&apos;t become engaged long ago. You <hi rend="i">are</hi> fond of
                        her, aren&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Selma,&quot; cried Davy, &quot;I <hi rend="i">love</hi>
                        you. I want <hi rend="i">you.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head with a quaint, fascinating expression of positiveness.
                        &quot;Now, my friend,&quot; said she, &quot;drop that fancy. It
                        isn&apos;t sensible. And it threatens to become silly.&quot; Her
                        smile suddenly expanded into a laugh. &quot;The idea of you and me
                        marriedof <hi rend="i">me</hi> married to <hi rend="i">you!</hi>
                        I&apos;d drive you crazy. No, I shouldn&apos;t stay long enough for
                        that. I&apos;d be off on the wings of the wind to the other end of the
                        earth as soon as you tried to put a halter on me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not join in her laugh. She rose. &quot;You will think again before
                        you go in with those peoplewon&apos;t you, David?&quot; she said,
                        sober and earnest.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-184" n="[180]"/>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care what becomes of me,&quot; he said
                        boyishly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">I</hi> do,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to
                        see you the man you can be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thenmarry me,&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>Her eyes looked gentle friendship; her passionate lips curled in scorn.
                        &quot;I might marry the sort of man you could be,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;but I never could marry a man so weak that, without me to bolster
                        him up, he&apos;d become a stool-pigeon.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she turned and walked away.</p>

                    <head>V.</head>
                    <p>A few days later, after she had taken her daily two hours&apos; walk,
                        Selma went into the secluded part of Washington Park and spent the rest of
                        the morning writing. Her walk was her habitual time for thinking out her
                        plans for the day. And when it was writing that she had to do, and the
                        weather was fine, that particular hillside with its splendid shade so
                        restful for the eyes and so stimulating to the mind became her work-shop.
                        She thought that she was helped as much by the colors of grass and foliage
                        as by the softened light and the tranquil view out over hills and valleys.</p>
                    <p>When she had finished her article she consulted the little nickel watch she
                        carried in her bag and discovered that it was only one o&apos;clock. She
                        had counted on getting through at three or half past. Two hours gained. How
                        could she best use them. The part of the Park where she was sitting was
                        separated from the Hastings grounds only by the winding highroad making its
                        last reach for the top of the hill. She decided that she would go to see
                        Jane Hastingswould try to make tactful progress in her project of helping
                        Jane and David Hull by marrying them to each other. Once she had hit upon
                        this project her interest in both <pb id="VAA2368-186" n="182"/> of them had
                        equally increased. Yes, these gained two hours was an opportunity not to be
                        neglected. She put her papers into her shopping bag and went straight up the
                        steep hill. She arrived at the top, at the edge of the lawn before
                        Jane&apos;s house, with somewhat heightened color and brightened eyes,
                        but with no quickening of the breath. Her slim, solid little body had all
                        the qualities of endurance of those wiry ponies that come from the regions
                        her face and walk and the careless grace of her hair so delightfully
                        suggested. As she advanced toward the house she saw a gay company assembled
                        on the wide veranda. Jane was giving a farewell luncheon for her visitors,
                        had asked almost a dozen of the most presentable girls in the town. It was a
                        very fashionable affair, and everyone had dressed for it in the best she had
                        to wear at that time of day.</p>
                    <p>Selma saw the company while there was still time for her to draw back and
                        descend into the woods. But she knew little about conventionalities, and she
                        cared not at all about them. She had come to see Jane; she conducted herself
                        precisely as she would have expected any one to act who came to see her at
                        any time. She marched straight across the lawn. The hostess, the fashionable
                        visitors, the fashionable guests soon centered upon the extraordinary figure
                        moving toward them under that blazing sun. The figure was extraordinary not
                        for dressthe dress was plain and unconspicuousbut for that expression of the
                        free and the untamed, the lack of self-consciousness so <pb id="VAA2368-187"
                            n="183"/> rarely seen except in children and animals. Jane rushed to the
                        steps to welcome her, seized her extended hands and kissed her with as much
                        enthusiasm as she kissed Jane. There was sincerity in this greeting of
                        Jane&apos;s; but there was pose, also. Here was one of those chances to
                        do the unconventional, the democratic thing.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a glorious surprise!&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll stop for lunch, of course?&quot; Then to the
                        girls nearest them: &quot;This is Selma Gordon, who writes for the <hi
                            rend="i">New Day.</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Pronouncing of namessmilesbowsveiled glances of curiosityseveral young women
                        exchanging whispered comments of amusement. And to be sure, Selma, in that
                        simple costume, gloveless, with dusty shoes and blown hair, did look very
                        much out of place. But then Selma would have looked, in a sense, out of
                        place anywhere but in a wilderness with perhaps a few tents and a half-tamed
                        herd as background. In another sense, she seemed in place anywhere as any
                        natural object must.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t eat lunch,&quot; said Selma. &quot;But
                        I&apos;ll stay if you&apos;ll put me next to you and let me talk to
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not realize what an upsetting of order and precedence this request,
                        which seemed so simple to her, involved. Jane hesitated, but only for a
                        fraction of a second. &quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;Now that I&apos;ve got you I&apos;d not let you go in any
                        circumstances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma was gazing around at the other girls with the <pb id="VAA2368-188"
                            n="184"/> frank and pleased curiosity of a child. &quot;Gracious,
                        what pretty clothes!&quot; she criedshe was addressing Miss Clearwater,
                        of Cincinnati. &quot;I&apos;ve read about this sort of thing in
                        novels and in society columns of newspapers. But I never saw it before. <hi
                            rend="i">Isn&apos;t</hi> it interesting!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Clearwater, whose father was a United States Senatorby purchasehad had
                        experience of many oddities, male and female. She also was attracted by
                        Selma&apos;s sparkling delight, and by the magnetic charm which she
                        irradiated as a rose its perfume. &quot;Pretty clothes are attractive,
                        aren&apos;t they?&quot; said she, to be saying something.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know a thing about clothes,&quot; confessed
                        Selma. &quot;I&apos;ve never owned at the same time more than two
                        dresses fit to wearusually only one. And quite enough for me. I&apos;d
                        only be fretted by a lot of things of that kind. But I like to see them on
                        other people. If I had my way the whole world would be well
                        dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Except you?&quot; said Ellen Clearwater with a smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I couldn&apos;t be well dressed if I tried,&quot; replied
                        Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I was a child I was the despair of my mother. Most of the
                        people in the tenement where we lived were very dirty and
                        disorderlynaturally enough, as they had no knowledge and no money and no
                        time. But mother had ideas of neatness and cleanliness, and she used to try
                        to keep me looking decent. But it was of no use. Ten minutes after she had
                        smoothed me down I was flying every which way again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You were brought up in a tenement?&quot; said Miss <pb
                            id="VAA2368-189" n="185"/> Clearwater. Several of the girls within
                        hearing were blushing for Selma and were feeling how distressed Jane
                        Hastings must be.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had a wonderfully happy childhood,&quot; replied Selma.
                        &quot;Until I was old enough to understand and to suffer. I&apos;ve
                        lived in tenements all my lifeamong very poor people. I&apos;d not feel
                        at home anywhere else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When I was born,&quot; said Miss Clearwater, &quot;we lived
                        in a log cabin up in the mining district of Michigan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma showed the astonishment the other girls were feeling. But while their
                        astonishment was in part at a girl of Ellen Clearwater&apos;s position
                        making such a degrading confession, hers had none of that element in it.
                        &quot;You don&apos;t in the least suggest a log cabin or poverty of
                        any kind,&quot; said she. &quot;I supposed you had always been rich
                        and beautifully dressed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; replied Ellen. She gazed calmly round at the
                        other girls who were listening. &quot;I doubt if any of us here was born
                        to what you see. Of course wesome of usmake pretensesall sorts of silly
                        pretenses. But as a matter of fact there isn&apos;t one of us who
                        hasn&apos;t near relatives in the cabins or the tenements at this very
                        moment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There was a hasty turning away from this dangerous conversation. Jane came
                        back from ordering the rearrangement of her luncheon table. Said Selma:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d like to wash my hands, and smooth my hair a
                        little.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-190" n="186"/>
                    <p>&quot;You take her up, Ellen,&quot; said Jane. &quot;And hurry.
                        We&apos;ll be in the dining-room when you come down.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s eyes were wide and roving as she and Ellen went through the
                        drawing-room, the hall, up stairs and into the very prettily furnished suite
                        which Ellen was occupying. &quot;I never saw anything like this
                        before!&quot; exclaimed Selma. &quot;It&apos;s the first time I
                        was ever in a grand house. This is a grand house, isn&apos;t
                        it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Noit&apos;s only comfortable,&quot; replied Ellen.
                        &quot;Mr. Hastingsand Jane, too, don&apos;t go in for
                        grandeur.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How beautiful everything isand how convenient!&quot; exclaimed
                        Selma. &quot;I haven&apos;t felt this way since the first time I
                        went to the circus.&quot; She pointed to a rack from which were
                        suspended thin silk dressing gowns of various rather gay patterns.
                        &quot;What are those?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dressing gowns,&quot; said Ellen. &quot;Just to wear round
                        while one is dressing or undressing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma advanced and felt and examined them. &quot;But why so
                        many?&quot; she inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, foolishness,&quot; said Ellen. &quot;Indulgence! To
                        suit different moods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Lovely,&quot; murmured Selma. &quot;Lovely!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suspect you of a secret fondness for luxury,&quot; said Ellen
                        slyly.</p>
                    <p>Selma laughed. &quot;What would I do with such things?&quot; she
                        inquired. &quot;Why, I&apos;d have no time to wear them.
                        I&apos;d never dare put on anything so delicate.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-191" n="187"/>
                    <p>She roamed through dressing-room, bedroom, bathroom, marveling, inquiring,
                        admiring. &quot;I&apos;m so glad I came,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;This will give me a fresh point of view. I can understand the
                        people of your class better, and be more tolerant about them. I understand
                        now why they are so hard and so indifferent. They&apos;re quite removed
                        from the common lot. They don&apos;t realize; they can&apos;t. How
                        narrow it must make one to have one&apos;s life filled with these pretty
                        little things for luxury and show. Why, if I lived this life, I&apos;d
                        cease to be human after a short time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ellen was silent.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean to say anything rude or offensive,&quot;
                        said Selma, sensitive to the faintest impressions. &quot;I was speaking
                        my thoughts aloud. ... Do you know David Hull?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The young reformer?&quot; said Ellen with a queer little smile.
                        &quot;Yesquite well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Does he live like this?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Rather more grandly,&quot; said Ellen.</p>
                    <p>Selma shook her head. A depressed expression settled upon her features.
                        &quot;It&apos;s useless,&quot; she said. &quot;He
                        couldn&apos;t possibly become a man.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Ellen laughed. &quot;You must hurry,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;We&apos;re keeping everyone waiting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As Selma was making a few passes at her rebellious thick hairpasses the like
                        of which Miss Clearwater had never before seenshe explained:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve been somewhat interested in David Hull of <pb
                            id="VAA2368-192" n="188"/> latehave been hoping he could graduate from a
                        fake reformer into a useful citizen. But&quot; She looked round
                        expressively at the luxury surrounding them&quot;one might as well try
                        to grow wheat in sand.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Davy is a fine fraud,&quot; said Ellen. &quot;Finebecause
                        he doesn&apos;t in the least realize that he&apos;s a
                        fraud.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid he is a fraud,&quot; said Selma setting on
                        her hat again. &quot;What a pity? He might have been a man, if
                        he&apos;d been brought up properly.&quot; She gazed at Ellen with
                        sad, shining eyes. &quot;How many men and women luxury
                        blights!&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It certainly has done for Davy,&quot; said Ellen lightly.
                        &quot;He&apos;ll never be anything but a respectable
                        fraud.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do <hi rend="i">you</hi> think so?&quot; Selma inquired.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My father is a public man,&quot; Miss Clearwater explained.
                        &quot;And I&apos;ve seen a great deal of these reformers.
                        They&apos;re the ordinary human variety of politician plus a more or
                        less conscious hypocrisy. Usually they&apos;re men who fancy themselves
                        superior to the common run in birth and breeding. My father has taught me to
                        size them up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went down, and Selma, seated between Jane and Miss Clearwater, amused
                        both with her frank comments on the scene so strange to herthe beautiful
                        table, the costly service, the variety and profusion of elaborate food. In
                        fact, Jane, reaching out after the effects got easily in Europe and almost
                        as easily in the East, but overtaxed the resources of the household which
                        she was only beginning to get into what she regarded <pb id="VAA2368-193"
                            n="189"/> as satisfactory order. The luncheon, therefore, was a
                        creditable and promising attempt rather than a success, from the standpoint
                        of fashion. Jane was a little ashamed, and at times extremely nervousthis
                        when she saw signs of her staff falling into disorder that might end in
                        rout. But Selma saw none of the defects. She was delighted with the dazzling
                        spectaclefor two or three courses. Then she lapsed into quiet and could not
                        be roused to speak.</p>
                    <p>Jane and Ellen thought she was overwhelmed and had been seized of shyness in
                        this company so superior to any in which she had ever found herself. Ellen
                        tried to induce her to eat, and, failing, decided that her refraining was
                        not so much firmness in the two meals-a-day system as fear of making a
                        &quot;break.&quot; She felt genuinely sorry for the silent girl
                        growing moment by moment more ill-at-ease. When the luncheon was about half
                        over Selma said abruptly to Jane:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must go now. I&apos;ve stayed longer than I should.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go?&quot; cried Jane. &quot;Why, we haven&apos;t begun
                        to talk yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another time,&quot; said Selma, pushing back her chair.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, don&apos;t rise.&quot; And up she darted, smiling gayly
                        round at the company. &quot;Don&apos;t anybody disturb
                        herself,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It&apos;ll be useless, for
                        I&apos;ll be gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she was as good as her word. Before any one quite realized what she was
                        about, she had escaped from the dining-room and from the house. She almost
                            <pb id="VAA2368-194" n="190"/> ran across the lawn and into the woods.
                        There she drew a long breath noisily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Free!&quot; she cried, flinging out her arms. &quot;Ohbut
                        it was <hi rend="i">dreadful!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>Miss Hastings and Miss Clearwater had not been so penetrating as they
                        fancied. Embarrassment had nothing to do with the silence that had taken
                        possession of the associate editor of the <hi rend="i">New Day.</hi> She was
                        never self-conscious enough to be really shy. She hastened to the office,
                        meeting Victor Dorn in the street doorway. She cried:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Such an experience!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What now?&quot; said Victor. He was used to that phrase from
                        the ardent and impressionable Selma. For her, with her wide-open eyes and
                        ears, her vivid imagination and her thirsty mind, life was one closely
                        packed series of adventures.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had an hour to spare,&quot; she proceeded to explain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought it was a chance to further a little scheme I&apos;ve
                        got for marrying Jane Hastings and David Hull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Um!&quot; said Victor with a quick change of expressionwhich,
                        however, Selma happened not to observe.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And,&quot; she went on, &quot;I blundered into a luncheon
                        party Jane was giving. You never sawyou never dreamed of such stylesuch
                        dresses and dishes and flowers and hats! And I was sitting there with them,
                        enjoying it all as if it were a circus or a ballet, whenOh, Victor, what a
                        silly, what a pitiful waste of time and money! So much to do in the worldso
                        much <pb id="VAA2368-195" n="191"/> that is thrillingly interesting and
                        usefuland those intelligent young people dawdling there at nonsense a child
                        would weary of! I had to run away. If I had stayed another minute I should
                        have burst out cryingor denouncing themor pleading with them to behave
                        themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What else can they do?&quot; said Victor. &quot;They
                        don&apos;t know any better. They&apos;ve never been taught.
                        How&apos;s the article?&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he led the way up to the editorial room and held her to the subject of
                        the article he had asked her to write. At the first opportunity she went
                        back to the subject uppermost in her mind. Said she:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess you&apos;re rightas usual. There&apos;s no hope for
                        any people of that class. The busy ones are thinking only of making money
                        for themselves, and the idle ones are too enfeebled by luxury to think at
                        all. No, I&apos;m afraid there&apos;s no hope for Hullor for Jane
                        either.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not sure about Miss Hastings,&quot; said Victor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You would have been if you&apos;d seen her to-day,&quot;
                        replied Selma. &quot;Oh, she was lovely, Victorreally wonderful to look
                        at. But so obviously the idler. Andbody and soul she belongs to the upper
                        class. She understands charity, but she doesn&apos;t understand justice,
                        and never could understand it. I shall let her alone hereafter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How harsh you women are in your judgments of each other,&quot;
                        laughed Dorn, busy at his desk. <pb id="VAA2368-196" n="192"/> &quot;We
                        are just,&quot; replied Selma. &quot;We are not fooled by each
                        other&apos;s pretenses.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn apparently had not heard. Selma saw that to speak would be to interrupt.
                        She sat at her own table and set to work on the editorial paragraphs. After
                        perhaps an hour she happened to glance at Victor. He was leaning back in his
                        chair, gazing past her out into the open; in his face was an expression she
                        had never seena look in the eyes, a relaxing of the muscles round the mouth
                        that made her think of him as a man instead of as a leader. She was saying
                        to herself. &quot;What a fascinating man he would have been, if he had
                        not been an incarnate cause.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She felt that he was not thinking of his work. She longed to talk to him, but
                        she did not venture to interrupt. Never in all the years she had known him
                        had he spoken to heror to any onea severe or even an impatient word. His
                        tolerance, his good humor were infinite. Yetshe, and all who came into
                        contact with him, were afraid of him. There could come, and on occasion
                        there did comeinto those extraordinary blue eyes an expression beside which
                        the fiercest flash of wrath would be easy to face.</p>
                    <p>When she glanced at him again, his normal expression had returnedthe face of
                        the leader who aroused in those he converted into fellow-workers a fanatical
                        devotion that was the more formidable because it was not infatuated. He
                        caught her eye and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Things are in such good shape for us that it <pb id="VAA2368-197"
                            n="193"/> frightens me. I spend most of my time in studying the horizon
                        in the hope that I can foresee which way the storm&apos;s coming from
                        and what it will be.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a pessimist you are!&quot; laughed Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s why the Workingmen&apos;s League has a
                        thick-and-thin membership of thirteen hundred and fifty,&quot; replied
                        Victor. &quot;That&apos;s why the <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> has
                        twenty-two hundred paying subscribers. That&apos;s why we grow faster
                        than the employers can weed our men out and replace them with immigrants and
                        force them to go to other towns for work.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, anyhow,&quot; said the girl, &quot;no matter what
                        happens we can&apos;t be weeded out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor shook his head. &quot;Our danger period has just begun,&quot;
                        he replied. &quot;The bosses realize our power. In the past
                        we&apos;ve been annoyed a little from time to time. But they thought us
                        hardly worth bothering with. In the future we will have to fight.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hope they will prosecute us,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;Then, we&apos;ll grow the faster.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not if they do it intelligently,&quot; replied Victor.
                        &quot;An intelligent persecutionif it&apos;s relentless enoughalways
                        succeeds. You forget that this isn&apos;t a world of moral ideas but of
                        force. ... I am afraid of Dick Kelly. He is something more than a vulgar
                        boss. He <hi rend="i">sees.</hi> My hope is that he won&apos;t be able
                        to make the others see. I saw him a while ago. He was extremely polite to
                        memore so than he ever has been before. He is up to something. I
                        suspect&quot; <pb id="VAA2368-198" n="194"/> Victor paused, reflecting.
                        &quot;What?&quot; asked Selma eagerly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I suspect that he thinks he has us.&quot; He rose, preparing to
                        go out. &quot;Wellif he haswhy, he has. And we shall have to begin all
                        over again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How stupid they are!&quot; exclaimed the girl. &quot;To
                        fight us who are simply trying to bring about peaceably and sensibly
                        what&apos;s bound to come about anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesthe rain is bound to come,&quot; said Victor. &quot;And
                        we say, &apos;Here&apos;s an umbrella and there&apos;s the way
                        to shelter.&apos; And they laugh at <hi rend="i">our</hi> umbrella and,
                        with the first drops plashing on their foolish faces, deny that
                        it&apos;s going to rain.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The Workingmen&apos;s League, always first in the field with its ticket,
                        had been unusually early that year. Although it was only the first week in
                        August and the election would not be until the third of October, the League
                        had nominated. It was a ticket made up entirely of skilled workers who had
                        lived all their lives in Remsen City and who had acquired an
                        independenceVictor Dorn was careful not to expose to the falling fire of the
                        opposition any of his men who could be ruined by the loss of a job or could
                        be compelled to leave town in search of work. The League always went early
                        into campaign because it pursued a much slower and less expensive method of
                        electioneering than either of the old partiesor than any of the
                        &quot;upper class&quot; reform parties that sprang up from time to
                            <pb id="VAA2368-199" n="195"/> time and died away as they accomplished
                        or failed of their purposesecuring recognition for certain personal
                        ambitions not agreeable to the old established bosses. Besides, the League
                        was, like the bosses and their henchmen, in politics every day in every
                        year. The League theory was that politics was as much a part of a
                        citizen&apos;s daily routine as his other work or his meals.</p>
                    <p>It was the night of the League&apos;s great ratification meeting. The
                        next day the first campaign numbercontaining the biographical sketch of Tony
                        Rivers, Kelly&apos;s right-hand man ... would go upon the press, and on
                        the following day it would reach the public.</p>
                    <p>Market Square in Remsen City was on the edge of the power quarter, was
                        surrounded by cheap hotels, boarding houses and saloons. A few years before
                        the most notable citizens, market basket on arm, could have been seen three
                        mornings in the week, making the rounds of the stalls and stands, both those
                        in the open and those within the Market House. But customs had rapidly
                        changed in Remsen City, and with the exception of a few old fogies only the
                        poorer classes went to market. The masters of houses were becoming
                        gentlemen, and the housewives were elevating into ladiesand it goes without
                        saying that no gentleman and no lady would descend to a menial task even in
                        private, much less in public.</p>
                    <p>Market Square had even become too common for <pb id="VAA2368-200" n="196"/>
                        any but the inferior meetings of the two leading political parties. Only the
                        Workingmen&apos;s League held to the old tradition that a political
                        meeting of the first rank could be properly held nowhere but in the natural
                        assembling place of the peopletheir market. So, their first great rally of
                        the campaign was billed for Market Square. And at eight o&apos;clock,
                        headed by a large and vigorous drum corps, the Victor Dorn cohorts at their
                        full strength marched into the centre of the Square, where one of the stands
                        had been transformed with flags, bunting and torches into a
                        speaker&apos;s platform. A crowd of many thousands accompanied and
                        followed the procession. Working-men&apos;s League meetings were
                        popular, even among those who believed their interests lay elsewhere. At
                        League meetings one heard the plain truth, sometimes extremely startling
                        plain truth. The League had no favors to ask of anybody, had nothing to
                        conceal, was strongly opposed to any and all political concealments. Thus,
                        its speakers enjoyed a freedom not usual in political speakingand Dorn and
                        his fellow-leaders were careful that no router, no exaggerator or well
                        intentioned wild man of any kind should open his mouth under a league
                        banner. <hi rend="i">That</hi> was what made the League so dangerousand so
                        steadily prosperous.</p>
                    <p>The chairman, Thomas Colman, the cooper, was opening the meeting in a speech
                        which was an instance of how well a man of no platform talent can acquit
                        himself when he believes something and believes it is <pb id="VAA2368-201"
                            n="197"/> his duty to convey it to his fellow-men. Victor Dorn, to be
                        the fourth speaker and the orator of the evening, was standing at the rear
                        of the platform partially concealed by the crowd of men and women leaders of
                        the party grouped behind Colman. As always at the big formal demonstrations
                        of the League, Victor was watching every move. This evening his anxiety was
                        deeper than ever before. His trained political sagacity warned him that, as
                        he had suggested to Selma, the time of his party&apos;s first great
                        crisis was at hand. No movement could become formidable without a life and
                        death struggle, when its aim frankly was to snatch power from the dominant
                        class and to place it where that class could not hope to prevail either by
                        direct means of force or by its favorite indirect means of bribery. What
                        would Kelly do? What would be his stroke at the very life of the League?for
                        Victor had measured Kelly and knew he was not one to strike until he could
                        destroy.</p>
                    <p>Like every competent man of action, Victor had measured his own abilities,
                        and had found that they were to be relied upon. But the contest between him
                        and Kellythe contest in the last ditchwas so appallingly unequal. Kelly had
                        the courts and the police, the moneyed class, the employers of labor, had
                        the clergy and well-dressed respectability, the newspapers, all the
                        customary arbiters of public sentiment. Also, he had the criminal and the
                        semi-criminal classes. And what had the League? The letter of the law,
                        guaranteeing <pb id="VAA2368-202" n="198"/> freedom of innocent speech and
                        action, guaranteeing the purity of the ballotno, not guaranteeing, but
                        simply asserting those rights, and leaving the upholding of them
                        toKelly&apos;s allies and henchmen! Also, the League had the power of
                        between a thousand and fifteen hundred intelligent and devoted men and about
                        the same number of womena solid phalanx of great might, of might far beyond
                        its numbers. Finally, it had Victor Dorn. He had no mean opinion of his
                        value to the movement; but he far and most modestly underestimated it. The
                        human way of rallying to an abstract principle is by way of a standard
                        bearera manpersonalitya real or fancied incarnation of the ideal to be
                        struggled for. And to the Workingmen&apos;s League, to the movement for
                        conquering Remsen City for the mass of its citizens, Victor Dorn was that
                        incarnation.</p>
                    <p>Kelly could use violenceviolence disguised as law, violence candidly and
                        brutally lawless. Victor Dorn could only use lawful meansclearly and
                        cautiously lawful means. He must at all costs prevent the use of force
                        against him and his partymust give Kelly no pretext for using the law
                        lawlessly. If Kelly used force against him, whether the perverted law of the
                        courts or open lawlessness, he must meet it with peace. If Kelly smote him
                        on the right cheek he must give him the left to be smitten.</p>
                    <p>When the League could outvote Kelly, thenanother policy, still of calmness
                        and peace and civilization, but <pb id="VAA2368-203" n="199"/> not so meek.
                        But until the League could outvote Kelly, nothing but patient endurance.</p>
                    <p>Every man in the League had been drilled in this strategy. Every man
                        understoodand to be a member of the League meant that one was politically
                        educated. Victor believed in his associates as he believed in himself.
                        Still, human nature was human nature. If Kelly should suddenly offer some
                        adroit outrageous provocationwould the League be able to resist?</p>
                    <p>Victor, on guard, studied the crowd spreading out from the platform in a
                        gigantic fan. Nothing there to arouse suspicion; ten or twelve thousand of
                        working class men and women. His glance pushed on out toward the edges of
                        the crowdtoward the saloons and alleys of the disreputable south side of
                        Market Square. His glance traveled slowly along, pausing upon each place
                        where these loungers, too far away to hear, were gathered into larger
                        groups. Why he did not know, but suddenly his glance wheeled to the right,
                        and then as suddenly to the leftthe west and the east ends of the square.
                        There, on either side he recognized, in the farthest rim of the crowd,
                        several of the men who did Kelly&apos;s lowest kinds of dirty workthe
                        brawlers, the repeaters, the leaders of gangs, the false witnesses for petty
                        corporation damage cases. A second glance, and he saw or, perhaps,
                        divinedpurpose in those sinister presences. He looked for the policethe
                        detail of a dozen bluecoats always assigned to large open-air meetings. Not
                        a policeman was to be seen. <pb id="VAA2368-204" n="200"/> Victor pushed
                        through the crowd on the platform, advanced to the side of Colman.
                        &quot;Just a minute, Tom,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve got
                        to say a wordat once.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Colman had fallen back; Victor Dorn was facing the crowd<hi rend="i">his</hi>
                        crowdthe men and women who loved him. In the clear, friendly, natural voice
                        that marked him for the leader born, the honest leader of an honest cause,
                        he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;My friends, if there is an attempt to disturb this meeting,
                        remember what we of the League stand for. No violence. Draw away from every
                        disturber, and wait for the police to act. If the police stop our meeting,
                        let themand be ready to go to court and testify to the exact words of the
                        speaker on which the meeting was stopped. Remember, we must be more lawful
                        than the law itself!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was turning away. A cheer was risinga belated cheer, because his words had
                        set them all to thinking and to observing. From the left of the crowd, a
                        dozen yards away from the platform, came a stone heavily rather than swiftly
                        flung, as from an impeded hand. In full view of all it curved across the
                        front of the platform and struck Victor Dorn full in the side of the head.
                        He threw up his hands.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Boysremember!&quot; he shouted with a terrible energythen, he
                        staggered forward and fell from the platform into the crowd.</p>
                    <p>The stone was a signal. As it flew, into the crowd from every direction the
                        Beech Hollow gangs tore their <pb id="VAA2368-205" n="201"/> way, yelling
                        and cursing and striking out right and lefttrampling children, knocking down
                        women, pouring out the foulest insults. The street lamps all round Market
                        Square went out, the torches on the platform were torn down and
                        extinguished. And in a dimness almost pitch dark a riot that involved that
                        whole mass of people raged hideously. Yells and screams and groans, the
                        shrieks of women, the piteous appeals of childrenbenches torn up for
                        weaponsmad slashing aboutsnarls and singings of pain-stricken groupsthen
                        police whistles, revolvers fired in the air, and the quick, regular tramp of
                        disciplined forces. The policestrangely ready, strangely inactive until the
                        mischief had all been doneentered the square from the north and, forming a
                        double line across it from east to west, swept it slowly clean. The fighting
                        ended as abruptly as it had begun. Twenty minutes after the flight of that
                        stone, the square was empty save a group of perhaps fifty men and women
                        formed about Victor Dorn&apos;s body in the shelter of the platform.</p>
                    <p>Selma Gordon was holding his head. Jane Hastings and Ellen Clearwater were
                        kneeling beside him, and Jane was wiping his face with a handkerchief wet
                        with whisky from the flask of the man who had escorted them there.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is only stunned,&quot; said Selma. &quot;I can feel the
                        beat of his blood. He is only stunned.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A doctor came, got down on his knees, made a rapid examination with expert
                        hands. As he felt, one of the <pb id="VAA2368-206" n="202"/> relighted
                        torches suddenly lit up Victor&apos;s face and the faces of those
                        bending over him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He is only stunned, Doctor,&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; replied the doctor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We left our carriage in the side street just over there,&quot;
                        said Jane Hastings. &quot;It will take him to the hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nohome,&quot; said Selma, who was calm. &quot;He must be
                        taken home.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The hospital is the place for him,&quot; said the doctor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nohome,&quot; repeated Selma. She glanced at the men standing
                        round. &quot;TomHenryand you, Edhelp me lift him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please, Selma,&quot; whispered Jane. &quot;Let him be taken
                        to the hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Among our enemies?&quot; said Selma with a strange and terrible
                        little laugh. &quot;Oh, no. After this, we trust no one. They may have
                        arranged to finish this night&apos;s work there. He goes
                        homedoesn&apos;t he, boys?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right, Miss Gordon,&quot; replied one of them.</p>
                    <p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Here&apos;s where I drop the
                        case,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing of the kind,&quot; cried Jane imperiously. &quot;I
                        am Jane HastingsMartin Hastings&apos; daughter. You will come with us,
                        pleaseor I shall see to it that you are not let off easily for such a
                        shameful neglect of duty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let him go, Jane,&quot; said Selma. &quot;There will be a
                            <pb id="VAA2368-207" n="203"/> doctor waiting. And he is only stunned.
                        Come, boyslift him up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They laid him on a bench top, softened with the coats of his followers. At
                        the carriage, standing in Farwell Street, they laid him across the two
                        seats. Selma got in with him. Tom Colman climbed to the box beside the
                        coachman. Jane and Miss Clearwater, their escorts and about a score of the
                        Leaguers followed on foot. As the little procession turned into Warner
                        Street it was stopped by a policeman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Can&apos;t go down this way,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s Mr. Dorn. We&apos;re taking him home. He was
                        hurt,&quot; explained Colman.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fire lines. Street&apos;s closed,&quot; said the policeman
                        gruffly.</p>
                    <p>Selma thrust her head out. &quot;We must get him home&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;House across the street burningand probably his house,
                        too,&quot; cut in the policeman. &quot;He&apos;s been raising
                        hellhe has. But it&apos;s coming home to him at last. Take him to the
                        hospital.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jane,&quot; cried Selma, &quot;make this man pass
                        us!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane faced the policeman, explained who she was. He became humbly civil at
                        once. &quot;I&apos;ve just told her, ma&apos;am,&quot; said
                        he, &quot;that his house is burning. The mob&apos;s gutting the <hi
                            rend="i">New Day</hi> office and setting fire to everything.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My house is in the next street,&quot; said Colman.
                        &quot;Drive there. Some of you people get Dr. Charlton <pb
                            id="VAA2368-208" n="204"/> and everything. Get busy. Whip up, driver.
                        Here, give me the lines!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus, within five minutes, Victor was lying upon a couch in the parlor of
                        Colman&apos;s cottage, and within ten minutes Dr. Charlton was beside
                        him and was at work. Selma and Jane and Mrs. Colman were in the room. The
                        othersa steadily increasing crowdwere on the steps outside, in the front
                        yard, were filling the narrow street. Colman had organized fifty Leaguers
                        into a guard, to be ready for any emergencies. Over the tops of the low
                        houses could be seen the vast cloud of smoke from the fire; the air was
                        heavy with the odors of burning wood; faintly came sounds of engines, of
                        jubilant drunken shouts.</p>
                    <p>&quot;A fracture of the skull and of the jaw-bone. Not necessarily
                        serious,&quot; was Dr. Charlton&apos;s verdict.</p>
                    <p>The young man, unconscious, ghastly pale, with his thick hair mussed about
                        his brow and on the right side clotted with blood, lay breathing heavily.
                        Ellen Clear-water came in and Mrs. Colman whispered to her the
                        doctor&apos;s cheering statement. She went to Jane and said in an
                        undertone:</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can go now, Jane. Come on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane seemed not to hear. She was regarding the face of the young man on the
                        couch.</p>
                    <p>Ellen touched her arm. &quot;We&apos;re intruding on these
                        people,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Let&apos;s go. We&apos;ve
                        done all we can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma did not hear, but she saw and understood. <pb id="VAA2368-209" n="205"
                        /> &quot;Yesyou&apos;d better go, Jane,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;Mrs. Colman and I will do everything that&apos;s
                        necessary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane did not heed. She advanced a step nearer the couch. &quot;You are
                            <hi rend="i">sure,</hi> doctor?&quot; she said, and her voice
                        sounded unnatural.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, miss&quot; He glanced at her face. &quot;Yes, Miss
                        Hastings. He&apos;ll be out in less than ten days, as good as ever.
                        It&apos;s a very simple affair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane glanced round. &quot;Is there a telephone? I wish to send for Dr.
                        Alban.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;d be glad to see him,&quot; said Dr. Charlton.
                        &quot;But I assure you it&apos;s unnecessary.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We don&apos;t want Dr. Alban,&quot; said Selma curtly.
                        &quot;Go home, Jane, and let us alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall go bring Dr. Alban,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>Selma took her by the arm and compelled her into the hall, and closed the
                        door into the room where Victor lay. &quot;You must go home,
                        Jane,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;We know what to do with our
                        leader. And we could not allow Dr. Alban here.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor must have the best,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>She and Selma looked at each other, and Selma understood.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He <hi rend="i">has</hi> the best,&quot; said she, gentle with
                        an effort.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dr. Alban is the best,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The most fashionable,&quot; said Selma. &quot;Not the
                        best.&quot; With restraint, &quot;Go home. Let us alone. This is no
                        place for youfor Martin Hastings&apos; daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane, looking and acting like one in a trance, tried <pb id="VAA2368-210"
                            n="206"/> to push past her and renter the room. Selma stood firm. She
                        said: &quot;If you do not go I shall have these men take you to your
                        carriage. You do not know what you are doing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane looked at her. &quot;I love him,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So do we,&quot; said Selma. &quot;And he belongs to <hi
                            rend="i">us.</hi> You must go. Come!&quot; She seized her by the
                        arm, and beckoning one of the waiting Leaguers to her assistance she pushed
                        her quietly but relentlessly along the hall, out of the house, out of the
                        yard and into the carriage. Then she closed the door, while Jane sank back
                        against the cushions.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, he belongs to you,&quot; said Jane; &quot;but I love
                        him. Oh, Selma!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma suddenly burst into tears. &quot;Go, Jane, dear. You <hi rend="i"
                            >must</hi> go,&quot; she cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;At least I&apos;ll wait here untiluntil they are <hi rend="i"
                            >sure,&quot;</hi> said Jane. &quot;You can&apos;t refuse me
                        that, Selma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they <hi rend="i">are</hi> sure,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;You must go with your friends. Here they come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Ellen Clearwater and Joe Wetherbethe second son of the chief owner of
                        the First Nationalreached the curb, Selma said to Wetherbe:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please stand aside. I&apos;ve something to say to this
                        lady.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When Wetherbe had withdrawn, she said: &quot;Miss Hastings isnot quite
                        herself. You had better take her home alone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane leaned from the open carriage window. &quot;Ellen,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-211" n="207"/> said she, &quot;I am going to stay here
                        until Victor recovers consciousness, and I am <hi rend="i"
                        >sure.&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;He has just come around,&quot; said Ellen. &quot;He is
                        certain to get well. His mind is clear.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must see for myself,&quot; cried Jane.</p>
                    <p>Selma was preventing her leaving the carriage when Ellen quietly interfered
                        with a significant look for Selma. &quot;Jane,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;you can&apos;t go in. The doctor has just put every one out
                        but his assistant and a nurse that has come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane hesitated, drew back into the corner of the carriage. &quot;Tell Mr.
                        Wetherbe to go his own way,&quot; said Ellen aside to Selma, and she got
                        in beside Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Mr. Hastings&apos;,&quot; said Selma to the driver. The
                        carriage drove away.</p>
                    <p>She gave Ellen&apos;s message to Wetherbe and returned to the house.
                        Victor was still unconscious; he did not come to himself until toward
                        daylight. And then it was clear to them all that Dr. Charlton&apos;s
                        encouraging diagnosis was correct.</p>
                    <p>Public opinion in Remsen City was publicly articulate by means of three daily
                        newspapersthe <hi rend="i">Pioneer,</hi> the <hi rend="i">Star,</hi> and the
                            <hi rend="i">Free Press.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Star</hi> and the <hi
                            rend="i">Free Press</hi> were owned by the same group of capitalists who
                        controlled the gas company and the water works. The <hi rend="i"
                        >Pioneer</hi> was owned by the traction interests. Both groups of
                        capitalists were jointly interested in the railways, the banks and in the
                        principal factories. The <hi rend="i">Pioneer</hi> was Republican, was
                        regarded as the organ of <pb id="VAA2368-212" n="208"/> Dick Kelly. The <hi
                            rend="i">Star</hi> was Democratic, spoke less cordially of Kelly and
                        always called for House, Mr. House, or Joseph House, Esquire. The <hi
                            rend="i">Free Press</hi> posed as independent with Democratic leanings.
                        It indulged in admirable essays against corruption, gang rule and bossism.
                        But it was never specific and during campaigns was meek and mild. For nearly
                        a dozen years there had not been a word of truth upon any subject important
                        to the people of Remsen City in the columns of any of the three. During wars
                        between rival groups of capitalists a half-truth was now and then timidly
                        uttered, but never a word of &quot;loose talk,&quot; of
                        &quot;anarchy,&quot; of anything but the entirely &quot;safe,
                        sane and conservative.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Thus, any one who might have witnessed the scenes in Market Square on
                        Thursday evening would have been not a little astonished to read the
                        accounts presented the next day by the three newspapers. According to all
                        three the Workingmen&apos;s League, long a menace to the public peace,
                        had at last brought upon Remsen City the shame of a riot in which two men, a
                        woman and four children had lost their lives and more than a hundred,
                        &quot;including the notorious Victor Dorn,&quot; had been injured.
                        And after the riot the part of the mob that was hostile to &quot;the
                        Dorn gang&quot; had swept down upon the office of the <hi rend="i">New
                            Day,</hi> had wrecked it, and had set fire to the building, with the
                        result that five houses were burned before the flames could be put out. The
                            <hi rend="i">Free Press</hi> published, as a mere rumor, that the
                        immediate <pb id="VAA2368-213" n="209"/> cause of the outbreak had been an
                        impending &quot;scurrilous attack&quot; in the <hi rend="i">New
                        Day</hi> upon one of the political gangs of the slums and its leader. The
                        Associated Press, sending forth an account of the riot to the entire
                        country, represented it as a fight between rival gangs of workmen
                        precipitated by the insults and menaces of a &quot;socialistic party led
                        by a young operator named Dorn.&quot; Dorn&apos;s faction had
                        aroused in the mass of the workingmen a fear that this spread of
                        &quot;socialistic and anarchistic ideas&quot; would cause a general
                        shut down of factories and a flight of the capital that was &quot;giving
                        employment to labor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A version of the causes and the events, somewhat nearer the truth, was talked
                        about Remsen City. But all the respectable classes were well content with
                        what their newspapers printed. And, while some broadminded respectabilities
                        spoke of the affair as an outrage, none of them was disposed to think that
                        any real wrong had been done. Victor Dorn and his crowd of revolutionists
                        had got, after all, only their deserts.</p>
                    <p>After forty-eight hours of careful study of public opinion, Dick Kelly
                        decided that Remsen City was taking the dose as he had anticipated. He felt
                        emboldened to proceed to his final move in the campaign against
                        &quot;anarchy&quot; in his beloved city. On the second morning after
                        the riot, all three newspapers published double-headed editorials calling
                        upon the authorities to safe-guard the community against another such
                        degrading and dangerous upheaval. &quot;It is time that the distinction
                            <pb id="VAA2368-214" n="210"/> between liberty and license be sharply
                        drawn.&quot; After editorials in this vein had been repeated for several
                        days, after sundry bodies of eminently respectable citizensthe
                        Merchants&apos; Association, the Taxpayers&apos; League, the Chamber
                        of Commercehad passed indignant and appealing resolutions, after two
                        priests, a elergyman and four preachers had sermonized against &quot;the
                        leniency of constituted authority with criminal anarchy,&quot; Mr. Kelly
                        had the City Attorney go before Judge Lansing and ask for an injunction.</p>
                    <p>Judge Lansing promptly granted the injunction. The <hi rend="i">New Day</hi>
                        was enjoined from appearing. The Workingmen&apos;s League was enjoined
                        from holding meetings.</p>
                    <p>Then the County Prosecutor, also a henchman of Kelly&apos;s, secured from
                        the Grand Jurycomposed of farmers, merchants and owners of
                        factoriesindictments against Thomas Colman and Victor Dorn for inciting a
                        riot.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Victor Dorn was rapidly recovering. With rare restraint young Dr.
                        Charlton did not fuss and fret and meddle, did not hamper nature with his
                        blundering efforts to assist, did not stuff &quot;nourishment&quot;
                        into his patient to decay and to produce poisonous blood. He let the young
                        man&apos;s superb vitality work the inevitable and speedy cure. Thus,
                        wounds and shocks, that have often been mistreated by doctors into mortal,
                        passed so quickly that only Selma Gordon and the doctor himself realized how
                        grave Victor&apos;s case had been. The day he <pb id="VAA2368-215"
                            n="211"/> was indictedjust a week from the riothe was sitting up and was
                        talking freely.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t it set him back if I tell him all that has
                        occurred?&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Talk to him as you would to me,&quot; replied Charlton.
                        &quot;He is a sensible man. I&apos;ve already told him pretty much
                        everything. It has kept him from fretting, to be able to lie there quietly
                        and make his plans.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Had you looked in upon Victor and Selma, in Colman&apos;s little
                        transformed parlor, you would rather have thought Selma the invalid. The man
                        in the bed was pale and thin of face, but his eyes had the expression of
                        health and of hope. Selma had great circles under her eyes and her
                        expression was despair struggling to conceal itself. Those indictments,
                        those injunctionshow powerful the enemy were! How could such an enemy,
                        aroused new and inflexibly resolved, be combatted?especially when one had no
                        money, no way of reaching the people, no chance to organize.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Dr. Charlton has told you?&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Day before yesterday,&quot; replied Victor. &quot;Why do
                        you look so down-in-the-mouth, Selma?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t easy to be cheerful, with you ill and the paper
                        destroyed,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not ill, and the paper isn&apos;t
                        destroyed,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Never were either I or it doing
                        such good work as now.&quot; His eyes were dancing. &quot;What more
                        could one ask than to have such stupid enemies as we&apos;ve
                        got?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-216" n="212"/>
                    <p>Selma did not lift her eyes. To her those enemies seemed anything but stupid.
                        Had they not ruined the League?</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see you don&apos;t understand,&quot; pursued Victor.
                        &quot;No matter. You&apos;ll wear a very different face two weeks
                        from now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; said Selma, &quot;exactly what you said you were
                        afraid of has occurred. And now you say you&apos;re glad of
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I told you I was afraid Dick Kelly would make the one move that
                        could destroy us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But he has!&quot; cried Selma.</p>
                    <p>Victor smiled. &quot;No, indeed!&quot; replied he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What worse could he have done?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll not tell you,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;I&apos;d not venture to say aloud such a dangerous thing as
                        what I&apos;d have done if I had been in his place. Instead of doing
                        that, he made us. We shall win this fall&apos;s election.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma lifted her head with a sudden gesture of hope. She had unbounded
                        confidence in Victor Dorn, and his tone was the tone of absolute confidence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had calculated on winning in five years. I had left the brutal
                        stupidity of our friend Kelly out of account.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you see how you can hold meetings and start up the
                        paper?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want to do either,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;I want those injunctions to stand. Those fools have done at a
                        stroke what we couldn&apos;t have done in years. They have united the
                        working class. Theythe fewhave <pb id="VAA2368-217" n="213"/> forbidden us,
                        the many, to unite or to speak. If those injunctions hold for a month,
                        nothing could stop our winning this fall. ... I can&apos;t understand
                        how Dick Kelly could be so stupid. Five years ago these moves of his would
                        have been bad for usyes, even three years ago. But we&apos;ve got too
                        strongand he doesn&apos;t realize! Selma, when you want to win, always
                        pray that your opponent will underestimate you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I still don&apos;t understand,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;None of us does. You must explain to me, so that I&apos;ll
                        know what to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do nothing,&quot; said Victor. &quot;I shall be out a week
                        from to-day. I shall not go into the streets until I not only am well but
                        look well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They arrested Tom Colman to-day,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;But they put the case over until you&apos;d be able to plead
                        at the same time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s right,&quot; said Victor. &quot;They are
                        playing into our hands!&quot; And he laughed as heartily as his bandages
                        would permit.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I don&apos;t understandI don&apos;t understand at
                        all!&quot; cried Selma. &quot;Maybe you are all wrong about
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was never more certain in my life,&quot; replied Victor.
                        &quot;Stop worrying about it, my dear.&quot; And he patted her hands
                        gently as they lay folded in her lap. &quot;I want youall our peopleto
                        go round looking sad these next few days. I want Dick Kelly to feel that he
                        is on the right track.&quot;</p>
                    <p>There came a knock at the door, and Mrs. Colman <pb id="VAA2368-218" n="214"
                        /> entered. She had been a school teacher, and of all the occupations there
                        is no other that leaves such plain, such indelible traces upon manner, mind
                        and soul. Said she:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Jane Hastings is outside in her carriageand wants to know if
                        she can see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma frowned. Victor said with alacrity: &quot;Certainly. Bring her in,
                        Mrs. Colman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma rose. &quot;Wait until I can get out of the way,&quot; she
                        cried.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sit down, and sit still,&quot; commanded Victor.</p>
                    <p>Selma continued to move toward the door. &quot;NoI don&apos;t wish to
                        see her,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>Victor chagrined her by acquiescing without another word.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll look in after supper?&quot; he asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you want me,&quot; said the girl.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come back here,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Wait, Mrs.
                        Colman.&quot; When Selma was standing by the bed he took her hand.
                        &quot;Selma,&quot; he said, &quot;don&apos;t let these
                        things upset you. Believe me, I&apos;m right. Can&apos;t you trust
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma had the look of a wild creature detained against its will.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not worried about the partyand the paper,&quot;
                        she burst out. &quot;I&apos;m worried about you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m all right. Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m
                        almost well?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma drew her hand away. &quot;I&apos;ll be back about half-past
                        seven,&quot; she said, and bolted from the room.</p>
                    <p>Victor&apos;s good-natured, merry smile followed her to <pb
                            id="VAA2368-219" n="215"/> the door. When the sound of her retreat by
                        way of the rear of the house was dying away he said to Mrs. Colman:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nowbring in the young&quot; lady. And please warn her that she
                        must stay at most only half an hour by that clock over there on the
                        mantel.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Every day Jane had been coming to inquire, had been bringing or sending
                        flowers and fruitwhich, by Dr. Charlton&apos;s orders, were not supposed
                        to enter the invalid&apos;s presence. Latterly she had been asking to
                        see Victor; she was surprised when Mrs. Colman returned with leave for her
                        to enter. Said Mrs. Colman:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s alone. Miss Gordon has just gone. You will see a
                        clock on the mantel in his room. You must not stay longer than half an
                        hour.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall be very careful what I say,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, you needn&apos;t bother,&quot; said the ex-school
                        teacher. &quot;Dr. Charlton doesn&apos;t believe in sick-room
                        atmosphere. You must treat Mr. Dorn exactly as you would a well person. If
                        you&apos;re going to take on, or put on, you&apos;d better not go in
                        at all.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll do my best,&quot; said Jane, rather haughtily,
                        for she did not like Mrs. Colman&apos;s simple and direct manner. She
                        was used to being treated with deference, especially by the women of Mrs.
                        Colman&apos;s class; and while she disapproved of deference in theory,
                        in practice she craved it, and expected it, and was irritated if she did not
                        get it. But, as she realized how unattractive this weakness was, she usually
                        took perhaps more pains than does the <pb id="VAA2368-220" n="216"/> average
                        person to conceal it. That day her nerves were too tense for petty
                        precautions. However, Mrs. Colman was too busy inspecting the details of
                        Miss Hastings&apos; toilet to note Miss Hastings&apos; manners.</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s nervousness vanished the instant she was in the doorway of
                        the parlor with Victor Dorn looking at her in that splendidly simple and
                        natural way of his. &quot;So glad to see you,&quot; he said.
                        &quot;What a delightful perfume you bring with you. I&apos;ve
                        noticed it before. I know it isn&apos;t flowers, but it smells like
                        flowers. With most perfumes you can smell through the perfume to something
                        that&apos;s the very reverse of sweet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They were shaking hands. She said: &quot;That nice woman who let me in
                        cautioned me not to put on a sick-room manner or indulge in sick-room talk.
                        It was quite unnecessary. You&apos;re looking fine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ain&apos;t I, though?&quot; exclaimed Victor.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve never been so comfortable. Just weak enough to like
                        being waited on. You were very good to me the night that stone knocked me
                        over. I want to thank you, but I don&apos;t know how. And the flowers,
                        and the fruitYou have been <hi rend="i">so</hi> kind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could do very little,&quot; said Jane, blushing and
                        faltering. &quot;And I wanted to doeverything.&quot; Suddenly all
                        energy, &quot;Oh, Mr. Dorn, I heard and saw it all. It was<hi rend="i"
                            >infamous!</hi> And the lying newspapersand all the people I meet
                        socially. They keep me in a constant rage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor was smiling gayly. &quot;The fortunes of war,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-221" n="217"/> said he. &quot;I expect nothing else. If
                        they fought fair they couldn&apos;t fight at all. We, on this side of
                        the struggle, can afford to be generous and tolerant. They are fighting the
                        losing battle; they&apos;re trying to hold on to the past, and of course
                        it&apos;s slipping from them inch by inch. But wewe are in step with the
                        march of events.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When she was with him Jane felt that his cause was hers, alsowas the only
                        cause. &quot;When do you begin publishing your paper again?&quot;
                        she asked. &quot;As soon as you are sitting up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not for a month or so,&quot; replied he. &quot;Not until
                        after the election.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I forgot about that injunction. You think that as soon as Davy
                        Hull&apos;s crowd is in they will let you begin again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He hesitated. &quot;Not exactly that,&quot; he said. &quot;But
                        after the election there will be a change.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes flashed. &quot;And they have indicted you! I heard the newsboys
                        crying it and stopped and bought a paper. But I shall do something about
                        that. I am going straight from here to father. Ellen Clearwater and I and
                        Joe Wetherbe <hi rend="i">saw.</hi> And Ellen and I will testify if
                        it&apos;s necessaryand will make Joe tell the truth. Do you know, he
                        actually had the impudence to try to persuade Ellen and me the next day that
                        we saw what the papers reported?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I believe it,&quot; said Victor. &quot;So I believe that
                        Joe convinced himself.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-222" n="218"/>
                    <p>&quot;You are too charitable,&quot; replied Jane.
                        &quot;He&apos;s afraid of his father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Miss Hastings,&quot; said Victor, &quot;you suggested a
                        moment ago that you would influence your father to interfere in this matter
                        of the indictment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll promise you now that he will have it
                        stopped,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to help the cause, don&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s eyes shifted, a little color came into her cheeks.
                        &quot;The causeand you,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Then you will not
                        interfere. And if your father talks of helping me you will discourage him
                        all you can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are saying that out of consideration for me. You&apos;re
                        afraid I will quarrel with my father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hadn&apos;t thought of that,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t tell you what I have in mind. But I&apos;ll
                        have to say this muchthat if you did anything to hinder those fellows from
                        carrying out their plans against me and against the League to the uttermost
                        you&apos;d be doing harm instead of good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But they may send you to jail. ... No, I forgot. You can give
                        bail.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor&apos;s eyes had a quizzical expression. &quot;Yes, I could
                        give bail. But even if I don&apos;t give bail, Miss Hastingseven if I am
                        sent to jailColman and Istill you must not interfere. You promise
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane hesitated. &quot;I can&apos;t promise,&quot; she finally
                        said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-223" n="219"/>
                    <p>&quot;You must,&quot; said Victor. &quot;You&apos;ll make a
                        mess of my plans, if you don&apos;t.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean that. Your intentions are good. But you would only do
                        mischiefserious mischief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They looked at each other. Said Jane: &quot;I promiseon one
                        condition.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That if you should change your mind and should want my help,
                        you&apos;d promptly and freely ask for it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I agree to that,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Now,
                        let&apos;s get it clearly in mind. No matter what is done about me or
                        the League, you promise not to interfere in any way, unless I ask you
                        to.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again Jane hesitated. &quot;No matter what they do?&quot; she
                        pleaded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No matter what they do,&quot; insisted he.</p>
                    <p>Something in his expression gave her a great thrill of confidence in him, of
                        enthusiasm. &quot;I promise,&quot; she said. &quot;You know
                        best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; said he. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A moment&apos;s silence, then she exclaimed: &quot;That was why you
                        let me in to-daybecause you wanted to get that promise from me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That was one of the reasons,&quot; confessed he. &quot;In
                        fact, it was the chief reason.&quot; He smiled at her.
                        &quot;There&apos;s nothing I&apos;m so afraid of as of
                        enthusiasm. I&apos;m going to be still more cautious and exact another
                            <pb id="VAA2368-224" n="220"/> promise from you. You must not tell any
                        one that you have promised not to interfere.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can easily promise that,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Be careful,&quot; warned Victor. &quot;A promise easily
                        made is a promise easily forgotten.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I begin to understand,&quot; said Jane. &quot;You want them
                        to attack you as savagely as possible. And you don&apos;t want them to
                        get the slightest hint of your plan.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A good guess,&quot; admitted Victor. He looked at her gravely.
                        &quot;Circumstances have let you farther into my confidence than any one
                        else is. I hope you will not abuse it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can rely upon me,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I want your
                        friendship and your respect as I never wanted anything in my life before.
                        I&apos;m not afraid to say these things to you, for I know I&apos;ll
                        not be misunderstood.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor&apos;s smile thrilled her again. &quot;You were born one of
                        us,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt it the first time we talked
                        together.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes. I do want to be somebody,&quot; replied the girl.
                        &quot;I can&apos;t content myself in a life of silly routine ...
                        can&apos;t do things that have no purpose, no result. And if it
                        wasn&apos;t for my father I&apos;d come out openly for the things I
                        believe in. But I&apos;ve got to think of him. It may be a weakness, but
                        I couldn&apos;t overcome it. As long as my father lives I&apos;ll do
                        nothing that would grieve him. Do you despise me for that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t despise anybody for anything,&quot; said
                        Victor. &quot;In your place I should put my father first.&quot; He
                            <pb id="VAA2368-225" n="221"/> laughed. &quot;In your place
                        I&apos;d probably be a Davy Hull or worse. I try never to forget that I
                        owe everything to the circumstances in which I was born and brought up.
                        I&apos;ve simply got the ideas of my class, and it&apos;s an
                        accident that I am of the class to which the future belongsthe working class
                        that will possess the earth as soon as it has intelligence enough to enter
                        into its kingdom.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But,&quot; pursued Jane, returning to herself, &quot;I
                        don&apos;t intend to be altogether useless. I can do something and hemy
                        father, I meanneedn&apos;t know. Do you think that is
                        dreadful?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t like it,&quot; said Victor. But he said it in
                        such a way that she did not feel rebuked or even judged.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nor do I,&quot; said she. &quot;I&apos;d rather lead
                        the life I wish to leadsay the things, I believedo the things I believe
                        inall openly. But I can&apos;t. And all I can do is to spend the income
                        of my money my mother left mespend it as I please.&quot; With a quick
                        embarrassed gesture she took an envelope from a small bag in which she was
                        carrying it. &quot;There&apos;s some of it,&quot; she said.
                        &quot;I want to give that to your campaign fund. You are free to use it
                        in any way you pleaseany way, for everything you are and do is your
                        cause.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor was lying motionless, his eyes closed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t refuse,&quot; she begged.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve no right to refuse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long silence, she watching him uneasily. At last he said,
                        &quot;NoI&apos;ve no right to refuse. If I did, it would be <pb
                            id="VAA2368-226" n="222"/> from a personal motive. You understand that
                        when you give the League this money you are doing what your father would
                        regard as an act of personal treachery to him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t think so, do you?&quot; cried she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said he deliberately.</p>
                    <p>Her face became deathly pale, then crimson. She thrust the envelope into the
                        bag, closed it hastily. &quot;Then I can&apos;t give it,&quot;
                        she murmured. &quot;Ohbut you are hard!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If you broke with your father and came with usand it killed him, as
                        it probably would,&quot; Victor Dorn went on, &quot;I should respect
                        youshould regard you as a wonderful, terrible woman. I should envy you
                        having a heart strong enough to do a thing so supremely right and so
                        supremely relentless. And I should be glad you were not of my bloodshould
                        think you hardly human. Yet that is what you ought to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not up to it,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you mustn&apos;t do the other,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;We need the money. I am false to the cause in urging you not to
                        give it. ButI&apos;m human.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He was looking away, an expression in his eyes and about his mouth that made
                        him handsomer than she would have believed a man could be. She was looking
                        at him longingly, her beautiful eyes swimming. Her lips were saying
                        inaudibly, &quot;I love youI love you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What did you say?&quot; he asked, his thoughts returning from
                        their far journey.</p>

                    <p>&quot;My time is up,&quot; she exclaimed, rising.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There are better ways of helping than money,&quot; said he,
                        taking her hand. &quot;And already you&apos;ve helped in those
                        ways.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I come again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whenever you like. Butwhat would your father say?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you don&apos;t want me to come again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s best not,&quot; said he. &quot;I wish fate
                        had thrown us on the same side. But it has put us in opposite campsand we
                        owe it to ourselves to submit.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Their hands were still clasped. &quot;You are content to have it
                        so?&quot; she said sadly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I&apos;m not,&quot; cried he, dropping her hand.
                        &quot;But we are helpless.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We can always hope,&quot; said she softly.</p>
                    <p>On impulse she laid her hand in light caress upon his brow, then swiftly
                        departed. As she stood in Mrs. Colman&apos;s flowery little front yard
                        and looked dazedly about, it seemed to her that she had been away from the
                        worldaway from herselfand was reluctantly but inevitably returning.</p>

                    <head>VI</head>
                    <p>As Jane drove into the grounds of the house on the hilltop she saw her father
                        and David Hull in an obviously intimate and agitated conversation on the
                        front veranda. She made all haste to join them; nor was she deterred by the
                        reception she gotthe reception given to the unwelcome interrupter. Said she:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are talking about those indictments, aren&apos;t you?
                        Everyone else is. There&apos;s a group on every corner down town, and
                        people are calling their views to each other from windows across the
                        streets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy glanced triumphantly at her father. &quot;I told you so,&quot;
                        said he.</p>
                    <p>Old Hastings was rubbing his hand over his large, bony, wizened face in the
                        manner that indicates extreme perplexity.</p>
                    <p>Davy turned to Jane. &quot;I&apos;ve been trying to show your father
                        what a stupid, dangerous thing Dick Kelly has done. I want him to help me
                        undo it. It <hi rend="i">must</hi> be undone or Victor Dorn will sweep the
                        town on election day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s heart was beating wildly. She continued to say carelessly,
                        &quot;You think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Davy&apos;s got a bad attack of big red eye to-day,&quot;
                        said her father. &quot;It&apos;s a habit young men have.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-229" n="225"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m right, Mr. Hastings,&quot; cried Hull.
                        &quot;And, furthermore, you know I&apos;m right, Jane; you saw that
                        riot the other night. Joe Wetherbe told me so. You said that it was an
                        absolutely unprovoked assault of the gangs of Kelly and House. Everyone in
                        town knows it was. The middle and the upper class people are pretending to
                        believe what the papers printedwhat they&apos;d like to believe. But
                        they <hi rend="i">know</hi> better. The working people are apparently
                        silent. They usually are apparently silent. But they know the truththey are
                        talking it among themselves. And these indictments will make Victor Dorn a
                        hero.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What of it? What of it?&quot; said Hastings impatiently.
                        &quot;The working people don&apos;t count.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not as long as we can keep them divided,&quot; retorted Davy.
                        &quot;But if they unite&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he went on to explain what he had in mind. He gave them an analysis of
                        Remsen City. About fifty thousand inhabitants, of whom about ten thousand
                        were voters. These voters were divided into three classesupper class, with
                        not more than three or four hundred votes, and therefore politically of no
                        importance <hi rend="i">at the polls,</hi> though overwhelmingly the most
                        influential in any other way; the middle class, the big and little
                        merchants, the lawyers and doctors, the agents and firemen and so on,
                        mustering in all about two thousand votes; finally, the working class with
                        no less than eight thousand votes out of a total of ten thousand.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-230" n="226"/>
                    <p>&quot;By bribery and cajolery and browbeating and appeal to religious
                        prejudice and to fear of losing jobsby all sorts of chicane,&quot; said
                        Davy, &quot;about seven of these eight thousand votes are kept divided
                        between the Republican or Kelly party and the Democratic or House party. The
                        other ten or twelve hundred belong to Victor Dorn&apos;s League. Now,
                        the seven thousand workingmen voters who follow Kelly and House like Victor
                        Dorn, like his ideas, are with him at heart. But they are afraid of him.
                        They don&apos;t trust each other. Workingmen despise the workingman as
                        an ignorant fool.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So he is,&quot; said Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So he is,&quot; agreed Davy. &quot;But Victor Dorn has
                        about got the workingmen in this town persuaded that they&apos;d fare
                        better with Dorn and the League as their leaders than with Kelly and House
                        as their leaders. And if Kelly goes on to persecute Victor Dorn, the
                        workingmen will be frightened for their rights to free speech and free
                        assembly. And they&apos;ll unite. I appeal to you, Janeisn&apos;t
                        that common sense?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know anything about politics,&quot; said Jane,
                        looking bored. &quot;You must go in and lie down before dinner, father.
                        You look tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings got ready to rise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Just a minute, Mr. Hastings,&quot; pleaded Hull. &quot;This
                        must be settled nowat once. I must be in a position not only to denounce
                        this thing, but also to <pb id="VAA2368-231" n="227"/> stop it. Not
                        to-morrow, but to-day ... so that the morning papers will have the
                        news.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s thoughts were flyingbut in circles. Everybody habitually
                        judges everybody else as both more and less acute than he really is. Jane
                        had great respect for Davy as a man of college education. But because he had
                        no sense of humor and because he abounded in lengthy platitudes she had
                        thought poorly indeed of his abilities. She had been realizing her mistake
                        in these last few minutes. The man who had made that analysis of politicsan
                        analysis which suddenly enlighted her as to what political power meant and
                        how it was wielded everywhere on earth as well as in Remsen Citythe man was
                        no mere dreamer and theorist. He had seen the point no less clearly than had
                        Victor Dorn. But what concerned her, what set her to fluttering, was that he
                        was about to checkmate Victor Dorn. What should she say and do to help
                        Victor?</p>
                    <p>She must get her father away. She took him gently by the arm, kissed the top
                        of his head. &quot;Come on, father,&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll let Davy work his excitement off on me. You must
                        take care of your health.&quot;</p>
                    <p>But Hastings resisted. &quot;Wait a minute, Jenny,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;I must think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can think lying down,&quot; insisted his daughter. Davy was
                        about to interpose again, but she frowned him into silence.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s something in what Davy says,&quot; persisted
                            <pb id="VAA2368-232" n="228"/> her father. &quot;If that there
                        Victor Dorn should carry the election, there&apos;d be no living in the
                        same town with him. It&apos;d put him away up out of reach.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane abruptly released her father&apos;s arm. She had not thought of
                        thatof how much more difficult Victor would be if he won now. She wanted him
                        to win ultimatelyyes, she was sure she did. Butnow? Wouldn&apos;t that
                        put him beyond her reachbeyond need of her?</p>
                    <p>She said: &quot;Please come, father!&quot; But it was perfunctory
                        loyalty to Victor. Her father settled back; Davy Hull began afresh, pressing
                        home his point, making his contention so clear that even Martin
                        Hastings&apos; prejudice could not blind him to the truth. And Jane sat
                        on the arm of a big veranda chair and listened and made no further effort to
                        interfere.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t agree with you, Hull,&quot; said the old man
                        at last. &quot;Victor Dorn&apos;s run up agin the law at last, and
                        he ought to get the consequences good and hard. But</p>
                    <p>&quot;Mr. Hastings,&quot; interrupted Davy eagerlytoo fond of talking
                        to realize that the old man was agreeing with him, &quot;Your daughter
                        saw&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fiddle-fiddle,&quot; cried the old man.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t bring sentimental women into this, Davy. As I was
                        saying, Victor ought to be punished for the way he&apos;s been stirring
                        up idle, lazy, ignorant people against the men that runs the community and
                        gives &apos;em jobs and food for their children. But maybe it
                        ain&apos;t wise to give <pb id="VAA2368-233" n="229"/> him his
                        desertsjust now. Anyhow, while you&apos;ve been talking away like a
                        sewing machine I&apos;ve been thinking. I don&apos;t see as how it
                        can do any serious <hi rend="i">harm</hi> to stop them there
                        indictments.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s it, Mr. Hastings,&quot; cried Hull.
                        &quot;Even if I do exaggerate, as you seem to think, still
                        where&apos;s the harm in doing it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It looks as if the respectable people were afraid of the lower
                        classes,&quot; said Hastings doubtfully. &quot;And that&apos;s
                        always bad.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it won&apos;t look that way,&quot; replied Davy,
                        &quot;if my plan is followed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what might be your plan?&quot; inquired Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m to be the reform candidate for Mayor. Your son-in-law,
                        Hugo, is to be the reform candidate for judge. The way to handle this is for
                        me to come out in a strong statement denouncing the indictments, and the
                        injunction against the League and the <hi rend="i">New Day,</hi> too. And
                        I&apos;ll announce that Hugo Galland is trying to join in the fight
                        against them and that he is as indignant and as determined as I am. Then
                        early to-morrow morning we can go before Judge Lansing and can present
                        arguments, and he will denounce the other side for misleading him as to the
                        facts, and will quash the indictments and vacate the injunctions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings nodded reflectively. &quot;Pretty good,&quot; said he with a
                        sly grin. &quot;And Davy Hull and my son-in-law will be popular
                        heroes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy reddened. &quot;Of course. I want to get all the <pb
                            id="VAA2368-234" n="230"/> advantage I can for our party,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;I don&apos;t represent myself. I represent the
                        party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Martin grinned more broadly. He who had been representing &quot;honest
                        taxpayers&quot; and &quot;innocent owners&quot; of corrupt stock
                        and bonds all his life understood perfectly. &quot;It&apos;s hardly
                        human to be as unselfish as you and I are, Davy,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Well, I&apos;ll go in and do a little telephoning. You go
                        ahead and draw up your statement and get it to the papersand see
                        Hugo.&quot; He rose, stood leaning on his cane, all bent and shrivelled
                        and dry. &quot;I reckon Judge Lansing&apos;ll be expecting you
                        to-morrow morning.&quot; He turned to enter the house, halted, crooked
                        his head round for a piercing look at young Hull. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        go talking round among your friends about what you&apos;re going to
                        do,&quot; said he sharply. &quot;Don&apos;t let <hi rend="i"
                            >nobody</hi> know until it&apos;s done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I could see you hurrying down to that there University Club to sit
                        there and tell it all to those smarties that are always blowing about what
                        they&apos;re going to do. You&apos;ll be right smart of a man some
                        day, Davy, if you&apos;ll learn to keep your mouth shut.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy looked abashed. He did not know which of his many indiscretions of
                        self-glorifying talkativeness Mr. Hastings had immediately in mind. But he
                        could recall several, any one of which was justification for the rather
                        savage rebukethe more humiliating that Jane was listening. He glanced
                        covertly at her. Perhaps she <pb id="VAA2368-235" n="231"/> had not heard;
                        she was gazing into the distance with a strange expression upon her
                        beautiful face, an expression that fastened his attention, absorbed though
                        he was in his project for his own ambitions. As her father disappeared, he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What are you thinking about, Jane?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane startled guiltily. &quot;I? OhI don&apos;t knowa lot of
                        things.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your look suggested that you were having aa severe attack of
                        conscience,&quot; said he, laughingly. He was in soaring good humor now,
                        for he saw his way clear to election.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was,&quot; said Jane, suddenly stern. A pause, then she
                        laughedrather hollowly. &quot;Davy, I guess I&apos;m almost as big a
                        fraud as you are. What fakirs we human beings are?always posing as doing for
                        others and always doing for our selfish selves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy&apos;s face took on its finest expression. &quot;Do you think
                        it&apos;s altogether selfishness for me to fight for Victor Dorn and
                        give him a chance to get out his paper againwhen he has warned me that he is
                        going to print things that may defeat me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know he&apos;ll not print them now,&quot; retorted
                        Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Indeed I don&apos;t. He&apos;s not so forbearing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know he&apos;ll not print them now,&quot; repeated
                        Jane. &quot;He&apos;d not be so foolish. Every one would forget to
                        ask whether what he said about you was true or false. They&apos;d think
                        only of how ungenerous <pb id="VAA2368-236" n="232"/> and ungrateful he was.
                        He wouldn&apos;t be either. But he&apos;d seem to beand that comes
                        to the same thing.&quot; She glanced mockingly at Hull.
                        &quot;Isn&apos;t that your calculation?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are too cynical for a woman, Jane,&quot; said Davy.
                        &quot;It&apos;s not attractive.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To your vanity?&quot; retorted Jane. &quot;I should think
                        not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellgood-by,&quot; said Davy, taking his hat from the rail.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got a hard evening&apos;s work before me. No
                        time for dinner.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another terrible sacrifice for public duty,&quot; mocked Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must be frightfully out of humor with yourself, to be girding
                        at me so savagely,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by, Mr. Mayor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I shall bein six weeks.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s face grew sombre. &quot;YesI suppose so,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;The people would rather have one of us than one of their own
                        kind. They do look up to us, don&apos;t they? It&apos;s ridiculous
                        of them, but they do. The idea of choosing you, when they might have Victor
                        Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He isn&apos;t running for Mayor,&quot; objected Hull.
                        &quot;The League&apos;s candidate is Harbinger, the
                        builder.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, it&apos;s Victor Dorn,&quot; said Jane. &quot;The
                        best man in a partythe strongest manis always the candidate for all the
                        offices. I don&apos;t know much about politics, but I&apos;ve
                        learned that much. ... It&apos;s Victor Dorn againstDick Kellyor Kelly
                        and father.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-237" n="233"/>
                    <p>Hull reddened. She had cut into quick. &quot;You will see who is Mayor
                        when I&apos;m elected,&quot; said he with all his dignity.</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed in the disagreeably mocking way that was the climax of her
                        ability to be nasty when she was thoroughly out of humor.
                        &quot;That&apos;s right, Davy. Deceive yourself. It&apos;s far
                        more comfortable. So long!&quot;</p>
                    <p>And she went into the house.</p>
                    <p>Davy&apos;s conduct of the affair was masterly. He showed those rare
                        qualities of judgment and diplomacy that all but insure a man a
                        distinguished career. His statement for the press was a model of dignity, of
                        restrained indignation, of good common sense. The most difficult part of his
                        task was getting Hugo Galland into condition for a creditable appearance in
                        court. In so far as Hugo&apos;s meagre intellect, atrophied by education
                        and by luxury, permitted him to be a lawyer at all, he was of that now
                        common type called the corporation lawyer. That is, for him human beings had
                        ceased to exist, and of course human rights, also; the world as viewed from
                        the standpoint of law contained only corporations, only interests. Thus, a
                        man like Victor Dorn was in his view the modern form of the devilwas a
                        combination of knave and lunatic who had no right to live except in the
                        restraint of an asylum or a jail.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, while Hugo despised the &quot;hoi polloi&quot; as only a
                        stupid, miseducated snob can despise, he <pb id="VAA2368-238" n="234"/>
                        appreciated that they had votes and so must be conciliated and he yearned
                        with the snob&apos;s famished yearning for the title and dignity of
                        judge. Davy found it impossible to convince him that the injunctions and
                        indictments ought to be attacked until he had convinced him that in no other
                        way could he become Judge Galland. As Hugo was fiercely prejudiced and
                        densely stupid and reverent of the powers of his own intellect, to convince
                        him was not easy. In fact, Davy did not begin to succeed until he began to
                        suggest that whoever appeared before Judge Lansing the next morning in
                        defense of free speech would be the Alliance and Democratic and Republican
                        candidate for judge, and that if Hugo couldn&apos;t see his way clear to
                        appearing he might as well give up for the present his political ambitions.</p>
                    <p>Hugo came round. Davy left him at one o&apos;clock in the morning and
                        went gloomily home. He had known what a prejudiced ass Galland was, how
                        unfit he was for the office of judge; but he had up to that time hidden the
                        full truth from himself. Now, to hide it was impossible. Hugo had fully
                        exposed himself in all his unfitness of the man of narrow upper class
                        prejudices, the man of no instinct or enthusiasm for right, justice and
                        liberty. &quot;Really, it&apos;s a crime to nominate such a chap as
                        that,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Yet we&apos;ve got to do it. How
                        Selma Gordon&apos;s eyes would shame me, if she could see me
                        now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy had the familiar fondness for laying on the <pb id="VAA2368-239" n="235"
                        /> secret penitential scourgewherewith we buy from our complacent
                        consciences license to indulge in the sins our appetites or ambitions crave.</p>
                    <p>Judge Lansingyou have never seen a man who <hi rend="i">looked</hi> the judge
                        more ideally than did gray haired, gray bearded, open browed Robert
                        LansingJudge Lansing was all ready for his part in the farce. He knew Hugo
                        and helped him over the difficult places and cut him short as soon as he had
                        made enough of his speech to give an inkling of what he was demanding. The
                        Judge was persuaded to deliver himself of a high-minded and eloquent
                        denunciation of those who had misled the court and the county prosecutor. He
                        pointed outin weighty judicial languagethat Victor Dorn had by his conduct
                        during several years invited just such a series of calamities as had beset
                        him. But he went on to say that Dorn&apos;s reputation and fondness for
                        speech and action bordering on the lawless did not withdraw from him the
                        protection of the law. In spite of himself the law would protect him. The
                        injunctions were dissolved and the indictments were quashed.</p>
                    <p>The news of the impending application, published in the morning papers, had
                        crowded the court room. When the Judge finished a tremendous cheer went up.
                        The cheer passed on to the throng outside, and when Davy and Hugo appeared
                        in the corridor they were borne upon the shoulders of workingmen and were
                        not released until they had made speeches. Davy&apos;s <pb
                            id="VAA2368-240" n="236"/> manly simplicity and clearness covered the
                        stammering vagueness of hero Galland.</p>
                    <p>As Davy was gradually clearing himself of the eager handshakers and
                        back-slappers, Selma suddenly appeared before him. Her eyes were shining and
                        her whole body seemed to be irradiating emotion of admiration and gratitude.
                        &quot;Thank youoh, thank you!&quot; she said, pressing his hand.
                        &quot;How I have misjudged you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy did not wince. He had now quite forgotten the part selfish ambition had
                        played in his gallant rush to the defense of imperilled freedomhad forgotten
                        it as completely as the now ecstatic Hugo had forgotten his prejudices
                        against the &quot;low, smelly working people.&quot; He looked as
                        exalted as he felt. &quot;I only did my plain duty,&quot; replied
                        he. &quot;How could any decent American have done less?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t seen Victor since yesterday afternoon,&quot;
                        pursued Shema. &quot;But I know how grateful he&apos;ll benot so
                        much for what you did as that <hi rend="i">you</hi> did it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The instinct of the crowdthe universal human intinctagainst intruding upon a
                        young man and young woman talking together soon cleared them of neighbors.
                        An awkward silence fell. Said he hesitatingly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Are you ready to give your answer?to that question I asked you the
                        other day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I gave you my answer then,&quot; replied she, her glance
                        seeking a way of escape.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;For you said then that you would
                            <pb id="VAA2368-241" n="237"/> not marry me. And I shall never take no
                        for an answer until you have married some one else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked up at him with eyes large and grave and puzzled.
                        &quot;I&apos;m sure you don&apos;t want to marry me,&quot;
                        she said. &quot;I wonder why you keep asking me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have to be honest with you,&quot; said Davy.
                        &quot;Somehow you bring out all the good there is in me. So, I
                        can&apos;t conceal anything from you. In a way I don&apos;t want to
                        marry you. You&apos;re not at all the woman I have always pictured as
                        the sort I ought to marry and would marry. ButSelma, I love you.
                        I&apos;d give up anythingeven my careerto get you. When I&apos;m
                        away from you I seem to regain control of myself. But just as soon as I see
                        you, I&apos;m as bad as ever again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then we mustn&apos;t see each other,&quot; said she.
                        Suddenly she nodded, laughed up at him and darted awayand Hugo Galland, long
                        since abandoned by the crowd, had seized him by the arm.</p>
                    <p>Selma debated whether to take Victor the news or to continue her walk. She
                        decided for the walk. She had been feeling peculiarly toward Victor since
                        the previous afternoon. She had not gone back in the evening, but had sent
                        an excuse by one of the Leaguers. It was plain to her that Jane Hastings was
                        up tomischief, and she had begun to fearsacrilegious though she felt it to
                        be to harbor such a suspicionthat there was man enough, weak, vain,
                        susceptible man enough, in Victor Dorn to make Jane a danger. <pb
                            id="VAA2368-242" n="238"/> The more she had thought about Jane and her
                        environment, the clearer it had become that there could be no permanent and
                        deep sincerity in Jane&apos;s aspirations after emancipation from her
                        class. It was simply the old, old story of a woman of the upper class
                        becoming infatuated with a man of a genuine kind of manhood rarely found in
                        the languor-producing surroundings of her own class. Would Victor yield? No!
                        her loyalty indignantly answered. But he might allow this useless idler to
                        hamper him, to weaken his energies for the timeand during a critical period.</p>
                    <p>She did not wish to see Victor again until she should have decided what
                        course to take. To think at her ease she walked out Monroe Avenue on her way
                        to the country. It was a hot day, but walking along in the beautiful shade
                        Selma felt no discomfort, except a slight burning of the eyes from the
                        fierce glare of the white highway. In the distance she heard the sound of an
                        engine. A few seconds, and past her at high speed swept an automobile. Its
                        heavy flying wheels tore up the roadway, raised an enormous cloud of dust.
                        The charm of the walk was gone; the usefulness of roadway and footpaths was
                        destroyed for everybody for the fifteen or twenty minutes that it would take
                        for the mass of dust to settleon the foliage, in the grass, on the bodies
                        and clothing of passers-by and in their lungs. Selma halted and gazed after
                        the auto. Who was tearing along at this mad speed? Who was destroying the
                        comfort of all using <pb id="VAA2368-243" n="239"/> that road, and annoying
                        them and making the air unfit to breathe! Why, an idle, luxuriously dressed
                        woman, not on an errand of life or death, but going down town to amuse
                        herself shopping or calling.</p>
                    <p>The dust had not settled before a second auto, having a young man and young
                        woman apparently on the way to play tennis, rushed by, swirling up even
                        vaster clouds of dust and all but colliding with a baby carriage a woman was
                        trying to push across the street. Selma&apos;s blood was boiling! The
                        infamy of it! These worthless idlers! What utter lack of manners, of
                        consideration for their fellow beings. A <hi rend="i">gentleman</hi> and a
                            <hi rend="i">lady</hi> insulting and bullying everyone who happened not
                        to have an automobile. Thenshe laughed. The ignorant, stupid masses! They
                        deserved to be treated thus contemptuously, for they could stop it if they
                        would. &quot;Some day we shall learn,&quot; philosophized she.
                        &quot;Then these brutalities of men toward each other, these brutalities
                        big and little, will cease.&quot; This matter of the insulting
                        automobiles, with insolent horns and criminal folly of speed and hurling
                        dust at passers-by, worse than if the occupants had spat upon them in
                        passingthis matter was a trifle beside the hideous brutalities of men
                        compelling masses of their fellow beings, children no less than grown
                        people, to toil at things killing soul, mind and body simply in order that
                        fortunes might be made! <hi rend="i">There</hi> was lack of consideration
                        worth thinking about.</p>
                    <p>Three more autos passedthree more clouds of dust, <pb id="VAA2368-244"
                            n="240"/> reducing Selma to extreme physical discomfort. Her philosophy
                        was severely strained. She was in the country now; but even there she was
                        pursued by these insolent and insulting hunters of pleasure utterly
                        indifferent to the comfort of their fellows. And when a fourth auto passed,
                        bearing Jane Hastings in a charming new dress and big, becoming hatSelma,
                        eyes and throat full of dust and face and neck and hands streaked and dirty,
                        quite lost her temper. Jane spoke; she turned her head away, pretending not
                        to see!</p>
                    <p>Presently she heard an auto coming at a less menacing pace from the opposite
                        direction. It drew up to the edge of the road abreast of her.
                        &quot;Selma,&quot; called Jane.</p>
                    <p>Selma paused, bent a frowning and angry countenance upon Jane.</p>
                    <p>Jane opened the door of the limousine, descended, said to her chauffeur:
                        &quot;Follow us, please.&quot; She advanced to Selma with a timid
                        and deprecating smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll let me walk with you?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am thinking out a very important matter,&quot; replied Selma,
                        with frank hostility. &quot;I prefer not to be interrupted.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma!&quot; pleaded Jane. &quot;What have I done to turn
                        you against me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma stood, silent, incarnation of freedom and will. She looked steadily at
                        Jane. &quot;You haven&apos;t done anything,&quot; she replied.
                        &quot;On impulse I liked you. On sober second thought I don&apos;t.
                        That&apos;s all.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-245" n="241"/>
                    <p>&quot;You gave me your friendship,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;You&apos;ve no right to withdraw it without telling me
                        why.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are not of my class. You are of the class that is at war with
                        mineat war upon it. When you talk of friendship to me, you are either false
                        to your own people or false in your professions to me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s manner was rudely offensiveas rude as Jane&apos;s dust,
                        to which it was perhaps a retort. Jane showed marvelous restraint. She told
                        herself that she felt compassionate toward this attractive, honest, really
                        nice girl. It is possible, however, that an instinct of prudence may have
                        had something to do with her ultraconciliatory attitude toward the dusty
                        little woman in the cheap linen dress. The enmity of one so near to Victor
                        Dorn was certainly not an advantage. Instead of flaring up, Jane said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Selmado be humando be your sweet, natural self. It
                        isn&apos;t my fault that I am what I am. And you know that I really
                        belong heart and soul with you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then come with us,&quot; said Selma. &quot;If you think the
                        life you lead is foolishwhy, stop leading it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know I can&apos;t,&quot; said Jane mournfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know you could,&quot; retorted Selma.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t be a hypocrite, Jane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selmahow harsh you are!&quot; cried Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Either come with us or keep away from us,&quot; said the girl
                        inflexibly. &quot;You may deceive yourselfand <pb id="VAA2368-246"
                            n="242"/> menwith that talk of broad views and high aspirations. But you
                        can&apos;t deceive another woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not trying to deceive anybody,&quot; exclaimed
                        Jane angrily. &quot;Permit me to say, Selma, that your methods
                        won&apos;t make many converts to your cause.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who ever gave you the idea that we were seeking converts in your
                        class?&quot; inquired Selma. &quot;Our whole object is to abolish
                        your classand end its drain upon usand its bad exampleand make its members
                        useful members of our class, and more contented and happier than they are
                        now.&quot; She laugheda free and merry laugh, but not pleasant in
                        Jane&apos;s ears. &quot;The idea of <hi rend="i">us</hi> trying to
                        induce young ladies and young gentlemen with polished finger nails to sit
                        round in drawing-rooms talking patronizingly of doing something for the
                        masses! You&apos;ve got a very queer notion of us, my dear Miss
                        Hastings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s eyes were flashing. &quot;Selma, there&apos;s a devil
                        in you to-day. What is it?&quot; she demanded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;There&apos;s a great deal of dust from your automobile in me
                        and on me,&quot; said Selma. &quot;I congratulate you on your good
                        manners in rushing about spattering and befouling your fellow beings and
                        threatening their lives.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane colored and lowered her head. &quot;II never thought of that
                        before,&quot; she said humbly.</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s anger suddenly dissolved. &quot;I&apos;m ashamed of
                        myself,&quot; she cried. &quot;Forgive me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>What she had said about the automobile had made <pb id="VAA2368-247" n="243"
                        /> an instant deep impression upon Jane, who was honestly trying to live up
                        to her aspirationswhen she wasn&apos;t giving up the effort as
                        hopelessly beyond her powers and trying to content herself with just
                        aspiring. She was not hypocritical in her contrition. The dust disfiguring
                        the foliage, streaking Selma&apos;s face and hair, was forcing the
                        lesson in manners vigorously home. &quot;I&apos;m much obliged to
                        you for teaching me what I ought to have learned for myself,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;I don&apos;t blame you for scorning me. I am a pretty
                        poor excuse. But&quot;with her most charming
                        smile&quot;I&apos;ll do betterall the faster if you&apos;ll help
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma looked at her with a frank, dismayed contrition, like a child that
                        realizes it has done something very foolish. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m so
                        horribly impulsive!&quot; she cried. &quot;It&apos;s always
                        getting me into trouble. You don&apos;t know how I try Victor
                        Dorn&apos;s patiencethough he never makes the least sign.&quot; She
                        laughed up at Jane. &quot;I wish you&apos;d give me a whipping.
                        I&apos;d feel lots better.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;d take some of my dust off you,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me take you to the house in the autoyou&apos;ll never see
                        it going at that speed again, I promise. Come to the house and I&apos;ll
                        dust you offand we&apos;ll go for a walk in the woods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma felt that she owed it to Jane to accept. As they were climbing the hill
                        in the auto, Selma said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;My, how comfortable this is! No wonder the people that have autos
                        stop exercising and get fat and sick and die. I couldn&apos;t trust
                        myself with one.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-248" n="244"/>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a daily fight,&quot; confessed Jane. &quot;If
                        I were married and didn&apos;t have to think about my looks and my
                        figure I&apos;m afraid I&apos;d give up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor says the only time one ought ever to ride in a carriage is
                        to his own funeral.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s down on show and luxury of every kindisn&apos;t
                        he?&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; replied Selma. &quot;Victor
                        isn&apos;t &apos;down on&apos; anything. He thinks show and
                        luxury are silly. He could be rich if he wished, for he has wonderful talent
                        for managing things and for making money. He has refused some of the most
                        wonderful offerswonderful in that way. But he thinks money-making a waste of
                        time. He has all he wants, and he says he&apos;d as soon think of eating
                        a second dinner when he&apos;d just had one as of exchanging time that
                        could be <hi rend="i">lived</hi> for a lot of foolish dollars.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he meant it, too,&quot; said Jane. &quot;In some men
                        that would sound like pretense. But not in him. What a mind he hasand what a
                        character!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma was abruptly overcast and ominously silent. She wished she had not been
                        turned so far by her impulse of penitencewished she had held to the calm and
                        deliberate part of her resolve about Janethe part that involved keeping
                        aloof from her. However, Jane, the tactfulhastened to shift the conversation
                        to generalities of the softest kindstalked about her college lifeabout the
                        inane and useless education they had given herdrew Selma out to talk about
                        her own education <pb id="VAA2368-249" n="245"/> in the tenementin the
                        public school, at night school, in factory and shop. Not until they had been
                        walking in the woods nearly two hours and Selma was about to go home, did
                        Victor, about whom both were thinking all the time, come into the
                        conversation again. It was Jane who could no longer keep away from the
                        subjectthe one subject that wholly interested her nowadays. Said she:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dorn is <hi rend="i">really</hi> almost well, you
                        think?&quot;</p>
                    <p>After a significant pause Selma said in a tone that was certainly not
                        encouraging, &quot;Obviously.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I was altogether wrong about Doctor Charlton,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;I&apos;m convinced now that he&apos;s the only really
                        intelligent doctor in town. I&apos;m trying to persuade father to change
                        to him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, good-by,&quot; said Selma. She was eager to get away, for
                        she suddenly felt that Jane was determined to talk about Victor before
                        letting her go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You altered toward me when I made that confessionthe night of the
                        riot,&quot; said Jane abruptly. &quot;Are you in love with him,
                        too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how you could help being,&quot; cried
                        Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s because you don&apos;t know what it is to be
                        busy,&quot; retorted Selma. &quot;Lovewhat you call loveis one of
                        the pastimes with your sort of people. It&apos;s a lazy, easy way of
                        occupying the thoughts.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t know me as well as you think you do,&quot;
                            <pb id="VAA2368-250" n="246"/> said Jane. Her expression fascinated
                        Selmaand made her more afraid than ever.</p>
                    <p>Impulsively Selma took Jane by the arm. &quot;Keep away from
                        us,&quot; she said. &quot;You will do no good. You can only cause
                        unhappinessperhaps most of all to yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t I know that!&quot; exclaimed Jane.
                        &quot;I&apos;m fighting it as hard as I can. But how little control
                        one has over oneself when one has always been indulged and
                        self-indulgent.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The man for you is David Hull,&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You could help himcould make a great deal of a person out of
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it,&quot; replied Jane. &quot;But I don&apos;t
                        want him, and heperhaps you didn&apos;t know that he is in love with
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No more than you are with Victor Dorn,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;I&apos;m different from the women he has known, just as Victor
                        is different from the men you meet in your class. But this is a waste of
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t believe in me at all,&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;In some ways you are very unjust and narrow, Selma.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma looked at her in that grave way which seemed to compel frankness.
                        &quot;Do <hi rend="i">you</hi> believe in yourself?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s glance shifted.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know you do not,&quot; proceeded Selma. &quot;The women
                        of your class rarely have sincere emotions because they do not lead sincere
                        lives. Part of your <pb id="VAA2368-251" n="247"/> imaginary love for Victor
                        Dorn is desire to fill up idle hours. The rest of it is vanitythe desire to
                        show your power over a man who seems to be woman-proof.&quot; She
                        laughed a little, turned away, paused. &quot;My mother used to quote a
                        French proverb&apos;One cannot trifle with love.&apos; Be careful,
                        Janefor your own sake. I don&apos;t know whether you could conquer
                        Victor Dorn or not. But I do know <hi rend="i">if</hi> you could conquer him
                        it would be only at the usual price of those conquests to a woman.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And what is that?&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your own complete surrender,&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How wise you are!&quot; laughed Jane. &quot;Who would have
                        suspected you of knowing so much!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could Ia womanand not unattractive to mengrow up to be
                        twenty-one years old, in the free life of a working woman, without learning
                        all there is to know about sex relations?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane looked at her with a new interest.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And,&quot; she went on, &quot;I&apos;ve learnednot by
                        experience, I&apos;m glad to say, but by observationthat my
                        mother&apos;s proverb is true. I shall not think about love until I am
                        compelled to. That is a peril a sensible person does not seek.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I did not seek it,&quot; cried Janeand then she halted and
                        flushed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by, Jane,&quot; said Selma, waving her hand and moving
                        away rapidly. She called back&quot;On ne badine pas avec
                        l&apos;amour!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-252" n="248"/>
                    <p>She went straight to Colman&apos;s cottageto Victor, lying very pale with
                        his eyes shut, and big Tom Colman sitting by his bed. There was a stillness
                        in the room that Selma felt was ominous. Victor&apos;s handstrong,
                        well-shaped, useful-looking, used-lookingnot <hi rend="i">abused</hi>
                        looking, but <hi rend="i">used</hi>-lookingwas outside the covers upon the
                        white counterpane. The fingers were drumming softly; Selma knew that
                        gesturea certain sign that Victor was troubled in mind.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve told him,&quot; said Selma to Colman as she
                        paused in the doorway.</p>
                    <p>Victor turned his head quickly, opened his eyes, gave her a look of welcome
                        that made her thrill with pride. &quot;Ohthere you are!&quot; he
                        exclaimed. &quot;I was hoping you&apos;d come.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I saw David Hull just after it was done,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;And I thanked him for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor&apos;s eyes had a look of amusement, of mockery. &quot;Thank
                        you,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She, the sensitive, was on the alert at once. &quot;Didn&apos;t you
                        want me to thank him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor did not answer. In the same amused way he went on: &quot;So they
                        carried him on their shoulders him and that other defender of the rights of
                        the people, Hugo Galland? I should like to have seen. It was a memorable
                        spectacle.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are laughing at it,&quot; exclaimed the girl.
                        &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You certainly are taking the news very queer, <pb id="VAA2368-253"
                            n="249"/> Victor,&quot; said Colman. Then to Selma, &quot;When I
                        told him he got white and I thought I&apos;d have to send for Doctor
                        Charlton.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Welljoy never kills,&quot; said Victor mockingly. &quot;I
                        don&apos;t want to keep you, TomSelma&apos;ll sit with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When they were alone, Victor again closed his eyes and resumed that silent
                        drumming upon the counterpane. Selma watched the restless fingers as if she
                        hoped they would disclose to her the puzzling secret of Victor&apos;s
                        thoughts. But she did not interrupt. That was one lesson in restraint that
                        Victor had succeeded in teaching hernever to interrupt. At last he heaved a
                        great sigh and said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Selma, old girlwe&apos;ve probably lost again. I was glad
                        you came because I wanted to talkand I can&apos;t say what&apos;s in
                        my mind before dear old Tomor any of them but my sister and you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t want those injunctions and indictments out of
                        the way?&quot; said Selma.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If they had stood, we&apos;d have wonin a walk,&quot;
                        replied Victor. &quot;As the cards lie new, David Hull will win. And
                        he&apos;ll make a pretty good show mayor, probablygood enough to fool a
                        large majority of our fellow citizens, who are politically as shallow and
                        credulous as nursery children. And soour work of educating them will be the
                        harder and slower. Oh, these David Hulls!these good men who keep their
                        mantles spotless in order to make them the more useful as covers for the
                        dirty work of others!&quot; Suddenly his <pb id="VAA2368-254" n="250"/>
                        merry smile burst out. &quot;And they carried Hugo Galland on their
                        shoulders?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you don&apos;t think Hull&apos;s motives were
                        honorable?&quot; inquired Selma, perplexed and anxious.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How could I know his motives?any man&apos;s motives?&quot;
                        replied Victor. &quot;No one can read men&apos;s hearts. All I ever
                        consider is actions. And the result of his actions is probably the defeat of
                        the League and the election of Dick Kelly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I begin to understand,&quot; said Selma thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;ButI do believe his motive was altogether good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My dear girl,&quot; said Victor, &quot;the primer lesson in
                        the life of action is: &apos;Never<hi rend="i">never</hi> look at
                        motives. Actiononly actionsalways actions.&apos; The chief reason the
                        human race is led patiently round by the nose is its fondness for fussing
                        about motives. We are interested only in men&apos;s actions and the
                        results to our cause. Davy Hull&apos;s motives concern only himselfand
                        those who care for him.&quot; Victor&apos;s eyes, twinkling
                        mischievously, shot a shrewd glance at Selma. &quot;You&apos;re not
                        by any chance in love with Davy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma colored high. &quot;Certainly not!&quot; she exclaimed
                        indignantly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why not? Why not?&quot; teased Victor. &quot;He&apos;s
                        tall and handsomeand superbly solemnand women always fancy a solemn man has
                        intellect and character. Not that Davy is a foolby no means. I&apos;d be
                        the last man to say thatI whom he has just cleverly checkmated in one
                        move.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-255" n="251"/>
                    <p>&quot;You intended not to give bail! You intended to go to
                        jail!&quot; exclaimed Selma abruptly. &quot;I see it all! How stupid
                        I was! Oh, I could cry, Victor! What a chance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Spilt milk,&quot; said Victor. &quot;We must forget it, and
                        plan to meet the new conditions. We&apos;ll start the paper at once. We
                        can&apos;t attack him. Very clever of himvery clever! If he were as
                        brave as he is shrewd, I&apos;d almost give up hope of winning this town
                        while he was in politics here. But he lacks courage. And he daren&apos;t
                        think and speak honestly. How that does cripple a man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;ll be one of us before very long,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;You misjudge him, Victor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Dorn smiled. &quot;Not so long as his own class gratifies his
                        ambitions,&quot; replied Victor. &quot;If he came with us
                        it&apos;d be because his own class had failed him and he hoped to rise
                        through and uponours.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma did not agree with him. But as she always felt presumptuous and even
                        foolish in disagreeing with Victor, she kept silent. And presently Victor
                        began to lay out her share in the task of starting up the <hi rend="i">New
                            Day.</hi> &quot;I shall be all right within a week,&quot; said
                        he, &quot;and we must get the first number out the week
                        following.&quot; She was realizing now that Hull&apos;s move had
                        completely upset an elaborate plan of campaign into which Victor had put all
                        his intelligence and upon which he had staked all his hopes. She marvelled
                        as he talked, unfolding rapidly an entirely <pb id="VAA2368-256" n="252"/>
                        new campaign, different in every respect from what the other would have
                        been. How swiftly his mind had worked, and how well! How little time he had
                        wasted in vain regrets! How quickly he had recovered from a reverse that
                        would have halted many a strong man.</p>
                    <p>And then she remembered how they all, his associates, were like him, proof
                        against the evil effects of set-back and defeat. And why were they so?
                        Because Victor Dorn had trained them to fight for the cause, and not for
                        victory. &quot;Our cause is the right, and in the end right is bound to
                        win because the right is only another name for the sensible&quot;that
                        had been his teaching. And a hardy army he had trained. The armies trained
                        by victory are strong; but the armies schooled by defeatthey are invincible.</p>
                    <p>When he had explained his new campaignas much of it as he deemed it wise at
                        that time to withdraw from the security of his own brainshe said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;But it seems to me we&apos;ve got a good chance to win,
                        anyhow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A chance, perhaps,&quot; replied he. &quot;But
                        we&apos;ll not bother about that. All we&apos;ve got to do is to
                        keep on strengthening ourselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, that&apos;s it!&quot; she cried. &quot;One added
                        herefive thereten yonder. Every new stone fitted solidly against the ones
                        already in place.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We must never forget that we aren&apos;t merely building a new
                        party,&quot; said Dorn. &quot;We&apos;re building a new
                        civilizationone to fit the new conditions of life. Let <pb id="VAA2368-257"
                            n="253"/> the Davy Hulls patch and tinker away at trying to keep the old
                        structure from falling in. We know it&apos;s bound to fall and that it
                        isn&apos;t fit for decent civilized human beings to live in. And
                        we&apos;re getting the new house ready. Soto us, election day is no more
                        important than any of the three hundred and sixty-five.&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was into the presence of a Victor Dorn restored in mind as well as in body
                        that Jane Hastings was shown by his sister, Mrs. Sherrill, one afternoon a
                        week or so later.</p>
                    <p>All that time Jane had been searching for an excuse for going to see him. She
                        had haunted the roads and the woods where he and Selma habitually walked.
                        She had seen neither of them. When the pretext for a call finally came to
                        her, as usual, the most obvious thing in the world. He must be suspecting
                        her of having betrayed his confidence and brought about the vacating of
                        those injunctions and the quashing of the indictments. She must go to him
                        and clear herself of suspicion.</p>
                    <p>She felt that the question of how she should dress for this crucial
                        interview, this attempt to establish some sort of friendly relations with
                        him, was of the very highest importance. Should she wear something plain,
                        something that would make her look as nearly as might be like one of his own
                        class? <hi rend="i">His</hi> class! Nono, indeed. The class in which he was
                        accidentally born and bred, but to which he did not belong. Or, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-258" n="254"/> should she go dressed frankly as of her own
                        classwearing the sort of things that made her look her finest and most
                        superior and most beautiful? Having nothing else to do, she spent several
                        hours in trying various toilets. She was not long in deciding against
                        disguising herself as a working woman. That garb might win his mental and
                        moral approval; but not by mental and moral ways did women and men prevail
                        with each other. In plain garbso Jane decided, as she inspected herselfshe
                        was no match for</p>
                    <p>Selma Gordon; she looked awkward, out of her element. So much being settled,
                        there remained to choose among her various toilets. She decided for an
                        embroidered white summer dress, extremely simple, but in the way that costs
                        beyond the power of any but the very rich to afford. When she was ready to
                        set forth, she had never looked so well in her life. Her toilet seemed a
                        mere detail. In fact, it was some such subtlety as those arrangements of
                        lines and colors in great pictures, whereby the glance of the beholder is
                        unconsciously compelled toward the central figure, just as water in a funnel
                        must go toward the aperture at the bottom. Jane felt, not without reason,
                        that she had executed a stroke of genius. She was wearing nothing that could
                        awaken Victor Dorn&apos;s prejudices about fine clothes, for he must
                        have those prejudices. Yet she was dressed in conformity with all that
                        centuries, ages of experience, have taught the dressmaking art on the
                        subject of feminine allure. And, when a woman feels <pb id="VAA2368-259"
                            n="255"/> that she is so dressed, her natural allure becomes greatly
                        enhanced.</p>
                    <p>She drove down to a point in Monroe Avenue not far from the house where
                        Victor and his family lived. The day was hot; boss-ridden Remsen City had
                        dusty and ragged streets and sidewalks. It, therefore, would not do to
                        endanger the freshness of the toilet. But she would arrive as if she had
                        come all the way on foot. Arrival in a motor at so humble a house would look
                        like ostentation; also, if she were seen going through that street afoot,
                        people would think she was merely strolling a little out of her way to view
                        the ruins of the buildings set on fire by the mob. She did pause to look at
                        these ruins; the air of the neighborhood still had a taint of burnt wood and
                        paper. Presently, when she was sure the street was clear of people of the
                        sort who might talkshe hastily entered the tiny front yard of
                        Victor&apos;s house, and was pleased to find herself immediately
                        screened from the street by the luxuriant bushes and creepers.</p>
                    <p>There was nothing in the least pretentious about the appearance of the little
                        house. It was simply a well built cottagebut of brick, instead of the usual
                        wood, and the slate roof descended at attractive angles. The door she was
                        facing was superior to the usual flimsy-looking door. Indeed, she at once
                        became conscious of a highly attractive and most unexpected air of
                        substantiality and good taste. The people who lived here seemed to be
                        permanent peoplelong resident, <pb id="VAA2368-260" n="256"/> and looking
                        forward to long residence. She had never seen such beautiful or such
                        tastefully grouped sun flowers, and the dahlias and marigolds were far above
                        the familiar commonplace kitchen garden flowers.</p>
                    <p>The door opened, and a handsome, extremely intelligent looking woman,
                        obviously Victor&apos;s sister, was looking pleasantly at her. Said she:
                        &quot;I&apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting. But I was busy in the
                        kitchen. This is Miss Hastings, isn&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, smiling friendlily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve heard my brother and Selma talk of you.&quot;
                        (Jane wondered what they had said.) &quot;You wish to see
                        Victor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I&apos;d not be interrupting,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come right in. He&apos;s used to being interrupted. They
                        don&apos;t give him five minutes to himself all day longespecially now
                        that the campaign&apos;s on. He always does his serious work very early
                        in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>They went through a hall, pleasantly odorous of baking in which good flour
                        and good butter and good eggs were being manufactured into something
                        probably appetizing, certainly wholesome. Jane caught a glimpse through open
                        doors on either side of a neat and reposeful little library-sitting room, a
                        plain delightfully simple little bedroom, a kitchen where everything shone.
                        She arrived at the rear door somehow depressed, bereft of the feeling of
                        upper-class superiority which had, perhaps unconsciously, possessed her as
                        she came toward the house. At the far <pb id="VAA2368-261" n="257"/> end of
                        an arbor on which the grape vines were so trellised that their broad leaves
                        cast a perfect shade, sat Victor writing at a table under a tree. He was in
                        his shirt sleeves, and his shirt was open at the throat. His skin was smooth
                        and healthily white below the collar line. The forearms exposed by his
                        rolled up sleeves were strong but slender, and the faint fair hair upon them
                        suggested a man, but not an animal.</p>
                    <p>Never had she seen his face and head so fine. He was writing rapidly, his
                        body easily erect, his head and neck in a poise of grace and strength. Jane
                        grew pale and trembledso much so that she was afraid the keen, friendly eyes
                        of Alice Sherrill were seeing. Said Mrs. Sherrill, raising her voice:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victorhere&apos;s Miss Hastings come to see you.&quot; Then
                        to Jane: &quot;Excuse me, please. I don&apos;t dare leave that
                        kitchen long.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She departed. Jane waited while Victor, his pencil reluctantly slackening and
                        his glance lingeringly rising from the paper, came back to sense of his
                        surroundings. He stared at her blankly, then colored a little. He rosestiff,
                        for him formal. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How d&apos;you do, Miss Hastings?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She came down the arbor, recovering her assurance as she again became
                        conscious of herself, so charmingly dressed and no doubt beautiful in his
                        eyes. &quot;I know you&apos;re not glad to see me,&quot; said
                        she. &quot;But I&apos;m only stopping a very little
                        minute.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes had softenedsoftened under the influence <pb id="VAA2368-262"
                            n="258"/> of the emotion no man can ever fail to feel at least in some
                        degree at sight of a lovely woman. &quot;Won&apos;t you
                        sit?&quot; said he, with a glance at the wooden chair near the other
                        side of the table.</p>
                    <p>She seated herself, resting one gloved hand on the prettily carved end of her
                        white sunshade. She was wearing a big hat of rough black straw, with a few
                        very gorgeous white plumes. &quot;What a delightful place to
                        work,&quot; exclaimed she, looking round, admiring the flowers, the slow
                        ripening grapes, the delicious shade. &quot;And youhow well you
                        look!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve forgotten I was ever anything but well,&quot;
                        said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re impatient for me to go,&quot; she cried
                        laughing. &quot;It&apos;s very rude to show it so plainly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied he. &quot;I am not impatient for you to
                        go. But I ought to be, for I&apos;m very busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, I shall be gone in a moment. I came only to tell you that you
                        are suspecting me wrongly.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Suspecting you?of what?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of having broken my word. I know you must think I got father to set
                        Davy Hull on to upsetting your plans.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The idea never entered my head,&quot; said he. &quot;You
                        had promisedand I know you are honest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane colored violently and lowered her eyes. &quot;I&apos;m notnot up
                        to what you say,&quot; she protested. &quot;But at least I
                        didn&apos;t break my promise. Davy thought of that himself.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-263" n="259"/>
                    <p>&quot;I have been assuming so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you didn&apos;t suspect me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not for an instant,&quot; Victor assured her. &quot;Davy
                        simply made the move that was obviously best for him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And now he will be elected,&quot; said Jane regretfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It looks that way,&quot; replied Victor. And he had the air of
                        one who has nothing more to say.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly Jane looked at him with eyes shining and full of appeal.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t send me away so quickly,&quot; she pleaded.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve not been telling the exact truth. I came only partly
                        because I feared you were suspecting me. The real reason was thatthat I
                        couldn&apos;t stay away any longer. I know you&apos;re not in the
                        least interested in me&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was watching him narrowly for signs of contradiction. She hoped she had
                        not watched in vain.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should you be?&quot; she went on. &quot;But ever since
                        you opened my eyes and set me to thinking, I can do nothing but think about
                        the things you have said to me, and long to come to you and ask you
                        questions and hear more.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor was staring hard into the wall of foliage. His face was set. She
                        thought she had never seen anything so resolute, so repelling as the curve
                        of his long jaw bone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll go now,&quot; she said, making a pretended move
                        toward rising. &quot;I&apos;ve no right to annoy you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood up abruptly, without looking at her. &quot;Yes, you&apos;d
                        better go,&quot; he said curtly.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-264" n="260"/>
                    <p>She quiveredand it was with a pang of genuine pain.</p>
                    <p>His gaze was not so far from her as it seemed. For he must have noted her
                        expression, since he said hurriedly: &quot;I beg your pardon. It
                        isn&apos;t that I mean to be rude. IIit is best that I do not see
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sank back in the chair with a sigh. &quot;And II know that I ought to
                        keep away from you. ButI can&apos;t. It&apos;s too strong for
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her slowly. &quot;I have made up my mind to put you out of
                        my head,&quot; he said. &quot;And I shall.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;Victordon&apos;t!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He sat again, rested his forearms upon the table, leaned toward her.
                        &quot;Look at me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>She slowly lifted her gaze to his, met it steadily. &quot;I thought so,
                        Victor,&quot; she said tenderly. &quot;I knew I couldn&apos;t
                        care so much unless you cared at least a little.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do I?&quot; said he. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I doubt
                        if either of us is in love with the other. Certainly, you are not the sort
                        of woman I could lovedeeply love. What I feel for you is the sort of thing
                        that passes. It is violent while it lasts, but it passes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care!&quot; cried she recklessly.
                        &quot;Whatever it is I want it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shook his head resolutely. &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;You
                        don&apos;t want it, and I don&apos;t want it. I know the kind of
                        life you&apos;ve mapped out for yourselfas far as women of your class
                        map out anything. It&apos;s the only <pb id="VAA2368-265" n="261"/> kind
                        of life possible to you. And it&apos;s of a kind with which I could, and
                        would, have nothing to do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; protested she. &quot;You could
                        make of me what you pleased.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;I couldn&apos;t make a suit of
                        overalls out of a length of silk. Anyhow, I have made up my life with love
                        and marriage left out. They are excellent things for some people, for most
                        people. But not for me. I must be free, absolutely free. Free to think only
                        of the cause I&apos;ve enlisted in, free to do what it
                        commands.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I?&quot; she said with tremendous life. &quot;What is
                        to become of me, Victor?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed quietly. &quot;You are going to keep away from mefind some one
                        else to amuse your leisure. That&apos;s what&apos;s going to become
                        of you, Jane Hastings.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She winced and quivered again. &quot;Thathurts,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your vanity? Yes. I suppose it does. But those wounds are
                        healthfulwhen the person is as sensible as you are.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think I am not capable of caring! You think I am vain and
                        shallow and idle. You refuse me all right to live, simply because I happen
                        to live in surroundings you don&apos;t approve of.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m not such an egotistical ass as to imagine a woman of
                        your sort could be genuinely in love with a man of my sort,&quot;
                        replied he. &quot;So, I&apos;ll see to it that we <pb
                            id="VAA2368-266" n="262"/> keep away from each other. I don&apos;t
                        wish to be tempted to do you mischief.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
                    <p>But he did not explain. He said: &quot;And you are going now. And we
                        shall not meet again except by accident.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She gave a sigh of hopelessness. &quot;I suppose I have lowered myself in
                        your eyes by being so frankby showing and speaking what I felt,&quot;
                        she said mournfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not in the least,&quot; rejoined he. &quot;A man who is
                        anybody or has anything soon gets used to frankness in women. I could hardly
                        have gotten past thirty, in a more or less conspicuous position, without
                        having had some experience. ... and without learning not to attach too much
                        importance toto frankness in women.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She winced again. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t say those things if you
                        knew how they hurt,&quot; she said. &quot;If I didn&apos;t care
                        for you, could I sit here and let you laugh at me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you could,&quot; answered he. &quot;Hoping somehow or
                        other to turn the laugh upon me later on. But really I was not laughing at
                        you. And you can spare yourself the effort of convincing me that
                        you&apos;re sincere.&quot; He was frankly laughing at her now.
                        &quot;You don&apos;t understand the situationnot at all. You fancy
                        that I am hanging back because I am overwhelmed or shy or timid. I assure
                        you I&apos;ve never been shy or <pb id="VAA2368-267" n="263"/> timid
                        about anything I wanted. If I wanted youI&apos;d<hi rend="i">take</hi>
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She caught her breath and shrank. Looking at him as he said that, calmly and
                        confidently, she, for the first time, was in loveand was afraid. Back to her
                        came Selma&apos;s warnings: &quot;One may not trifle with love. A
                        woman conquers only by surrender.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But, as I said to you a while ago,&quot; he went on,
                        &quot;I don&apos;t want youor any woman. I&apos;ve no time for
                        marriageno time for a flirtation. And though you tempt me strongly, I like
                        you too well toto treat you as you invite.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane sat motionless, stunned by the sudden turning of the tables. She who had
                        come to conquerto amuse herself, to evoke a strong, hopeless passion that
                        would give her a delightful sense of warmth as she stood safely by its
                        bright flamesshe had been conquered. She belonged to this man; all he had to
                        do was to claim her.</p>
                    <p>In a low voice, sweet and sincere beyond any that had ever come from her lips
                        before, she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Anything, Victoranythingbut don&apos;t send me away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And he, seeing and hearing, lost his boasted self-control.
                        &quot;Gogo,&quot; he cried harshly. &quot;If you don&apos;t
                        go&quot; He came round the table, seizing her as she rose, kissed her
                        upon the lips, upon the eyes. &quot;You are lovelylovely!&quot; he
                        murmured. &quot;And I who can&apos;t have flowers on my table or in
                        sight when I&apos;ve got anything <pb id="VAA2368-268" n="264"/> serious
                        to doI love your perfume and your color and the wonderful softness of
                        you&quot;</p>
                    <p>He pushed her away, &quot;Nowwill you go?&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>His eyes were flashing. And she was trembling from head to foot. She was
                        gazing at him with a fascinated expression. &quot;I understand what you
                        meant when you warned me to go,&quot; she said. &quot;I
                        didn&apos;t believe it, but it was so.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;GoI tell you!&quot; he ordered.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s too late,&quot; said she. &quot;You
                        can&apos;t send me away nowfor you have kissed me. If I&apos;m in
                        your power, you&apos;re in my power, too.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Moved by the same impulse both looked up the arbor toward the rear door of
                        the house. There stood Selma Gordon, regarding them with an expression of
                        anger as wild as the blood of the steppes that flowed in her veins. Victor,
                        with what composure he could master, put out his hand in farewell to Jane.
                        He had been too absorbed in the emotions raging between him and her to note
                        Selma&apos;s expression. But Jane, the woman, had seen. As she shook
                        hands with Victor, she said neither high nor low:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma knows that I care. I told her the night of the
                        riot.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good-by,&quot; said Victor in a tone she thought it wise not to
                        dispute.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll be in the woods above the park at ten
                        tomorrow,&quot; she said in an undertone. Then to Selma, <pb
                            id="VAA2368-269" n="[265]"/> unsmilingly: &quot;You&apos;re not
                        interrupting. I&apos;m going.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma advanced. The two girls looked frank hostility into each
                        other&apos;s eyes. Jane did not try to shake hands with her. With a nod
                        and a forced smile of conventional friendliness upon her lips, she passed
                        her and went through the house and into the street.</p>
                    <p>She lingered at the gate, opening and closing it in a most leisurely fashiona
                        significantly different exit from her furtive and ashamed entrance. Love and
                        revolt were running high and hot in her veins. She longed openly to defy the
                        worldher world.</p>

                    <p>Impulse was the dominant strain in Selma Gordon&apos;s characterimpulse
                        and frankness. But she was afraid of Victor Dorn as we all are afraid of
                        those we deeply respectthose whose respect is the mainstay of our
                        self-confidence. She was moving toward him to pour out the violence that was
                        raging in her on the subject of this flirtation of Jane Hastings. The
                        spectacle of a useless and insincere creature like that trifling with her
                        deity, and being permitted to trifle, was more than she could endure. But
                        Victor, dropping listlessly to his chair and reaching for his pencil, was
                        somehow a check upon her impetuousness. She paused long enough to think the
                        sobering second thought. To speak would be both an impertinence and a folly.
                        She owed it to the cause and to her friend Victor to speak; but to speak at
                        the wrong time and in the wrong way would be worse than silence.</p>
                    <p>Said he: &quot;I was finishing this when she came. I&apos;ll be done
                        in a minute. Please read what I&apos;ve written and tell me what you
                        think.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma took up the loose sheets of manuscript and stood reading his inaugural
                        of the new <hi rend="i">New Day.</hi> As she read she forgot the petty
                        matter that had so agitated her a moment before. This salutatorythis <pb

                        campaign to take Remsen City out of the hands of its exploiters and
                        despoilers and make it a city fit for civilized residence and worthy of its
                        population of intelligent, progressive workingmenthis leading editorial for
                        the first number was Victor Dorn at his greatest and best. The man of action
                        with all the enthusiasm of a dreamer. The shrewd, practical politician with
                        the outlook of a statesman. How honest and impassioned he was; yet how free
                        from folly and cant. Several times as she read Selma lifted her eyes to look
                        at him in generous, worshipful admiration. She would not have dared let him
                        see; she would not have dared speak the phrases of adoration of his genius
                        that crowded to her lips. How he would have laughed at herhe who thought
                        about himself as a personality not at all, but only as an instrument.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Here&apos;s the rest of it,&quot; said he, throwing himself
                        back in his chair and relighting his pipe.</p>
                    <p>She finished a moment later, said as she laid the manuscript on the table:
                        &quot;That&apos;s the best you&apos;ve ever done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think so,&quot; agreed he. &quot;It seems to me
                        I&apos;ve got a new grip on things. I needed a turn such as your friend
                        Davy Hull gave me. Nothing like rivalry to spur a man on. The old crowd was
                        so stupidcunning, but stupid. But Hull injects a new element into the
                        struggle. To beat him we&apos;ve got to use our best brains.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-272" n="268"/>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ve got to attack him,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;After all, he is the enemy. We can&apos;t let him disarm us by
                        an act of justice.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, indeed,&quot; said Victor. &quot;But we&apos;ll
                        have to be careful. Here&apos;s what I&apos;m going to carry on the
                        first page.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He held up a sheet of paper on which he had written with a view to effective
                        display the names of the four most offensive local corporations with their
                        contribution$25,000 eachto the campaign fund of the Citizens&apos;
                        Alliance. &quot;Under it, in big type,&quot; proceeded he,
                        &quot;we&apos;ll carry a line asking, &apos;Is the
                        Citizens&apos; Alliance fooling these four corporations or is it fooling
                        the people?&apos; I think that will be more effective than columns of
                        attack.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We ought to get that out on wall-bills and dodgers,&quot;
                        suggested Selma, &quot;and deluge the town with it once or twice a week
                        until election.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Splendid!&quot; exclaimed Victor. &quot;I&apos;ll make
                        a practical politician of you yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Colman and Harbinger and Jocelyn and several others of the League leaders
                        came in one at a time, and the plan of campaign was developed in detail. But
                        the force they chiefly relied upon was the influence of their twelve hundred
                        men, their four or five thousand women and young men and girls, talking
                        every day and evening, each man or woman or youth with those with whom he
                        came into contact. This &quot;army of education&quot; was
                        disciplined, was educated, knew just what <pb id="VAA2368-273" n="269"/>
                        arguments to use, had been cautioned against disputes, against arousing
                        foolish antagonisms. The League had nothing to conceal, no object to gain
                        but the government of Remsen City by and for its citizenswell paved, well
                        lighted, clean streets, sanitary houses, good and clean street car service,
                        honest gas, pure water, plenty of good schoolsthat first of all. The
                        &quot;reform crowd&quot;the Citizens&apos; Alliancelike every
                        reform party of the past, proposed to do practically the same things. But
                        the League met this with: &quot;Why should we elect an upper class
                        government to do for us what we ought to do for ourselves? And how can they
                        redeem their promises when they are tied up in a hundred ways to the very
                        people who have been robbing and cheating us?&quot;</p>
                    <p>There were to be issues of the <hi rend="i">New Day;</hi> there were to be
                        posters and dodgers, public meetings in halls, in squares, on street
                        corners. But the main reliance now as always was this educated
                        &quot;army of education&quot;these six thousand missionaries, each
                        one of them in resolute earnest and bent upon converting his neighbors on
                        either side, and across the street as well. A large part of the time the
                        leaders could spare from making a living was spent in working at this army,
                        in teaching it new arguments or better ways of presenting old arguments, in
                        giving the enthusiasm, in talking with each individual soldier of it and
                        raising his standard of efficiency. Nor could the employers of these
                        soldiers of Victor Dorn&apos;s complain that they <pb id="VAA2368-274"
                            n="270"/> shirked their work for polities. It was a fact that could not
                        be denied that the members of the Working-men&apos;s League were far and
                        away the best workers in Remsen City, got the best pay, and earned it, drank
                        less, took fewer days off on account of sickness. One of the sneers of the
                        Kelly-House gang was that &quot;those Dorn cranks think they are
                        aristocrats, a little better than us common, ordinary laboring
                        men.&quot; And the sneer was not without effect. The truth was, Dorn and
                        his associates had not picked out the best of the working class and drawn it
                        into the League, but had made those who joined the League better workers,
                        better family men, better citizens.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We are saying that the working class ought to run things,&quot;
                        Dorn said again and again in his talks, public and private. &quot;Then,
                        we&apos;ve got to show the community that we&apos;re fit to run
                        things. That is why the League expels any man who shirks or is a drunkard or
                        a crook or a bad husband and father.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The great fight of the Leaguethe fight that was keeping it from powerwas with
                        the trades unions, which were run by secret agents of the Kelly-House
                        oligarchy. Kelly and the Republican party rather favored &quot;open
                        shop&quot; or &quot;scab&quot; laborthe right of an American to
                        let his labor to whom he pleased on what terms he pleased. The Kelly orators
                        waxed almost tearful as they contemplated the outrage of any interference
                        with the ancient liberty of the American citizen. Kelly disguised as House
                        was a hot union man. <pb id="VAA2368-275" n="271"/> He loathed the
                        &quot;scab.&quot; He jeered at the idea that a laborer ought to be
                        at the mercy of the powerful employer who could dictate his own terms, which
                        the laborers might not refuse under stress of hunger. Thus the larger part
                        of the &quot;free&quot; labor in Remsen City voted with Kellywas
                        bought by him at so much a head. The only organization it had was under the
                        Kelly district captains. Union labor was almost solidly Democraticexcept in
                        Presidential elections, when it usually divided on the tariff question.</p>
                    <p>Although almost all the Leaguers were members of the unions, Kelly and House
                        saw to it that they had no influence in union councils. That is, until
                        recently Kelly-House had been able to accomplish this. But they were seeing
                        the approaching end of their domination. The &quot;army of
                        education&quot; was proving too powerful for them. And they felt that at
                        the coming election the decline of their power would be apparentunless
                        something drastic were done.</p>
                    <p>They had attempted it in the riot. The riot had been a fizzlethanks to the
                        interposition of the personal ambition of the until then despised
                        &quot;holy boy,&quot; David Hull. Kelly, the shrewd, at once saw the
                        mark of the man of force. He resolved that Hull should be elected. He had
                        intended simply to use him to elect Hugo Galland judge and to split up the
                        rest of the tickets in such a way that some Leaguers and some reformers
                        would get in, would be powerless, would bring discredit and ridicule upon
                        their parties. But <pb id="VAA2368-276" n="272"/> Hull was a man who could
                        be useful; his cleverness in upsetting the plot against Dorn and turning all
                        to his advantage demonstrated that. Therefore, Hull should be elected and
                        passed up higher. It did not enter his calculations that Hull might prove
                        refractory, might really be all that he professed; he had talked with Davy,
                        and while he had underestimated his intelligence, he knew he had not
                        misjudged his character. He knew that it was as easy to
                        &quot;deal&quot; with the Hull stripe of honest, high minded men as
                        it was difficult to &quot;deal&quot; with the Victor Dorn stripe.
                        Hull he called a &quot;sensible fellow&quot;; Victor Dorn he called
                        a crank. Buthe respected Dorn, while Hull he held in much such esteem as he
                        held his cigar-holder and pocket knife, or Tony Rivers and Joe House.</p>
                    <p>When Victor Dorn had first begun to educate and organize the people of Remsen
                        City, the boss industry was in its early form. That is, Kelly and House were
                        really rivals in the collecting of big campaign funds by various forms of
                        blackmail, in struggling for offices for themselves and their followers, in
                        levying upon vice and crime through the police. In these ways they made the
                        money, the lion&apos;s share of which naturally fell to them as leaders,
                        as organizers of plunder. But that stage had now passed in Remsen City as it
                        had passed elsewhere, and the boss industry had taken a form far more
                        difficult to combat. Kelly and House no longer especially cared whether
                        Republican party or Democratic won. Their businesstheir source of <pb

                        elections, had become a matter of skill in keeping the people more or less
                        evenly divided between the two &quot;regular&quot; parties, with an
                        occasional fake third party to discourage and bring into contempt reform
                        movers and to make the people say, &quot;Well, bad as they are, at least
                        the regulars aren&apos;t addle-headed, damn fools doing nothing except
                        to make business bad.&quot; Both Kelly and House were supported and
                        enriched by the corporations and by big public contracting companies and by
                        real estate deals. Kelly still appropriated a large part of the
                        &quot;campaign fund.&quot; House, in addition, took a share of the
                        money raised by the police from dives. But these sums were but a small part
                        of their income, were merely pin money for their wives and children.</p>
                    <p>Yetat heart and in all sincerity Kelly was an ardent Republican and House was
                        a ferocious Democrat. If you had asked either what Republican and Democrat
                        meant he would have been as vague and unsatisfactory in his reply as would
                        have been any of his followers bearing torch and oilcloth cape in political
                        processions, with no hope of gainbeyond the exquisite pleasure of making a
                        shouting ass of himself in the most public manner. But for all that, Kelly
                        was a Republican and House a Democrat. It is not a strange, though it is a
                        profoundly mysterious, phenomenon, that of the priest who arranges the trick
                        mechanism of the god, yet being a devout believer, ready to die for his
                        &quot;faith.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-278" n="274"/>
                    <p>Difficult though the task was of showing the average Remsen City man that
                        Republican and Democrat, Kelly and House, were one and the same thing, and
                        that thing a blood-sucking, blood-heavy leech upon his veinsdifficult though
                        this task was, Victor Dorn knew that he had about accomplished it, when
                        David Hull appeared. A new personality; a plausible personality, deceptive
                        because self-deceivingyet not so thoroughly self-deceived that it was in
                        danger of hindering its own ambition. David Hulljust the kind of
                        respectable, popular figurehead and cloak the desperate KellyHouse
                        conspiracy needed.</p>
                    <p>How far had the &quot;army of education&quot; prepared the people for
                        seeing through this clever new fraud upon them? Victor Dorn could not judge.
                        He hoped for the best; he was prepared for the worst.</p>
                    <p>The better to think out the various problems of the new situation,
                        complicated by his apparent debt of gratitude to Davy, Victor went forth
                        into the woods very early the next morning. He wandered far, but ten
                        o&apos;clock found him walking in the path in the strip of woods near
                        the high road along the upper side of the park. And when Jane Hastings
                        appeared, he was standing looking in the direction from which she would have
                        to come. It was significant of her state of mind that she had given small
                        attention to her dress that morning. Nor was she looking her best in
                        expression or in color. Her eyes and her skin suggested an almost sleepless
                        night.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-279" n="275"/>
                    <p>He did not advance. She came rapidly as if eager to get over that
                        embarrassing space in which each could see the other, yet neither could
                        speak without raising the voice. When she was near she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think you owe something to Davy Hull for what he did?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The people think so,&quot; said he. &quot;And
                        that&apos;s the important thing.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellyou owe him nothing,&quot; pursued she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nothing that would interfere with the cause,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;And that would be true, no matter what he had done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I mean he did nothing for you,&quot; she explained.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I forgot to tell you yesterday. The whole thing was simply a move
                        to further his ambition. I happened to be there when he talked with father
                        and enlisted him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor laughed. &quot;It was your father who put it through. I might have
                        known!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At first I tried to interpose. ThenI stopped.&quot; She stood
                        before him with eyes down. &quot;It came to me that for my own sake it
                        would be better that you should lose this fall. It seemed to me that if you
                        won you would be farther out of my reach.&quot; She paused, went
                        steadily on: &quot;It was a bad feeling I had that you must not get
                        anything except with my help. Do you understand?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perfectly,&quot; said he cheerfully. &quot;You are your
                        father&apos;s own daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-280" n="276"/>
                    <p>&quot;I love power,&quot; said she. &quot;And so do you. Only,
                        being a woman, I&apos;d stoop to things to get it, that a manat least
                        your sort of manwould scorn. Do you despise me for that? You
                        oughtn&apos;t to. And you will teach me better. You can make of me what
                        you please, as I told you yesterday. I only half meant it then.
                        Nowit&apos;s true, through and through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor glanced round, saw near at hand the bench he was seeking.
                        &quot;Let&apos;s sit down here,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;I&apos;m rather tired. I slept little and I&apos;ve been
                        walking all morning. And you look tired, also.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;After yesterday afternoon I couldn&apos;t sleep,&quot; said
                        she</p>
                    <p>When they were seated he looked at her with an expression that seemed to say:
                        &quot;I have thrown open the windows of my soul. Throw open yours; and
                        let us look at each other as we are, and speak of things as they
                        are.&quot; She suddenly flung herself against his breast and as he
                        clasped her she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nono! Let&apos;s not reason coldly about things, Victor.
                        Let&apos;s feellet&apos;s <hi rend="i">live!</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <p>It was several minutesand not until they had kissed many timesbefore he
                        regained enough self-control to say: &quot;This simply will not do,
                        Jane. How can we discuss things calmly? You sit there&quot;he pushed her
                        gently to one end of the bench&quot;and I&apos;ll sit at this end.
                        Now!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I love you, Victor! With your arms round me I am happyand <hi
                            rend="i">so</hi> strong!&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-281" n="277"/>
                    <p>&quot;With my arms round you I&apos;m happy, I&apos;ll
                        admit,&quot; said he. &quot;Butoh, so weak! I have the sense that I
                        am doing wrongthat we are both doing wrong.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why? Aren&apos;t you free?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, I am not free. As I&apos;ve told you, I belong to a causeto
                        a career.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I won&apos;t hinder you there. I&apos;ll help
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why go over that again? You know betterI know better.&quot;
                        Abruptly, &quot;Your fatherwhat time does he get home for
                        dinner?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He didn&apos;t go down town to-day,&quot; replied Jane.
                        &quot;He&apos;s not wellnot at all well.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor looked baffled. &quot;I was about to propose that we go straight
                        to him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>If he had been looking at Jane, he might have seen the fleeting flash of an
                        expression that betrayed that she had suspected the object of his inquiry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will not go with me to your father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not when he is ill,&quot; said she. &quot;If we told him,
                        it might kill him. He has ambitionswhat he regards as ambitionsfor me. He
                        admires you, buthe doesn&apos;t admire your ideas.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then,&quot; said Victor, following his own train of thought,
                        &quot;we must fight this out between ourselves. I was hoping
                        I&apos;d have your father to help me. I&apos;m sure, as soon as you
                        faced him with me, you&apos;d realize that your feeling about me is
                        largely a delusion.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you?&quot; said Jane softly. &quot;Your feeling about
                            <pb id="VAA2368-282" n="278"/> methe feeling that made you kiss mewas
                        that delusion?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It wasjust what you saw,&quot; replied he, &quot;and
                        nothing more. The idea of marrying youof living my life with you
                        doesn&apos;t attract me in the least. I can&apos;t see you as my
                        wife.&quot; He looked at her impatiently. &quot;Have you no
                        imagination? Can&apos;t you see that you could not change, and become
                        what you&apos;d have to be if you lived with me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can make of me what you please,&quot; repeated she with
                        loving obstinacy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That is not sincere!&quot; cried he. &quot;You may think it
                        is, but it isn&apos;t. Look at me, Jane.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t been doing anything else since we met,&quot;
                        laughed she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s better,&quot; said he. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        not be solemn. Solemnity is pose, and when people are posing they get
                        nowhere. You say I can make of you what I please. Do you mean that you are
                        willing to become a woman of my classto be that all your lifeto bring up
                        your children in that wayto give up your fashionable friendsand maidand
                        carriagesand Paris clothesto be a woman who would not make my associates and
                        their families uncomfortable and shy?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was silent. She tried to speak, but lifting her eyes before she began her
                        glance encountered his and her words died upon her lips.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know you did not mean that,&quot; pursued he.
                        &quot;Now, I&apos;ll tell you what you did mean. You meant <pb
                            id="VAA2368-283" n="279"/> that after you and I were marriedor
                        engagedperhaps you did not intend to go quite so far as marriage just
                        yet.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The color crept into her averted face.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Look at me!&quot; he commanded laughingly.</p>
                    <p>With an effort she forced her eyes to meet his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nowsmile, Jane!&quot;</p>
                    <p>His smile was contagious. The curve of her lips changed; her eyes gleamed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I not reading your thoughts?&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are very clever, Victor,&quot; admitted she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good. We are getting on. You believed that, once we were engaged, I
                        would gradually begin to yield, to come round to your way of thinking. You
                        had planned for me a career something like Davy Hull&apos;sonly freer
                        and bolder. I would become a member of your class, but would pose as a
                        representative of the class I had personally abandoned. Am I
                        right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on, Victor,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s about all. Now, there are just two objections to
                        your plan. The first is, it wouldn&apos;t work. My associates would be
                        &apos;on to&apos; me in a very short time. They are shrewd,
                        practical, practically educated mennot at all the sort that follow Davy Hull
                        or are wearing Kelly&apos;s and House&apos;s nose rings. In a few
                        months I&apos;d find myself a leader without a followingand what is more
                        futile and ridiculous than that?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;They worship you,&quot; said Jane. &quot;They trust you <pb
                            id="VAA2368-284" n="280"/> implicitly. They know that whatever you did
                        would be for their good.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed heartily. &quot;How little you know my friends,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;I am their leader only because I am working with them, doing
                        what we all see must be done, doing it in the way in which we all see it
                        must be done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But <hi rend="i">that</hi> is not power!&quot; cried Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Victor. &quot;But it is the career I
                        wishthe only one I&apos;d have. Power means that one&apos;s
                        followers are weak or misled or ignorant. To be first among
                        equalsthat&apos;s worth while. The other thing is the poor tawdriness
                        that kings and bosses crave and that shallow, snobbish people
                        admire.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I see that,&quot; said Jane. &quot;At least, I begin to see
                        it. How wonderful you are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Victor laughed. &quot;Is it that I know so much, or is it that you know
                        so little?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t like for me to tell you that I admire
                        you?&quot; said Jane, subtle and ostentatiously timid.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care much about it one way or the other,&quot;
                        replied Victor, who had, when he chose, a rare ability to be blunt without
                        being rude. &quot;Years ago, for my own safety, I began to train myself
                        to care little for any praise or blame but my own, and to make myself a very
                        searching critic of myself. So, I am really flattered only when I win my own
                        praiseand I don&apos;t often have that pleasure.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really, I don&apos;t see why you bother with me,&quot; said
                            <pb id="VAA2368-285" n="281"/> she with sly innocencewhich was as far as
                        she dared let her resentments go.</p>
                    <p>&quot;For two reasons,&quot; replied he promptly. &quot;It
                        flatters me that you are interested in me. The second reason is that, when I
                        lost control of myself yesterday, I involved myself in certain
                        responsibilities to you. It has seemed to me that I owe it to myself and to
                        you to make you see that there is neither present nor future in any
                        relations between us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She put out her hand, and before he knew what he was doing he had clasped it.
                        With a gentle, triumphant smile she said: <hi rend="i"
                            >&quot;There&apos;s</hi> the answer to all your reasoning,
                        Victor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He released her hand. <hi rend="i">&quot;An</hi> answer,&quot; he
                        said, &quot;but not the correct answer.&quot; He eyed her
                        thoughtfully. &quot;You have done me a great service,&quot; he went
                        on. &quot;You have shown me an unsuspected, a dangerous weakness in
                        myself. At another timeand coming in another way, I might have made a mess
                        of my careerand of the things that have been entrusted to me.&quot; A
                        long pause, then he added, to himself rather than to her, &quot;I must
                        look out for that. I must do something about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane turned toward him and settled herself in a resolute attitude and with a
                        resolute expression. &quot;Victor,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;I&apos;ve listened to you very patiently. Now I want you to
                        listen to me. What is the truth about us? Why, that we are as if we had been
                        made for each other. I don&apos;t know as much as you do. I&apos;ve
                            <pb id="VAA2368-286" n="282"/> led a much narrower life. I&apos;ve
                        been absurdly miseducated. But as soon as I saw you I felt that I had found
                        the man I was looking for. And I believeI feelI <hi rend="i">know</hi> you
                        were drawn to me in the same way. Isn&apos;t that so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Youfascinated me,&quot; confessed he. &quot;Youor your
                        clothesor your perfume.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Explain it as you like,&quot; said she. &quot;The fact
                        remains that we were drawn together. WellVictor, I am not afraid to face the
                        future, as fate maps it out for us. Are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You<hi rend="i">afraid,</hi>&quot; she went on. &quot;Noyou
                        couldn&apos;t be afraid.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long silence. Then he said abruptly: &quot;<hi rend="i">If</hi> we
                        loved each other. But I know that we don&apos;t. I know that you would
                        hate me when you realized that you couldn&apos;t move me. And I know
                        that I should soon get over the infatuation for you. As soon as it became a
                        question of sympathiescommon tastescongenialityI&apos;d find you
                        hopelessly lacking.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She felt that he was contrasting her with some one elsewith a certain some
                        one. And she veiled her eyes to hide their blazing jealousy. A movement on
                        his part made her raise them in sudden alarm. He had risen. His expression
                        told her that the battle was lostfor the day. Never had she loved him as at
                        that moment, and never had longing to possess him so dominated her willful,
                        self-indulgent, spoiled nature. Yet she <pb id="VAA2368-287" n="283"/> hated
                        him, too; she longed to crush him, to make him sufferto repay him with
                        interest for the suffering he was inflicting upon herthe humiliation. But
                        she dared not show her feelings. It would be idle to try upon this man any
                        of the coquetries indicated for such casesto dismiss him coldly, or to make
                        an appeal through an exhibition of weakness or reckless passion.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You will see the truth, for yourself, as you think things
                        over,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>She rose, stood before him with downcast eyes, with mouth sad and sweet.
                        &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;It&apos;s you who are hiding
                        the truth from yourself. I hopefor both our sakesthat you&apos;ll see
                        itbefore long. Good-bydear.&quot; She stretched out her hand.</p>
                    <p>Hesitatingly he took it. As their hands met, her pulse beating against his,
                        she lifted her eyes. And once more he was holding her close, was kissing
                        her. And she was lying in his arms unresisting, with two large tears shining
                        in the long lashes of her closed eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, Janeforgive me!&quot; he cried, releasing her. &quot;I
                        must keep away from you. I willI <hi rend="i">will!&quot;</hi> And he
                        was rushing down the steep slopedirect, swift, relentless. But she, looking
                        after him with a tender, dreamy smile, murmured: &quot;He loves me. He
                        will come again. If notI&apos;ll go and get him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>To Jane Victor Dorn&apos;s analysis of his feeling toward her and of the
                        reasons against yielding to it seemed of no importance whatever. Side by
                        side with Selma&apos;s <pb id="VAA2368-288" n="284"/> &quot;One may
                        not trifle with love&quot; she would have put &quot;In matters of
                        love one does not reason,&quot; as equally axiomatic. Victor was simply
                        talking; love would conquer him as it had conquered every man and every
                        woman it had ever entered. Loveblind, unreasoning, irresistiblewould have
                        its will and its way.</p>
                    <p>And about most men she would have been rightabout any man practically, of the
                        preceding generation. But Victor represented a new type of human beingthe
                        type into whose life reason enters not merely as a theoretical force, to be
                        consulted and disregarded, but as an authority, a powerful influence,
                        dominant in all crucial matters. Only in our own time has science begun to
                        make a notable impression upon the fog which formerly lay over the whole
                        human mind, thicker here, thinner there, a mere haze yonder, but present
                        everywhere. This fog made clear vision impossible, usually made seeing of
                        any kind difficult; there was no such thing as finding a distinct line
                        between truth and error as to any subject. And reason seemed almost as
                        faulty a guide as feelingwas by many regarded as more faulty, not without
                        justification.</p>
                    <p>But nowadays for some of us there are clear or almost clear horizons, and
                        such fog banks as there are conceal from them nothing that is of importance
                        in shaping a rational course of life. Victor Dorn was one of these
                        emancipated few. All successful men form their lives upon a system of some
                        kind. Even those who seem to live at haphazard, like the multitude, prove
                            <pb id="VAA2368-289" n="285"/> to have chart and compass and definite
                        port in objective when their conduct is more attentively examined. Victor
                        Dorn&apos;s system was as perfect as it was simple, and he held himself
                        to it as rigidly as the father superior of a Trappist monastery holds his
                        monks to their routine. Also, Victor had learned to know and to be on guard
                        against those two arch-enemies of the man who wishes to &quot;get
                        somewhere&quot;self-excuse and optimism. He had got a good strong leash
                        upon his vanityand a muzzle, too. When things went wrong he instantly blamed
                            <hi rend="i">himself,</hi> and did not rest until he had ferreted out
                        the stupidity or folly of which <hi rend="i">he</hi> had been guilty. He did
                        not grieve over his failures; he held severely scientific <hi rend="i">post
                            mortems</hi> upon them to discover the reason whyin order that there
                        should not again be that particular kind of failure at least. Then, as to
                        the other arch-enemy, optimism, he simply cut himself off from indulgence in
                        it. He worked for success; he assumed failure. He taught himself to care
                        nothing about success, but only about doing as intelligently and as
                        thoroughly as he could the thing next at hand.</p>
                    <p>What has all this to do with his infatuation for Jane? It serves to show not
                        only why the Workingmen&apos;s League was growing like a plague of gypsy
                        moth, but also why Victor Dorn was not the man to be conquered by passion.
                        Naturally, Jane, who had only the vaguest conception of the size and power
                        of Victor Dorn&apos;s mind, could not comprehend wherein lay the
                        difference between him and the men she read about in novels or met <pb
                            id="VAA2368-290" n="286"/> in her wanderings among the people of her own
                        class in various parts of the earth. It is possible for even the humblest of
                        us to understand genius, just as it is possible to view a mountain from all
                        sides and get a clear idea of its bulk and its dominion. But the hasty
                        traveler contents himself with a glance, a &quot;How superb,&quot;
                        and a quick passing on; and most of us are hasty travelers in the scenic
                        land of intellectuality. Jane saw that he was a great man. But she was
                        deceived by his frankness and his simplicity. She evoked in him only the
                        emotional side of his nature, only one part of that. Because itthe only
                        phase of him she attentively examinedwas so impressive, she assumed that it
                        was the chief feature of the man.</p>
                    <p>Also, young and inexperienced women and women not so young, and with
                        opportunity to become less inexperienced but without the ability to learn by
                        experiencealways exaggerate the importance of passion. Almost without
                        exception, it is by way of passion that a man and a woman approach each
                        other. It is, of necessity, the exterior that first comes into view. Thus,
                        all that youth and inexperience can know about love is its aspect of
                        passion. Because Jane had again and again in her five grown-up years
                        experienced men falling passionately in love with her, she fancied she was
                        an expert in matters of love. In fact, she had still everything to learn.</p>
                    <p>On the way home she, assuming that the affair was as good as settled, that
                        she and Victor Dorn were <pb id="VAA2368-291" n="287"/> lovers, was busy
                        with plans for the future. Victor Dorn had made a shrewd guess at the state
                        of her mind. She had no intention of allowing him to pursue his present
                        career. That was merely foundation. With the aid of her love and council,
                        and of her father&apos;s money and influence, hehe and shewould mount to
                        something really worth whilesomething more than the petty politics of a
                        third rate city in the West. Washington was the proper arena for his
                        talents; they would take the shortest route to Washington. No trouble about
                        bringing him around; a man so able and so sensible as he would not refuse
                        the opportunity to do good on a grand scale. Besideshe must be got away from
                        his family, from these doubtless good and kind but certainly not very high
                        class associates of his, and from Selma Gordon. The idea of his comparing
                            <hi rend="i">her</hi> with Selma Gordon! He had not done so aloud, but
                        she knew what was in his mind. Yes, he must be taken far away from all these
                        provincial and narrowing associations.</p>
                    <p>But all this was mere detail. The big problem was how to bring her father
                        round. He couldn&apos;t realize what Victor Dorn would be after she had
                        taken him in hand. He would see only Victor Dorn, the labor agitator of
                        Remsen City, the nuisance who put mischievous motives into the heads of
                        &quot;the hands&quot;the man who made them think they had heads when
                        they were intended by the Almighty to be simply hands. How reconcile him to
                        the idea of accepting this nuisance, <pb id="VAA2368-292" n="288"/> this
                        poor, common member of the working class as a son-in-law, as the husband of
                        the daughter he wished to see married to some one of the
                        &quot;best&quot; families?</p>
                    <p>On the face of it, the thing was impossible. Why, then, did not Jane despair?
                        For two reasons. In the first place, she was in love, and that made her an
                        optimist. Somehow love would find the way. But the second reasonthe one she
                        hid from herself deep in the darkest sub-cellar of her mind, was the real
                        reason. It is one matter to wish for a person&apos;s death. Only a
                        villainous nature can harbor such a wish, can admit it except as a hastily
                        and slyly in-crawling impulse, to be flung out the instant it is discovered.
                        It is another matter to calculatevery secretly, very unconsciouslyupon a
                        death that seems inevitable anyhow. Jane had only to look at her father to
                        feel that he would not be spared to her long. The mystery was how he had
                        kept alive so long, how he continued to live from day to day. His stomach
                        was gone; his whole digestive apparatus was in utter disorder. His body had
                        shriveled until he weighed no more than a bady. His pulse was so feeble that
                        even in the hot weather he complained of the cold and had to be wrapped in
                        the heaviest winter garments. Yet he lived on, and his mind worked with
                        undiminished vigor.</p>
                    <p>When Jane reached home, the old man was sitting on the veranda in the full
                        sun. On his huge head was a fur cap pulled well down over his ears and
                        intensifying <pb id="VAA2368-293" n="289"/> the mortuary, skull-like
                        appearance of his face. Over his ulster was an old-fashioned Scotch shawl
                        such as men used to wear in the days before overcoats came into fashion.
                        About his wasted legs was wrapped a carriage robe, and she knew that there
                        was a hot-water bag under his feet. Beside him sat young Doctor Charlton,
                        whom Jane had at last succeeded in inducing her father to try. Charlton did
                        not look or smell like a doctor. He rather suggested a professional athlete,
                        perhaps a better class prize fighter. The weazened old financier was gazing
                        at him with a fascinated expressionadmiring, envious, amused.</p>
                    <p>Charlton was saying:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you do look like a dead one. But that&apos;s only another
                        of your tricks for fooling people. You&apos;ll live a dozen years unless
                        you commit suicide. A dozen years? Probably twenty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You ought to be ashamed to make sport of a poor old
                        invalid,&quot; said Hastings with a grin.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any man who could stand a lunch of crackers and milk for ten years
                        could outlive anything,&quot; retorted Charlton. &quot;No, you
                        belong to the old stock. You used to see &apos;cm around when you were a
                        boy. They usually coughed and wheezed, and every time they did it, the
                        family used to get ready to send for the undertaker. But they lived on and
                        on. When did your mother die?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Couple of years ago,&quot; said Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And your father?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-294" n="290"/>
                    <p>&quot;He was killed by a colt he was breaking at sixty-seven.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton laughed uproariously. &quot;If you took walks and rides instead
                        of always sitting round, you never would die,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;But you&apos;re like lots of women I know. You&apos;d
                        rather die than take exercise. Still, I&apos;ve got you to stop that
                        eating that was keeping you on the verge all the time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re trying to starve me to death,&quot; grumbled
                        Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you feel better, now that you&apos;ve got used
                        to it and don&apos;t feel hungry?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not getting any nourishment.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How would eating help you? You can&apos;t digest any more than
                        what I&apos;m allowing you. Do you think you were better off when you
                        were full of rotting food? I guess not.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;WellI&apos;m doing as you say,&quot; said the old man
                        resignedly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And if you keep it up for a year, I&apos;ll put you on a horse.
                        If you don&apos;t keep it up, you&apos;ll find yourself in a
                        hearse.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane stood silently by, listening with a feeling of depression which she
                        could not have accounted for, if she wouldand would not if she could. Not
                        that she wished her father to die; simply that Charlton&apos;s
                        confidence in his long life forced her to face the only alternativebringing
                        him round to accept Victor Dorn.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-295" n="291"/>
                    <p>At her father&apos;s next remark she began to listen with a high beating
                        heart. He said to Charlton:</p>
                    <p>&quot;How about that there friend of yoursthat young Dorn? You
                        ain&apos;t talked about him to-day as much as usual.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The last time we talked about him we quarreled,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;It&apos;s irritating to see a man of your
                        intelligence a slave to silly prejudices.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I like Victor Dorn,&quot; replied Hastings in a most
                        conciliatory tone. &quot;I think he&apos;s a fine young man.
                        Didn&apos;t I have him up here at my house not long ago?
                        Jane&apos;ll tell you that I like him. She likes him, too. But the
                        trouble with himand with you, toois that you&apos;re dreaming all the
                        time. You don&apos;t recognize facts. And, so, you make a lot of trouble
                        for us conservative men.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please don&apos;t use that word conservative,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;It gags me to hear it. <hi rend="i">You&apos;re</hi>
                        not a conservative. If you had been you&apos;d still be a farm hand.
                        You&apos;ve been a radical all your lifechanging things round and round,
                        always according to your idea of what was to your advantage. The only
                        difference between radicals like you robber financiers and radicals like
                        Victor and me is that our ideas of what&apos;s to our advantage differ.
                        To you life means money; to us it means health and comfort and happiness.
                        You want the world changedlaws upset, liberty destroyed, wages lowered, and
                        so onso that you can get all the money. We want the world changed so that we
                        can be healthy and comfortable and happysecurely <pb id="VAA2368-296"
                            n="292"/> sowhich we can&apos;t be unless everybody is, or is in the
                        way to being.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was surprised to see that her father, instead of being offended, was
                        amused and pleased. He liked his new doctor so well that he liked everything
                        he said and did. Jane looked at Charlton in her friendliest way. Here might
                        be an ally, and a valuable ally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Human nature doesn&apos;t change,&quot; said Hastings in
                        the tone of a man who is stating that which cannot be disputed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;The mischief it doesn&apos;t,&quot; said Charlton in prompt
                        and vigorous dissent. &quot;When conditions change, human nature has to
                        change, has to adapt itself. What you mean is that human nature
                        doesn&apos;t change itself. But conditions change it. They&apos;ve
                        been changing it very rapidly these last few years. Sciencesteam,
                        electricity, a thousand inventions and discoveries, crowding one upon
                        anotherscience has brought about entirely new and unprecedented conditions
                        so rapidly that the changes in human nature now making and that must be made
                        in the next few years are resulting in a series of convulsions. You
                        old-fashioned fellowsand the political parties and the politiciansare in
                        danger of being stranded. Leaders like Victor Dornmovements like our
                        Workingmen&apos;s Leaguethey seem new and radical to-day. By to-morrow
                        they&apos;ll be the commonplace thing, found everywhereand administering
                        the public affairs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was not surprised to see an expression of at <pb id="VAA2368-297"
                            n="293"/> least partial admission upon her father&apos;s face.
                        Charlton&apos;s words were of the kind that set the imagination to work,
                        that remind those who hear of a thousand and one familiar related facts
                        bearing upon the same points. &quot;Well,&quot; said Hastings,
                        &quot;I don&apos;t expect to see any radical changes in my
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you&apos;ll not live as long as I think,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;We Americans advance very slowly because this is a big
                        country and undeveloped, and because we shift about so much that no one
                        stays in one place long enough to build up a citizenship and get an
                        education in politicswhich is nothing more or less than an education in the
                        art of living. But slow though we are, we do advance. You&apos;ll soon
                        see the last of Boss Kelly and Boss Houseand of such gentle, amiable frauds
                        as our friend Davy Hull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed merrily. &quot;Why do you call him a fraud?&quot; she
                        asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because he is a fraud,&quot; said Charlton. &quot;He is
                        trying to confuse the issue. He says the whole trouble is petty dishonesty
                        in public life. Bosh! The trouble is that the upper and middle classes are
                        milking the lower classboth with and without the aid of the various
                        governments, local, state and national. <hi rend="i">That&apos;s</hi>
                        the issue. And the reason it is being forced is because the lower class, the
                        working class, is slowly awakening to the truth. When it completely
                        awakens&quot; Charlton made a large gesture and laughed.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What then?&quot; said Hastings.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-298" n="294"/>
                    <p>&quot;The end of the upper and the middle classes. Everybody will have to
                        work for a living.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who&apos;s going to be elected this fall?&quot; asked Jane.
                        &quot;Your man?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Doctor Charlton. &quot;Victor Dorn thinks
                        not. But he always takes the gloomy view. And he doesn&apos;t meet and
                        talk with the fellows on the other side, as I do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings was looking out from under the vizor of his cap with a peculiar
                        grin. It changed to a look of startled inquiry as Charlton went on to say:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, we&apos;ll win. But the Davy Hull gang will get the
                        offices.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you think that?&quot; asked old Hastings sharply.</p>
                    <p>Charlton eyed his patient with a mocking smile. &quot;You didn&apos;t
                        think any one knew but you and Kellydid you?&quot; laughed he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Knew what?&quot; demanded Hastings, with a blank&apos;
                        stare.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No matter,&quot; said Charlton. &quot;I know what you
                        intend to do. Well, you&apos;ll get away with the goods. But
                        you&apos;ll wish you hadn&apos;t. You old-fashioned fellows, as
                        I&apos;ve been telling you, don&apos;t realize that times have
                        changed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean, Doctor, that the election is to be stolen away from
                        you?&quot; inquired Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Was that what I meant, Mr. Hastings?&quot; said Charlton.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-299" n="295"/>
                    <p>&quot;The side that loses always shouts thief at the side that
                        wins,&quot; said the old man indifferently. &quot;I don&apos;t
                        take any interest in politics.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should you?&quot; said the Doctor audaciously.
                        &quot;You own both sides. So, it&apos;s heads you win, tails I
                        lose.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings laughed heartily. &quot;Them political fellows are a lot of
                        blackmailers,&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s ungrateful,&quot; said Charlton.
                        &quot;Still, I don&apos;t blame you for liking the Davy Hull crowd
                        better. From them you can get what you want just the same, only you
                        don&apos;t have to pay for it.&quot; He rose and stretched his big
                        frame, with a disregard of conventional good manners so unconscious that it
                        was inoffensive. But Charlton had a code of manners of his own, and somehow
                        it seemed to suit him where the conventional code would have made him seem
                        cheap. &quot;I didn&apos;t mean to look after your political
                        welfare, too,&quot; said he. &quot;But I&apos;ll make no charge
                        for that.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I like to hear you young fellows talk,&quot; said Martin.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll sing a different song when you&apos;re as old
                        as I am and have found out what a lot of damn fools the human race
                        is.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As I told you before,&quot; said Charlton,
                        &quot;it&apos;s conditions that make the human animal whatever it
                        is. It&apos;s in the harness of conditionsthe treadmill of conditionsthe
                        straight jacket of conditions. Change the conditions and you change the
                        animal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>When he was swinging his big powerful form across <pb id="VAA2368-300"
                            n="296"/> the lawns toward the fringe of woods, Jane and her father
                        looking after him, Jane said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s wonderfully clever, isn&apos;t he?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;A dreamera crank,&quot; replied the old man.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But what he says sounds reasonable,&quot; suggested the
                        daughter.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It <hi rend="i">sounds</hi> sensible,&quot; admitted the old
                        man peevishly. &quot;But it ain&apos;t what <hi rend="i">I</hi> was
                        brought up to call sensible. Don&apos;t you get none of those fool ideas
                        into your head. They&apos;re. all very well for men that
                        haven&apos;t got any property or any responsibilitiesfor flighty fellows
                        like Charlton and that there Victor Dorn. But as soon as anybody gets
                        property and has interests to look after, he drops that kind of
                        talk.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mean that property makes a man too blind or too cowardly to
                        speak the truth?&quot; asked Jane with an air of great innocence.</p>
                    <p>The old man either did not hear or had no answer ready. He said:
                        &quot;You heard him say that Davy Hull was going to win?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why, he said Victor Dorn was going to win,&quot; said Jane,
                        still simple and guileless.</p>
                    <p>Hastings frowned impatiently. &quot;That was just loose talk. He admitted
                        Davy was to be the next mayor. If he isand I expect Charlton was about
                        rightif Davy is elected, I shouldn&apos;t be surprised to see him
                        nominated for governor next year. He&apos;s a sensible, knowing fellow.
                        He&apos;ll make a good mayor, and he&apos;ll be elected governor on
                        his record.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-301" n="297"/>
                    <p>&quot;And on what you and the other men who run things will do for
                        him,&quot; suggested Jane slyly.</p>
                    <p>Her father grinned expressively. &quot;I like to see a sensible,
                        ambitious young fellow from my town get on,&quot; said he. &quot;And
                        I&apos;d like to see my girl married to a fellow of that sort, and
                        settled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think more could be done with a man like Victor Dorn,&quot;
                        said Jane. &quot;It seems to me the Davy Hull sort of politics isis
                        about played out. Don&apos;t you think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane felt that her remark was a piece of wild audacity. But she was
                        desperate. To her amazement her father did not flare up but kept silent,
                        wearing the look she knew meant profound reflection. After a moment he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Davy&apos;s a knowing boy. He showed that the other day when he
                        jumped in and made himself a popular hero. He&apos;d never
                        &apos;a&apos; been able to come anywheres near election but for
                        that. Dorn&apos;d &apos;a&apos; won by a vote so big that Dick
                        Kelly wouldn&apos;t &apos;a&apos; dared even try to count him
                        out. ... Dorn&apos;s a better man than Davy. But Dorn&apos;s got a
                        foolish streak in him. He believes the foolishness he talks, instead of
                        simply talking it to gain his end. I&apos;ve been looking him over and
                        thinking him over. He won&apos;t do, Jinny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Was her father discussing the matter abstractly, impersonally, as he seemed?
                        Or, had he with that uncanny shrewdness of his somehow penetrated to her
                        secretor to a suspicion of it? Jane was so agitated <pb id="VAA2368-302"
                            n="298"/> that she sat silent and rigid, trying to look unconcerned.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I had a strong notion to try to do something for him,&quot;
                        continued the old man. &quot;But it&apos;d be no use. He&apos;d
                        not rise to a chance that was offered him. He&apos;s set on going his
                        own way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane trembleddared. &quot;I believe <hi rend="i">I</hi> could do
                        something with him,&quot; said sheand she was pleased with the coolness
                        of her voice, the complete absence of agitation or of false note.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Try if you like,&quot; said her father. &quot;But
                        I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll find I&apos;m right. Be careful not to
                        commit yourself in any way. But I needn&apos;t warn you. You know how to
                        take care of yourself. Still, maybe you don&apos;t realize how set up
                        he&apos;d be over being noticed by a girl in your position. And if you
                        gave him the notion that there was a chance for him to marry you,
                        he&apos;d be after you hammer and tongs. The idea of getting hold of so
                        much money&apos;d set him crazy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I doubt if he cares very muchor at allabout money,&quot; said
                        Jane, judicially.</p>
                    <p>Hastings grinned satirically. &quot;There ain&apos;t nobody that
                        don&apos;t care about money,&quot; said he, &quot;any more than
                        there&apos;s anybody that don&apos;t care about air to breathe. Put
                        a pin right there, Jinny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I hate to think that,&quot; she said, reluctantly,
                        &quot;but I&apos;m afraidit&apos;sso.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she was taking her ride one morning she met <pb id="VAA2368-303" n="299"/>
                        David Hull also on horseback and out for his health. He turned and they rode
                        together, for several miles, neither breaking the silence except with an
                        occasional remark about weather or scenery. Finally Davy said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You seem to be down about something, too?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not exactly down,&quot; replied Jane.
                        &quot;SimplyI&apos;ve been doing a lot of thinkingand planningor
                        attempt at planninglately.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I, too,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Naturally. How&apos;s politics?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Of course I don&apos;t hear anything but that I&apos;m
                        going to be elected. If you want to become convinced that the whole world is
                        on the graft, take part in a reform campaign. We&apos;ve attracted every
                        broken-down political crook in this region. It&apos;s hard to say which
                        crowd is the more worthless, the college amateurs at politics or these
                        rotten old in-goods who can&apos;t get employment with either Kelly or
                        House and, so, have joined us. By Jove, I&apos;d rather be in with the
                        out and out grafters the regulars that make no bones of being in politics
                        for the spoils. There&apos;s slimy hypocrisy over our crowd that revolts
                        me. Not a particle of sincerity or conviction. Nothing but high moral
                        guff.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, but <hi rend="i">you&apos;re</hi> sincere, Davy,&quot;
                        said Jane with twinkling eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Am I?&quot; said Davy angrily. &quot;I&apos;m not so
                        damn sure of it.&quot; Hastily, &quot;I don&apos;t mean that. Of
                        course, I&apos;m sincereas sincere as a man can be and get anywhere in
                        this world. You&apos;ve got to humbug the people, <pb id="VAA2368-304"
                            n="300"/> because they haven&apos;t sense enough to want the
                        truth.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I guess, Davy,&quot; said Jane shrewdly, &quot;if you told
                        them the whole truth about yourself and your party they&apos;d have
                        sense enoughto vote for Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s a demagogue,&quot; said Davy with an angry jerk
                        at his rein. &quot;He knows the people aren&apos;t fit to
                        rule.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who is?&quot; said Jane. &quot;I&apos;ve yet to see any
                        human creature who could run anything without making more or less of a mess
                        of it. Andwell, personally, I&apos;d prefer incompetent honest servants
                        to competent ones who were liars or thieves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Sometimes I think,&quot; said Davy, &quot;that the only
                        thing to do is to burn the world up and start another one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t talk like a man who expected to be
                        elected,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;OhI&apos;m worrying about myselfnot about the
                        election,&quot; said Hull, lapsing into sullen silence. And certainly he
                        had no reason to worry about the election. He had the Citizen&apos;s
                        Alliance and the Democratic nominations. And, as a further aid to him, Dick
                        Kelly had given the Republican nomination to Alfred Sawyer, about the most
                        unpopular manufacturer in that region. Sawyer, a shrewd money maker, was an
                        ass in other ways, was strongly seized of the itch for public office. Kelly,
                        seeking the man who would be the weakest, combined business with good
                        politics; he forced Sawyer to pay fifty thousand dollars into the
                        &quot;campaign fund&quot; in a lump sum, and was counting
                        confidently upon <pb id="VAA2368-305" n="301"/> &quot;milking&quot;
                        him for another fifty thousand in installments during the campaign. Thus, in
                        the natural order of things, Davy could safely assume that he would be the
                        next mayor of Remsen City by a gratifyingly large majority. The last vote of
                        the Workingmen&apos;s League had been made fifteen hundred. Though it
                        should quadruple its strength at the coming electionwhich was most
                        improbableit would still be a badly beaten second. Politically, Davy was at
                        ease.</p>
                    <p>Jane waited ten minutes, then asked abruptly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s become of Selma Gordon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see this week&apos;s <hi rend="i">New
                        Day?&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>&quot;Is it out? I&apos;ve seen no one, and haven&apos;t been
                        down town.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There was a lot of stuff in it against me. Most of it demagoguing,
                        of course, but more or less hysterical campaigning. The only nasty article
                        about mea downright personal attack on my sinceritywas signed &apos;S.
                        G.&apos;&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohto be sure,&quot; said Jane, with smiling insincerity.
                        &quot;I had almost forgotten what you told me. Well, it&apos;s easy
                        enough to bribe her to silence. Go offer yourself to her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A long silence, then Davy said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe
                        she&apos;d accept me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Try it,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>Again a long pause. David said sullenly: &quot;I did.&quot; Selma
                        Gordon had refused David Hull! Half a dozen explanations of this astounding
                        occurrence rapidly <pb id="VAA2368-306" n="302"/> suggested themselves. Jane
                        rejected each in turn at a glance. &quot;You&apos;re sure she
                        understood you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I made myself as clear as I did when I proposed to you,&quot;
                        replied Davy with a lack of tact which a woman of Jane&apos;s kind would
                        never forget or forgive.</p>
                    <p>Jane winced, ignored. Said she: &quot;You must have insisted on some
                        conditions she hesitated to accept.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;On her own terms,&quot; said Davy.</p>
                    <p>Jane gave up trying to get the real reason from him, sought it in
                        Selma&apos;s own words and actions. She inquired: &quot;What did she
                        say? What reason did she give?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That she owed it to the cause of her class not to marry a man of my
                        class,&quot; answered Hull, believing that he was giving the exact and
                        the only reason she assigned or had.</p>
                    <p>Jane gave a faint smile of disdain. &quot;Women don&apos;t act from a
                        sense of duty,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;s not the ordinary woman,&quot; said Hull.
                        &quot;You must remember she wasn&apos;t brought up as you and I
                        werehasn&apos;t our ideas of life. The things that appeal to us most
                        strongly don&apos;t touch her. She knows nothing about them.&quot;
                        He added, &quot;And that&apos;s her great charm for me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane nodded sympathetically. Her own case exactly. After a brief hesitation
                        she suggested:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps Selma&apos;s in love withsome one else.&quot; The
                        pause before the vague &quot;some one else&quot; was almost
                        unnoticeable.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-307" n="303"/>
                    <p>&quot;With Victor Dorn, you mean?&quot; said Davy. &quot;I asked
                        her about that. No, she&apos;s not in love with him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;As if she&apos;d tell you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy looked at her a little scornfully. &quot;Don&apos;t
                        insinuate,&quot; he said. &quot;You know she would. There&apos;s
                        nothing of the ordinary tricky, evasive, faking woman about her. And
                        although she&apos;s got plenty of excuse for being conceited, she
                        isn&apos;t a bit so. She isn&apos;t always thinking about herself,
                        like the girls of our class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t in the least wonder at your being in love with
                        her, Davy,&quot; said Jane sweetly. &quot;Didn&apos;t I tell you
                        I admired your tasteand your courage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re sneering at me,&quot; said Davy. &quot;All
                        the same, it did take couragefor I&apos;m a snob at bottomlike youlike
                        all of us who&apos;ve been brought up so foolishlyso rottenly. But
                        I&apos;m proud that I had the courage. I&apos;ve had a better
                        opinion of myself ever since. And if you have any unspoiled womanhood in
                        you, you agree with me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do agree with you,&quot; said Jane softly. She reached out
                        and laid her hand on his arm for an instant. &quot;That&apos;s
                        honest, Davy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He gave her a grateful look. &quot;I know it,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;The reason I confide things to you is because I know
                        you&apos;re a real woman at bottom, Janethe only real person
                        I&apos;ve ever happened across in our class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It took more courage for you to do that sort of thing than it would
                        for a woman,&quot; said Jane. &quot;It&apos;s more natural,
                        easier for a woman to stake everything <pb id="VAA2368-308" n="304"/> in
                        love. If she hasn&apos;t the man she wants she hasn&apos;t anything,
                        while a man&apos;s wife can be a mere detail in his life. He can forget
                        he&apos;s married, most of the time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That isn&apos;t the way I intend to be married,&quot; said
                        Davy. &quot;I want a wife who&apos;ll be half, full half, of the
                        whole. And I&apos;ll get her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean you haven&apos;t given up?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why should I? She doesn&apos;t love another man. So,
                        there&apos;s hope. Don&apos;t you think so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was silent. She hastily debated whether it would be wiser to say yes or
                        to say no.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think so?&quot; repeated he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;How can I tell?&quot; replied Jane, diplomatically.
                        &quot;I&apos;d have to see her with yousee how she feels toward
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think she likes me,&quot; said Davy, &quot;likes me a
                        good deal.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane kept her smile from the surface. What a man always thought, no matter
                        how plainly a woman showed that she detested him. &quot;No doubt she
                        does,&quot; said Jane. She had decided upon a course of action.
                        &quot;If I were you, Davy, I&apos;d keep away from her for the
                        presentgive her time to think it over, to see all the advantages. If a man
                        forces himself on a queer, wild sort of girl such as Selma is, he&apos;s
                        likely to drive her further away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy reflected. &quot;Guess you&apos;re right,&quot; said he
                        finally.</p>
                    <p>&quot;My instinct is always to actto keep on acting until I get results.
                        But it&apos;s dangerous to do that with Selma. At least, I think so. I
                        don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t <pb id="VAA2368-309" n="305"/>
                        understand her. I&apos;ve got nothing to offer hernothing that she
                        wantsas she frankly told me. Even if she loved me, I doubt if she&apos;d
                        marry meon account of her sense of duty. What you said awhile agoabout women
                        never doing things from a sense of dutythat shows how hard it is for a woman
                        to understand what&apos;s perfectly simple to a man. Selma
                        isn&apos;t the sheltered woman sortthe sort whose moral obligations are
                        all looked after by the men of her family. The old-fashioned woman always
                        belonged to some manor else was an outcast. This new style of woman looks at
                        life as a man does.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane listened with a somewhat cynical expression. No doubt, in theory, there
                        was a new style of woman. But practically, the new style of woman merely <hi
                            rend="i">talked</hi> differently; at least, she was still the
                        old-fashioned woman, longing for dependence upon some man and indifferent to
                        the obligations men made such a fuss aboutprobably not so sincerely as they
                        fancied. But her expression changed when Davy went on to say:</p>
                    <p>&quot;She&apos;d look at a thing of that sort much as Ior Victor Dorn
                        would.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s heart suddenly sank. Because the unconscious blow had hurt
                        she struck out, struck back with the first weapon she could lay hold of.
                        &quot;But you said a minute ago that Victor was a hypocritical
                        demagogue.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy flushed with confusion. He was in a franker <pb id="VAA2368-310" n="306"
                        /> mood now, however. &quot;I&apos;d like to think that,&quot;
                        he replied. &quot;But I don&apos;t honestly believe it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You think that if Victor Dorn loved a woman of our class
                        he&apos;d put her out of his life?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s hardly worth discussing,&quot; said Davy.
                        &quot;No woman of our classno woman he&apos;d be likely to look
                        atwould encourage him to the point where he&apos;d presume upon
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;How narrow you are!&quot; cried Jane, derisive but even more
                        angry.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s differententirely differentwith a man, even in our
                        class. But a woman of our classshe&apos;s a lady or she&apos;s
                        nothing at all. And a lady couldn&apos;t be so lacking in refinement as
                        to descend to a man socially beneath her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can see how <hi rend="i">any</hi> woman might fall in love with
                        Victor Dorn.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re just saying that to be argumentative,&quot;
                        said Davy with conviction. &quot;Take yourself, for example.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I confess I don&apos;t see any such contrast between Victor and
                        youexcept where the comparison&apos;s altogether in his favor,&quot;
                        said Jane pleasantly. &quot;You don&apos;t know as much as he does.
                        You haven&apos;t the independence of characteror the courageor the
                        sincerity. You couldn&apos;t be a real leader, as he is. You have to
                        depend on influence, and on trickery.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A covert glance at the tall, solemn-looking young man riding silently beside
                        her convinced her that he was as uncomfortable as she had hoped to make him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-311" n="307"/>
                    <p>&quot;As for mannersand the things that go to make a gentleman,&quot;
                        she went on, &quot;I&apos;m not sure but that there, too, the
                        comparison is against you. You always suggest to me that if you
                        hadn&apos;t the pattern set for men of our class and didn&apos;t
                        follow it, you&apos;d be absolutely lost, Davy, dear. While
                        Victorhe&apos;s a fine, natural person, with the manners that grow as
                        naturally out of his personality as oak leaves grow out of an oak.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was astonished and delighted by this eloquence of hers about the man she
                        lovedan eloquence far above her usual rather commonplace mode of speech and
                        thought. Love was indeed an inspirer! What a person she would become when
                        she had Victor always stimulating her. She went on:</p>
                    <p>&quot;A woman would never grow tired of Victor. He doesn&apos;t talk
                        stale stuff such as all of us get from the stale little professors and
                        stale, dreary text-books at our colleges.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why don&apos;t you fall in love with him?&quot; said Davy
                        sourly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I do believe you&apos;re envious of Victor Dorn,&quot;
                        retorted Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a disagreeable mood you&apos;re in to-day,&quot; said
                        Davy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;So a man always thinks when a woman speaks well of another man in
                        his presence.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t suspect you of being envious of Selma. Why should
                        you suspect me of feeling ungenerously <pb id="VAA2368-312" n="308"/> about
                        Victor? Fall in love with him if you like. Heaven knows, I&apos;d do
                        nothing to stop it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Perhaps I shall,&quot; said Jane, with unruffled amiability.
                        &quot;You&apos;re setting a dangerous example of breaking down class
                        lines.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Now, Jane, you know perfectly well that while, if I married Selma
                        she&apos;d belong to my class, a woman of our class marrying Victor Dorn
                        would sink to his class. Why quarrel about anything so obviously
                        true?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor Dorn belongs to a class by himself,&quot; replied Jane.
                        &quot;You forget that men of genius are not regarded like you poor
                        ordinary mortals.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy was relieved that they had reached the turning at which they had to
                        separate. &quot;I believe you are in love with him,&quot; said he as
                        a parting shot.</p>
                    <p>Jane, riding into her lane, laughed gayly, mockingly. She arrived at home in
                        fine humor. It pleased her that Davy, for all his love for Selma, could yet
                        be jealous of Victor Dorn on her account. And more than ever, after this
                        talk with himthe part of it that preceded the quarrelshe felt that she was
                        doing a fine, brave, haughtily aristocratic thing in loving Victor Dorn.
                        Only a woman with a royal soul would venture to be thus audacious.</p>
                    <p>Should she encourage or discourage the affair between Davy and Selma? There
                        was much to be said for this way of removing Selma from her path; also, if a
                        man of Davy Hull&apos;s position married beneath him, less <pb
                            id="VAA2368-313" n="309"/> would be thought of her doing the same thing.
                        On the other hand, she felt that she had a certain property right in David
                        Hull, and that Selma was taking what belonged to her. This, she admitted to
                        herself, was mean and small, was unworthy of the woman who was trying to be
                        worthy of Victor Dorn, of such love as she professed for him. Yes, mean and
                        small. She must try to conquer it.</p>
                    <p>Butwhen she met Selma in the woods a few mornings later, her dominant
                        emotions were anything but high-minded and generous. Selma was looking her
                        most fascinatingwild and strange and unique. They caught sight of each other
                        at the same instant. Jane came composedly onSelma made a darting movement
                        toward a by-path opening near her, hesitated, stood like some shy, lovely
                        bird of the deep wilderness ready to fly away into hiding.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hello, Selma!&quot; said Jane carelessly.</p>
                    <p>Selma looked at her with wide, serious eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where have you been keeping yourself of late? Busy with the
                        writing, I suppose?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I owe you an apology,&quot; said Selma, in a queer, suppressed
                        voice. &quot;I have been hating you, and trying to think of some way to
                        keep you and Victor Dorn apart. I thought it was from my duty to the cause.
                        I&apos;ve found out that it was a low, mean personal reason.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane had stopped short, was regarding her with eyes that glowed in a pallid
                        face. &quot;Because you are in love with him?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-314" n="[310]"/>
                    <p>Selma gave a quick, shamed nod. &quot;Yes,&quot; she saidthe sound
                        was scarcely audible.</p>
                    <p>Selma&apos;s frank and generousand confidingselfsacrifice aroused no
                        response in Jane Hastings. For the first time in her life she was knowing
                        what it meant to hate.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And I&apos;ve got to warn you,&quot; Selma went on,
                        &quot;that I am going to do whatever I can to keep you from hindering
                        him. Not because I love him, but because I owe it to the cause. He belongs
                        to it, and I must help him be single-hearted for it. You could only be a bad
                        influence in his life. I think you would like to be a sincere woman; but you
                        can&apos;t. Your class is too strong for you. Soit would be wrong for
                        Victor Dorn to love and to marry you. I think he realizes it and is
                        struggling to be true to himself. I intend to help him, if I can.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane smiled cruelly. &quot;What hypocrisy!&quot; she said, and turned
                        and walked away.</p>

                    <head>VIII</head>
                    <p>In America we have been bringing up our women like men, and treating them
                        like children. They have active minds with nothing to act upon. Thus they
                        are driven to think chiefly about themselves. With Jane Hastings,
                        self-centering took the form of self-analysis most of the time. She was
                        intensely interested in what she regarded as the new development of her
                        character. This definite and apparently final decision for the narrow and
                        the ungenerous. In fact, it was no new development, but simply a revelation
                        to herself of her own real character. She was seeing at last the genuine
                        Jane Hastings, inevitable product of a certain heredity in a certain
                        environment. The high thinking and talking, the idealistic aspiration were
                        pose and pretense. Jane Hastings was a selfish, self-absorbed person, ready
                        to do almost any base thing to gain her ends, ready to hate to the uttermost
                        any one who stood between her and her object.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m certainly not a lovely personnot a lovable
                        person,&quot; thought she, with that gentle tolerance wherewith we
                        regard our ownselves, whether in the dress of pretense or in the undress of
                        deformed humanness. &quot;Still Iam what I am, and I&apos;ve got to
                        make the best of it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>As she thought of Selma&apos;s declaration of war she became <pb
                            id="VAA2368-316" n="312"/> less and less disturbed about it. Selma
                        neither would nor could do anything sly. Whatever she attempted in the open
                        would only turn Victor Dorn more strongly toward herself. However, she must
                        continue to try to see him, must go to see him in a few days if she did not
                        happen upon him in her rides or walks. How poorly he would think of her if
                        he knew the truth about her! But then, how poor most womenand men, toowould
                        look in a strong and just light. Few in deed could stand idealizing; except
                        Victor, no one she knew. And he was human enough not to make her
                        uncomfortable in his presence.</p>
                    <p>But it so happened that before she could see Victor Dorn her father disobeyed
                        Dr. Charlton and gave way to the appetite that was the chief cause of his
                        physical woes. He felt so well that he ate the family dinner, including a
                        peach cobbler with whipped cream, which even the robust Jane adventured
                        warily. Martha was dining with them. She abetted her father.
                        &quot;It&apos;s light,&quot; said she. &quot;It
                        couldn&apos;t harm anybody.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mustn&apos;t touch it, popsy,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>She unthinkingly spoke a little too commandingly. Her father, in a perverse
                        and reckless mood, took Martha&apos;s advice. An hour later Dr. Charlton
                        was summoned, and had he not arrived promptly</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another fifteen or twenty minutes,&quot; said he to the old man
                        when he had him out of immediate danger, &quot;and I&apos;d have had
                        nothing to do but sign a certificate of natural death.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-317" n="313"/>
                    <p>&quot;Murder would have been nearer the truth,&quot; said Martin
                        feebly. &quot;That there fool Martha!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Come out from behind that petticoat!&quot; cried Charlton.
                        &quot;Didn&apos;t I spend the best part of three days in giving you
                        the correct ideas as to health and diseasein showing you that <hi rend="i"
                            >all</hi> disease comes from indigestion<hi rend="i">all</hi> disease,
                        from falling hair and sore eyes to weak ankles and corns? And
                        didn&apos;t I convince you that you could eat only the things I told you
                        about?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t hit a man when he&apos;s down,&quot; groaned
                        Hastings.</p>
                    <p>&quot;If I don&apos;t, you&apos;ll do the same idiotic trick
                        again when I get you upif I get you up.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hastings looked quickly at him. This was the first time Charlton had ever
                        expressed a doubt about his living. &quot;Do you mean that?&quot; he
                        said hoarsely. &quot;Or are you just trying to scare me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Both,&quot; said Charlton. &quot;I&apos;ll do my best,
                        but I can&apos;t promise. I&apos;ve lost confidence in you. No
                        wonder doctors, after they&apos;ve been in practice a few years, stop
                        talking food and digestion to their patients. I&apos;ve never been able
                        to convince a single human being that appetite is not the sign of health,
                        and yielding to it the way to health. But I&apos;ve made lots of people
                        angry and have lost their trade. I had hopes of you. You were such a
                        hopeless wreck. But no. And you call yourself an intelligent man!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll never do it again,&quot; said Hastings, pleading,
                        but smiling, tooCharlton&apos;s way of talking delighted him.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-318" n="314"/>
                    <p>&quot;You think this is a joke,&quot; said Charlton, shaking his
                        bullet head. &quot;Have you any affairs to settle? If you have, send for
                        your lawyer in the morning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Fearthe Great Fearsuddenly laid its icy long fingers upon the throat of the
                        old man. He gasped and his eyes rolled. &quot;Don&apos;t trifle with
                        me, Charlton,&quot; he muttered. &quot;You know you will pull me
                        through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll do my best,&quot; said Charlton. &quot;I
                        promise nothing. I&apos;m serious about the lawyer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want no lawyer hanging round my bed,&quot;
                        growled the old man. &quot;It&apos;d kill me. I&apos;ve got
                        nothing to settle. I don&apos;t run things with loose ends. And
                        there&apos;s Jinny and Marthy and the boyshare and share
                        alike.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellyou&apos;re in no immediate danger. I&apos;ll come
                        early to-morrow.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wait till I get to sleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll be asleep as soon as the light&apos;s down. But
                        I&apos;ll stop a few minutes and talk to your daughter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton found Jane at the window in the dressing room next her
                        father&apos;s bedroom. He said loudly enough for the old man to
                        overhear:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your father&apos;s all right for the present, so you
                        needn&apos;t worry. Come downstairs with me. He&apos;s to go to
                        sleep now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane went in and kissed the bulging bony forehead. &quot;Good night,
                        popsy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Good night, Jinny dear,&quot; he said in a softer voice than
                        she had ever heard from him. &quot;I&apos;m feeling very <pb
                            id="VAA2368-319" n="315"/> comfortable now, and sleepy. If anything
                        should happen, don&apos;t forget what I said about not temptin&apos;
                        your brother by trustin&apos; him too fur. Look after your own affairs.
                        Take Mr. Haswell&apos;s advice. He&apos;s stupid, but he&apos;s
                        honest and careful and safe. You might talk to Dr. Charlton about things,
                        too. He&apos;s straight, and knows what&apos;s what. He&apos;s
                        one of them people that gives everybody good advice but themselves. If
                        anything should happen&quot; &quot;But nothing&apos;s going to
                        happen, popsy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It might. I don&apos;t seem to care as much as I did.
                        I&apos;m so tarnation tired. I reckon the goin&apos; ain&apos;t
                        as bad as I always calculated. I didn&apos;t know how tired they felt
                        and anxious to rest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll turn down the light. The nurse is right in
                        there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesturn the light. If anything should happen, there&apos;s an
                        envelope in the top drawer in my desk for Dr. Charlton. But don&apos;t
                        tell him till I&apos;m gone. I don&apos;t trust nobody, and if he
                        knowed there was something waiting, why, there&apos;s no telling</p>
                    <p>The old man had drowsed off. Jane lowered the light and went down to join
                        Charlton on the front veranda, where he was smoking a cigarette. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s asleep.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;s all right for the next few days,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;After thatI don&apos;t know. I&apos;m very
                        doubtful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was depressed, but not so depressed as she would <pb id="VAA2368-320"
                            n="316"/> have been had not her father so long looked like death and so
                        often been near dying.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Stay at home until I see how this is going to turn out. Telephone
                        your sister to be within easy call. But don&apos;t let her come here.
                        She&apos;s not fit to be about an ill person. The sight of her pulling a
                        long, sad face might carry him off in a fit of rage.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane observed him with curiosity in the light streaming from the front hall.
                        &quot;You&apos;re a very practical personaren&apos;t
                        you?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No romance, no idealism, you mean?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed in his plain, healthy way. &quot;Not a frill,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;I&apos;m interested only in facts. They keep me busy
                        enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re not married, are you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not yet. But I shall be as soon as I find a woman I want.&quot;</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="i">&quot;If</hi> you can get her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get her, all right,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;No trouble about that. The woman I want&apos;ll want
                        me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m eager to see her,&quot; said Jane.
                        &quot;She&apos;ll be a queer one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; said he. &quot;But I&apos;ll
                        make her a queer one before I get through with herqueer, in my sense,
                        meaning sensible and useful.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You remind me so often of Victor Dorn, yet you&apos;re not at
                        all like him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;re in the same businesstrying to make the <pb
                            id="VAA2368-321" n="317"/> human race fit to associate with. He looks
                        after the minds; I look after the bodies. Mine&apos;s the humbler branch
                        of the business, perhapsbut it&apos;s equally necessary, and it comes
                        first. The chief thing that&apos;s wrong with human nature is bad
                        health. I&apos;m getting the world ready for Victor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You like him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I worship him,&quot; said Charlton in his most matter-of-fact
                        way.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yet he&apos;s just the opposite of you. He&apos;s an
                        idealist.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Who told you that?&quot; laughed Charlton.
                        &quot;He&apos;s the most practical, sensible man in this town. You
                        people think he&apos;s a crank because he isn&apos;t crazy about
                        money or about stepping round on the necks of his fellow beings. The truth
                        is, he&apos;s got a sense of proportionand a sense of humorand an idea
                        of a rational happy life. You&apos;re still barbarians, while
                        he&apos;s a civilized man. Ever seen an ignorant yap jeer when a neat,
                        clean, well-dressed person passed by? Well, you people jeering at Victor
                        Dorn are like that yap.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I agree with you,&quot; said Jane hastily and earnestly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, you don&apos;t,&quot; replied Charlton, tossing away
                        the end of his cigarette. &quot;And so much the worse for you.
                        Good-night, lady.&quot; And away he strode into the darkness, leaving
                        her amused, yet with a peculiar sense of her own insignificance.</p>
                    <p>Charlton was back again early the next morning and spent that dayand a large
                        part of many days thereafterin working at the wreck, Martin Hastings,
                        inspecting <pb id="VAA2368-322" n="318"/> known weak spots, searching for
                        unknown ones, patching here and there, trying all the schemes teeming in his
                        ingenious and supremely sensible mind in the hope of setting the wreck
                        afloat again. He could not comprehend why the old man remained alive. He had
                        seen many a human being go who was in health, in comparison with this
                        conglomerate of diseases and frailties; yet life there was, and a most
                        tenacious life. He worked and watched, and from day to day put off
                        suggesting that they telegraph for the son. The coming of his son might
                        shake Martin&apos;s conviction that he would get well; it seemed to
                        Charlton that that conviction was the one thread holding his patient from
                        the abyss where darkness and silence reign supreme.</p>
                    <p>Jane could not leave the grounds. If she had she would have seen Victor Dorn
                        either not at all or at a distance. For the campaign was now approaching its
                        climax.</p>
                    <p>The public man is always two wholly different personalities. There is the man
                        the public seesand fancies it knows. There is the man known only to his
                        intimates, known imperfectly to them, perhaps an unknown quantity even to
                        himself until the necessity for decisive action reveals him to himself and
                        to those in a position to see what he really did. Unfortunately, it is not
                        the man the public sees but the hidden man who is elected to the office.
                        Nothing could be falser than the old saw that sooner or later a man stands
                        revealed. Sometimes, as we well know, history has not found out a man after
                        a <pb id="VAA2368-323" n="319"/> thousand years of studying him. And the
                        most familiar, the most constantly observed men in public life often round
                        out a long career without ever having aroused in the public more than a
                        faint and formless suspicion as to the truth about them.</p>
                    <p>The chief reason for this is that, in studying a character, no one is content
                        with the plain and easy way of reaching an understanding of itthe way of
                        looking only at its <hi rend="i">acts.</hi> We all love to dabble in the
                        metaphysical, to examine and weigh motives and intentions, to compare
                        ourselves and make wildly erroneous judgment inevitable by listening to the
                        man&apos;s <hi rend="i">words</hi>his professions, always more or less
                        dishonest, though perhaps not always deliberately so.</p>
                    <p>In that Remsen City campaign the one party that could profit by the full and
                        clear truth, and therefore was eager for the truth as to everything and
                        everybody, was the Workingmen&apos;s League. The Kelly crowd, the House
                        gang, the Citizens&apos; Alliance, all had their ugly secrets, their
                        secret intentions different from their public professions. All these were
                        seeking office and power with a view to increasing or perpetuating or
                        protecting various abuses, however ardently they might attack, might perhaps
                        honestly intend to end, certain other and much smaller abuses. The
                        Workingmen&apos;s League said that it would end every abuse existing law
                        did not securely protect, and it meant what it said. Its campaign fund was
                        the dues paid in by its members and the profits from the <hi rend="i">New
                            Day.</hi> Its financial books were open <pb id="VAA2368-324" n="320"/>
                        for free inspection. Not so the othersand that in itself was proof enough of
                        sinister intentions. Under Victor Dorn&apos;s shrewd direction, the
                        League candidates published, each man in a sworn statement, a complete
                        description of all the property owned by himself and by his wife.
                        &quot;The character of a man&apos;s property,&quot; said the <hi
                            rend="i">New Day,</hi> &quot;is an indication of how that man will
                        act in public affairs. Therefore, every candidate for public trust owes it
                        to the people to tell them just what his property interests are. The League
                        candidates do thisand an effective answer the schedules make to the charge
                        that the League&apos;s candidates are men who have &apos;no stake in
                        the community.&apos; Now, let Mr. Sawyer, Mr. Hull, Mr. Galland and the
                        rest of the League&apos;s opponents do likewise. Let us read how many
                        shares of water and ice stock Mr. Sawyer owns. Let us hear from Mr. Hull
                        about his traction holdingsthose of the Hull estate from which he draws his
                        entire income. As for Mr. Galland, it would be easier for him to give the
                        list of public and semi-public corporations in which he is not largely
                        interested. But let him be specific, since he asks the people to trust him
                        as judge between them and those corporations of which he is almost as large
                        an owner as is his father-in-law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>This line of attackand the publication of the largest contributors to the
                        Republican and Democratic-Reform campaign fundcaused a great deal of public
                        and private discussion. Large crowds cheered Hull when he, without doing the
                        charges the honor of repeating <pb id="VAA2368-325" n="321"/> them,
                        denounced the &quot;undignified and demagogic methods of our desperate
                        opponents.&quot; The smaller Sawyer crowds applauded Sawyer when he
                        waxed indignant over the attempts of those &quot;socialists and
                        anarchists, haters of this free country and spitters upon its glorious flag,
                        to set poor against rich, to destroy our splendid American tradition of a
                        free field and no favors, and let the best man win!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Sawyer, and Davy, all the candidates of the machines and the reformers for
                        that matter, made excellent public appearances. They discoursed eloquently
                        about popular rights and wrongs. They denounced corruption; they stood
                        strongly for the right and renounced and denounced the devil and all his
                        works. They promised to do far more for the people than did the Leaguers;
                        for Victor Dorn had trained his men to tell the exact truththe difficulty of
                        doing anything for the people at any near time or in any brief period
                        because at a single election but a small part of the effective offices could
                        be changed, and sweeping changes must be made before there could be sweeping
                        benefits. &quot;We&apos;ll do all we can,&quot; was their
                        promise. &quot;Their county government and their state government and
                        their courts won&apos;t let us do much. But a beginning has to be made.
                        Let&apos;s make it!&quot;</p>
                    <p>David Hull&apos;s public appearance was especially good. Not so effective
                        as it has now become, because he was only a novice at campaigning in that
                        year. But he looked, wellhandsome, yet not too handsome, upper class, but
                        not arrogant, serious, frank and kindly. And <pb id="VAA2368-326" n="322"/>
                        he talked in a plain, honest wayyou felt that no interest, however greedy,
                        desperate and powerful, would dare approach that man with an improper
                        proposaland you quite forgot in real affairs the crude improper proposal is
                        never the method of approach. When Davy, with grave emotion, referred to the
                        &quot;pitiful efforts to smirch the personal character of
                        candidates,&quot; you could not but burn with scorn of the Victor Dorn
                        tactics. What if Hull did own gas and water and ice and traction and railway
                        stocks? Mustn&apos;t a rich man invest his money somehow? And how could
                        he more creditably invest it than in local enterprises and in enterprises
                        that opened up the country and gave employment to labor? What if the
                        dividends were improperly, even criminally, earned? Must he therefore throw
                        the dividends paid him into the street? As for a man of such associations
                        and financial interests being unfit fairly to administer public affairs,
                        what balderdash! Who could be more fit than this educated, high-minded man,
                        of large private means, willing to devote himself to the public service
                        instead of drinking himself to death or doing nothing at all. You would have
                        felt, as you looked at Davy and listened to him, that it was little short of
                        marvelous that a man could be so self-sacrificing as to consent to run the
                        gauntlet of low mudslingers for no reward but an office with a salary of
                        three thousand a year. And you would have been afraid that, if something was
                        not done to stop these mudslingers, such men as David Hull would abandon
                        their <pb id="VAA2368-327" n="323"/> patriotic efforts to save their
                        countryand then <hi rend="i">what</hi> would become of the country?</p>
                    <p>But Victor and his associateson the platform, in the paper, in posters and
                        dodgers and leafletscontinued to press home the ugly questionsand continued
                        to call attention to the fact that, while there had been ample opportunity,
                        none of the candidates had answered any of the questions. And
                        presentlykeeping up this line of attackVictor opened out in another. He had
                        Falconer, the League candidate for judge, draw up a careful statement of
                        exactly what each public officer could do under existing law to end or to
                        check the most flagrant of the abuses from which the people of Remsen City
                        were suffering. With this statement as a basis, he formulated a series of
                        questions&quot;Yes or no? If you are elected, will you or will you
                        not?&quot; The League candidates promptly gave the specific pledges.
                        Sawyer dodged. David Hull was more adroit. He held up a copy of the list of
                        questions at a big meeting in Odd Fellows&apos; Hall.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Our opponents have resorted to a familiar trickthe question and the
                        pledge.&quot; (Applause. Sensation. Fear lest &quot;our
                        candidate&quot; was about to &quot;put his foot in it.&quot;)
                        &quot;We need resort to no tricks. I promptly and frankly, for our whole
                        ticket, answer their questions. I say, &apos;We will lay hold of <hi
                            rend="i">any</hi> and <hi rend="i">every</hi> abuse, as soon as it
                        presents itself, and <hi rend="i">will smash it.&apos;&quot;</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Applause, cheers, whistlingsa demonstration lasting nearly five minutes by a
                        watch held by Gamaliel <pb id="VAA2368-328" n="324"/> Tooker, who had a
                        mania for gathering records of all kinds and who had voted for every
                        Republican candidate for President since the party was founded. Davy did not
                        again refer to Victor Dorn&apos;s questions. But Victor continued to
                        press them and to ask whether a public officer ought not to go and present
                        himself to abuses, instead of waiting for them to hunt him out and present
                        themselves to him.</p>
                    <p>Such was the campaign as the public saw it. And such was in reality the
                        campaign of the Leaguers. But the real campaignthe one conducted by Kelly
                        and Housewas entirely different. They were not talking; they were working.</p>
                    <p>They were working on a plan based somewhat after this fashion:</p>
                    <p>In former and happier days, when people left politics to politicians and
                        minded their own business, about ninety-five per cent. of the voters voted
                        their straight party tickets like good soldiers. Then politics was a
                        high-class business, and politicians devoted themselves to getting out the
                        full party vote and to buying or cajoling to one side or the other the
                        doubtful ten per cent that held the balance of power. That golden age,
                        however, had passed. People had gotten into the habit of fancying that,
                        because certain men had grown very, very rich through their own genius for
                        money-making, supplemented perhaps by accidental favors from law and public
                        officials, therefore politics in some way might possibly concern the private
                        citizen, might account for <pb id="VAA2368-329" n="325"/> the curious
                        discrepancy between his labor and its reward. The impression was growing
                        that, while the energy of the citizen determined the <hi rend="i"
                        >production</hi> of wealth, it was politics that determined the distribution
                        of wealth. And under the influence of this impression, the percentage of
                        sober, steady, reliable voters who &quot;stood by the grand old
                        party&quot; had shrunk to about seventy, while the percentage of voters
                        who had to be worried about had grown to about thirty.</p>
                    <p>The Kelly-House problem was, what shall we do as to that annoying thirty per
                        cent?</p>
                    <p>Kellyfor he was <hi rend="i">the</hi> brain of the bi-partisan machine,
                        proposed to throw the election to the House-Reform
                        &quot;combine.&quot; His henchmen and House&apos;s made a
                        careful poll, and he sat up all night growing haggard and puffy-eyed over
                        the result. According to this poll, not only was the League&apos;s
                        entire ticket to be elected, but also Galland, despite his having the
                        Republican, the Democratic and the Reform nominations, was to be beaten by
                        the League&apos;s Falconer. He couldn&apos;t understand it. The
                        Sawyer meetings were quite up to his expectations and indicated that the
                        Republican rank and file was preparing to swallow the Sawyer dose without
                        blinking. The Alliance and the Democratic meetings were equally
                        satisfactory. Hull was &quot;making a hit.&quot; Everywhere he had
                        big crowds and enthusiasm. The League meetings were only slightly better
                        attended than during the last campaign; no indication there of the League
                        &quot;landslide.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-330" n="326"/>
                    <p>Yet Kelly could not, dared not, doubt that poll. It was his only safe guide.
                        And it assured him that the long-dreaded disaster was at hand. In vain was
                        the clever trick of nominating a popular, &quot;clean&quot; young
                        reformer and opposing him with an unpopular regular of the most offensive
                        typemore offensive even than a professional politician of unsavory record.
                        At last victory was to reward the tactics of Victor Dorn, the slow, patient
                        building which for several years now had been rasping the nerves of Boss
                        Kelly.</p>
                    <p>What should he do?</p>
                    <p>It was clear to him that the doom of the old system was settled. The
                        plutocrats, the upper-class crowdthe &quot;silk stockings,&quot; as
                        they had been called from the days when men wore knee-breechesthey fancied
                        that this nation-wide movement was sporadic, would work out in a few years,
                        and that the people would return to their allegiance. Kelly had no such
                        delusions. Issuing from the depths of the people, he understood. They were
                        learning a little something at last. They were discovering that the ever
                        higher prices for everything and stationary or falling wages and salaries
                        had some intimate relation with politics; that at the national capitol, at
                        the state capitol, in the county courthouse, in the city hall their share of
                        the nation&apos;s vast annual production of wealth was being
                        determinedand that the persons doing the dividing, though elected by them,
                        were in the employ of the plutocracy. Kelly, seeing and comprehending, felt
                        that it behooved him to get for his masters <pb id="VAA2368-331" n="327"/>
                        and for himselfall that could be got in the brief remaining time. Not that
                        he was thinking of giving up the game; nothing so foolish as that. It would
                        be many a year before the plutocracy could be routed out, before the people
                        would have the intelligence and the persistence to claim and to hold their
                        own. In the meantime, they could be fooled and robbed by a hundred tricks.
                        He was not a constitutional lawyer, but he had practical good sense, and
                        could enjoy the joke upon the people in their entanglement in the toils of
                        their own making. Through fear of governmental tyranny they had divided
                        authority among legislators, executives and judges, national, state, local.
                        And, behold, outside of the government, out where they had never dreamed of
                        looking, had grown up a tyranny that was perpetuating itself by dodging from
                        one of these divided authorities to another, eluding capture, wearing out
                        the not too strong perseverance of popular pursuit.</p>
                    <p>But, thanks to Victor Dorn, the local graft was about to be taken away from
                        the politicians and the plutocracy. How put off that unpleasant event?
                        Obviously, in the only way left unclosed. The election must be stolen.</p>
                    <p>It is a very human state of mind to feel that what one wants somehow has
                        already become in a sense one&apos;s property. It is even more
                        profoundly human to feel that what one has had, however wrongfully, cannot
                        justly be taken away. So Mr. Kelly did not regard himself as <pb
                            id="VAA2368-332" n="328"/> a thief, taking what did not belong to him;
                        no, he was holding on to and defending his own.</p>
                    <p>Victor Dorn had not been in politics since early boyhood without learning how
                        the political game is conducted in all its branches.</p>
                    <p>Because there had never been the remotest chance of victory, Victor had never
                        made prelection polls of his party. So the first hint that he got of there
                        being a real foundation for the belief of some of his associates in an
                        impending victory was when he found out that Kelly and House were
                        &quot;colonizing&quot; voters, and were selecting election officers
                        with an eye to &quot;dirty work.&quot; These preparations, he knew,
                        could not be making for the same reason as in the years before the
                        &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; between the Republican
                        and the Democratic machines. Kelly, he knew, wanted House and the Alliance
                        to win. Therefore, the colonizations in the slums and the appointing of
                        notorious buckos to positions where they would control the ballot boxes
                        could be directed only against the Workhingmen&apos;s League. Kelly must
                        have accurate information that the League was likely, or at least not
                        unlikely, to win.</p>
                    <p>Victor had thought he had so schooled himself that victory and defeat were
                        mere words to him. He soon realized how he had overestimated the power of
                        philosophy over human nature. During that campaign he had been imagining
                        that he was putting all his ability all his energy, all his resourcefulness
                        into the fight. He now discovered his mistake. Hopedefinite hopeof <pb
                            id="VAA2368-333" n="329"/> victory had hardly entered his mind before he
                        was organizing and leading on such a campaign as Remsen City had never known
                        in all its historyand Remsen City was in a state where politics is the chief
                        distraction of the people. Sleep left him; he had no need of sleep. Day and
                        night his brain worked, pouring out a steady stream of ideas. He became like
                        a gigantic electric storage battery to which a hundred, a thousand small
                        batteries come for renewal. He charged his associates afresh each day. And
                        they in turn became amazingly more powerful forces for acting upon the minds
                        of the people.</p>
                    <p>In the last week of the campaign it became common talk throughout the city
                        that the &quot;Dorn crowd&quot; would probably carry the election.
                        Kelly was the only one of the opposition leaders who could maintain a calm
                        front. Kelly was too seasoned a gambler even to show his feelings in his
                        countenance, but, had he been showing them, his following would not have
                        been depressed, for he had made preparations to meet and overcome any
                        majority short of unanimity which the people might roll up against him. The
                        discouragement in the House-Alliance camps became so apparent that Kelly
                        sent his chief lieutenant, Wellman, successor to the fugitive Rivers, to
                        House and to David Hull with a message. It was delivered to Hull in this
                        form:</p>
                    <p>&quot;The old man says he wants you to stop going round with your chin
                        knocking against your knees. He says everybody is saying you have given up
                        the fight.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-334" n="330"/>
                    <p>&quot;Our meetings these last few days are very discouraging,&quot;
                        said Davy gloomily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s meetin&apos;s?&quot; retorted Wellman.
                        &quot;You fellows that shoot off your mouths think you&apos;re doing
                        the campaigning. But the real stuff is being doped up by us fellows who
                        ain&apos;t seen or heard. The old man says you are going to win.
                        That&apos;s straight. He knows. It&apos;s only a question of the
                        size of your majority. So pull yourself together, Mr. Hull, and put the
                        ginger back into your speeches, and stir up that there gang of dudes. What a
                        gang of Johnnies and quitters they are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Hull was looking directly and keenly at the secret messenger. Upon his lips
                        was a question he dared not ask. Seeing the impudent, disdainful smile in
                        Wellman&apos;s eyes, he hastily shifted his glance. It was most
                        uncomfortable, this suspicion of the hidden meaning of the Kelly messagea
                        suspicion <hi rend="i">almost</hi> confirmed by that mocking smile of the
                        messenger. Hull said with embarrassment:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Tell Mr. Kelly I&apos;m much obliged.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you&apos;ll begin to make a fight again?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Davy impatiently.</p>
                    <p>When he was alone he became once more involved in one of those internal
                        struggles to prevent himself from seeingand smellinga hideous and malodorous
                        truth. These struggles were painfully frequent. The only consolation the
                        young reformer found was that they were increasingly less difficult to end
                        in the way such struggles <pb id="VAA2368-335" n="331"/> must be ended if a
                        high-minded young man is to make a career in &quot;practical&quot;
                        life.</p>
                    <p>On election day after he had voted he went for a long walk in the woods to
                        the south of the town, leaving word at his headquarters what direction he
                        had taken. After walking two hours he sat down on a log in the shade near
                        where the highroad crossed Foaming Creek. He became so absorbed in his
                        thoughts that he sprang to his feet with a wild look when Selma&apos;s
                        voice said, close by:</p>
                    <p>&quot;May I interrupt a moment, Mr. Hull?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He recovered slowly. His cheeks were pale and his voice uncertain as he
                        replied:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You? I beg your pardon. This campaign has played smash with my
                        nerves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He now noted that she was regarding him with a glance so intense that it
                        seemed to concentrate all the passion and energy in that slim, nervous body
                        of hers. He said uncomfortably:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You wished to see me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I wonder what you were thinking about,&quot; she said in her
                        impetuous, direct way. &quot;It makes me almost afraid to ask what I
                        came to ask.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Won&apos;t you sit?&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No, thanks,&quot; replied she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then you&apos;ll compel me to stand. And I&apos;m horribly
                        tired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She seated herself upon the log. He made himself comfortable at its other
                        end.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-336" n="332"/>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve just come from Victor Dorn&apos;s
                        house,&quot; said she. &quot;There was a consultation among the
                        leaders of our party. We have learned that your peopleKelly and Houseare
                        going to steal the election on the count this evening. They are committing
                        wholesale frauds nowsending round gangs of repeaters, intimidating our
                        voters, openly buying votes at the polling placespaying men as much not to
                        vote as they usually pay for votes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy, though latterly he had grown so much older and graver that no one now
                        thought of him as Davy, contrived to muster a smile of amusement.
                        &quot;You oughtn&apos;t to let them deceive you with that silly
                        talk, Miss Gordon. The losers always indulge in it. Your good sense must
                        tell you how foolish it is. The police are on guard, and the courts of
                        justice are open.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesthe police are on guardto protect fraud and to drive us away
                        from the polls. And the courts are openbut not for us.&quot;</p>
                    <p>David was gentle with her. &quot;I know how sincere you are,
                        Selma,&quot; said he. &quot;No doubt you believe those things.
                        Perhaps Dorn believes them, alsofrom repeating them so often. But all the
                        same I&apos;m sorry to hear you say them.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He tried to look at her. He found that his eyes were more comfortable when
                        his glance was elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This has been a sad campaign to me,&quot; he went on.
                        &quot;I did not appreciate before what demagogery meant <pb
                            id="VAA2368-337" n="333"/> how dangerous it ishow wicked, how criminally
                        wicked it is for men to stir up the lower classes against the educated
                        leadership of the community.</p>
                    <p>Selma laughed contemptuously. &quot;What nonsense, David Hulland from <hi
                            rend="i">you!&quot;</hi> she cried. &quot;By educated leadership
                        do you mean the traction and gas and water and coal and iron and produce
                        thieves? Or do you mean the officials and the judges who protect them and
                        license them to rob?&quot; Her eyes flashed. &quot;At this very
                        moment, in our town, those thieves and their agents, the police and the
                        courts, are committing the most frightful crime known to a free people. Yet
                        the masses are submitting peaceably. How long the upper class has to indulge
                        in violence, and how savagely cruel it has to be, before the people even
                        murmur. But I didn&apos;t come here to remind you of what you already
                        know. I came to ask you, as a man whom I have respected, to assert his
                        manhoodif there is any of it left after this campaign of falsehood and
                        shifting.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma!&quot; he protested energetically, but still avoiding her
                        eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Those wretches are stealing that election for you, David Hull. Are
                        you going to stand for it? Or, will you go into town and force Kelly to
                        stop?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;If anything wrong is being done by Kelly,&quot; said David,
                        &quot;it must be for Sawyer.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma rose. &quot;At our consultation,&quot; said she quietly and
                        even with no suggestion of repressed emotion, &quot;they debated coming
                        to you and laying the facts before you. <pb id="VAA2368-338" n="334"/> They
                        decided against it. They were right; I was wrong. I pity you, David Hull.
                        Good-by.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She walked away. He hesitated, observing her. His eyes lighted up with the
                        passion he believed his good sense had conquered. &quot;Selma,
                        don&apos;t misjudge me!&quot; he cried, following her. &quot;I
                        am not the scoundrel they&apos;re making you believe me. I love
                        you!&quot;</p>
                    <p>She wheeled upon him so fiercely that he started back. &quot;How dare
                        you!&quot; she said, her voice choking with anger. &quot;You
                        miserable fraud! You bellwether for the plutocracy, to lead reform movements
                        off on a false scent, off into the marshes where they&apos;ll be
                        suffocated.&quot; She looked at him from head to foot with a withering
                        glance. &quot;No doubt, you&apos;ll have what&apos;s called a
                        successful career. You&apos;ll be their traitor leader for the radicals
                        they want to bring to confusion. When the people cry for a reform
                        you&apos;ll shout louder than anybody elseand you&apos;ll be made
                        leaderand you&apos;ll leadinto the marshes. Your followers will perish,
                        but you&apos;ll come back, ready for the next treachery for which the
                        plutocracy needs you. And you&apos;ll look honest and respectableand
                        you&apos;ll talk virtue and reform and justice. But you&apos;ll know
                        what you are yourself. David Hull, I despise you as much as you despise
                        yourself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not follow as she walked away. He returned to the log, and slowly
                        reseated himself. He was glad of the violent headache that made thought
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>Remsen City, boss-ridden since the Civil War, had experienced <pb
                            id="VAA2368-339" n="335"/> many a turbulent election day and night. The
                        rivalries of the two bosses, contending for the spoils where the electorate
                        was evenly divided, had made the polling places in the poorer quarters
                        dangerous all day and scenes of rioting at night. But latterly there had
                        been a notable improvement. People who entertained the pleasant and
                        widespread delusion that statute laws offset the habits and customs of men,
                        restrain the strong and protect the weak, attributed the improvement to
                        sundry vigorously worded enactments of the legislature on the subject of
                        election frauds. In fact, the real bottom cause of the change was the
                        &quot;gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot; between the two party
                        machines whereunder both entered the service of the same master, the
                        plutocracy.</p>
                    <p>Never in Remsen City history had there been grosser frauds than those of this
                        famous election day, and never had the frauds been so open. A day of scandal
                        was followed by an evening of shame; for to overcome the League the henchmen
                        of Kelly and House had to do a great deal of counting out and counting in,
                        of mutilating ballots, of destroying boxes with their contents. Yet never
                        had Remsen City seen so peaceful an election. Representatives of the League
                        were at every polling place. They protested; they took names of principals
                        and witnesses in each case of real or suspected fraud. They appealed to the
                        courts from time to time and got rulingsalways against them, even where the
                        letter of the decision was in their favor. They did all this in the <pb
                            id="VAA2368-340" n="336"/> quietest manner conceivable, without so much
                        as an expression of indignation. And when the results were announceda
                        sweeping victory for Hull and the fusion ticket, Hugo Galland elected by
                        five hundred over Falconerthe Leaguers made no counter demonstration as the
                        drunken gangs of machine heelers paraded in the streets with bands and
                        torches.</p>
                    <p>Kelly observed and was uneasy. What could be the meaning of this meek
                        acceptance of a theft so flagrant that the whole town was talking about it?
                        What was Victor Dorn&apos;s &quot;game&quot;?</p>
                    <p>He discovered the next day. The executive committee of the League worked all
                        night; the League&apos;s printers and presses worked from six
                        o&apos;clock in the morning until ten. At half-past ten Remsen City was
                        flooded with a special edition of the <hi rend="i">New Day,</hi> given away
                        by Leaguers and their wives and sons and daughtersa monster special edition
                        paid for with the last money in the League&apos;s small campaign chest.
                        This special was a full account of the frauds that had been committed. No
                        indictment could have been more complete, could have carried within itself
                        more convincing proofs of the truth of its charges. The <hi rend="i">New
                        Day</hi> declared that the frauds were far more extensive than it was able
                        to prove; but it insisted upon, and took into account, only those frauds
                        that could be proved in a &quot;court of justiceif Remsen City had a
                        court of justice, which the treatment of the League&apos;s protectors at
                        the Courthouse yesterday shows that it has not.&quot; The results of the
                            <pb id="VAA2368-341" n="337"/> League&apos;s investigations were
                        tabulated. The <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> showed:</p>
                    <p>First, that while Harbinger, the League candidate for Mayor, had actually
                        polled 5,280 votes at least, and David Hull had polled less than 3,950, the
                        election had been so manipulated that in the official count 4,827 votes were
                        given to Hull and 3,980 votes to Harbinger.</p>
                    <p>Second, that in the actual vote Falconer had beaten Hugo Galland by 1,230 at
                        least; that in the official count Galland was declared elected by a majority
                        of 672.</p>
                    <p>Third, that these results were brought about by wholesale fraudulent voting,
                        one gang of twenty-two repeaters casting upwards of a thousand votes at the
                        various polling places; also by false counting, the number of votes reported
                        exceeding the number cast by between two and three thousand.</p>
                    <p>As a piece of workmanship the document was an amazing illustration of the
                        genius of Victor Dorn. Instead of violence against violence, instead of
                        vague accusation, here was a calm, orderly proof of the League&apos;s
                        case, of the outrage that had been done the city and its citizens. Before
                        night fell the day after the election there was no one in Remsen City who
                        did not know the truth.</p>
                    <p>The three daily newspapers ignored the special. They continued to
                        congratulate Remsen City upon the &quot;vindication of the
                        city&apos;s fame for sound political sense,&quot; as if there had
                        been no protest against the official version <pb id="VAA2368-342" n="338"/>
                        of the election returns. Nor did the press of the state or the country
                        contain any reference to the happenings at Remsen City. But Remsen City
                        knew, and that was the main point sought by Victor Dorn.</p>
                    <p>A committee of the League with copies of the special edition and transcripts
                        of the proofs in the possession of the League went in search of David Hull
                        and Hugo Galland. Both were out of town, &quot;resting in retirement
                        from the fatigue of the campaign.&quot; The prosecuting attorney of the
                        county was seen, took the documents, said he would look into the matter,
                        bowed the committee outand did as Kelly counted on his doing. The grand jury
                        heard, but could not see its way clear to returning indictments; no one was
                        upon a grand jury in that county unless he had been passed by Kelly or
                        House. Judge Freilig and Judge Lansing referred the committee to the grand
                        jury and to the county prosecutor.</p>
                    <p>When the League had tried the last avenue to official justice and had found
                        the way barred, House meeting Kelly in the Palace Hotel caf, said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well, Richard, I guess it&apos;s all over.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kelly nodded. &quot;You&apos;ve got away with the goods.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m surprised at Dorn&apos;s taking it so
                        quietly,&quot; said House. &quot;I rather expected he&apos;d
                        make trouble.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Kelly vented a short, grunting laugh. &quot;Troublehell!&quot;
                        ejaculated he. &quot;If he&apos;d &apos;a&apos; kicked up a
                        fight we&apos;d &apos;a&apos; had him. But he was too
                        &apos;cute for that, damn him. So next time he wins.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-343" n="339"/>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, folks ain&apos;t got no memoriesespecially for
                        politics,&quot; said House easily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll see,&quot; retorted Kelly. &quot;The next
                        mayor of this town&apos;ll be a Leaguer, and by a majority that
                        can&apos;t be trifled with. So make hay while the sun shines, Joe. After
                        this administration there&apos;ll be a long stretch of bad weather for
                        haying.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m trying to get hold of Hull,&quot; said House, and
                        it was not difficult to read his train of thought. &quot;I was a <hi
                            rend="i">leetle</hi> afraid he was going to be scared by that document
                        of Dorn&apos;sand was going to do something crazy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Again Kelly emitted his queer grunting laugh. &quot;I guess he was a <hi
                            rend="i">leetle</hi> afraid he would, too, and ran away and hid to get
                        back his nerve.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, he&apos;s all right. He&apos;s a pushing, level-headed
                        fellow, and won&apos;t make no trouble. Don&apos;t you think
                        so?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Trouble? I should say not. How can heif he takes the job?&quot;</p>
                    <p>To which obvious logic no assent was necessary.</p>
                    <p>Davy&apos;s abrupt departure was for the exact reason Mr. Kelly ascribed.
                        And he had taken Hugo with him because he feared that he would say or do
                        something to keep the scandal from dying the quick death of all scandals.
                        There was the less difficulty in dissuading him from staying to sun himself
                        in the glories of his new rank and title because his wife had cast him
                        adrift for the time and was stopping at the house of her father, whose death
                        was hourly expected.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-344" n="340"/>
                    <p>Old Hastings had been in a stupor for several weeks. He astonished everybody,
                        except Dr. Charlton, by rousing on election night and asking how the battle
                        had gone.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And he seemed to understand what I told him,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Certainly he understood,&quot; replied Charlton. &quot;The
                        only part of him that&apos;s in any sort of condition is his mind,
                        because it&apos;s the only part of him that&apos;s been properly
                        exercised. Most people die at the top first because they&apos;ve never
                        in all their lives used their minds when they could possibly avoid
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the week following the election he came out of his stupor again. He said
                        to the nurse:</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s about supper time, ain&apos;t it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered she. &quot;They&apos;re all down at
                        dinsupper. Shall I call them?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No,&quot; said he. &quot;I want to go down to her
                        room.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;To Miss Jane&apos;s room?&quot; asked the puzzled nurse.</p>
                    <p>&quot;To my wife&apos;s room,&quot; said Hastings crossly.</p>
                    <p>The nurse, a stranger, thought his mind was wandering.
                        &quot;Certainly,&quot; said she soothingly. &quot;In a few
                        minutesas soon as you&apos;ve rested a while.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re a fool!&quot; mumbled Hastings. &quot;Call
                        Jinny.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nurse obeyed. When he repeated his request to Jane, she hesitated. The
                        tears rolled down his cheeks. &quot;I know what I&apos;m
                        about,&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Send for Charlton. He&apos;ll
                        tell you to let me have my way.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane decided that it was best to yield. The shrunken <pb id="VAA2368-345"
                            n="341"/> figure, weighing so little that it was terrifying to lift it,
                        was wrapped warmly, and put in an invalid chair. With much difficulty the
                        chair was got out into the hall and down the stairs. Then they wheeled it
                        into the room where he was in the habit of sitting after supper. When he was
                        opposite the atrocious crayon enlargement of his wife an expression of
                        supreme content settled upon his features. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go back to your supper, Jinny. Take the nurse woman with you. I
                        want to be by myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nurse glanced stealthily in from time to time during the next hour. She
                        saw that his eyes were open, were fixed upon the picture. When Jane came she
                        ventured to enter. She said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Do you mind my sitting with you, father?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not answer. She went to him, touched him. He was dead.</p>
                    <p>As a rule death is not without mitigations, consolations even. Where it is
                        preceded by a long and troublesome illness, disrupting the routine of the
                        family and keeping everybody from doing the things he or she wishes, it
                        comes as a relief. In this particular case not only was the death a relief,
                        but also the estate of the dead man provided all the chief mourners with
                        instant and absorbing occupation. If he had left a will, the acrimony of the
                        heirs would have been caused by dissatisfaction with his way of distributing
                        the property. Leaving no will, he plunged the three heirsor, rather, the
                        five heirs, for the husband of Martha and the wife <pb id="VAA2368-346"
                            n="342"/> of the son were most important factorshe plunged the five
                        heirs into a ferment of furious dispute as to who was to have what. Martha
                        and her husband and the daughter-in-law were people of exceedingly small
                        mind. Trifles, therefore, agitated them to the exclusion of larger matters.
                        The three fell to quarreling violently over the division of silverware,
                        jewelry and furniture. Jane was so enraged by the &quot;disgusting
                        spectacle&quot; that she proceeded to take part in it and to demand
                        everything which she thought it would irritate Martha Galland or Irene
                        Hastings to have to give up.</p>
                    <p>The three women and Hugofor Hugo loved petty wranglingspent day after day in
                        the bitterest quarrels. Each morning Jane, ashamed overnight, would issue
                        from her room resolved to have no part in the vulgar rowdyism. Before an
                        hour had passed she would be the angriest of the disputants. Except her own
                        unquestioned belongings there wasn&apos;t a thing in the house or
                        stables about which she cared in the least. But there was a principle at
                        stakeand for principle she would fight in the last ditch.</p>
                    <p>None of them wished to call in arbitrators or executors; why go to that
                        expense? So, the bickering and wrangling, the insults and tears and sneers
                        went on from day to day. At last they settled the whole matter by lotand by
                        a series of easily arranged exchanges where the results of the drawings were
                        unsatisfactory. Peace was restored, but not liking. Each of the three
                        groupsHugo and Martha, Will and Irene, Jane in a <pb id="VAA2368-347"
                            n="343"/> group by herselfdetested the other two. They felt that they
                        had found each other out. As Martha said to Hugo, &quot;It takes a thing
                        of this kind to show people up in their true colors.&quot; Or, as Jane
                        said to Doctor Charlton, &quot;What beasts human beings are!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Said he: &quot;What beasts circumstance makes of some of them
                        sometimes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are charitable,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am scientific,&quot; replied he. &quot;It&apos;s very
                        intelligent to go about distributing praise and blame. To do that is to obey
                        a slightly higher development of the instinct that leads one to scowl at and
                        curse the stone he stumps his toe on. The sensible thing to do is to look at
                        the causes of thingsof brutishness in human beings, for exampleand to remove
                        those causes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It was wonderful, the way you dragged father back to life and
                        almost saved him. That reminds me. Wait a second, please.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She went up to her room and got the envelope addressed to Charlton which she
                        had found in the drawer, as her father directed. Charlton opened it, took
                        out five bank notes each of a thousand dollars. She glanced at the money,
                        then at his face. It did not express the emotion she was expecting. On the
                        contrary, its look was of pleased curiosity.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Five thousand dollars,&quot; he said, reflectively.
                        &quot;Your father certainly was a queer mixture of surprises and
                        contradictions. Now, who would have suspected him of a piece of sentiment
                        like this? Pure sentiment. He <pb id="VAA2368-348" n="344"/> must have felt
                        that I&apos;d not be able to save him, and he knew my bill
                        wouldn&apos;t be one-tenth this sum.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He liked you, and admired you,&quot; said Jane. &quot;He
                        was very generous where he liked and admired.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton put the money back in the envelope, put the envelope in his pocket.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll give the money to the Children&apos;s
                        Hospital,&quot; said he. &quot;About six months ago I completed the
                        sum I had fixed on as necessary to my independence; so, I&apos;ve no
                        further use for moneyexcept to use it up as it comes in.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You may marry some day,&quot; suggested Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not a woman who wishes to be left richer than
                        independent,&quot; replied he. &quot;As for the children,
                        they&apos;ll be brought up to earn their own independence. I&apos;ll
                        leave only incubators and keepsakes when I die. But no estate. I&apos;m
                        not that foolish and inconsiderate.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;What a queer idea!&quot; exclaimed Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;On the contrary, it&apos;s simplest common sense. The idea of
                        giving people something they haven&apos;t earnedthat&apos;s the
                        queer idea.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You are <hi rend="i">so</hi> like Victor Dorn!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That reminds me!&quot; exclaimed Charlton. &quot;It was
                        very negligent of me to forget. The day your father died I dropped in on
                        Victor and told himhim and Selma Gordonabout it. And both asked me to take
                        you their sympathy. They said a great deal about your love for your father,
                        and how sad it was to lose him. They were really distressed.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-349" n="345"/>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s face almost brightened. &quot;I&apos;ve been rather
                        hurt because I hadn&apos;t received a word of sympathy
                        fromthem,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;They&apos;d have come, themselves, except that politics has
                        made a very ugly feeling against themand Galland&apos;s your
                        brother-in-law.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Jane. &quot;But I&apos;m not
                        Gallandand not of that party.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes, you are of that party,&quot; replied Charlton.
                        &quot;You draw your income from it, and one belongs to whatever he draws
                        his income from. Civilization means propertyas yet. And it doesn&apos;t
                        mean men and womenas yet. So, to know the man or the woman we look at the
                        property.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s hideously unjust,&quot; cried Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t be utterly egotistical,&quot; said Charlton.
                        &quot;Don&apos;t attach so much importance to your little, mortal,
                            <hi rend="i">weak</hi> personality. Try to realize that you&apos;re
                        a mere chip in the great game of chance. You&apos;re a chip with the
                        letter P on itwhich stands for Plutocracy. And you&apos;ll be played as
                        you&apos;re labeled.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You make it very hard for any one to like you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Wellgood-by, then.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And ignoring her hasty, half-laughing, half-serious protests he took himself
                        away. She was intensely irritated. A rapid change in her outward character
                        had been going forward since her father&apos;s deatha change in the
                        direction of intensifying the traits that had always been really dominant,
                        but had been less apparent <pb id="VAA2368-350" n="346"/> because softened
                        by other traits now rapidly whithering.</p>
                    <p>The cause of the change was her inheritance.</p>
                    <p>Martin Hastings, remaining all his life in utter ignorance of the showy uses
                        of wealth and looking on it with the eyes of a farm hand, had remained the
                        enriched man of the lower classes, at heart a member of his original class
                        to the end. The effect of this upon Jane had been to keep in check all the
                        showy and arrogant, all the upper class, tendencies which education and
                        travel among the upper classes of the East and of Europe had implanted in
                        her. So long as plain old Martin lived, she could not <hi rend="i">feel</hi>
                        the position she hador, rather, would some day havein the modern social
                        system. But just as soon as he passed away, just as soon as she became a
                        great heiress, actually in possession of that which made the world adore,
                        that which would buy servility, flattery, awejust so soon did she begin to
                        be an upper-class lady.</p>
                    <p>She had acquired a superficial knowledge of businessenough to enable her to
                        understand what the various items in the long, long schedule of her holdings
                        meant. Symbols of her importance, of her power. She had studied the
                        &quot;great ladies&quot; she had met in her travels and visitings.
                        She had been impressed by the charm of the artistic, carefully cultivated
                        air of simplicity and equality affected by the greatest of these great
                        ladies as those born to wealth and position. To be gentle and natural, to be
                        graciousthat was the &quot;proper thing.&quot; <pb id="VAA2368-351"
                            n="347"/> So, she now adopted a manner that was if anything too kindly.
                        Her pose, her mask, behind which she was concealing her swollen and still
                        swelling pride and sense of superiority, as yet fitted badly. She
                        &quot;overacted,&quot; as youth is apt to do. She would have given a
                        shrewd observerone not dazzled by her wealth beyond the power of clear
                        sightthe impression that she was pitying the rest of mankind, much as we all
                        pity and forbear with a hopeless cripple. But the average observer would
                        simply have said: &quot;What a sweet, natural girl, so unspoiled by her
                        wealth!&quot;just as the hopeless cripple says, &quot;What a polite
                        person,&quot; as he gets the benefit of effusive good manners that
                        would, if he were shrewd, painfully remind him that he was an unfortunate
                        creature.</p>
                    <p>Of all the weeds that infest the human garden snobbishness, the commonest, is
                        the most prolific, and it is a mighty cross breeder, toomodifying every
                        flower in the garden, changing colors from rich to glaring, changing odors
                        from perfumes to sickening-sweet or to stenches. The dead hands of Martin
                        Hastings scattered showers of shining gold upon his daughter&apos;s
                        garden; and from these seeds was springing a heavy crop of that most
                        prolific of weeds.</p>
                    <p>She was beginning to resent Charlton&apos;s mannerbluff, unceremonious,
                        candid, at times rude. He treated women exactly as he treated men, and he
                        treated all men as intimates, free and easy fellow travelers afoot upon a
                        dusty, vulgar highway. She had found charm in that <pb id="VAA2368-352"
                            n="348"/> manner, so natural to the man of no pretense, of splendid
                        physical proportions, of the health of a fine tree. She was beginning to get
                        into the state of mind at which practically all very rich people in a
                        civilized society sooner or later arrivea state of mind that makes it
                        impossible for any to live with or near them except hirelings and
                        dependents. The habit of power of any kind breeds intolerance of equality of
                        level intercourse. This is held in check, often held entirely in check,
                        where the power is based upon mental superiority; for the very superiority
                        of the mind keeps alive the sense of humor and the sense of proportion. Not
                        so the habit of money power. For money power is brutal, mindless. And as it
                        is the only real power in any and all aristocracies, aristocracies are
                        inevitably brutal and brutalizing.</p>
                    <p>If Jane had been poor, or had remained a few years longeruntil her character
                        was better setunder the restraining influence of her unfrilled and
                        unfrillable father, her passion for power, for superiority would probably
                        have impelled her to develop her mind into a source of power and position.
                        Fate abruptly gave her the speediest and easiest means to power known in our
                        plutocratic civilization. She would have had to be superhuman in beauty of
                        character or a genius in mind to have rejected the short and easy way to her
                        goal and struggled on in the long and hardand doubtfulway.</p>
                    <p>She did not herself appreciate the change within herself. She fancied she was
                        still what she had been two <pb id="VAA2368-353" n="349"/> weeks before. For
                        as yet nothing had occurred to enable her to realize her changed direction,
                        her changed view of life. Thus, she was still thinking of Victor Dorn as she
                        had thought of him; and she was impatient to see him. She was now free<hi
                            rend="i">free!</hi> She could, without consulting anybody, have what she
                        wanted. And she wanted Victor Dorn.</p>
                    <p>She had dropped from her horse and with her arm through the bridle was
                        strolling along one of the quieter roads which Victor often took in his
                        rambles. It was a tonic October day, with floods of sunshine upon the
                        gorgeous autumnal foliage, never more gorgeous than in that fall of the
                        happiest alternations of frost and warmth. She heard the pleasant rustle of
                        quick steps in the fallen leaves that carpeted the byroad. She knew it was
                        he before she glanced; and his first view of her face was of its beauty
                        enhanced by a color as delicate and charming as that in the leaves about
                        them.</p>
                    <p>She looked at his hands in which he was holding something half concealed.
                        &quot;What is it?&quot; she said, to cover her agitation.</p>
                    <p>He opened his hands a little wider. &quot;A bird,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;Some hunter has broken its wing. I&apos;m taking it to
                        Charlton for repairs and a fair start for its winter down South.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His eyes noted for an instant significantly her sombre riding costume, then
                        sought her eyes with an expression of simple and friendly sympathy. The
                        tears came to her eyes, and she turned her face away. She for the <pb
                            id="VAA2368-354" n="350"/> first time had a sense of loss, a moving
                        memory of her father&apos;s goodness to her, of an element of tenderness
                        that had passed out of her life forever. And she felt abjectly
                        ashamedashamed of her relief at the lifting of the burden of his long
                        struggle against death, ashamed of her miserable wranglings with Martha and
                        Billy&apos;s wife, ashamed of her forgetfulness of her father in the
                        exultation over her wealth, ashamed of the elaborately fashionable mourning
                        she was wearingand of the black horse she had bought to match. She hoped he
                        would not observe these last flauntings of the purely formal character of a
                        grief that was being utilized to make a display of fashionableness.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You always bring out the best there is in me,&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>He stood silently before hernot in embarrassment, for he was rarely
                        self-conscious enough to be embar-rassed, but refraining from speech simply
                        because there was nothing to say.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t heard any of the details of the
                        election,&quot; she went on. &quot;Did you come out as well as you,
                        hoped?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Better,&quot; said he. &quot;As a result of the election
                        the membership of the League has already a little more than doubled. We
                        could have quadrupled it, but we are somewhat strict in our requirements. We
                        want only those who will stay members as long as they stay citizens of
                        Remsen City. But I must go on to Charlton or he&apos;ll be out on his
                        rounds.&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-355" n="351"/>
                    <p>She caught his glance, which was inclined to avoid hers. She gave him a
                        pleading look. &quot;I&apos;ll walk with you part of the
                        way,&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>He seemed to be searching for an excuse to get away. Whether because he
                        failed to find it or because he changed his mind, he said:
                        &quot;You&apos;ll not mind going at a good gait?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll ride,&quot; said she. &quot;It&apos;s not
                        comfortable, walking fast in these boots.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He stood by to help her, but let her get into the saddle alone. She smiled
                        down at him with a little coquetry. &quot;Are you afraid to touch
                        meto-day?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>He laughed: &quot;The bird is merely an excuse,&quot; he admitted.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve got back my self-control, and I purpose to keep
                        it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She flushed angrily. His frankness now seemed to her to be flavored with
                        impertinent assurance. &quot;That&apos;s amusing,&quot; said
                        she, with an unpleasant smile. &quot;You have an extraordinary opinion
                        of yourself, haven&apos;t you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He shrugged his shoulders as if the subject did not interest him and set off
                        at a gait that compelled her horse to a rapid walk. She said presently:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m going to live at the old place alone for the present.
                        You&apos;ll come to see me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her. &quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;As I told you a
                        moment ago, that&apos;s over. You&apos;ll have to find some one else
                        to amuse youfor, I understand perfectly, Jane, <pb id="VAA2368-356" n="352"
                        /> that you were only doing what&apos;s called flirting. That sort of
                        thing is a waste of timefor me. I&apos;m not competent to judge whether
                        it&apos;s a waste for you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She looked coldly down at him. &quot;You have changed since I last saw
                        you,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&apos;t mean the change in your
                        manner toward me. I mean something deeper. I&apos;ve often heard that
                        politics makes a man deteriorate. You must be careful, Victor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I must think about that,&quot; said he. &quot;Thank you for
                        warning me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>His prompt acceptance of her insincere criticism made her straightway
                        repentant. &quot;No, it&apos;s I that have changed,&quot; she
                        said. &quot;Oh, I&apos;m horrid!simply horrid. I&apos;m in
                        despair about myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Any one who thinks about himself is bound to be,&quot; said he
                        philosophically. &quot;That&apos;s why one has to keep busy in order
                        to keep contented.&quot; He halted. &quot;I can save a mile and half
                        an hour by crossing these fields.&quot; He held the wounded bird in one
                        hand very carefully while he lifted his hat.</p>
                    <p>She colored deeply. &quot;Victor,&quot; she said,
                        &quot;isn&apos;t there any way that you and I can be
                        friends?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied he. &quot;As I told you before, by
                        becoming one of us. Those are impossible terms, of course. But
                        that&apos;s the only way by which we could be of use to each other.
                        Jane, if I, professing what I do profess, offered to be friends with you on
                        any other terms, you&apos;d be very foolish not to reject my offer. For,
                        it would mean that I was a fraud. Don&apos;t you see that?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-357" n="[353]"/>
                    <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But when I am with you I see
                        everything exactly as you represent it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s fortunate for you that I&apos;m not disposed to
                        take advantage of thatisn&apos;t it?&quot; said he, with
                        good-humored irony.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You don&apos;t believe me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not altogether,&quot; he confessed. &quot;To be quite
                        candid, I think that for some reason or other I rouse in you an irresistible
                        desire to pose. I doubt if you realize itwholly. But you&apos;d be hard
                        pressed just where to draw the line between the sincere and the insincere,
                        wouldn&apos;t youhonestly?&quot;</p>
                    <p>She sat moodily combing at her horse&apos;s mane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I know it&apos;s cruel,&quot; he went on lightly,
                        &quot;to deny anything, however small, to a young lady who has always
                        had her own way. But in self-defense I must do It.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why <hi rend="i">do</hi> I take these things from you?&quot;
                        she cried, in sudden exasperation. And touching her horse with her stick,
                        she was off at a gallop.</p>

                    <p>From anger against Victor Dorn, Jane passed to anger against herself. This
                        was soon followed by a mood of self-denunciation, by astonishment at the
                        follies of which she had been guilty, by shame for them. She could not scoff
                        or scorn herself out of the infatuation. But at least she could control
                        herself against yielding to it. Recalling and reviewing all he had said,
                        shethat is, her vanitydecided that the most important remark, the only
                        really important remark, was his declaration of disbelief in her sincerity.
                        &quot;The reason he has repulsed meand a very good reason it isis that
                        he thinks I am simply amusing myself. If he thought I was in earnest, he
                        would act very differently. Very shrewd of him!&quot;</p>
                    <p>Did she believe this? Certainly not. But she convinced herself that she
                        believed it, and so saved her pride. From this point she proceeded by easy
                        stages to doubting whether, if Victor had taken her at her word, she would
                        have married him. And soon she had convinced herself that she had gone so
                        far only through her passion for conquest, that at the first sign of his
                        yielding her good sense would have asserted itself and she could have
                        retreated.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He knew me better than I knew myself,&quot; said she <pb
                            id="VAA2368-359" n="355"/> not so thoroughly convinced as her pride
                        would have liked, but far better content with herself than in those unhappy
                        hours of humiliation after her last talk with him.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning of her infatuation there had been only a few days, hardly
                        more than a few hours, when the voice of prudence and good sense had been
                        silenced. Yes, he was right; they were not suited to each other, and a
                        marriage between them would have been absurd. He did belong to a different,
                        to a lower class, and he could never have understood her. Refinement, taste,
                        the things of the life of luxury and leisure were incomprehensible to him.
                        It might be unjust that the many had to toil in squalor and sordidness while
                        the few were privileged to cultivate and to enjoy the graces and the
                        beauties; but, unjust or in some mysterious way just, there was the fact.
                        Her life was marked out for her; she was of the elect. She would do well to
                        accept her good fortune and live as the gods had ordained for her.</p>
                    <p>If Victor had been different in that one respect! ... The infatuation, too,
                        was a fact. The wise course was flightand she fled.</p>
                    <p>That winter, in Chicago and in New York, Jane amused herselfin the ways
                        devised by latter day impatience with the folly of wasting a precious part
                        of the one brief life in useless grief or pretense of grief. In Remsen City
                        she would have had to be very quiet indeed, under penalty of horrifying
                        public sentiment. But <pb id="VAA2368-360" n="356"/> Chicago and New York
                        knew nothing of her grief, cared nothing about grief of any kind. People in
                        deep mourning were found in the theaters, in the gay restaurants, wherever
                        any enjoyment was to be had; and very sensible it was of them, and proof of
                        the sincerity of their sorrowfor sincere sorrow seeks consolation lest it go
                        mad and commit suicidedoes it not?</p>
                    <p>Jane, young, beautiful, rich, clever, had a very good time indeedso good that
                        in the spring, instead of going back to Remsen City to rest, she went
                        abroad. More enjoymentor, at least, more of the things that fill in the time
                        and spare one the necessity of thinking.</p>
                    <p>In August she suddenly left her friends at St. Moritz and journeyed back to
                        Remsen City as fast as train and boat and train could take her. And on the
                        front veranda of the old house she sat herself down and looked out over the
                        familiar landscape and listened to the katydids lulling the woods and the
                        fields, and was bored and wondered why she had come.</p>
                    <p>In a reckless mood she went down to see Victor Dorn. &quot;I am
                        cured,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I must be cured. I simply
                        can&apos;t be small and silly enough to care for a country town labor
                        agitator after all I&apos;ve been throughafter the attentions
                        I&apos;ve had and the men of the world I&apos;ve met. I&apos;m
                        cured, and I must prove it to myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In the side yard Alice Sherrill and her children and several neighbor girls
                        were putting up pears and <pb id="VAA2368-361" n="357"/> peaches,
                        blackberries and plums. The air was heavy with delicious odors of ripe and
                        perfect fruit, and the laughter, the bright healthy faces, the strong
                        graceful bodies in all manner of poses at the work required made a scene
                        that brought tears to Jane&apos;s eyes. Why tears she could not have
                        explained, but there they were. At far end of the arbor, looking exactly as
                        he had in the same place the year before, sat Victor Dorn, writing. He
                        glanced up, saw her! Into his face came a look of welcome that warmed her
                        chilled heart.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hel-<hi rend="i">lo!</hi>&quot; he cried, starting up.
                        &quot;I <hi rend="i">am</hi> glad to see you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m mighty glad to be back,&quot; said she, lapsing
                        with keen pleasure into her native dialect.</p>
                    <p>He took both her hands and shook them cordially, then looked at her from head
                        to foot admiringly. &quot;The latest from the Rue de la Paix, I
                        suppose?&quot; said he.</p>
                    <p>They seated themselves with the table between them. She, under cover of
                        commonplaces about her travels, examined him with the utmost calmness. She
                        saw every point wherein he fell short of the men of her classthe sort of men
                        she ought to like and admire. But, oh, how dull and stale and narrow and
                        petty they were, beside this man. She knew now why she had fled. She
                        didn&apos;t want to love Victor Dorn, or to marry himor his sort of man.
                        But he, his intense aliveness, his keen, supple mind, had spoiled her for
                        those others. One of them she could not marry. &quot;I should go mad
                        with boredom. One can no more live intimately with fashion than <pb
                            id="VAA2368-362" n="358"/> one can eat gold and drink diamonds. And, oh,
                        but I am hungry and thirsty!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;So you&apos;ve had a good time?&quot; he was saying.</p>
                    <p>Superb,&quot; replied she. &quot;Such scenerysuch variety of people.
                        I love Europe. ButI&apos;m glad to be home again.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how you can stand it,&quot; said Victor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why?&quot; inquired she in surprise.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Unless I had an intense personal interest in the most active kind
                        of life in a place like this, I should either fly or take to
                        drink,&quot; replied he. &quot;In this world you&apos;ve either
                        got to invent occupation for yourself or else keep where amusements and
                        distractions are thrust at you from rising till bed-time. And no amusements
                        are thrust at you in Remsen City.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;ve been trying the life of being amused,&quot;
                        said Jane, &quot;and I&apos;ve got enough.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;For the moment,&quot; said Victor, laughing.
                        &quot;You&apos;ll go back. You&apos;ve got to. What else is
                        there for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her eyes abruptly became serious. &quot;That&apos;s what
                        I&apos;ve come home to find out,&quot; said she. Hesitatingly,
                        &quot;That&apos;s why I&apos;ve come here to-day.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He became ouriously quietstared at the writing before him on the table. After
                        a while he said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jane, I was entirely too glad to see you to-day. I had&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t say that,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;Victor,
                        it isn&apos;t a weakness&quot;</p>
                    <p>His hand resting upon the table clenched into a fist <pb id="VAA2368-363"
                            n="359"/> and his brows drew down. &quot;There can be no question
                        but that it is a weakness and a folly,&quot; he pushed on. &quot;I
                        will not spoil your life and mine. You are not for me, and I am not for you.
                        The reason we hang on to this is because each of us has a streak of
                        tenacity. We don&apos;t want each other, but we are so made that we
                        can&apos;t let go of an idea once it has gotten into our
                        heads.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;There is another reason,&quot; she said gently. &quot;We
                        are, both of us, aloneand lonesome, Victor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I&apos;m not alone. I&apos;m not lonesome&quot; And
                        there he abruptly halted, to gaze at her with the expression of awakening
                        and astonishment. &quot;I believe I&apos;m wrong. I believe
                        you&apos;re right,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I had never thought
                        of that before.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been imagining your work, your cause was
                        enough,&quot; she went on in a quiet rational way that was a
                        revelationand a self-revelationof the real Jane Hastings. &quot;But it
                        isn&apos;t. There&apos;s a whole other side of your naturethethethe
                        private sidethat&apos;s the expressionthe private side. And
                        you&apos;ve been denying to it its rights.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He reflected, nodded slowly. &quot;I believe that&apos;s the
                        truth,&quot; he said. &quot;It explains a curious feeling
                        I&apos;ve had a sort of shriveling sensation.&quot; He gazed
                        thoughtfully at her, his face gradually relaxing into a merry smile.</p>
                    <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; asked she, smiling in turn.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We&apos;ve both got to fall in love and marry,&quot; said
                        he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Not with each other, of coursefor we&apos;re not in any <pb
                            id="VAA2368-364" n="360"/> way mated. But love and marriage and the rest
                        of it that&apos;s the solution. I don&apos;t need it quite as much
                        as you do, for I&apos;ve got my work. But I need it. Now that I see
                        things in the right light I wonder that I&apos;ve been so stupidly
                        blind. Why do we human beings always overlook the obvious?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t easy to marry,&quot; said Jane, rather
                        drearily.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t easy to find some one with whom one would be
                        willing to pass one&apos;s life. I&apos;ve had several chances one
                        or two of them not entirely mercenary, I think. But not one that I could
                        bring myself to accept.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Vanityvanity,&quot; said Victor. &quot;Almost any human
                        being is interesting and attractive if one will stop thinking about oneself
                        and concentrate on him or her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She smiled. &quot;It&apos;s evident you&apos;ve never tried to
                        fall in love.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The nearest I ever came to it was with you,&quot; replied he.
                        &quot;But that was, of course, out of the question.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t admit that,&quot; said she, with an amusing
                        kind of timid obstinacy.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let&apos;s be honest and natural with each other,&quot;
                        urged he. &quot;Now, Jane, admit that in your heart of hearts you feel
                        you ought not to marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Her glance avoided his.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Comeown up!&quot; cried he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I have thought of that side of it,&quot; she conceded.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And if I hadn&apos;t piqued you by thinking of it, too,
                        you&apos;d never have lingered on any other side of it,&quot; said
                        he. &quot;Well! Now that we&apos;ve cleared the ground <pb
                            id="VAA2368-365" n="361"/> there&apos;s Davy. He&apos;s to be
                        nominated by the Republicans for Governor next week.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Davy? I had almost forgotten him. I&apos;ll think of Davyand
                        let you know ... And you? Who is there for you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Ohno one you know. My sister has recommended several girls from
                        time to time. I&apos;ll see.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane gave the freest and heartiest laugh that had passed her lips in more
                        than a year. It was thus free and unrestrained because he had not said what
                        she was fearing he would sayhad not suggested the woman nearest him, the
                        obvious woman. So eager was she to discover what he thought of Selma, that
                        she could hardly restrain herself from suggesting her. Before they could say
                        anything more, two men came to talk with him. Jane could not but leave.</p>
                    <p>She dined that night at Mrs. Sherlock&apos;sMrs. Sherlock was
                        Davy&apos;s oldest sister. Davy took her in, they talkedabout his
                        careerthrough dinner, and he walked home with her in the moonlight. He was
                        full of his approaching nomination. He had been making what is known as a
                        good record, as mayor. That is, he had struck out boldly at sundry petty
                        abuses practised by a low and comparatively uninfluential class of
                        exploiters of the people. He had been so busy with these showy trifles that
                        there had been no time for the large abuses. True, he had publicly warned
                        the gas company about its poor gas, and the water company about its
                        unwholesome water for the low-lying tenement districts, <pb id="VAA2368-366"
                            n="362"/> and the traction company about the fewness and filthiness of
                        its cars. The gas company had talked of putting in improved machinery; the
                        water company had invited estimates on a filtration plant; the traction
                        company had said a vague something about new cars as soon as car
                        manufacturers could make definite promises as to delivery. But nothing had
                        been doneas yet. Obviously a corporation, a large investment of capital,
                        must be treated with consideration. It would not do for a conservative, fair
                        minded mayor to rush into demagogery. So, Davy was content to point proudly
                        to his record of having &quot;made the big corporations awaken to a
                        sense of their duty.&quot; An excellent record, as good as a reform
                        politician, with a larger career in prospect, could be expected to make.
                        People spoke well of Mayor Hull and the three daily papers eulogized him.
                        Davy no longer had qualms of conscience. He read the eulogies, he listened
                        to the flatteries of the conservative leading citizens he met at the Lincoln
                        and at the University, and he felt that he was all that he in young
                        enthusiasm had set out to be.</p>
                    <p>When he went to other cities and towns and to county fairs to make addresses
                        he was introduced as the man who had redeemed Remsen City, as a shining
                        example of the honest <hi rend="i">sane</hi> man in politics, as a man the
                        bosses were afraid of, yet dared not try to down. &quot;You
                        can&apos;t fool the people.&quot; And were not the people, notably
                        those who didn&apos;t live in Remsen City and had only read in their
                        newspapers about the reform Republican mayor <pb id="VAA2368-367" n="363"/>
                        weren&apos;t they clamorous for Mayor Hull for governor! Thus, Davy was
                        high in his own esteem, was in that mood of profound responsibility to
                        righteousness and to the people wherein a man can get the enthusiastic
                        endorsement of his conscience for any act he deems it expedient to commit in
                        safeguarding and advancing his career. His person had become valuable to his
                        country. His opponents were therefore anathema maranatha.</p>
                    <p>As he and Jane walked side by side in the tender moonlight, Jane said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s become of Selma Gordon?&quot;</p>
                    <p>A painful pause; then Davy, in a tone that secretly amused Jane:
                        &quot;Selma? I see her occasionallyat a distance. She still writes for
                        Victor Dorn&apos;s sheet, I believe. I never see it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane felt she could easily guess why. &quot;Yesit is irritating to read
                        criticisms of oneself,&quot; said she sweetly. Davy&apos;s
                        self-complacence had been most trying to her nerves.</p>
                    <p>Another long silence, then he said: &quot;AboutMiss Gordon. I suppose you
                        were thinking of the things I confided to you last year?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, I was,&quot; confessed Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s all over,&quot; said Mayor and prospective
                        Governor Hull. &quot;I found I was mistaken in her.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you tell me that she refused you?&quot; pressed
                        Jane, most unkindly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;We met again after that,&quot; said Davyby way of proving that
                        even the most devoted apostle of civic <pb id="VAA2368-368" n="364"/>
                        righteousness is yet not without his share of the common humanity,
                        &quot;and from that time I felt differently toward her. ...
                        I&apos;ve never been able to understand my folly. ... I wonder if you
                        could forgive me for it?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Davy was a good deal of a bore, she felt. At least, he seemed so in this
                        first renewing of old acquaintance. But he was a man of purpose, a man who
                        was doing much and would do more. And she liked him, and had for him that
                        feeling of sympathy and comprehension which exists among people of the same
                        region, brought up in much the same way. Instead of cutting him off, she
                        temporized. Said she with a serenely careless laugh that might have let a
                        man more expert in the ways of women into the secret of how little she cared
                        about him: &quot;You mean forgive you for dropping me so abruptly and
                        running after her?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s not exactly the way to put it,&quot; objected
                        he.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Put it any way you like,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I forgive
                        you. I didn&apos;t care at the time, and I don&apos;t care
                        now.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was looking entrancing in that delicate light. Davy was notingwas
                        feelingthis. Also, he was reflectingin a high-minded wayupon the many
                        material, mental and spiritual advantages of a marriage with her. Just the
                        woman to be a governor&apos;s wife a senator&apos;s wifea
                        president&apos;s wife. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Jane, my feeling for you has never changed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Really?&quot; said Jane. &quot;Why, I thought you told me
                        at one time that you were in love with me?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-369" n="365"/>
                    <p>&quot;And I always have been, dearand am,&quot; said Davy, in his
                        deepest, tenderest tones. &quot;And now that I am winning a position
                        worthy of you&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see,&quot; cut in Jane. &quot;Let&apos;s
                        not talk about it tonight.&quot; She felt that if he kept on she might
                        yield to the temptation to say something mocking, something she would regret
                        if it drove him away finally.</p>
                    <p>He was content. The ice had been broken. The Selma Gordon business had been
                        disposed of. The way was clear for straight-away love-making the next time
                        they met. Meanwhile he would think about her, would get steam up, would have
                        his heart blazing and his words and phrases all in readiness.</p>
                    <p>Every human being has his or her fundamental vanity that must be kept alive,
                        if life is to be or to seem to be worth living. In man this vanity is
                        usually some form of belief in his mental ability, in woman some form of
                        belief in her physical charm. Fortunatelyor, rather, necessarilynot much is
                        required to keep this vanity aliveor to restore it after a shock, however
                        severe. Victor Dorn had been compelled to give Jane Hastings&apos;
                        vanity no slight shock. But it recovered at once. Jane saw that his failure
                        to yield was due not to lack of potency in her charms, but to extraordinary
                        strength of purpose in his character. Thus, not only was she able to save
                        herself from any sense of humiliation, but also she was without any feeling
                        of resentment against him. She liked him and <pb id="VAA2368-370" n="366"/>
                        admired him more than ever. She saw his point of view; she admitted that he
                        was right<hi rend="i">if</hi> it were granted that a life such as he had
                        mapped for himself was better for him than the career he could have made
                        with her help.</p>
                    <p>Her heart, however, was hastily, even rudely thrust to the background when
                        she discovered that her brother had been gambling in wheat with practically
                        her entire fortune. With an adroitness that irritated her against herself,
                        as she looked back, he had continued to induce her to disregard their
                        father&apos;s cautionings and to ask him to take full charge of her
                        affairs. He had not lost her fortune, but he had almost lost it. But for an
                        accidental stroke, a week of weather destructive to crops all over the
                        country, she would have been reduced to an income of not more than ten or
                        fifteen thousand a yeartwenty times the income of the average American
                        family of five, but for Miss Hastings straitened subsistence and a miserable
                        state of shornness of all the radiance of life. And, pushing her inquiries a
                        little farther, she learned that her brother would still have been rich,
                        because he had taken care to settle a large sum on his wifein such a way
                        that if she divorced him it would pass back to him.</p>
                    <p>In the course of her arrangings to meet this situation and to prevent its
                        recurrence she saw much of Doctor Charlton. He gave her excellent advice and
                        found for her a man to take charge of her affairs so far as <pb
                            id="VAA2368-371" n="367"/> it was wise for her to trust any one. The man
                        was a bank cashier, Robert Headley by nameone of those rare beings who care
                        nothing for riches for themselves and cannot invest their own money wisely,
                        but have a genius for fidelity and wise counsel.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a pity he&apos;s married,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;If he weren&apos;t I&apos;d urge you to take him
                        as a husband.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane laughed. A plainer, duller man than Headley it would have been hard to
                        find, even among the respectabilities of Remsen City.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Why do you laugh?&quot; said Charlton. &quot;What is there
                        absurd in a sensible marriage?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Would you marry a woman because she was a good
                        housekeeper?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That would be one of the requirements,&quot; said Charlton.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve sense enough to know that, no matter how much I
                        liked a woman before marriage, it couldn&apos;t last long if she were
                        incompetent. She&apos;d irritate me every moment in the day.
                        I&apos;d lie awake of nights despising her. And how she would hate
                        me!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t imagine you a husband,&quot; laughed Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;That doesn&apos;t speak well for your imagination,&quot;
                        rejoined Charlton. &quot;I have perfect healthwhich means that I have a
                        perfect disposition, for only people with deranged interiors are sour and
                        snappy and moody. And I am sympathetic and understanding. I appreciate that
                        women are rottenly brought up and have everything to learneverything
                        that&apos;s worth while if one is to live comfortably and growingly. So,
                        I <pb id="VAA2368-372" n="368"/> shouldn&apos;t expect much at the
                        outset beyond a desire to improve and a capacity to improve. Yes,
                        I&apos;ve about all the virtues for a model husbanda companionable,
                        helpful mate for a woman who wants to be more of a person every day she
                        lives.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. thanks,&quot; said Jane, mockingly. &quot;The
                        advertisement reads well, but I don&apos;t care to invest.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, I looked you over long ago,&quot; said Charlton with a
                        coolness that both amused and exasperated her. &quot;You
                        wouldn&apos;t do at all. You are very attractive to look at and to talk
                        with. Your money would be useful to some plans I&apos;ve got for some
                        big sanatoriums along the line of Schulze&apos;s up at Saint
                        Christopher. But&quot; He shook his head, smiling at her through a cloud
                        of cigarette smoke.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Go on,&quot; urged Jane. &quot;What&apos;s wrong with
                        me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve been miseducated too far and too deeply. You <hi
                            rend="i">know</hi> too much that isn&apos;t so. You&apos;ve got
                        the upper class American woman habit of thinking about yourself all the
                        time. You are an indifferent housekeeper, and you think you are good at it.
                        You don&apos;t know the practical side of lifecooking, sewing, house
                        furnishing, marketing. You&apos;re ambitious for a show careerthe sort
                        Davy Hullexcuse me, Governor David Hullis making so noisily.
                        There&apos;s just the man for you. You ought to marry. Marry
                        Hull.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane was furiously angry. She did not dare show it; Charlton would merely
                        laugh and walk away, and perhaps refuse to be friends with her. It
                        exasperated <pb id="VAA2368-373" n="369"/> her to the core, the narrow
                        limitations of the power of money. She could, through the power of her
                        money, do exactly as she pleased to and with everybody except the only kind
                        of people she cared about dominating; these she was apparently the less
                        potent with because of her money. It seemed to put them on their mettle and
                        on their guard.</p>
                    <p>She swallowed her anger. &quot;Yes, I&apos;ve got to get
                        married,&quot; said she. &quot;And I don&apos;t know what to do
                        about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Hull,&quot; said Charlton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is that the best advice you can give?&quot; said she
                        disdainfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;He needs you, and you need him. You like him don&apos;t
                        you?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very much.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Thenthe thing&apos;s done. Davy isn&apos;t the man to fail
                        to seize an opportunity so obviously to his advantage. Not that he
                        hasn&apos;t a heart. He has a big onedoes all sorts of gracious,
                        patronizing, kind thingsdoes no end of harm. But he&apos;d no more let
                        his emotions rule his life thanthanVictor Dornor I, for that
                        matter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane colored; a pathetic sadness tinged the far-away expression of her eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;No doubt he&apos;s half in love with you already. Most men are
                        who know you. A kindly smile and he&apos;ll be kneeling.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t want David Hull,&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;Ever since <pb id="VAA2368-374" n="370"/> I can remember
                        they&apos;ve been at me to marry him. He bores me. He doesn&apos;t
                        make me respect him. He never could control meor teach meor make me look up
                        to him in any way. I don&apos;t want him, and I won&apos;t have
                        him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid you&apos;ve got to do it,&quot; said
                        Charlton. &quot;You act as if you realized it and were struggling and
                        screaming against manifest destiny like a child against a determined
                        mother.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane&apos;s eyes had a look of terror. &quot;You are
                        joking,&quot; said she. &quot;But it frightens me, just the
                        same.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I am not joking,&quot; replied he. &quot;I can hear the
                        wedding bellsand so can you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t!&quot; pleaded Jane. &quot;I&apos;ve so
                        much confidence in your insight that I can&apos;t bear to hear you
                        saying such things even to tease me. ... Why haven&apos;t you told me
                        about these sanatoriums you want?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Because I&apos;ve been hoping I could devise some way of
                        getting them without the use of money. Did it ever occur to you that almost
                        nothing that&apos;s been of real and permanent value to the world was
                        built with money? The things that money has done have always been badly
                        done.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Let me help you,&quot; said Jane earnestly. &quot;Give me
                        something to do. Teach me how to do something. I am <hi rend="i">so</hi>
                        bored!and so eager to have an occupation. I simply can&apos;t lead the
                        life of my class.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You want to be a lady patronessa lady philanthropist,&quot; <pb
                            id="VAA2368-375" n="371"/> said Charlton, not greatly impressed by her
                        despair. &quot;That&apos;s only another form of the life of your
                        classand a most offensive form.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Your own termsyour own terms, absolutely,&quot; cried Jane in
                        desperation.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nomarry Hull and go into upper and middle class politics.
                        You&apos;ll be a lady senator or a lady ambassador or cabinet officer,
                        at least.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I will not marry David Hullor anybody, just yet,&quot; cried
                        Jane. &quot;Why should I? I&apos;ve still got ten years where
                        there&apos;s a chance of my being able to attract some man who attracts
                        me. And after that I can buy as good a husband as any that offers now.
                        Doctor Charlton, I&apos;m in desperate, deadly earnest. And I ask you to
                        help me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;My own terms?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I give you my word.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll have to give your money outright. No strings
                        attached. No chance to be a philanthropist. Also, you&apos;ll have to
                        workhave to educate yourself as I instruct you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yesyes. Whatever you say.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton looked at her dubiously. &quot;I&apos;m a fool to have
                        anything to do with this,&quot; he said. &quot;You aren&apos;t
                        in any way a suitable personany more than I&apos;m the sort of man you
                        want to assist you in your schemes. You don&apos;t realize what tests
                        you&apos;re to be put through.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t care,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s a chance to try my theory,&quot; mused he.
                        &quot;You <pb id="VAA2368-376" n="372"/> know, I insist we are all
                        absolutely the creatures of circumstancethat character adapts itself to
                        circumstancethat to change a man or a town or a nationor a worldyou have
                        only to change their fundamental circumstances.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ll try me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll think about it,&quot; said Charlton.
                        &quot;I&apos;ll talk with Victor Dorn about it.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Whatever you do, don&apos;t talk to him,&quot; cried Jane,
                        in terror. &quot;He has no faith in me&quot; She checked herself,
                        hastily added&quot;in anybody outside his own class.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never do anything serious without consulting Victor,&quot;
                        said Charlton firmly. &quot;He&apos;s got the best mind of any one I
                        know, and it is foolish to act without taking counsel of the best.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He&apos;ll advise against it,&quot; said Jane bitterly.</p>
                    <p>&quot;But I may not take his advice literally,&quot; said Charlton.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not in mental slavery to him. I often adapt his
                        advice to my needs instead of adopting it outright.&quot;</p>
                    <p>And with that she had to be content.</p>
                    <p>She passed a day and night of restlessness, and called him on the telephone
                        early the following morning. As she heard his voice she said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did you see Victor Dorn last night?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where are you?&quot; asked Charlton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In my room,&quot; was her impatient answer.</p>
                    <p>&quot;In bed?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-377" n="373"/>
                    <p>&quot;I haven&apos;t gotten up yet,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;What <hi rend="i">is</hi> the matter?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Had your breakfast?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. I&apos;ve rung for it. It&apos;ll be here in a few
                        minutes.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; said Charlton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;This is very mysteriousor very absurd,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Please ring off and call your kitchen and tell them to put your
                        breakfast on the dining-room table for you in three-quarters of an hour.
                        Then get up, take your bath and your exercisesdress yourself for the dayand
                        go down and eat your breakfast. How can you hope to amount to anything
                        unless you live by a rational system? And how can you have a rational system
                        unless you begin the day right?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Did</hi> you see Victor Dorn?&quot; said
                        Janefurious at his impertinence but restraining herself.</p>
                    <p>&quot;And after you have breakfasted,&quot; continued Charlton,
                        &quot;call me up again, and I&apos;ll answer your
                        questions.&quot;</p>
                    <p>With that he hung up his receiver. Jane threw herself angrily back against
                        her pillow. She would lie there for an hour, then call him again. Butif he
                        should ask her whether she had obeyed his orders? True, she might lie to
                        him; but wouldn&apos;t that be too petty? She debated with herself for a
                        few minutes, then obeyed him to the letter. As she was coming through the
                        front hall after breakfast, he appeared in the doorway.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-378" n="374"/>
                    <p>&quot;You didn&apos;t trust me!&quot; she cried reproachfully.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied he. &quot;But I preferred to talk
                        with you face to face.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Did</hi> you see Mr. Dorn?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton nodded. &quot;He refused to advise me. He said he had a personal
                        prejudice in your favor that would make his advice worthless.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Jane glowedbut not quite so thrillingly as she would have glowed in the same
                        circumstances a year before.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Besides, he&apos;s in no state of mind to advise anybody about
                        anything just now,&quot; said Charlton.</p>
                    <p>Jane glanced sharply at him. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she said.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s not my secret,&quot; replied Charlton.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You mean he has fallen in love?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;That&apos;s shrewd,&quot; said Charlton. &quot;But
                        women always assume a love affair.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;With whom?&quot; persisted Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Oh, a very nice girl. No matter. I&apos;m not here to talk
                        about anybody&apos;s affairs but yoursand mine.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Answer just one question,&quot; said Jane, impulsively.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Did he tell you anything aboutme?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton staredthen whistled. &quot;Are <hi rend="i">you</hi> in love
                        with him, too?&quot; he cried.</p>
                    <p>Jane flushedhesitatedthen met his glance frankly. &quot;I <hi rend="i"
                            >was,</hi>&quot; said she.</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Was?</hi>&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-379" n="375"/>
                    <p>&quot;I mean that I&apos;m over it,&quot; said she.
                        &quot;What have you decided to do about me?&quot;</p>
                    <p>Charlton did not answer immediately. He eyed her narrowlyan examination which
                        she withstood well. Then he glanced away and seemed to be reflecting.
                        Finally he came back to her question. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;To give you a trial. To find out whether you&apos;ll
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She drew a long sigh of relief.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Didn&apos;t you guess?&quot; he went on, smilingly, nodding
                        his round, prize-fighter head at her. &quot;Those suggestions about bed
                        and breakfastthey were by way of a beginning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You must give me a lot to do,&quot; urged she. &quot;I
                        mustn&apos;t have a minute of idle time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He laughed. &quot;Trust me,&quot; he said.</p>
                    <p>While Jane was rescuing her property from her brother and was safeguarding it
                        against future attempts by him, or by any of that numerous company whose
                        eyes are ever roving in search of the most inviting of prey, the lone women
                        with baggagewhile Jane was thus occupied, David Hull was, if possible, even
                        busier and more absorbed. He was being elected governor. His State was being
                        got ready to say to the mayor of Remsen City, &quot;Well done, good and
                        faithful servant. Thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will make
                        thee ruler over many.&quot;</p>
                    <p>The nomination was not obtained for him without <pb id="VAA2368-380" n="376"
                        /> difficulty. The Republican partylike the Democratichad just been brought
                        back under &quot;safe and sane and conservative&quot; leadership
                        after a prolonged debauch under the influence of that once famous and
                        revered reformer, Aaron Whitman, who had not sobered up or released the
                        party for its sobering until his wife&apos;s extravagant entertaining at
                        Washington had forced him to accept large &quot;retainers&quot; from
                        the plutocracy. The machine leaders had in the beginning forwarded the
                        ambitions of Whitman under the impression that his talk of a
                        &quot;square deal&quot; was &quot;just the usual dope&quot;
                        and that Aaron was a &quot;level-headed fellow at bottom.&quot; It
                        had developedafter they had let Aaron become a popular idol, not to be
                        trifled withit had developed that he was almost sincereas sincere as can be
                        expected of an ambitious, pushing fellow. Now came David Hull, looking
                        suspiciously like Whitman at his worstand a more hopeless case, because he
                        had money a plenty, while Whitman was luckily poor and blessed with an
                        extravagant wife. True, Hull had the backing of Dick Kellyand Kelly was not
                        the man &quot;to hand the boys a lemon.&quot; Still Hull looked like
                        a &quot;holy boy,&quot; talked like one, had the popular reputation
                        of having acted like one as mayorand the &quot;reform game&quot; was
                        certainly one to attract a man who could afford it and was in politics for
                        position only. Perhaps Dick wanted to be rid of Hull for the rest of his
                        term, and was &quot;kicking him upstairs.&quot; It would be a shabby
                        trick upon his fellow leaders, but justifiable if there should be some big
                            <pb id="VAA2368-381" n="377"/> &quot;job&quot; at Remsen City
                        that could be &quot;pulled off&quot; only if Hull were out of the
                        way.</p>
                    <p>The leaders were cold until Dick got his masters in the Remsen City branch of
                        the plutocracy to pass the word to the plutocracy&apos;s general agents
                        at Indianapolisa certain well-known firm of political bankers. Until that
                        certification came the leaders, having no candidate who stood a chance of
                        winning, were ready to make a losing campaign and throw the election to the
                        Democratsnot a serious misfortune at a time when the machines of the two
                        parties had become simply friendly rival agents for the same rich master.</p>
                    <p>There was a sharp fight in the convention. The anti-machine element,
                        repudiating Whitman under the leadership of a shrewd and honest young man
                        named Joe Bannister, had attacked Hull in the most shocking way. Bannister
                        had been reading Victor Dorn&apos;s <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> and had
                        got a notion of David Hull as man and mayor different from the one made
                        current by the newspapers. He made a speech on the floor of the convention
                        which almost caused a riot and nearly cost Davy the nomination. That
                        catastrophe was averted by adjournment. Davy gave Dick Kelly&apos;s
                        second lieutenant, Osterman, ten thousand in cash, of which Osterman said
                        there was pressing need &quot;for perfectly legitimate purposes, I
                        assure you, Mr. Mayor.&quot; Next day the Bannister faction lost forty
                        and odd sturdy yeomen from districts where the crops had been painfully
                        short, and Davy was nominated,</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-382" n="378"/>
                    <p>In due time the election was held, and Mayor Hull became Governor Hull by a
                        satisfactory majority for so evenly divided a State. He had spentin
                        contributions to the machine campaign fundupwards of one hundred thousand
                        dollars. But that seemed a trifling sacrifice to make for reform principles
                        and for keeping the voice of the people the voice of God. He would have been
                        elected if he had not spent a cent, for the Democratic machine, bent on
                        reorganizing back to a sound basis with all real reformers or reformers
                        tainted with sincerity eliminated, had nominated a straight machine manand
                        even the politicians know that the people who decide elections will not
                        elect a machine man if they have a chance to vote for any one else. It
                        saddened David Hull, in the midst of victory, that his own town and county
                        went against him, preferring the Democrat, whom it did not know, as he lived
                        at the other end of the State. Locally the offices at stake were all
                        captured by the &quot;Dorn crowd.&quot; At last the
                        Workingmen&apos;s League had a judge; at last it could have a day in
                        court. There would not be a repetition of the great frauds of the
                        Hull-Harbinger campaign.</p>
                    <p>By the time David had sufficient leisure to reopen the heart department of
                        his ambition. Jane was deep in the effort to show Doctor Charlton how much
                        intelligence and character she had. She was serving an apprenticeship as
                        trained nurse in the Children&apos;s Hospital, where he was chief of the
                        staff, and was taking several extra <pb id="VAA2368-383" n="379"/> courses
                        with his young assistants. It was nearly two weeks after David&apos;s
                        first attempt to see her when her engagements and his at last permitted this
                        meeting. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;What&apos;s this new freak?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell you yet,&quot; replied she.
                        &quot;I&apos;m not sure, myself.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I don&apos;t see how you can endure that fellow Charlton. They
                        say he&apos;s as big a crank in medicine as he is in politics.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s all of a piece,&quot; said Jane, tranquilly.
                        &quot;He says he gets his political views from his medicine and his
                        medical ideas from his politics.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Don&apos;t you think he&apos;s a frightful
                        bounder?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Frightful,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Fresh, impudentconceited. And he looks like a prize
                        fighter.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;At some anglesyes,&quot; conceded Jane. &quot;At others,
                        he&apos;s almost handsome.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The other day, when I called at the hospital and they
                        wouldn&apos;t take my name in to you&quot; David broke off to vent
                        his indignation&quot;Did you ever hear of such impertinence!&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;And you the governor-elect,&quot; laughed Jane. &quot;Shall
                        I tell you what Doctor Charlton said? He said that a governor was simply a
                        public servant, and anything but a public representativeusually a public
                        disgrace. He said that a servant&apos;s business was attending to his
                        own job and not hanging round <pb id="VAA2368-384" n="380"/> preventing his
                        fellow servants from attending to their jobs.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I knew he had low and vulgar views of public affairs,&quot;
                        said David. &quot;What I started to say was that I saw him talking to
                        you that day, across the court, and you seemed to be enjoying his
                        conversation.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;<hi rend="i">Enjoying</hi> it? I love it,&quot; cried Jane.
                        &quot;He makes me laugh, he makes me cold with rage, he gives me a
                        different sensation every time I see him.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You <hi rend="i">like</hi>him?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Immensely. And I&apos;ve never been so interested or so happy
                        in my life.&quot; She looked steadily at him. &quot;Nothing could
                        induce me to give it up. I&apos;ve put everything else out of my
                        mind.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Since the dismal end of his adventure with Selma Gordon, David had become
                        extremely wary in his dealings with the female sex. He never again would
                        invite a refusal; he never again would put himself in a position where a
                        woman might feel free to tell him her private opinion of him. He reflected
                        upon Jane&apos;s words. They could have but the one meaning. Not so
                        calmly as he would have liked, but without any embarrassing constraint, he
                        said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;ve found what suits you, at last. It
                        isn&apos;t exactly the line I&apos;d have thought a girl such as you
                        would choose. You&apos;re sure you are not making a mistake?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Quite,&quot; said Jane.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I should think you&apos;d prefer marriageand a home <pb
                            id="VAA2368-385" n="381"/> and a social circleand all that,&quot;
                        ventured David. &quot;I&apos;ll probably not marry.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;No. You&apos;d hardly take a doctor.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;The only one I&apos;d want I can&apos;t get,&quot; said
                        Jane.</p>
                    <p>She wished to shock David, and she saw with pleasure that she had succeeded.
                        Indeed so shocked was he that in a few minutes he took leave. And as he
                        passed from her sight he passed from her mind.</p>
                    <p>Victor Dorn described Davy Hull&apos;s inaugural address as &quot;an
                        uninteresting sample of the standard reform brand of artificial milk for
                        political infants.&quot; The press, however, was enthusiastic, and
                        substantial people everywhere spoke of it as having the &quot;right
                        ring,&quot; as being the utterance of a &quot;safe, clean man whom
                        the politicians can&apos;t frighten or fool.&quot; In this famous
                        speech David urged everybody who was doing right to keep on doing so, warned
                        everybody who was doing wrong that they would better look out for
                        themselves, praised those who were trying to better conditions in the right
                        way, condemned those who were trying to do so in the wrong way. It was all
                        most eloquent, most earnest. Some few people were disappointed that he had
                        not explained exactly what and whom he meant by right and by wrong; but
                        these earping murmurs were drowned in the general acclaim. A man whose fists
                        clenched and whose eyes flashed as did David Hull&apos;s must
                        &quot;mean business&quot;and if no results came of these <pb
                            id="VAA2368-386" n="382"/> words, it wouldn&apos;t be his fault, but
                        the machinations of wicked plutocrats and their political agents.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t it disgusting!&quot; exclaimed Selma, reading an
                        impassioned paragraph aloud to Victor Dorn. &quot;It almost makes me
                        despair when I see how peopleour sort of people, tooare taken in by such
                        guff. And they stand with their empty picked pockets and cheer this man,
                        who&apos;s nothing but a stool pigeon for pickpockets.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;s something gained,&quot; observed Victor
                        tranquilly, &quot;when politicians have to denounce the plutocracy in
                        order to get audiences and offices. The people are beginning to know
                        what&apos;s wrong. They read into our friend Hull&apos;s
                        generalities what they think he ought to meanwhat they believe he does mean.
                        The next step ishe&apos;ll have to do something or they&apos;ll find
                        him out.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;He do anything?&quot; Selma laughed derisively. &quot;He
                        hasn&apos;t the courageor the honesty.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Well&apos;patience and shuffle the cards,&apos; as Sancho
                        Panza says. We&apos;re winning Remsen City. And our friends are winning
                        a little ground here, and a little there and a little yonderand soononly too
                        soonthis crumbling false politics will collapse and disappear. Too soon, I
                        fear. Before the new politics of a work-compelling world for the working
                        class only is ready to be installed.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma had been only half attending. She now said abruptly, with a fluttering
                        movement that suggested <pb id="VAA2368-387" n="383"/> wind blowing strongly
                        across open prairies under a bright sky:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ve decided to go away.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Yes, you must take a vacation,&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve been telling you that for several years. And you
                        must go away to the sea or the mountains where you&apos;ll not be
                        harassed by the fate of the human race that you so take to heart.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I didn&apos;t mean a vacation,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;I meant to Chicagoto work there.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;ve had a good offer?&quot; said Victor.
                        &quot;I knew it would come. You&apos;ve got to take it. You need the
                        wider experiencethe chance to have a paper of your ownor a work of your own
                        of some kind. It&apos;s been selfishness, my keeping you all this
                        time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Selma had turned away. With her face hidden from him she said, &quot;Yes,
                        I must go.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;When?&quot; said Victor.</p>
                    <p>&quot;As soon as you can arrange for some one else.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;All right. I&apos;ll look round. I&apos;ve no hope of
                        finding any one to take your place, but I can get some one who will
                        do.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You can train any one,&quot; said Selma. &quot;Just as you
                        trained me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll see what&apos;s to be done,&quot; was all he
                        said.</p>
                    <p>A week passedtwo weeks. She waited; he did not bring up the subject. But she
                        knew he was thinking of it; for there had been a change in his manner toward
                        hera constraint, a self-consciousness theretofore utterly <pb
                            id="VAA2368-388" n="384"/> foreign to him in his relations with any one.
                        Selma was wretched, and began to show it first in her appearance, then in
                        her work. At last she burst out:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Give that article back to me,&quot; she cried.
                        &quot;It&apos;s rotten. I can&apos;t write any more. Why
                        don&apos;t you tell me so frankly? Why don&apos;t you send me
                        away?&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;You&apos;re doing better work than I am,&quot; said he.
                        &quot;You&apos;re eager to be offaren&apos;t you? Will you stay
                        a few days longer? I must get away to the countryaloneto get a fresh grip on
                        myself. I&apos;ll come back as soon as I can, and you&apos;ll be
                        free. There&apos;ll be no chance for vacations after you&apos;re
                        gone.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said she. She felt that he would think this
                        curtness ungracious, but more she could not say.</p>
                    <p>He was gone four days. When he reappeared at the office he was bronzed, but
                        under the bronze showed fatiguein a man of his youth and strength sure sign
                        of much worry and loss of sleep. He greeted her almost awkwardly, his eyes
                        avoiding hers, and sat down to opening his accumulated mail. Although she
                        was furtively observing him she started when he abruptly said:</p>
                    <p>&quot;You know you are free to goat any time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;I&apos;ll wait until you catch up with your work,&quot; she
                        suggested.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Nonever mind. I&apos;ll get along. I&apos;ve kept you out
                        of all reason. ... The sooner you go the better. I&apos;ve got to get
                        used to it, andI hate suspense.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Then I&apos;ll go in the morning,&quot; said Selma.
                        &quot;I&apos;ve no <pb id="VAA2368-389" n="385"/> arrangements to
                        makeexcept a little packing that&apos;ll take less than an hour. Will
                        you say good-by for me to any one who asks? I hate fusses, and I&apos;ll
                        be back here from time to time.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He looked at her curiously, started to speak, changed his mind and resumed
                        reading the letter in his hand. She turned to her work, sat pretending to
                        write. In fact she was simply scribbling. Her eyes were burning and she was
                        fighting against the sobs that came surging. He rose and began to walk up
                        and down the room. She hastily crumpled and flung away the sheet on which
                        she had be scrawling; he might happen to glance at her desk and see. She
                        bent closer to the paper and began to writeanything that came into her head.
                        Presently the sound of his step ceased. An uncontrollable impulse to fly
                        seized her. She would get upwould not put on her hatwould act as if she were
                        simply going to the street door for a moment. And she would not returnwould
                        escape the danger of a silly breakdown. She summoned all her courage,
                        suddenly rose and moved swiftly toward the door. At the threshold she had to
                        pause; she could not control her heart from a last look at him.</p>
                    <p>He was seated at his table, was staring at its litter of letters, papers and
                        manuscripts with an expression so sad that it completely transformed him.
                        She forgot herself. She said softly:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Victor!&quot;</p>
                    <p>He did not hear.</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-390" n="386"/>
                    <p>&quot;Victor,&quot; she repeated a little more loudly.</p>
                    <p>He roused himself, glanced at her with an attempt at his usual friendly smile
                        of the eyes.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Is there something wrong that you haven&apos;t told me
                        about?&quot; she asked.</p>
                    <p>&quot;It&apos;ll pass,&quot; said he. &quot;I&apos;ll get
                        used to it.&quot; With an attempt at the manner of the humorous
                        philosopher, &quot;Man is the most adaptable of all the animals.
                        That&apos;s why he has distanced all his relations. I didn&apos;t
                        realize how much our association meant to me until you set me to thinking
                        about it by telling me you were going. I had been taking you for granteda
                        habit we easily fall into with those who simply work with and for us and
                        don&apos;t insist upon themselves.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She was leaning against the frame of the open door into the hall, her hands
                        behind her back. She was gazing out of the window across the room.</p>
                    <p>&quot;You,&quot; he went on, &quot;are as I&apos;d like to
                        beas I imagined I was. Your sense of duty to the cause orders you elsewhere,
                        and you golike a good soldier, with never a backward glance.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She shook her head, but did not speak.</p>
                    <p>&quot;With never a backward glance,&quot; he repeated.
                        &quot;While I&quot; He shut his lips together firmly and settled
                        himself with fierce resolution to his work. &quot;I beg your
                        pardon,&quot; he said. &quot;This iscowardly. As I said before, I
                        shall get myself in hand again, and go on.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She did not move. The breeze of the unseasonably <pb id="VAA2368-391" n="387"
                        /> warm and brilliant day fluttered her thick, loosely gathered hair about
                        her brow. Her strange, barbaric little face suggested that the wind was
                        blowing across it a throng of emotions like the clouds of a driven storm.</p>
                    <p>A long silence. He suddenly flung out his arms in a despairing gesture and
                        let them fall to the table. At the crash she startled, gazed wildly about.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Selma!&quot; he cried. &quot;I must say it. I love
                        you.&quot;</p>
                    <p>A profound silence fell. After a while she went softly across the room and
                        sat down at her desk.</p>
                    <p>&quot;I think I&apos;ve loved you from the first months of your
                        coming here to workto the old office, I mean. But we were always

                        simply that I&apos;ve got the habit of telling you everythingof holding

                    <p>&quot;I was going,&quot; she said, &quot;because I loved

                    <p>Once more silence, both looking uneasily about, their glances avoiding each
                        other. The door of the printing room opened, and Holman, the printer, came
                        in, his case in his grimy hand. Said he:</p>
                    <p>&quot;Where&apos;s the rest of that street car article?&quot;</p>
                    <pb id="VAA2368-392" n="[388]"/>
                    <p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Selma, starting up and taking
                        some manuscript from her desk and handing it to him.</p>
                    <p>&quot;Louis,&quot; said Victor, as Holmes was retreating,
                        &quot;Selma and I are going to be married.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Louis paused, but did not look round. &quot;That ain&apos;t
                        what&apos;d be called news,&quot; said he. &quot;I&apos;ve
                        known it for more than three years.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He moved on toward his room. &quot;I&apos;ll be ready for that
                        leading article in half an hour. So, you&apos;d better get
                        busy.&quot;</p>
                    <p>He went out, closing the door behind him. Selma and Victor looked at each
                        other and burst out laughing. Thenstill laughingthey took hold of hands like
                        two children. And the next thing they knew they were tight in each
                        other&apos;s arms, and Selma was sobbing wildly.</p>

                    <head>X</head>
                    <p>When Jane had finished her apprenticeship, Doctor Charlton asked her to marry
                        him. Said Jane:</p>
                    <p>&quot;I never knew you to be commonplace before. I&apos;ve felt this
                        coming for some time, but I expected it would be in the form of an offer to
                        marry me.&quot;</p>
                    <p>She promptly accepted himand she has not, and will not regret it. So far as a
                        single case can prove a theory, Jane&apos;s case has proved
                        Charlton&apos;s theory that environment determines character. His
                        alternations of tenderness and brusqueness, of devotion to her and devotion
                        to his work, his constant offering of something new and his unremitting
                        insistence upon something new from her each day make it impossible for her
                        to develop the slightest tendency toward that sleeping sickness wherewith
                        the germ of conventionality inflicts any mind it seizes upon.</p>
                    <p>David Hull, now temporarily in eclipse through over-caution in radical
                        utterance, is gathering himself for a fresh spurt that will doubtless place
                        him at the front in politics again. He has never married. The belief in
                        Remsen City is that he is a victim of disappointed love for Jane Hastings.
                        But the truth is that he is unable to take his mind off himself long enough
                        to become sufficiently interested in another human being. There is no
                        especial reason why he has thus far escaped <pb id="VAA2368-394" n="[390]"/>
                        the many snares that have been set for him because of his wealth and
                        position. Who can account for the vagaries of chance?</p>
                    <p>The Workingmen&apos;s League now controls the government of Remsen City.
                        It gives an honest and efficient administration, and keeps the public
                        service corporations as respectful of the people as the laws will permit.
                        But, as Victor Dorn always warned the people, little can be done until the
                        State government is conqueredand even then there will be the national
                        government to see that all the wrongs of vested rights are respected and
                        that the people shall have little to say, in the management of their own
                        affairs. As all sensible people know, any corrupt politician, or any greedy
                        plutocrat, or any agent of either is a safer and better administrator of the
                        people&apos;s affairs than the people themselves.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="i">New Day</hi> is a daily with a circulation for its weekly
                        edition that is national. And Victor and Selma are still its editors, though
                        they have two little boys to bring up.</p>
                    <p>Jane and Selma see a great deal of each other, and are friendly, and try hard
                        to like each other. But they are not friends.</p>
                    <p>Dick Kelly&apos;s oldest son, graduated from Harvard, is the leader of
                        the Remsen City fashionable set. Joe House&apos;s only son is a
                        professional gambler and sets the pace among the sports.</p>

                    <p>A clean, straightforward novel, interesting from page to page, and as a whole
                        most interesting because Mr. Phillips has with great skill written it so
                        that the millionaire husband not only shows the character of his wife but
                        lays his own character before the reader as if unconsciously. A faithfully
                        true picture of the social climber in American womanhood, the Passaic
                        undertaker&apos;s daughter who climbs to European chteau life. The most
                        cold-blooded and accurate presentation of a certain type of money-making,
                        hard-working commercial man. And yet the man tells his own story.</p>

                        honest enough to dare, to seek the truest meanings of life by teaching

                    <p>A wayward girl, heiress to a great fortune, falls deeply in love with an
                        artist of small means, who does not seem to reciprocate her feeling. Her
                        father intervenes. The girl, who, like her mother, has always been
                        accustomed to bow to her father&apos;s aggressive will, now defies him
                        utterly and leaves her home. The artist remains unaware of the havoc he has
                        created. He is friendly in a manner toward the girl and tries to act as a
                        sort of elder brother and counselor in her perplexities. The working up and
                        working out of this tangled situation is accomplished in a masterly way, and

                    <p>The title of Mr. Phinips&apos; new novel is a daring one. The story
                        itself is just as daring, but nevertheless it rings true. It is a frank and
                        faithful picture of married life as it exists to-day among the prosperous
                        classes of this country. It is the story of a young couple who loved as
                        others do, but whose love turns to indifference, and Mr. Phillips shows us
                        why their married life was a failure.</p>
