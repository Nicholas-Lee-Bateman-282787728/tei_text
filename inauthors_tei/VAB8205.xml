							<l>Her cheeks red-lined by the scalding dew</l>
							<l>That wells to the lashes and wavering there,</l>

							<l>As clouds that cross December skies,</l>
							<l>So creeps the mist o'er the toil-tired eyes</l>

							<l>O'er the flag-draped box from the Philippines.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>What matter to her what the flower-wreathes are for?</l>
							<l>What comfort finds she in the Honors of War?</l>
							<l>She recks not of tribute nor pageantry's tread;</l>
							<l>Honors heaped Heaven-high can not give back her dead.</l>
							<l>The heart-strings are severed--torn--wrenched from their place,</l>
							<l>And Agony draws deeper lines on the face</l>
							<l>Of the mother that listessly, lifelessly leans</l>
							<l>O'er the flag-draped box from the Philippines.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She thinks not of glory on battle-fields won;</l>
							<l>She only remembers that this was her son;--</l>
							<l>The head droops still lower; the eyes are grief-blind,</l>
							<l>And the toil-palsied hands lie, with fingers entwined,</l>
							<l>In the old family Bible that rests on her knees,</l>
							<l>While she gazes through tears at its pages and sees</l>
							<l>Only roses--the flag--and the wreathed evergreen,</l>
							<l>And the face in the box from the Philippines.</l>

							<l>What means this mighlty tribute carved with shapes in garb of War?</l>
							<l>What means this pile of stone high-heaped? What is it builded for?</l>
							<l>Does it typify a Union from the depths of chaos wrought,</l>
							<l>And the lives splashed out in crimson in the awful battles fought?</l>
							<l>Does it speak alone of lives dashed out on sunny southern fens:</l>
							<l>Of souls cramped--sickened--starved--that fled from reeking prison pens?</l>
							<l>Is it only to the victors furloughed to their last sweet sleep,</l>
							<l>In camp in God's own country where the angels sentry keep?</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Rather let it tell the loved ones who are left to mourn the loss,</l>
							<l>They shall meet them at the river--they are waiting just across,</l>
							<l>In a bivouac of slumber on the bright and shining shore,</l>
							<l>Where the muskets' spiteful rattle wakes the echoes nevermore;</l>
							<l>Where the flags of truce are flying and the war-drum is at rest,</l>
							<l>Where gaping wounds by angel hands have tenderly been dressed.</l>
							<l>Where the long forced-march is ended, and where wars have ceased to be,</l>
							<l>And the men who marched with Sherman are encamped with those of Lee.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Once upon a midnight dreary, Eddie Poe sat weak and weary,</l>
							<l>Musing o'er some borrowed volumes of old-time forgotten lore:</l>
							<l>As he sat there stretching, napping, suddenly there came a tapping</l>
							<l>As of some one gently rapping with a broom stick on the door:</l>
							<l>"Thash my wife," he feebly muttered, and his foot-steps kinder stuttered</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">--As he tottered towards the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>It was club night, in December, and I think, if I remember,</l>
							<l>He said something 'bout the ghosts that wrestled 'round upon the floor,</l>
							<l>And he wished that it was Tuesday--wished 'twas Wednesday-maybe Thursday;</l>
							<l>Anyway he'd estimated all his sorrows o'er and o'er,</l>
							<l>Counted up the sorrows for the lovely, lost Lenore,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">--Then that tapping at the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Presently his soul grew stronger--like his breath--and then no longer</l>
							<l>Waiting, said he, "Madam, your forgiveness I implore,</l>
							<l>But the fact is we had champagne, lovely, ice-cold, sparkling champagne,</l>
							<l>And so gently came your tapping, rapping at my chamber door</l>
							<l>That I didn't think I heard you." Then he opened wide the door--</l>
							<l>There was nothing there but--nothing--</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">--Nothing more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Back into his room then turning, there he saw the lamp still burning,</l>
							<l>"But again there came the tapping, this time louder than before:</l>
							<l>"Funny", mused he, "There it is now, tapping, tapping at the window</l>
							<l>Let me see than what 'tis is it and this mystery explore:"</l>
							<l>With his heart then wildly beating, tottered forward as before--</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">--" 'Tis the wind. nothing more."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then he opened wide the shutter and with flurry, fuss and flutter</l>
							<l>In there flew a croaking raven--took a turn around the floor,</l>
							<l>Not the least obeisance made he, not a moment stopped or stayed he,</l>
							<l>But as if he had a right to, flew and perched above the door:</l>
							<l>Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above the chamber door:</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">--Perched and shrieked out "Nevermore."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Stunned was Poe at first to dumbness, with a feeling 'kin to bumness,</l>
							<l>And he marvelled at the grave and stern decorum this bird wore;</l>
							<l>Till his wits again returning and his heart with vengeance burning</l>
							<l>Grabbed he wildly for a weapon-flung the book of ancient lore</l>
							<l>At the unoffending Raven sitting there above the door--</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Here lies a Pioneer; here on this spot,</l>
							<l>Long years ago, so says tradition,</l>
							<l>He pitched his tent; led hither by</l>
							<l>His own unconquerable ambition</l>
							<l>To open up new lands; to feel that he</l>
							<l>Could look abroad and proudly say</l>
							<l>"I am, in truth, monarch and lord</l>
							<l>Of all that I survey."</l>
							<l>On this bright spot among the hills</l>
							<l>He pitched his tent and blazed the way</l>
							<l>For commerce and the busy marts</l>
							<l>Of generations of a future day.</l>
							<l>Here in the heart of untamed wilderness</l>
							<l>He woke the echoes with his keen-edged axe;</l>
							<l>He cleared and planted, later garnered in</l>
							<l>His meagre yield of grain and flax.</l>
							<l>Here, where pale-face ne'er before had trod;</l>
							<l>Here, where the swarthy Indian prowled</l>
							<l>In search of game; where all night long</l>
							<l>The hungry wolf and coyote howled</l>
							<l>In dire dismay at that high-blazing heap--</l>
							<l>His camp-fire; its far-reaching glare</l>
							<l>Held them at bay till daybreak's gray</l>
							<l>Flared forth and drove them to their lair.</l>
							<l>And here he lived and soon had builded up</l>
							<l>A cabin to replace his little tent,</l>
							<l>While to and from this humble cabin home</l>
							<l>His friends, the Red men, went.</l>
							<l>But peace like this could not forever be.</l>
							<l>More white men came: the Red Man stood aghast.</l>
							<l>While pale face deeper sunk his restless axe</l>
							<l>And mutual hatred grew, until at last</l>
							<l>The Red Men's fury burst and from the hills</l>
							<l>Down crushing on the Whites there poured</l>
							<l>With paint-streaked face and hatchet ready poised,</l>
							<l>The savage, murdering Indian horde.</l>
							<l>All in a might were these brave lives put out</l>
							<l>As one would snuff a candle with the cap;</l>
							<l>All unexpected was the midnight raid</l>
							<l>As from clear sky the deaf'ning thunder clap.</l>
							<l>Only an ash heap showed where cabin stood</l>
							<l>And stiffening bodies minus scalp-locks lay--</l>
							<l>Food for the now brave wolves by night,</l>
							<l>To bake and blister in the sun by day.</l>
							<l>Here lies a Pioneer; no stone to mark</l>
							<l>His resting place. The grasses wave</l>
							<l>Above his form, the stately trees</l>
							<l>Moan their sad requiem o'er his grave.</l>
							<l>Here, where he lived among the rocks and trees,</l>
							<l>Here, where his camp-fire burned;</l>
							<l>Here lies he now, encamped in peace at last,</l>
							<l>His bones to ashes turned.</l>

							<l>He run away when th' war broke out</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">(An' th' home folks thought th' world o' him)</l>
							<l>He said he felt zif he ort t' go</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">So he run away, as I said afore;</l>
							<l>Not that he loved his home folks less,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">But loved his country more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>After he'd j'ined he come t' me--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I's consid'able older'n Jim--</l>
							<l>An' told me all 'bout what he'd done</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">(An' I knowed his parents worshipped him)</l>
							<l>So him an' me, we jest paired off,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Sorter like pals, yuh know,</l>
							<l>An' ever' place I ever went</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Jim thought he'd ort t' go.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>So when we fit in th' wilderness</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I's right 'longside o' Jim</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">(Th' comp'ny thought th' world o' him)</l>
							<l>So up we crawled in th' underbresh</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' got where we could see</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">An' we each one "cooned" a tree.</l>

							<l>He couldn't leave me t' die alone</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">(An' I'd a-died fer him.)</l>
							<l>When we got fur enough t' stop</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Jim fainted dead away</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Years ago, at urgent call</l>
							<l>Our fathers met in Fanueil Hall,</l>
							<l>Wrote "Independence. We are free,"</l>
							<l>And handed it down to you and me</l>
							<l>And made us men instead of slaves.</l>
							<l>Then followed Lexington, Bunker Hill,</l>
							<l>Stony Point and Bemis Heights,</l>
							<l>And Valley Forge's days and nights.</l>
							<l>Those heroes died and in their will</l>
							<l>Bequeathed their triumphs and their graves</l>
							<l>They fought for a noble, holy cause</l>
							<l>With corner stone of God's own laws</l>
							<l>That all men are and ought to be</l>
							<l>On equal basis, each one free</l>
							<l>To worship God as he thinks best,</l>
							<l>That each with Liberty be blessed.</l>
							<l>They gave us a country; a banner they gave</l>
							<l>For land of free and home of brave.</l>
							<l>The Star Spangled Banner for me and for you--</l>
							<l>God's glorious banner, with heaven's own blue</l>
							<l>The blood of our heroes, spilled in the fight,</l>
							<l>Is emblemed by crimson; its purity, white.</l>
							<l>Those men cried "Liberty" to the world</l>
							<l>And Liberty's beautiful banner unfurled.</l>
							<l>It floats today and always will</l>
							<l>As long as men have blood to spill,</l>
							<l>And battlefields to spill it o'er</l>
							<l>And Uncle Sam to shed it for.</l>
							<l>The same old blood is in each vein</l>
							<l>And tingles at each finger tip,</l>
							<l>And falling from each patriot lip</l>
							<l>We hear the doom of Spain.</l>

							<l>O, thou white-whiskered</l>
							<l>Hoary-headed god,</l>
							<l>Whose breath blights where it strikes</l>
							<l>Thy name is Winter</l>
							<l>And thy icy breath</l>
							<l>Puts a quietus on</l>
							<l>The flowers that bloom in the spring,</l>
							<l>Tra la.</l>
							<l>It also colors up to some extent,</l>
							<l>The pale Caucasian's alabster nose,</l>
							<l>And likens it unto the red, red rose.</l>
							<l>Thy spotless mantle settles down</l>
							<l>In boistrous silence on the</l>
							<l>Things of Earth and makes the ash barrel</l>
							<l>Look like a thing of beauty.</l>
							<l>Thou'rt here, O, King!--thy icy grasp</l>

							<l>'Tis felt.</l>
							<l>The thermometer drops with dull</l>
							<l>Resounding, thud, and hovers</l>
							<l>'Round about the frizo mark.</l>
							<l>The gas gives out--the coal pile dwindles</l>
							<l>And the heat goes up the flue.</l>
							<l>The small boy--schoolward bound--</l>
							<l>Glides merrily athwart the frozen mud-hole.</l>
							<l>The ice-man's out of work;</l>
							<l>His hooks hang silent on the gloomy wall</l>
							<l>The while he hovers o'er the convalescent fire </l>
							<l>Rubs mutton tallow on his favorite</l>
							<l>Corn and sighs, "where am I at?"</l>
							<l>The frozen pump makes joyful noises</l>
							<l>Like a hired man who sings at even- tide.</l>
							<l>The blooming youth hies to the ice,</l>
							<l>Straps on his skates and cuts a star</l>
							<l>Or two, as graceful as a crippled cow.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>She sat in silence and the fire light played</l>
							<l>Upon her brow; her cheeks, the locks that strayed</l>
							<l>Gray, straggling truants from their wonted place</l>
							<l>And fell in threads of silver down her face.</l>
							<l>She sat in silence, and in memory came</l>
							<l>The silent whisperings of one dear name;</l>
							<l>The olden days before her locks were gray,</l>
							<l>And of the loved one who had marched away.</l>
							<l>She sat in silence and her fancies teemed</l>
							<l>With thought of him of whom each night she dreamed.</l>
							<l>She thought of him who in that olden time</l>
							<l>Had left with her this blackened old half dime.</l>
							<l>She saw again the blue-bloused, beardless boy</l>
							<l>Leap from the ranks, half sadness, half in joy;</l>
							<l>Again she felt his kiss; the dead, dull pain;</l>
							<l>And heard his words, "Until I come again."</l>
							<l>She heard again the wild hurrahs and cheers;</l>
							<l>Again she saw the goodbyes and the tears;</l>
							<l>She saw once more the swinging lines of blue;</l>
							<l>She saw Old Glory waving fond adieu.</l>
							<l>She heard again the drum and shrieking fife;</l>
							<l>She saw again that pulsing line of life</l>
							<l>Ebb farther, farther from her tear-dimmed sight,</l>
							<l>A sacrifice for freedom and the right.</l>
							<l>She saw it as it passed the old log mill</l>
							<l>And watched it crawling, crawling up the hill;</l>
							<l>She saw him wave a "good-bye" from the crest--</l>
							<l>Then lost to sight, borne onward with the rest.</l>
							<l>She sought again the lonely cabin door</l>
							<l>Where he had played in those old days of yore;</l>
							<l>'There where he gaily romped and played</l>
							<l>In childish sport, she knelt and prayed.</l>
							<l>She lived again through all the weary years,</l>
							<l>And wept again the floods of mother's tears;--</l>
							<l>She heard once more the thrilling fife and drum</l>
							<l>And heard the shout "At last the boys have come!"</l>
							<l>Again she saw the happy, laughing few--</l>
							<l>The ragged, straggling, dusty ranks of blue;</l>
							<l>Again she felt the weary eyes grow dim;</l>
							<l>As still she watched, and still no word from him.</l>
							<l>And still at ev'ning when the shadows fall</l>
							<l>And from the woods comes whip-poor-will's drear call,</l>
							<l>She lives anew the lonely years of pain</l>
							<l>And o'er the silver keep-sake weeps again.</l>
							<l>That old coin cherished in trust for him,</l>
							<l>Handled, caressed, the date grown dim;</l>
							<l>And life's blossoms wither--fade--fall and expire</l>
							<l>As she silently sits, gazing into the fire.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>When the gently whispering zephyrs play among the budding trees</l>
							<l>And the first faint hints of spring are wafted on the Southern breeze:</l>
							<l>When wild flowers peep from drifted leaves and blossom one by one,</l>

						<lg>
							<l>When the ground hog wakes from Winter's sleep to stretch his cramped-up limbs,</l>
							<l>And the city clerk and sweetheart gaily chant their picnic hymns:</l>
							<l>Then 'round the stump and on the fence will silently entwine</l>
							<l>Man's awful, silent enemy, the pesky pizen vine.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>When the Summer's heat is sizzling and the crops are all "done brown"</l>
							<l>When Autumn's frosts are nipping things and leaves come tumbling down:</l>

							<l>Ready always for a victim is the pesky pizen vine.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Man may boast of his complexion and his form of perfect mould:</l>
							<l>He may outstare War's grim visage; he may laugh at grim Death cold:</l>
							<l>But the thing that mars his beauty, warps his shape all out of line</l>
							<l>Is the graceful, unassuming, modest pesky pizen vine.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>"As one who cons at evening o'er an album all alone,"</l>
							<l>We have conned o'er volumes borrowed, also volumes of our own,</l>
							<l>Searching in the homes of wisdom for a word they never knew,</l>
							<l>But in vain our search has proven, so we leave it now to you.</l>
							<l>We've consulted Noah Webster and he said he didn't know;</l>
							<l>Likewise Chambers' many volumes on this word no light can throw;</l>
							<l>We have searched through dictionaries, unabridged and otherwise</l>
							<l>But so far 'thas proven fruitless--still doth blindness bind our eyes.</l>
							<l>Is it French or ancient Latin? Bengalese or Hindoostan?</l>
							<l>Does it come from northern Norway, or from sunny Yucatan?</l>
							<l>Was it minted in the tropics? Was it born 'mid northern snow?</l>
							<l>Is it Eastern? Is it Western ? That is what we fain would know.</l>
							<l>We have read your book on Sifers, but can't cipher this thing out,</l>
							<l>We have wondered at its meaning, but as yet we are in doubt;</l>
							<l>It seems to be a word that lately into use has flounced</l>
							<l>So pray tell us Mr. Riley, how Rubayait is pronounced.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>October gay, the glorious month,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The dearest of them all,</l>
							<l>When Summer, backward glancing,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Slowly ripens into Fall.</l>
							<l>Thy frost-tipped fingers, here and there,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Are turning leaves to gold,</l>
							<l>And fiery red and softer hues--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The year is growing old.</l>
							<l>The rising sun looks dull and red</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As through the mist it peeps</l>
							<l>At early morn, but brighter grows,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And warmer, as it higher creeps;</l>
							<l>Then weaker growing, going down,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">It sinks a fiery ball,</l>
							<l>While early shadows higher climb</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And darkness settles over all.</l>
							<l>The far-off woods are blue and dim,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A smoky haze is everywhere,</l>
							<l>While hints of Indian Summer come</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">With every breath of air.</l>
							<l>The yellow plumes of golden rod</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Are nodding to and fro</l>
							<l>To thistle down whirled here and there</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As breezes chance to blow.</l>
							<l>The birds are leaving, bullbats whirl</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">In dizzy flight at eventide;</l>
							<l>Dame Nature dons her gala dress--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Grim winter's blushing bride,</l>
							<l>The erstwhile timid little quail</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And shy prairie hen</l>
							<l>By hunger driven, bolder grow,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And flock to haunts of men.</l>
							<l>The beechnuts, nipped by biting frost,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Noisily rattle down,</l>
							<l>And pawpaws, slowly turning black,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Lie scatttred o'er the ground.</l>
							<l>Then, hail! Oh hail, October fair,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">The dearest month of all,</l>
							<l>When Summer, backward glancing,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Slowly ripens into Fall.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>I like t' see th' fodder shocks a-standin' row on row;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I like th' tang of autumn an' th' first few skifts of snow.</l>
							<l>I like th' sparkle of th' frost that tetches up th' leaves</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' ripens th' persimmons. An' I, somehow, half believe</l>
							<l>That I like th' autumn better as my shadder stretches out</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Along th' western hill slope. There's a cheerfulness about</l>
							<l>Th' whistle of th' pa'tridge an' th' callin' of th' snipe</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' th' blowin' of th' dinner horn when punkin pies is ripe.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I somehow like th' idy of th' settin' of th' sun</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">As I set an' ponder over all my workin' days that's done.</l>
							<l>I had my happy springtime, an' my summer come an' went</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' now that autumn's slippin' on I find myself content</l>
							<l>T' set an' dream an' whittle, lookin' backward o'er th' years,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">T' chuckle over things that formed th' basis of my fears.</l>
							<l>An' as I set before th' fire an' smoke my ole cob pipe</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I smile because it's autumn time an' punkin pies is ripe.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I like t' watch th' boys gittin' out at airly morn,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">A-hookin' up th' teams an' startin' in t' shuck th' corn;</l>
							<l>Fer me there's jist real music in th' rattle of th' gears</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' I like t' hear th' thumpin' of th' shiny, yellow ears</l>
							<l>Ag'in' th' six-foot bump board as th' boys fling'em in</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">An' I'm sometimes half way wishin' that I was young ag'in.</l>
							<l>But my workin' days is over, an' I smile an' fill my pipe;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I'm happy that it's autumn an' th' punkin pies is ripe.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Across the blood-washed battle-fields where once the cannon roared,</l>
							<l>Where brother fought with brother and where crimson life-blood poured;</l>
							<l>Through Gettysburg's grim monuments, o'er Chickamauga's plain;</l>
							<l>From Lookout Mountain's cloud-wreathed crest rings out the glad refrain</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">"Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>The same dear flag floats over all, the glorious stripes and stars--</l>
							<l>The Blue and Gray together meet and count her battle scars,</l>
							<l>United now is North and South, united East and West,</l>
							<l>United now forever--the same song in each breast:</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">"Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She's up there now--Old Glory--gaily flapping in the breeze,</l>
							<l>And smiles in whole-souled happiness at what she hears and sees</l>
							<l>As the boys who wore the loyal blue meet those who wore the gray,</l>
							<l>And sing the one glad anthem that is National to-day,</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">"Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>She's up there now--Old Glory--and she waves for all to-day:</l>
							<l>Her rippling folds alike protect North's blue and Southern gray.</l>
							<l>Her twinkling stars smile down on us from out their field of blue</l>
							<l>And seem to breathe the same sweet thought as back in 'sixty-two;</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">"Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>To-day the veterans meet and talk their old time skirmish-lore,</l>
							<l>They stand again on picket post;--they fight their battles o'er:</l>
							<l>They go once more through prison pens, they visit lowly graves</l>
							<l>Where over blue and gray alike, that same dear banner waves</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">"Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Those who wept at Appamatox stand with those whom vict'ry crowned,</l>
							<l>And together strew the evergreen o'er lowly flag-marked mound,</l>
							<l>And they kneel beside the headstone, and with clasped hands, through their
								tears</l>
							<l>They smile their heart-felt happiness, that after many years</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">There is "Reunion."</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>No more the rattling drum beats out the stirring call to arms:</l>
							<l>No more these one time brother-foes pay heed to War's alarms:</l>
							<l>They are waiting now for roll-call o'er that vest eternal sea</l>
							<l>Where the men who marched with Sherman are encamped with those of Lee</l>
							<l rend="ti-3">In glad "Reunion."</l>

						<p><hi rend="center">By Henry W. Shortheavysetfellow.</hi></p>

						<lg>
							<l>From the stagnant pools and marshes,</l>
							<l>From the lakes and creeks and rivers,</l>
							<l>From the homes of frogs orchestral</l>
							<l>And from out the rusty rain-barrel</l>
							<l>Comes the hungry Mosqui-to-to;</l>
							<l>Mosqui-to-to with his tool-kit,</l>
							<l>With his saw and hatchet sharpened,</l>
							<l>With his blood-pump and his auger,</l>
							<l>Comes to break our rest at night-time,</l>
							<l>With his sharp insinuations.</l>
							<l>And the silver moon of springtime</l>
							<l>In his nightly rounds looks on him</l>
							<l>Since his advent in the city;</l>
							<l>Likewise has the sun-light warmed him</l>
							<l>Since his coming here among us.</l>
							<l>We are weary, we are waiting</l>
							<l>For the passing of his visit.</l>
							<l>We are weary of his singing,</l>
							<l>Weary of his sharp caresses.</l>
							<l>Even now our maids and matrons</l>
							<l>Bear the marks of Mosqui-to-to;</l>
							<l>Bear the marks upon their faces,</l>
							<l>On their cheeks and on their eye-lids;</l>
							<l>And their arms so plump and chubby</l>
							<l>Have grown lumpy from his kisses.</l>
							<l>Even now our youths and seignors</l>
							<l>Cuss in undertones and whispers</l>
							<l>At the work of Mosqui-to-to.</l>
							<l>Leave us, leave us, Mosqui-to-to!</l>
							<l>Leave us to enjoy the springtime.</l>
							<l>Be not partial in your visits,</l>
							<l>Go to Gosport or Romona--</l>
							<l>Be a Gosport Mosqui-to-to</l>
							<l>Go and give to them the ha-ha</l>
							<l>Go and guy them Withahaha.</l>
							<l>Withahaha dry and juiceless</l>
							<l>Yea the laugh with daggers in it,</l>
							<l>Be a swell, an out-and-outer;</l>
							<l>Come not back again to bore us;</l>
							<l>With your bill so oft presented.</l>
							<l>Come not back again to ramble</l>
							<l>In our village, 'round our doorways.</l>
							<l>Go thou hence--go thou and leave us</l>
							<l>Come not back again to grieve us,</l>
							<l>Then to Manitou the Mighty</l>
							<l>We our thanks will send exulting.</l>

						<p><hi rend="b">"Thermopolyae had its messenger of defeat. The Alamo had none."</hi></p>

						<lg>
							<l>Far to the southward and westward--out on' the frontier of Texas,</l>
							<l>Stands the old mission del Alamo; Alamo, place of the cottonwoods,</l>
							<l>Founded by early Franciscans, builded of bricks of adobe.</l>
							<l>Here in the trackless wilds the padres came preaching the gospel,</l>
							<l>Here came the early Franciscans and founded a chain of these missions;</l>
							<l>A chain reaching far to the southward, linked the savage to civilization.</l>
							<l>The Mission of the Conception, the first of the chain to the southward</l>
							<l>The Mission of San Jose was next in the chain that they builded;</l>
							<l>Then the Mission San Juan Capistrano, and southward still farther they builded</l>
							<l>The Mission San Francisco Espada, last of the chain to the southward.</l>
							<l>Here worshiped the early Franciscans, and here came the Mexican Indian;</l>
							<l>Coming and going at pleasure, he smoked the peace pipe with the paleface.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Here in the Mission del Alamo--when Texas was warring for freedom</l>
							<l>The Texans stored arms and munitions and placed a small band to defend them,</l>
							<l>Nine score they numbered all told, when the Mexican army beseiged them,</l>
							<l>Nine score brave and true under Travis, beseiged in the walls of the mission,</l>
							<l>Travis and Bonham and Bowie, Crockett and Evans and Walker--</l>
							<l>Names graven deep in our history; too deep for time to destroy.</l>
							<l>Here these men waited and watched, with the Mexican army about them,</l>
							<l>Waited and watched in vain for the succor they knew could not reach them.</l>
							<l>Then Bonham slipped out through the lines and rode with a message to Fannin,</l>
							<l>Two hundred miles southward and eastward, but in vain was the message delivered</l>
							<l>Back through the Mexican lines, his life in the balance, came Bonham,</l>
							<l>Back through the circle of Death, to the death that he knew was in waiting;</l>
							<l>Back to his chieftan came Bonham, shunning the life that was offered;</l>
							<l>Diisdaining Life at the cost of a duty well done in half doing.</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-060" n="[60]"/>

							<l>Back to report he had failed, reinforcements could never be sent them;</l>
							<l>Back to his place in the ranks, by the side of his true hearted comrades,</l>
							<l>Back to the death that he knew was as certain and sure as the daybreak.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Up from the east came the light, the gray and the pink of the morning.</l>
							<l>Slowly dispelling the mist that hung like a shroud o'er the fenland.</l>
							<l>Routing the shadows of night-blending the gloom and the darkness</l>
							<l>Into the half-lights of dawn-colors less awesome and sombre.</l>
							<l>Here and there through the gloom blinked the last dying embers of campfires;</l>
							<l>The fires of the army encamped, asleep on their arms in the trenches;</l>
							<l>Rolled in their blankets they slept, and sleeping, they dreamed of the battle.</l>
							<l>Northward and eastward and westward and southward the plain stretched unbroken</l>
							<l>Save by the low rolling swells of the undulating prairie.</l>
							<l>There to the south in the mist loomed the dark silhouette of the mission,</l>
							<l>Sombre and silent it stood, spectral and grim and forbidding.</l>
							<l>Naught broke the stillness that reigned save the gurgle and ripple of water</l>
							<l>Swiftly, yet peacefully, flowing from the north through the square of the
								mission;</l>
							<l>The gurgle and ripple of water that sounded like prattle of children</l>
							<l>And thoughts of the sentries sped back to the firesides where waited their loved
								ones;</l>
							<l>Tears welled to their lashes unchecked, and unchecked flowed down their grim
								faces.</l>
							<l>Down their bronzed cheeks through the lines furrowed deep by exposure and
								hardship.</l>
							<l>When the gray in the east spoke of morning, the sentries on watch in the
								mission</l>
							<l>Detected a stir in the camp of the enemy circled about them;</l>
							<l>Silently, one by one, lights gleamed in the officers' quarters;</l>
							<l>Footsteps, though muffled, were heard, distinct in the stillness of morning;</l>
							<l>Scurrying forms were discerned, approaching and leaving headquarters.</l>
							<l>Suddenly, out of the night a bugle shrieked summons to action.</l>
							<l>The silence of sleep o'er the plain was shattered by notes of a bugle</l>
							<l>Sounding the call "To Arms!" "To Arms!" shrieked the echoes in answer.</l>
							<l>The blanket-wrapped forms by the campfires leaped into life on the instant,</l>
							<l>The bugles of other divisions caught up the refrain and it echoed</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-061" n="[61]"/>

							<l>Through the encircling camps--the death knell of those in the mission.</l>
							<l>The tramping of feet in the darkness, the neighing and stamping of horses,</l>
							<l>The orders of those in command, the curses, the jests and the laughter,</l>
							<l>The rattle and clank of arms, the scurrying forms in the darkness,</l>
							<l>Presaged disaster dire for the little hand full in the Mission.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>They rushed at the bugle's first summons, and formed in parade on the plaza</l>
							<l>Where Travis addressed them and told them if any so wished they might leave
								him--</l>
							<l>"Leave me while yet there is time; go ere the battle commences.</l>
							<l>Go and my God speed be with you"--not a man moved from "Atten- tion."</l>
							<l>Not a man moved from his place, and they cheered till the echoes gave answer</l>
							<l>"We will stay with you, Colonel, die with you" they cried as they went to their
								stations.</l>
							<l>Resolute, calm and cool, they waited the launching of battle;</l>
							<l>Unshaken by fear and undaunted, they grimly awaited the onset.</l>
							<l>Even the dozen of sick were furnished with arms and munitions,</l>
							<l>And stretched on their beds of pain, they cooly awaited their summons.</l>
							<l>Then as they waited and watched, the pink of' the east turned to crimson;</l>
							<l>Precurser of horror and death; a mantle of blood o'er the heavens.</l>
							<l>The Mexican bugles rang "Charge!" and on came the Mexican army--</l>
							<l>The Mexicans five thousand strong, shouting and yelling like demons.</l>
							<l>Then clear and distinct o'er the battle rang music, wierd, wild and unearthly,</l>
							<l>The Mexican bands playing "Dugello", the Mexican word meaning "Cut-throat",</l>
							<l>And flaunting the flag of red, "Asking and giving no quarter".</l>
							<l>Each watcher upon the walls shakes hands with his neighbor in silence;</l>
							<l>Rifles are lifted and sighted, the lockstrings of cannon are tightened.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Nearer the Mexicans come; a cannon shot booms from the plaza,</l>
							<l>The rifles ring back a reply--Death has begun with the sunrise.</l>
							<l>The onsweeping lines reel and waver; they falter and totter and scatter,</l>
							<l>Then rally again to the north and are once again checked in their onslaught.</l>
							<l>Far off to the east is the roar and the rattle of cannon and rifles,</l>
							<l>Death stalks abroad on the slope to the east of the yard of the convent.</l>
							<l>Then through a lull in the storm again comes that unearthly music</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-062" n="[62]"/>

							<l>That fiendish and devilish air, "Dugello, Dugello, Dugello".</l>
							<l>Then from the west rings "The Charge"--the west wall is left undefended--</l>
							<l>Over they come with a rush and over the north wall and redoubt,</l>
							<l>Through the ,stockade on the south, yelling like hell-hounds they scramble.</l>
							<l>Travis is shot in his tracks and falls 'cross the trail of his cannon,</l>
							<l>Bonham falls dead at his gun, and falling, his weight pulls the lock-string</l>
							<l>And Hell thunders out from its throat and his death yell is drowned in its
								rumble.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Surrounded by fire and steel, disdaining the thought of surrender,</l>
							<l>The brave Texans fight to the last and die with the glory of battle.</l>
							<l>Some rush to the convent and rally, where stretched on their cots, wait the sick
								ones,</l>
							<l>Waiting for Death to call and fearless to answer the summons.</l>
							<l>There in the long, low room, the hospital room of the mission,</l>
							<l>They battle till life goes out and die with the laurels of glory.</l>
							<l>Bowie, alone in his room, lies waiting with grim resolution,</l>
							<l>Burning with fever and pain, his pulse beating higher and higher,</l>
							<l>Till a face, brown and fierce in its anger, peers suddenly in at the doorway</l>
							<l>Then others come, followed by others; the pistol shots rattle and echo;</l>
							<l>Curses and groans fill the room; the bodies of wounded and dying</l>
							<l>Reach from his bed to the door; bayonet-pinned to his death bed</l>
							<l>Bowie was found, and across him, stretched cold in death is his slayer,</l>
							<l>A hoop-iron knife sunk in his bosom and Bowie's dead hand on the handle.</l>
							<l>While some in the walls of the convent seek refuge from numbers o'er-whelming,</l>
							<l>To the church rush Crockett and others to die in its sanctified portals</l>
							<l>Here in a desperate stand, the little band struggles like demons</l>
							<l>With face to the foe at close quarters, they battle with odds overpowering;</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Fire the magazine, Evans" cries Crockett, and weakened and faint from his
								bleeding,</l>
							<l>The Major makes one fruitless dash and falls lifeless and limp on the
								threshold.</l>
							<l>Backed in the angle of walls, his enemies swarming about him,</l>
							<l>Dabbled and splashed with blood, his rifle clasped tight by the muzzle</l>
							<l>Crockett is selling his life at a price that will stagger the nation;</l>
							<l>Swinging his weapon of war, he fights on, disdaining surrender,</l>
							<l>Building a breastwork of foes--a breastwork of dead round about him.</l>
							<l>Piled up around him in heaps are the crippled, the dead and the dying--</l>




							<pb id="VAB8205-063" n="[63]"/>

							<l>Numbers soon tell and they rush him like merciless stag-hounds their quarry</l>
							<l>And he sinks beneath numbers too great and their bayonets drink up his
								life-blood.</l>
							<l>But one man is left--gunner Walker--the last man in arms in the mission,</l>
							<l>And they toss him aloft on their bayonets--laugh at his feeble resistance.</l>
							<l>So ends the Alamo struggle--the nine score against the five thousand.</l>
							<l>The flag of two stars is hauled down, for none is now left to defend it.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But one scene remains to be pictured--the last' of this blood-dripping story;</l>
							<l>You ask "Where the graves of these heroes?" "Where do these martyrs lie
								sleeping?"</l>
							<l>Their tomb is in History's page-they sleep in the hearts of the people.</l>
							<l>No grave oped to close o'er their bones: no sepulchre walls are built 'round
								them.</l>
							<l>None save the Alamo walls, where the bodies were burned by the victors.</l>
							<l>As the dead demigod of the ancients was laid on his funeral pyre--</l>
							<l>As the Chief of the Vikings in death, in his burning ship sailed to Valhalla--</l>
							<l>So in the Alamo walls were the dead heroes wafted to heaven.</l>
							<l>Piled in a pyramid towering--in layers of wood and of bodies--</l>
							<l>The torch was applied, and their ashes stirred by the zephyrs of heaven--</l>
							<l>Scattered and hallowed the ground and the walls of the Alamo mission.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Wherever men sing love of heroes, these heroes will not be forgotten.</l>
							<l>Graven too deep are their names for the ravage of Time to destroy.</l>
						</lg>

						<p>Thermopolyae sent word of defeat. From the Alamo none brought the message.</p>

							<l>It was a summer evening,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">Roll something large and round</l>
							<l>Which he, beside the rivulet,</l>

							<l>He came to ask what he had found</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">That was so large and smooth and round.</l>
							<l>Old Kaspar took it from the boy</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Who stood expectant by,</l>
							<l>And then the old man shook his head</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And with a natural sigh,</l>
							<l>"'Tis some poor fellow's skull," quoth he</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">"Who fell in that great victory.</l>
							<l>I find them in the garden,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">With wonder-waiting eyes.</l>
							<l>"Now tell us all about the fight</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And why they killed them all outright."</l>
							<l>"It was the Princetons," Kaspar cried,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">"Who put the Yales to rout,</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">I could not quite make out.</l>

							<l>And many a college chappie</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Went there that day and died.</l>

							<l>With a thousand twists of ribbons bright; with feathers, defunct birds,</l>
							<l>She produces bonnets that defy all Noah Webster's words.</l>
							<l>Takes feathers from the ostrich, caught in Afric's burning sands,</l>
							<l>And plumage from the myriad birds of all the foreign lands,</l>

							<l>And they collect and intermingle in the Trimmer's dizzy dream.</l>

							<l>Th' best of th' lot; so't seemed t' me.</l>
							<l>He'd set in his cheer--I c'n see him yit--</l>
							<l>By th' wide fireplace, an' smoke an' spit</l>

							<l>Now this weddin' yarn he used t' tell</l>
							<l>Concerned Joe Pinkard, a fairly well</l>
							<l>Meanin' young farm workin' hand</l>
							<l>Who was tendin' a crop on Hudson's land--</l>
							<l>Up north o' here some six, eight mile--</l>
							<l>Grubbin' stumps an' layin' tile</l>
							<l>Thoo th' oozy swamp land 'long th' branch</l>
							<l>That meandered down thoo Hudson's ranch.</l>
							<l>Joe tuk a shine to as sprightly a lass</l>
							<l>As ever peeped into a lookin' glass;</l>
							<l>Rosy cheeked an' ruby lipped</l>
							<l>With a wisp o' ches'nut hair that slipped</l>
							<l>Kinda out f'm under her bonnet's edge</l>
							<l>An' fluttered about like a tuft o' sedge</l>
							<l>Grass down 'n th' bottom lands.</l>
							<l>Her eyes fair sparkled an' flashed commands</l>
							<l>That Joe'd jist jump t' carry thoo</l>
							<l>Er bust a gallus tryin' to.</l>
							<l>Tall an' straight, clean limbed an' strong,</l>
							<l>A stiddy worker an' jist along</l>
							<l>About nineteen year' old er</l>
							<l>So when Joe begun a-sparkin' her.</l>
							<l>She worked fer old John Mitchell then,</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-076" n="[76]"/>

							<l>He'pin his wife. But 'y jacks, when</l>
							<l>Mitchell begun t' smell a mouse</l>
							<l>He mighty nigh tore down th' house;</l>
							<l>Stormed an' r'ared an' jist went on,</l>
							<l>Fumed an' fussed till his breath was gone.</l>
							<l>He cracked his fists an' stomped his hat</l>
							<l>An' said he'd putt an end t' that</l>
							<l>Forthwith an' sudden. Then he thinks</l>
							<l>T' call her names: "ungrateful minx",</l>
							<l>"Brazen hussy", "spiteful cat"</l>
							<l>An' a lot o' ugly things like that.</l>
							<l>But Marthy smiled an' tossed her head</l>
							<l>A little higher an' then, 'y Ned,</l>
							<l>She jist lit in an' give ole John</l>
							<l>A real tongue lashing with whiskers on.</l>
							<l>She'd worked fer him "f'm dawn t' dusk</l>
							<l>Year in, year out, an' nary a husk"</l>
							<l>Had he paid her 'cept board an' keep.</l>
							<l>She 'lowed if her work was s' overly cheap</l>
							<l>She'd work fer herse'f in a home o' her own;</l>
							<l>An' out she went an' left'em alone.</l>
							<l>When John come to fust thing he knowed</l>
							<l>He seed her marchin' down th' road</l>
							<l>With head helt high an' arms a-swing;</l>
							<l>On past th' willer that shaded th' spring,</l>
							<l>Round th' hill where th' thick bunch grass</l>
							<l>Had nigh outgrowed th' sassafras</l>
							<l>Along th' fence row. An' so she left</l>
							<l>Th' Mitchells whur she'd done th' heft</l>
							<l>O' th' work fer up'ards o' thirteen year.</l>
							<l>She come on over t' gran' dad's here</l>
							<l>An' nothin'd do but he must go</l>
							<l>T' Hudson's an' take th' word t' Joe.</l>
							<l>She set th' time for noon next day--</l>
							<l>Joe, of course, had nothin' t' say--</l>
							<l>But git th' squire er minister,</l>
							<l>Hitch her t' him an' him t' her.</l>
							<l>It caught Joe nappin' an' his su'prise</l>
							<l>Jist stared out thoo his big round eyes,</l>
							<l>But he gapped fer breath an' heaved a sigh</l>
							<l>An' over his face come a "do-er-die"</l>
							<l>Sort of a look, an' then he smiled</l>
							<l>That he was happily rikonciled</l>
							<l>To th' inscrutable ways of Provi-dence.</l>
							<l>He sa'ntered over t' th' garden fence,</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-077" n="[77]"/>

							<l>Leaned his big frame 'crost th' gate</l>
							<l>An' begun forthwith t' enumerate</l>
							<l>Th' details of th' great event</l>
							<l>That he considered wuz heaven-sent.</l>
							<l>Joe'd looked forward fer quite a spell</l>
							<l>To th' ringin' of his weddin' bell,</l>
							<l>An' had figgered ahead on this an' that</l>
							<l>Of all his outfit--boots t' hat.</l>
							<l>But here it wuz, th' day of days,</l>
							<l>An' he wuz ketched contrariways;</l>
							<l>Clothes he had--two homespun suits</l>
							<l>An' a coonskin cap, but had no boots.</l>
							<l>He'd worked th' hull blame summer in</l>
							<l>Buck skin pants an' moccasins--</l>
							<l>Savin' his homespun an' waitin' th' day</l>
							<l>Th' old boot maker tromped round that way,</l>
							<l>Figgerin' he'd have a bran new pair</l>
							<l>Th' day he wed his lady fair.</l>
							<l>But here he wuz, the big day come,</l>
							<l>An' him no boots, an' say, 'y gum,</l>
							<l>He done some figger'n'--fust an' last--</l>
							<l>An' done some thinkin', quick an' fast;</l>
							<l>But ever' idy wuz cast aside</l>
							<l>Huntin' fer one more simplified.</l>
							<l>But Hudson had some hides he'd tanned</l>
							<l>An' said he'd make a pair by hand</l>
							<l>An' promised shore he'd have 'em done</l>
							<l>By noon next day. An' he begun</l>
							<l>Forthwith t' measure an' cut an' sew</l>
							<l>An' fashion th' weddin' boots fer Joe.</l>
							<l>Stitching' an' vampin' far in th' night</l>
							<l>By a taller candle's feeble light;</l>
							<l>His eye balls burned, th' whites turned red,</l>
							<l>An' he pulled wax ends till his arms felt dead.</l>
							<l>Up next mornin' an' at it ag'in,</l>
							<l>Workin' th' dull awl out an' in;</l>
							<l>Pullin' th' wax' ends hard an' tight</l>

							<l>But hard luck hit pore Joe ag'in--</l>
							<l>More trouble come a-edgin' in;</l>
							<l>Now that they'd found th' cowhide, tanned,</l>
							<l>Th' pesky cows they tuk a hand.</l>
							<l>Here it wuz, Joe's weddin' day,</l>
							<l>An' th' tarnal cows had wandered away.</l>




							<pb id="VAB8205-078" n="[78]"/>

							<l>Lost in th' woods, th' Lord knowed where--</l>
							<l>Some'rs out in th' big "Out There."</l>
							<l>Hudson wuz busy makin' boots</l>
							<l>An' hadn't time t' hunt th' brutes</l>
							<l>So he detailed Joe an' off he went</l>
							<l>Lickety split on th' old gray, bent</l>
							<l>Kneed mare. He rid an' rid--</l>
							<l>Th' clouds come up an' th' sun wuz hid;</l>
							<l>He hunted here an' hunted there,</l>
							<l>Nervously urgin' th' old gray mare</l>
							<l>To faster gait--an' ever on</l>
							<l>They traveled till noonday wuz gone.</l>
							<l>No trace of th' cows could pore Joe find</l>
							<l>Though many a mile he'd left behind;</l>
							<l>Rode east an' south--er thought he did--</l>
							<l>Couldn't tell fer th' sun wuz hid--</l>
							<l>But he traveled furder an' furder still</l>
							<l>Searched dusky holler an' thicket an' hill</l>
							<l>But found no cows, ner any trace</l>
							<l>Of Red er Spot er old Bald Face.</l>
							<l>He looked about in fear an' awe--</l>
							<l>But not a landmark he ever saw</l>
							<l>Before wuz there t' greet his eye;</l>
							<l>He searched th' woods an' searched th' sky</l>
							<l>Tryin' t' find some familiar thing</l>
							<l>T' guide him in his wandering.</l>
							<l>An' then at last he knowed he's lost</l>
							<l>When down in a holler he come acrost</l>
							<l>A spring branch he had never seen.</l>
							<l>That gurgled an' babbled along between</l>
							<l>Th' beeches an' oaks an' sycamores;</l>
							<l>Not a spot in th' hull outdoors</l>
							<l>That Joe, in his plight, could reco'nize</l>
							<l>As he stared about with frightened eyes.</l>
							<l>Then he tuk th' shakes an' his fever riz</l>
							<l>An' his muscles ached like th' rheumatiz;</l>
							<l>His throbbin' head jist buzzed an' roared</l>
							<l>Like bumble bees inside th' old gourd</l>
							<l>Dipper hung 'longside th' well.</l>
							<l>As his fever riz his spirits fell</l>
							<l>Till he was e'ena' most tuckered out</l>
							<l>Tryin' t' figger his way about.</l>
							<l>He thought of bears an' catamounts,</l>
							<l>An' Indians that wandered hereabouts--</l>
							<l>He wondered if they'd scalp him first,</l>
							<l>Er kill him 'fore they done their worst;</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-079" n="[79]"/>

							<l>Bewildered an' he'pless, Joe looked about</l>
							<l>Tryin' t' figger which way out</l>
							<l>O' th' trackless woods an' home ag'in</l>
							<l>Where bride an' Squire awaited him</l>
							<l>Till finally a bright idee</l>
							<l>Formed in his mind an' he says, says 'e</l>
							<l>"I'll turn th' old mare loose, 'y jacks,</l>
							<l>She knows th' way an' she'll make tracks</l>
							<l>Straight for home an' Hudson's barn."--</l>
							<l>So here th'old mare enters this weddin' yarn.</l>
							<l>Th' mare turned round an' started back,</l>
							<l>Joe follerin' close in th' old gray's track;</l>
							<l>She kep' th' lad a-travelin' fast--</l>
							<l>She stepped out brisk fer noon was past</l>
							<l>An' she was hungry an' wanted corn.</l>
							<l>But in this haste new trouble was born.--</l>
							<l>She stepped in a yeller jackets' nest</l>
							<l>An' f'm that p'int on, 'y jing, th' rest</l>
							<l>O' that trip was made by travelin' fast.</l>
							<l>Joe knowed blame well he didn't dast</l>
							<l>Lose a sight o' that old gray mare</l>
							<l>'T' leave him wanderin' he'pless there.</l>
							<l>Her head helt high, her tail a-whisk,</l>
							<l>Kickin' an' snortin' an' tryin' t' frisk</l>
							<l>Herse'f free of th' pesky things</l>
							<l>That follered close on angry wings,</l>
							<l>Thoo hazel thickets, thoo briers an' brush</l>
							<l>Th' gray mare charged with frightened rush</l>
							<l>Seekin' t' brush th' plague aside</l>
							<l>That burned an' stung her old gray hide.</l>
							<l>She threshed thoo thickets an' over logs,</l>
							<l>Floundered her way thoo oozy bogs,</l>
							<l>Joe a-follerin' like old Grim Death</l>
							<l>Runnin' his best an' gappin' fer breath.</l>
							<l>He knowed full well deliverance lay</l>
							<l>In stickin' close t' that old gray.</l>
							<l>A swingin' limb hit his face a slap,</l>
							<l>A brier snatched off his coonskin cap--</l>
							<l>Th' only cap he had, an' yit,</l>
							<l>He couldn't stop t' rescue it.</l>
							<l>On he floundered, an' ever on,</l>
							<l>Heavin' great sobs, his breath clean gone,</l>
							<l>He struggled an' staggered an' follered along</l>
							<l>Though certain sure th' mare wuz wrong.</l>
							<l>Then thoo a thicket he plunged at last</l>
							<l>T' stop in wonder an' stare aghast--</l>




							<pb id="VAB8205-080" n="[80]"/>

							<l>There wuz th' clearin'; th' cabin stood</l>
							<l>Jist yander at th' aidge o' th' wood;</l>
							<l>An' there wuz Hdson an' Marthy, too,</l>
							<l>Wringin', her hands an' laughin' thoo</l>
							<l>Tear-soaked eyes that welcomed him.</l>
							<l>There wuz Nin' Steele an' there stood Jim</l>
							<l>Bigger an' th' marryin' Squire--</l>
							<l>Feller named Jake McIntyre--</l>
							<l>Jim Galletly an' Hart an' Dunn</l>
							<l>An' all th' neighbors--ever' one.</l>
							<l>An' "looky yander! Drat my stars!"</l>
							<l>Th' cows wuz at th' feedin' bars!</l>
							<l>Joe heaved a sigh that shuk his frame</l>
							<l>An' staggered a step er two an' blame</l>
							<l>My trap, he looked--an' stopped--</l>
							<l>An' then, 'y jing sir, down he dropped</l>
							<l>Like a poll-axed beef 'n' there he laid.</l>
							<l>Marthy screamed an' then she made</l>
							<l>About two jumps an' retch his side</l>
							<l>An' grabbed him in her arms an' cried,</l>
							<l>An' tuk on scan'lous--petted him--</l>
							<l>Ruffled his hair-an' called t' Jim</l>
							<l>T' bring some water-an' rubbed his han's,</l>
							<l>An' kissed his face, an'--oh, my lan's--</l>
							<l>I dunno what she didn't do</l>
							<l>Till Joe showed signs o' comin' to</l>
							<l>An' set up, kinda mystified,</l>
							<l>While Marthy jist knelt there an' cried</l>
							<l>An' laughin' at him thoo her tears--</l>
							<l>Hysteric mixture, joy an' fears.</l>
							<l>Joe wuz up in about three shakes</l>
							<l>Of a lamb's tail; then he takes</l>
							<l>Marthy in his arms like he's fergot</l>
							<l>They's other folks there on th' spot,</l>
							<l>Er jist don't care--guess that's what</l>
							<l>We'd orter say, as like as not.</l>
							<l>Joe swapped his tattered workday clo'es</l>
							<l>Fer his weddin' suit, an' goodness knows</l>
							<l>Them boots looked queer t' say th' least--</l>
							<l>Jist tan leather an' not been greased</l>
							<l>Er colored. Too big 'n th' top</l>
							<l>They seemed disposed t' kinda lop</l>
							<l>Over sideways, gee an' haw.</l>
							<l>Joe looked funny 'nuff, but shaw,</l>

						<lg>
							<l>There's a little old shoemaker lives in our block</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Who works right ahead like a Seth Thomas clock;</l>
							<l>He goes to work early and quits his work late</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Day in and day out--never misses a date.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He sits at his bench with his long apron tied</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Tight 'round his waist; with his tools at his side--</l>
							<l>His hammer, his last, his knife and his awl;</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And he trims and he shaves while the leather chips fall.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>I stop at his door, he looks up with a grin,</l>
							<l>A cheery "good morning" and "won't you come in?"</l>
							<l>He'll chat with you, laugh, anytime of the day,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">But while he is chatting, keeps pegging away.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He says that's his motto to carry him through</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">And it fits everybody, whatever we do;--</l>
							<l>Be sure of your goal as you meet life each day,</l>
							<l>And once your goal's set, keep pegging away.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>There's one Jim Whitcomb Riley yarn that's never yit been told</l>
							<l>An' I better give it to you now, afore it gits too old;</l>
							<l>Twuz a crowd of Indynoplus friends that Riley once brought down</l>
							<l>Fer a picnic on th' Fletcher place out here adjoinin' town.</l>
							<l>These city chaps, so Riley said when he writ t' Uncle Cal,</l>
							<l>Was comin' down t' gether nuts; an' each one and his gal</l>
							<l>Was countin' on a splendid time--no ifs ner ans ner buts--</l>
							<l>An' ever'one was figgerin' on a bag o' hick'ry nuts.</l>
							<l>Cal Fletcher liked t' play a joke as well as anyone</l>
							<l>An' saw his chance, with Riley's crowd, t' have a batch o' fun;</l>
							<l>He called his hired man an' boys an' sent 'em sever'l days</l>
							<l>To his hundred-acre Flatwoods farm out east o' here a ways.</l>
							<l>Th' nuts was layin' thick as flies out in them hick'ry woods</l>
							<l>An' Fletcher told his hired han's 'to bring in all they could.</l>
							<l>They searched th' Flatwoods over, scratched among th' leaves an' grass</l>
							<l>An finely got 'em gethered an' brought 'em in at last,</l>
							<l>They hauled 'em in to Fletcher's--near half a wagon load--</l>
							<l>An' Uncle Calvin chuckled as himself an' helpers throwed</l>
							<l>Th' hull blame kit an'b'ilin'--broadcasted, if yuh please--</l>
							<l>Till th' nuts was layin' shoe mouth deep in a grove of simmon trees.</l>
							<l>Fletcher th'owed his ole straw hat an' jist rared back an' laughed</l>
							<l>Till th' hired man an' th' fam'ly thought th' old man gone plumb daft;</l>
							<l>An' then he told 'em--laughin'--th' why of what he'd done,</l>
							<l>Swore 'em all t' silence an' t' wait an' watch th' fun.</l>
							<l>Th' Riley crowd come troopin' in one bright October day,</l>
							<l>An' nothin' seemed t' please 'em but t' pitch in right away</l>
							<l>A-huntin' nuts. So Uncle Calvin, squeezin' back a grin,</l>
							<l>Tuk 'em out an' showed 'em an' told 'em "Jist wade in,"</l>
							<l>Wade in they did an' went t' work with basket, bag an' sack,</l>
							<l>A-grabbin' nuts jist right an' left; each one humped his back</l>
							<l>An' grabbled up th' shagbarks with shouts of joy an' glee</l>
							<l>But never one o' them city chaps tuk time t' see a tree.</l>
							<l>Riley watched 'em quite a spell an' chuckled now an' then,</l>
							<l>While peepin' f'm th' haymow wuz Fletcher's hired men;</l>
							<l>They watched th' thing with eager eyes, a-laughin' up their sleeves</l>
							<l>Th' way them folks was scratchin' 'mongst th' dead persimmon leaves.</l>
							<l>Then Riley beckoned Uncle Cal an' tuk him off one side</l>
							<l>An' whispered to him, laughin', "They's jist one thing that I'd</l>
							<l>Like t' have you tell me 'bout these hick'ry-simmon trees,"</l>
							<l>But Fletcher laughed an' whispered back:"Jist leave 'em on their knees."</l>

							<l>At each good deed of boy or girl</l>

							<l>And thus each week of earthly time</l>
							<l>I lose a year or so.</l>
							<l>"And so, a long as time shall last,</l>

							<l>When little girls and little boys</l>
							<l>Act just the best they know;</l>
							<l>But when they're bad or when they cry</l>
							<l>My years climb up a score;</l>
							<l>So you be good end help me live</l>

							<hi rend="b">A Nightmare.</hi></head>

						<lg>
							<l>Once upon a midnight dreary, Willie Bryan weak and weary,</l>
							<l>Sought his couch in fruitless hope that he would sweetly sleep and snore,</l>
							<l>But he tossed in troubled slumber and dreams came in endless number,</l>
							<l>And he gazed in awe and sadness at his sword above the door;</l>
							<l>At his sword and his commission idly resting 'bove the door,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">--And he feebly, deeply swore--</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>To the people he had spoken, using silver as the token,</l>
							<l>Of the good that he could do them with his little silver mint,</l>
							<l>And he poured forth floods of language, sweeping, tidal waves of language;</l>
							<l>In a cataract of language talked he to them without stint.</l>
							<l>But his talk was not ALL SILVER as it was four years before--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">There was this time something more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>He said things about our navy, sailing seas all blue and wavy,</l>
							<l>Claiming lands we had no right to--islands more than he could count:</l>
							<l>Islands to the eastward lying where heathen banners should be flying;</l>
							<l>This he talked and talked and talked of--this, the issue paramount,</l>
							<l>His talk was Anti-Annexation--Porto Rico's cash taxation;--</l>
							<l>Wept some tears for Aguinaldo--tears of pity, nothing more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But he had no words of pity for the vast white-tented city,</l>
							<l>Where the dead sleep in intrenchments that deep sleep of Evermore;</l>
							<l>How the brave blue coats died smiling, while he coward, was beguiling</l>
							<l>Idle moments writing speeches to be heard the country o'er;</l>
							<l>And his new sword hanging listless on a peg above the door--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Hanging IDLY--nothing more.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Oh! that sword and that commission! and his sins of rank omission;</l>
							<l>And his resignation written while his troops were breaking camp!</l>
							<l>Do you wonder that he tumbled in his sleep and deeply grumbled</l>
							<l>At that sword and that commission hanging there above the door</l>
							<l>And his resignation hidden, to all prying eyes forbidden;</l>
							<l>Deep within his trunk 't was laying hid from sight forevermore,</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Double-locked forevermore.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>As he tosseed in restless slumber mocking dreams in endless number,</l>
							<l>Mocking dreams came by the dozen, aye they came sixteen to one;</l>
							<l>And a ghost-form Jeffersonian, cried in tones deep and stentorian,</l>
							<l>"How about Louisiana bought in eighteen hundred three?</l>
						</lg>




						<pb id="VAB8205-099" n="[99]"/>

						<lg>
							<l>Then the people all cried: "Take 'er--one and one-half cents an acre?</l>
							<l>And we took 'er, Bryan, took 'er, though my power stretched till it cracked.</l>
							<l>In dreams he gave back annexations to the old back number nations;</l>
							<l>And he sliced off territory till he stood on Plymouth Rock;</l>
							<l>And he wildly gasped for water, saying things he hadn't oughter</l>
							<l>Of that Jeffersonian purchase made a hundred years before--</l>
							<l>And he shook his two fists doubled at that sword above the door--</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Shook his fists and madly swore.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>But that Nemesis pursued him and away from sweet sleep wooed him</l>
							<l>And he saw a row of dinner pails chuck full for four years more;</l>
							<l>And he cried out in his sadness, "What is hell to all this madness?</l>
							<l>If that Elephant steps on me I am done forevermore!"</l>
							<l>Thus poor Billy Bryan slumbered--ravin' on from twelve till four.</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">Simply ravin'--nothing more.</l>

							<l>I've wandered to the village Tom.</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">I've sat beneath the tree,</l>

							<l>The old Court House is altered some</l>
							<l rend="ti-2">You know we used to go</l>

							<l rend="ti-2">They pay 'em down below.</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Here stands the Court House primeval--the murmuring tax-payers and voters</l>
							<l>Stand like an adamant wall and cry out, "Investigation!"</l>
							<l>They long for the time to come when its secrets are loosed to the public;</l>
							<l>But still is the work undone, with no symptoms of ever beginning.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Here stands the Court House primeval, the Temple of Justice of Owen</l>
							<l>The Court House of brick and of mortar, one laid upon top of the other;</l>
							<l>Here in the midst of the village, surrounded by hitch-rack and shade trees--</l>
							<l>Trees of the days of the seventies, set out in the days of Ham Moffet</l>
							<l>Moffet, the Sheriff of. Owen, Sweet Owen, the State of the Hoosier.</l>
							<l>Here, under the trees in the summer, on the bald-headed lawn, and the settees,</l>
							<l>Lounge the. wiseacres of Owen, who, lounging, swap yarns and tobacco,</l>
							<l>And speak of the days "ante-bellum," the airly days" back in the thirties,</l>
							<l>When our children's grandfathers were youngsters and wore the sore toe and the
								stone bruise;</l>
							<l>Those days when the Court House was builded in the year twenty- five, by the
								masons</l>
							<l>Who worked under Hart, the contractor, chief of the masons and builders.</l>
							<l>They talked of the days when the Court Room was on the ground floor of the
								building,</l>
							<l>And the office rooms reached by a stairway that led to the story above it;</l>
							<l>They speak of the courts and the judges, and men who have been the officials,</l>
							<l>The Recorder, the Auditor, Treasurer, the Sheriff and Board of Commissioners.</l>



							<pb id="VAB8205-102" n="[102]"/>

							<l>They talk of the papers and books--the records locked tight from the public,</l>
							<l>The records of moneys and taxes paid into the funds of the County,</l>
							<l>The records of moneys expended, the whys and the wherefores and so forth;</l>
							<l>And they long for a peep at the records of the doings of bygone officials--</l>
							<l>Officials whose nests have been feathered in some unaccountable manner,</l>
							<l>Officials who clothed in fine linen, and gathered much money about them,</l>
							<l>Who rode in their chariots of gold with their coat of arms richly emblazoned,</l>
							<l>Gilded and streaked with red like the lithograph of a circus.</l>
							<l>But the mystery grows deeper and deeper while officials are still wrapped in
								silence,</l>
							<l>Silence as deep and profound as the empty slippers of dead men.</l>
							<l>They mention the century past--the cycle we've just left behind us.</l>
							<l>They speak of the month of March, bleak March of the year ninteen hundred</l>
							<l>And the appropriation of money--one thousand cold plunks, known as dollars,</l>
							<l>And then they speak of the time when the Council had gathered together,</l>
							<l>When, smokiing their black cigars, they talked of the wish of the people</l>
							<l>And murmured against the thought of spending the tax-payers money,</l>
							<l>Money which they had earned by labor incessant and galling;</l>
							<l>And they argued for and against--spoke pro and con on the question,</l>
							<l>And after much wrangling among them, decided at last on an issue,</l>
							<l>"An investigation of records to be made by an expert accountant".</l>
							<l>Containing also the proviso "not exceeding six years at the furthest"</l>
							<l>So said the Honorable Council in open session assembled;</l>
							<l>And a contract in due form was arranged and an expert accountant named
								Graffis--</l>
							<l>Graffis the friend of the gang, the "Ancient Order of Auditors"--</l>
							<l>Promised to do the work and straightway went hence without signing.</l>
							<l>The contract was thus laid aside with never the name of this Graffis--</l>
							<l>Nowhere upon its clean page is the scratch of his pen or his pencil;</l>
							<l>Gone is he now from our midst--gone without even a whisper--</l>
							<l>Never a lisp of the name of the village whereto he was going;--</l>
							<l>Gone is he now from our midst--gone as the light from a candle</l>
							<l>When caught in a draft through the casement, or snuffed with the fingers at
								bed-time;</l>
							<l>Gone from us now and we call him, while naught but the echoes give answer--</l>
							<l>Echoee that impart to us nothing--but mockingly answer back, "Graffis".</l>


							<pb id="VAB8205-103" n="[103]"/>

							<l>Still is his business undone with no symptoms of ever beginning--</l>
							<l>Thus is the matter enameled-smeared over with coatings of white- wash,</l>
							<l>Covered with costly enamel-Enameline, known to the "ancients"--</l>
							<l>Thus does the matter lie resting--finished before the beginning.</l>
							<l>And so ends Enameline's story--a tale of whitewash in Sweet Owen.</l>

						<head rend="center"><hi rend="b">Griffin's Bird</hi></head>

						<p>G. R. Griffin, editor of the Democrat, stated in one of his issues that the G. O. P.
							convention was to be postponed and likely never would be held. Mr. Griffin stated that
							he got a lot of laughs out of . the reply that followed this announcement. The parody
							on "Poe's Raven" follows:</p>

						<p rend="center"><hi rend="b">A Parody.</hi></p>

						<lg>
							<l>Once upon a storm day dreary, Griffin sat there weak and weary</l>
							<l>Musing o'er the leery prospects that his party saw before;</l>
							<l>As he sat there, nodding, napping, suddenly there came a tapping</l>
							<l>As of someone gently rapping, rapping at the sanctum door;</l>
							<l>"Wonder who it is," said Griffin, and his fingers 'gan to stiffen</l>
							<l>As he thought of some delinquent with his back pay at the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then he ambled to the portal thinking he would find some mortal</l>
							<l>Waiting with the "jingling needful" that was due in days of yore;</l>
							<l>But instead he saw the hallway--just the bare and vacant hallway--</l>
							<l>And he rubbered down the stairway till his rubber neck was sore;</l>
							<l>And he pondered and he wondered while outside it rained and thundered,</l>
							<l>And the lightning flashed and sizzled as he stood there at the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>"Tis as idle, mocking fancy--'tis a sort of necromancy</l>
							<l>Juggling my imagination as it often has before,"--</l>
							<l>As he turned back to his writing, on the window-ledge alighting;</l>
							<l>Griffin saw a bird bedraggled, wet and weary, sick and sore--</l>
							<l>Saw a bird with feathers ruffled and its fragile form all muffled</l>
							<l>In a coat of drooping plumage;--and it "tap-tapped" as before</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then did Griffin ope' the shutter and with hurry, fuss and flutter</l>
							<l>Through the window flew the birdlet weak and wounded, sick and sore;</l>
							<l>Not the least obeisance made he, not a moment stopped or stayed he</l>
							<l>But flew straight to Billy Bryan hanging near the sanctum door--</l>
							<l>To the picture of poor Bryan hanging,near the sanctum door.</l>
							<l>Perched upon the late lamented--shrieked out, "Griffin, nevermore!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Stunned was Griffin--stunned to dumbness--with a feeling 'kin to bumness,</l>
							<l>And he marvelled at the aspect of this bird so near the door,</l>
							<l>And his footsteps pottered, pottered, as around the room he tottered</l>
							<l>Thinking that, b'gosh, he had 'em as he'd never had before.</l>
							<l>"Sure it must portend disaster," and his thought ran fast and faster</l>




							<pb id="VAB8205-114" n="[114]"/>

							<l>As he gazed in awe and wonder at the bird so near the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then the bird forlorn and battered shook its feathers torn an tattered</l>
							<l>Griffin's bird so "scared and weakened", opened up to say some more;</l>
							<l>And the words that it had spoken came again in accents broken--</l>
							<l>In a wildly-weird crescendo, shrieking, "Griffin nevermore!"</l>
							<l>Cried out, "Griffin, please make mention that the G.O.P. convention</l>
							<l>Nevermore'll he held in Owen as it.used to heretofore.</l>
							<l rend="ti=2">-----Never, never, nevermore!"</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>Then rushed Griffin to the cases, pushed the workmen from their places,</l>
							<l>Grabbed a stick and set up "blarney" as he never set before.</l>
							<l>And his face was cracked with smiling as he went on there compiling</l>
							<l>What the little bird had told him as it sat so near the door:!</l>
							<l>What the weary bird had spoken in its accents weak and broken--</l>
							<l>What the "forlorn bird" had told him as it sat beside the door.</l>
						</lg>

						<lg>
							<l>And the news the bird had brought him, proved a haunting ghost that sought
								him--</l>
							<l>Sought him even in his slumbers--woke him up with "Nevermore!"</l>
							<l>Proved a Nemesis:--pursued him: and away from sweet sleep wooed him</l>
							<l>As the story books say Furies did in jolly days of yore;</l>
							<l>And in nightmares bird-beaks bit him;--boomerangs flew back and hit him,</l>
							<l>And in dreams a "crowless" rooster with the "gaps" shrieked, "Nevermore!"</l>
						</lg>
