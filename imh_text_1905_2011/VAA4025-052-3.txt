            The last thirty years of the nineteenth century formed a distinct period of literary growth in the 
                        United States
                    . Both quality and quantity advanced. Every section and nearly every state produced a
                    novelist of power, but greatest activity was evident in the South and West. In Indiana and
                    particularly in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , literature was a popular avenue of expression. It was the fashion to write, perhaps a
                    novel, poetry, essay, or editorial, or if not to write, then certainly to maintain a lively interest
                    in and appreciation of all things literary. Perhaps the democratic spirit and the triumph of
                    individual initiative furnish the explanation sought by historians and psychologists for the zest
                    with which the average Hoosier engaged in literary pursuits. No school lighted his path; he was a
                    pioneer. Though some were properly trained in the art, many followed it with a spontaneity that
                    matched their enthusiasm.
            Before the Civil War the spoken word was much more prominent in Hoosier literature than the written
                    word. Addresses by preachers, lawyers, or politicians on holidays or special occasions were the
                    characteristic literary expression.1 Though here and there a poet saw his verses
                    printed in some newspaper or periodical, the publishing of books was not common at that time in
                    Indiana.
            Although Indiana's principal claim to literary virtue is through the novel,2

                     did not at once find this medium. The earliest important
                    literary work of this period is The Soldier of Indiana in the War for the Union (
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1866), by Catharine Merrill. Except for the writings of James Whitcomb Riley, the
                    literature which has made 
                        Indianapolis
                     famous was largely produced after the turn of the century; the last quarter of the
                    nineteenth century, literarily speaking, was one of development. Factors which greatly influenced
                    this development were the presence of enterprising booksellers; a publishing house which grew out of
                    the bookselling business of Samuel Merrill and others (dating back to 1838), which still retains
                    Merrill in the firm name; and sympathetic newspaper editors who encouraged the fledgling writers,
                    chief of whom was George C. Harding, author of editorials and of a volume of Miscellaneous Writings (1882).3
            
            A decade after the Civil War 
                        Indianapolis
                     literary-minded folk were reading a wide variety of books and magazines. According to
                    the book review columns of the newspapers, such magazines as Scribner's,
                        Lippincott's, Godey's Lady's Book, The Magazine of American History,
                        Sunday Afternoon, and Wide Awake were popular.4
                    Readers were urged to subscribe for such British periodicals as the Edinburgh Review, 
                            London
                         Quarterly Review, Westminster Review, British Quarterly Review, and Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, which were being reprinted by a 
                        New York
                     firm for sale in this country.5 Books advertised ranged from
                    scientific and religious works to tales of adventure, biography, historical novels, and the Alger
                    stories. There were John Bigelow's Life of 
                            Franklin
                        
               , Charles Nordhoff's Politics for Young Americans,
                    John W. Draper's History of the Conflict Between Religion and Science,
                    and Sir Samuel Baker's, African Adventures to name a few of those
                        listed.6
                    Religion and the State by Stanhope T. Speer and Life of 
                            Israel

                by Increase N. Tarbox were among those deemed worthy of reviews.7 One of the few midwestern writers mentioned, though not a Hoosier, was Mark Twain, whose
                        Gilded Age was announced.8

            Literary activities in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , in much the same manner as those in music, were sponsored and encouraged by clubs. The
                    churches, schools, and colleges generally maintained literary societies or clubs which met regularly
                    to listen to papers, discussions, or debates on important literary figures, on prominent political
                    or moral topics of the day, or to study the works of leading writers. The two most outstanding
                    literary clubs were not sponsored by a church or school, but each was an independent group which
                    sought to encourage creative literary activity in the form of original papers presented to the club
                    by various members: the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club, founded in 1875, and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Literary Club (for men), organized in 1877. Earlier than either of these was the
                    College Corner Club established in 1872. Including both men and women in its membership, it was
                    probably the first mixed literary club in the state.9 In 1874 a new literary
                    association was formed in the northern part of the city with only men admitted to membership.10 In 1877 the Hawthorne Literary Club was holding meetings,11 and in 1878 the 
                        Plymouth
                     Literary Club secured lecturers who appeared at 
                        Plymouth
                     Church.12 During the latter year the Union Literary Society,
                    colored, sponsored by the Second Baptist Church, held several meetings at which topics of special
                    interest to Negroes were debated. These debates were usually preceded by some form of entertainment
                    which often included vocal and instrumental music.13
            
            In the absence of the numerous and varied forms of entertainment familiar to folk of the
                    mid-twentieth century, these clubs performed a social as well as a cultural and educational service.
                    The College Corner Club, organized in the old 
                        Butler
                     University neighborhood east of College Avenue and north of Forest Home Avenue (now
                    13th Street), included in its membership all sorts of professional people—judges,
                    lawyers, ministers, physicians, and teachers, as well as housewives. Mary Colgan and Mary E.
                    Nicholson, both teachers, took the lead in its organization. Its meetings were notable for
                    "free discussion, literary flavor and social

                     took "his first flight as a poet when a member of this club."14
            
            This neighborly group helped open the way for organization of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club in 1875.15 On February 18, eight ladies met
                    at the home of Martha Nicholson McKay "for the purpose of organizing a Woman's
                        Club."16 A literary or cultural objective was not at once evident,
                    for the first few programs were decidedly domestic in character. Mrs. McKay stated in her papers:
                    "Lest our little craft should sink in an unchartered sea, the first programs were designed
                    to quiet the fears of the anxious."17 On the club's tenth
                    anniversary she stated: "I know that from a sincere desire to help women into a recognition
                    of the possibility of reconciling intellectual and domestic work, this club was formed."18 Years earlier she had put the club's purpose differently. When a
                    distinguished rabbi upon hearing about the club had said disapprovingly, "Sarah's
                    place is in her tent," Mrs. McKay quickly replied, "Oh yes, we know that. We only
                    want her to have a window in it."19 But during the first years, its
                    programs gradually became less domestic and by 1885 had changed completely to the varied character
                    of its current programs, some of which are extremely intellectual.20
            
            One of the original members of the Woman's Club was Mrs. Edwin Thompson, later Mrs. Theodore
                    L. Sewall, whose name and organizing influence were found in the beginnings of many cultural
                    movements in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . She was the only one of the founders of the Woman's Club who was a university
                    graduate, having been granted a bachelor's degree by Northwestern University in 1866, and
                    in 1871, a master's degree from the same institution. "Few young women at that
                    time could claim such a distinction."21 She was also a member of the
                    College Corner Club. Mrs. Thompson came

                        Franklin
                    , Indiana, and soon after that both of them were teaching in the high school.22 She was a member of the committee appointed to draft articles for the club
                    constitution and was chosen vice-president at the first meeting. During the summer of 1875 Mrs.
                    Thompson went with her husband to 
                        Asheville
                    , 
                        North Carolina
                     , for the benefit of his failing health, but the journey was in vain, for he died the
                    following year of tuberculosis.23
            
            A list of Woman's Club members during those first years speaks "eloquently that the
                    town, as well as the club, was in the making, because they are the same names that are in the annals
                    of many initial efforts toward improved social conditions and better cultural advantages for 
                        Indianapolis
                     of that time."24 The club had broad cultural aims, and
                    though literary study and endeavor have played an important part in its programs, the members have,
                    through the years, participated in many other forms of cultural activities.
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Literary Club in Article II of its consituation stated: "The object of this
                    club shall be social, literary and aesthetic culture."25 One criterion
                    for judging the success of an organization in attaining its objective lies in the quality and
                    achievements of its membership. Meredith Nicholson, writer and member of the club, declared that it
                    "has illustrated perhaps better than any other expression of the life of Indiana, the
                    quality of the men who have dominated there in the last three decades. In a State where not to be an
                    author is to be distinguished, the members have written and read their essays in that spirit of true
                    cultivation which takes its aspirations and attainments as a matter of course, and not too
                    seriously. A president and a vice-president of the 
                        United States
                     have been on the club's rolls, as have cabinet officers, senators in Congress,
                    and foreign ministers; but literary and ethical questions, oftener than political problems, have
                    vexed its discussions, and it has been more interested as a society in Newman, Arnold, and Emerson,

            Organized January 10, 1877, at the home of John D. Howland, with its membership limited at first to
                    fifty, the club met for five months at homes of the members, then moved into a club room in the
                    Halcyon Block at the northwest corner of 
                        Delaware
                     and 
                        New York
                     streets, which remained its meeting place until December, 1879.27
                    Meetings were held weekly, at first on Saturdays, but since 1879 on Mondays.28
            
            That there was a desire among professional people to maintain and encourage literary study and
                    activity, at least within their own circle, was indicated by the large proportion of members
                    representing the various professions, such as physicians, lawyers, clergymen, and teachers. Two
                    charter members, Charles Evans, formerly of 
                        Boston
                    , and John D. Howland, were also interested in the development of a public library.
                    Evans had been brought to 
                        Indianapolis
                     purposely to organize the library and Howland had had a part in organizing the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Library Association, forerunner of the present city library.29 The
                    wide variety of topics to be found in their early programs indicates their breadth of interests, but
                    after the first years the subjects treated became more strictly literary in nature.30 From the beginning meetings were held in an atmosphere of considerable informality but with
                    strong emphasis on high literary standards. The frank criticism to which a paper and its author were
                    subjected not only furnished entertainment for the members, but at the same time challenged writers
                    to their best efforts.
            In the general field of letters during this decade, there were few writers of much importance, and
                    none who achieved high rank in the literary world. Sarah Parke Morrison, first woman graduate of
                    Indiana University, came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1875 to engage in literary work.31 Mrs. Hetty Athon Morrison
                    received mention as a "graceful and forcible writer" whose book entitled My Summer in the Kitchen was

                        demand.33
            
            Of all forms of literary expression, poetry was the most popular. Ben D. House was still active, as
                    was Mrs. Sarah T. Bolton, of whom it was said that she "probably [had] done more than any
                    other lady to enhance the literature and particularly the poetic reputation of Indiana."34 Another, Mrs. Mary E. Nealy, had been well known in 
                        Indianapolis
                     for her poetry a little earlier, from 1858 to 1863, but during the seventies lived in 
                        Washington
                    , D.C., and achieved high rank there as an art critic.35
            
            "The literary career of J. W. Riley … has been watched with an interest that is
                    unfolding in admiration as the evidences of undoubted genius accompany the successive products of
                    his pen. His 'Flying Islands of the Night' from title to final monologue
                    … shows promise of future greatness. Mr. Riley has industry, which is one of the
                    attributes of genius, and its sober exercise can win for him a high place. He should devote himself
                    with unflagging zeal to productions really worthy of the talents he has in his keeping."36 So stated the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         News in 1878, forecasting the public regard for the "Hoosier
                    Poet" which later grew into an attitude of reverence in his home state. Even those who are
                    inclined to scoff at Riley's work as literature and at the Riley "legend"
                    which has developed cannot overlook his importance in the literary scene of Indiana and his
                    influence on popular thought there as well as in the national scene.
            Riley had wanted to be an actor, but finding that impossible, since he could not bring himself to
                    conform to conventions of the stage, decided to write pieces that could be read effectively from the
                    platform. Keeping his audience always in mind, he endeavored to get dramatic quality into his poetry
                    and sketches.37 These were read by the author

                     who had schooled himself in the technique of the stage, but by
                    casting aside conventional movements and allowing his own peculiar genius full scope, he achieved a
                    reputation for characterization and dramatization which brought him fame.38
            
            His platform career began in 1874 in the small town of Monrovia in 
                        Morgan County
                    . Surviving that failure, he tried again in Anderson the next year with results which
                    were not much better. Then began a period of two years of going from one small Indiana town to
                    another giving recitals in churches and schoolhouses, all the while rigidly training himself in the
                    art of impersonation.39 Years later in 
                        London
                    , Benoit Coquelin, the great French actor, is reputed to have remarked to Sir Henry
                    Irving after hearing Riley, " 'Henry, you and I have been studying all these years
                    how to act, but here is a young man out of the West, who knows all we know by nature.'
                        "40 This was consummate art. He had natural talent, for as a child
                    of seven he amazed his parents with imitations of a Bohemian peddler.41 Moreover
                    he developed and supplemented this talent by careful attention to all the rules of dramatic art and
                    delineated character with what appeared to the audience no effort at all. He had learned the little
                    things that count, for he once remarked to a friend, "If you want to play the part of an
                    old man—any sort of old man—just keep a stiff upper lip; that's the
                    most important single thing to remember."42
            
            At 
                        Kokomo
                     in February, 1878, Riley gave a program that turned the tide in his career.
                    "Nothing succeeds like success," and others followed to make certain his career as
                    a public reader. The 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Journal commented that "the Hoosier Poet is getting talked about and
                    quarrelled over—a sure sign that there is something in the man."43 At the Masonic Hall in 
                        Greenfield
                     the local literary club gave an entertainment for his benefit. It was a financial
                    success and Riley's part was performed excellently. "Riley is a master hand at the

                     may well be proud of her poet."44
            
            Having earned his spurs, Riley made bold to include 
                        Indianapolis
                     in his "lecture tour" in 1879. He first appeared in March. Little
                    attention was given to this in the press, though it was said he made a hit in his performance at the
                        Grand.45 In the fall a benefit was planned at the new Park Theater. He was
                    to be the featured performer and prepared for it with some misgivings. The whole thing seemed risky,
                    for the enormous sum of $50.00 must be paid for the hall.46 But Dan
                    Macauley was behind it and whatever he "undertook for other people … always
                        succeeded."47 The performance was announced for October 16, and a
                    week before that Riley came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to make final preparations. The week of suspense was a great strain, for he realized
                    that he was "on the spot." 
                        Indianapolis
                     must be won. Success or failure this time would fix his destiny for all Indiana.48
            
            Advance publicity in the press was quite favorable, yet there was a note of skepticism. It was said
                    that he stood without challenge at the head of Indiana poets, but that "he is young, almost
                    boyish in appearance, and lacks that maturity in his methods which time and study only can
                    impart," but in time "he will take a high rank among the literary men of the
                        country."49
            
            Finally the day came, and Riley was a complete success. The audience paid tribute by demanding an
                    encore, then remaining until they were dismissed by Dan Macauley. Only one adverse criticism was
                    offered. Riley had apparently not fully realized the limits of the room and some in the rear seats
                    had not heard him. The audience was said to be first-class in spite of the bad weather and the
                    presence of a circus in town.50
            
            That same year, in the summer of 1879, Riley contemplated breaking into print. In collaboration with

                     Hartwell Catherwood he planned "an ingenuous mixture
                    of prose and verse."51 This air castle did not materialize, for each
                    writer was a bit too impetuous; teamwork between them was apparently impossible and Riley became
                    somewhat subdued. Urged by his friend, Rev. Myron Reed, not to rush into print but to build up a
                    more solid reputation among central Indiana towns, he waited four years for the appearance of his
                    first book.52
            
            Whether or not Riley would take his place among the famous literary figures of the nation, his place
                    in the cultural scene of Indiana, and more specifically of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , since the town became his permanent home after the fall of 1879, was now secure.
                    Scarcely any program or entertainment was complete without one or more recitations by Riley.
                    Invariably it was reported that he had captured his audience, or had been enthusiastically
                    applauded, or had been requested to give one or more encores.
            Riley's growing popularity encouraged other writers of both prose and poetry to seek fame
                    and fortune in the literary arts and helped usher in a sort of golden age in the cultural life of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Literature and the arts were to flower in an atmosphere in which culture was valued
                    for its own sake. After the advent of natural gas and the consequent industrial activity, Hoosier
                    life was dominated by commercial and financial interests. Expressions of culture then began to
                    function more and more as tools of wealth and power to aid the newly rich to achieve social or class
                    distinction. Factors which had considerable influence on the literary culture of this period were
                    the lecture course or lyceum, the growth of libraries, and the number and character of booksellers
                    and book publishers in the city.
            It is difficult for the present generation to understand the power and influence of the platform in
                    this earlier period. Many elements have combined to change both the audiences and the public
                    speakers so that the type of oratory once popular is no longer fashionable or effective. In the
                    1870's and 1880's the public auditorium and the lectern were important in the
                    dissemination of knowledge and served well as social agencies also. The lecture platform fulfilled a
                    manifold purpose involving education, entertainment, and the advancement

                     of a cause. The variety of types of lectures appearing in the
                    Hoosier capital in the 1870's reveals the nature of the purposes they served. Whether these
                    were achieved can, of course, never fully be known. An entertainer may grasp at once his
                    effectiveness, and he who promotes a cause can gauge somewhat the extent to which his propaganda has
                    been accepted; but the lecturer who would educate can never measure the results of his efforts
                    beyond the immediate interest of his listeners. One criterion in any public activity, however, is
                    the extent of its popularity.
            John C. Ridpath, the historian, stated that the real nobility of a community are those who attend
                    lectures. He described the struggles of the lecture field in the 1870's, pointing out that
                    for twenty years oratory or lecturing had been tremendously popular, especially in the wintertime.
                    With the depression of the seventies and the resulting hard times and general pessimism of the
                    populace, it seemed that lecturing became almost extinct. Great lecturers no longer appeared on the
                    platform. Later a new lyceum, more rational and more permanent, arose and flourished for a
                        generation.53 New and powerful speakers appeared to entertain and inspire
                    those who listened.
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     had its first lyceum or lecture course in 1846, sponsored by the Union Literary
                    Society, the first program of which was delivered by Rev. Henry Ward Beecher at the Second
                    Presbyterian Church.54 In 1850 Daniel Read, Robert Dale Owen, and John B. Niles
                    participated in a series of lectures sponsored by this society, with admission free to the public;
                    the responsibilities for paying the necessary expenses were assumed voluntarily by a few
                    public-spirited citizens, including Calvin Fletcher, James M. Ray, Austin W. Morris, Thomas H.
                    Sharpe, General Thomas A. Morris, and James B. Sulgrove.55 Evidently local
                    enthusiasts made use of talent from the state constitutional convention then in session.
            Naturally all normal activities were seriously curtailed by the Civil War in the 1860's. In

                     Y.M.C.A. sponsored a lecture course which included both
                    entertaining and intellectual elements.56 Later in the decade it continued to
                    sponsor its lecture course, but in order to meet the competition from various
                    "private" lecture courses planned a sustaining membership, offering the privileges
                    of the use of gymnasium and bath rooms to be included in the price of a season lecture ticket. The
                    management thus sought to please all classes by the variety of entertainment offered for the season.
                    The 1877–1878 season included Rev. James C. Fletcher in a travel lecture; Robert J.
                    Burdette, friend of Riley, who spoke on "The Rise and Fall of the Moustache;" and
                    Rev. Myron Reed on "The Bliss of Ignorance."57
            
            Lecture bureaus in the East held contracts with a wide variety of actors, entertainers, and
                    informative lecturers so that a word to the Ridpath Lyceum Bureau could secure bookings for any type
                    of public performance desired.58 Also popular at this time were the collegiate
                    interstate oratorical contests usually held in one of the theaters.59
            
            The years 1878 and 1879 were bonanza years for public speakers, bearing out the statement of
                    Professor Ridpath. Every week many lectures of all sorts were announced in the columns of the
                    newspapers. The churches, theaters, and public halls were the auditoriums for lectures on science,
                    religion, art, travel, or pure hokum. It was also the era of dramatic interpretation. Hermann Linde
                    read Macbeth entirely from memory, and his interpretation of each character was
                    pronounced wonderful.60 Mrs. Laura E. Dainty of 
                        Chicago
                     gave two programs of dramatic and humorous readings in 1879, in April at 
                        Plymouth
                     Church and in June at the Grand Opera House. Each time her audience was said to be one
                    of the best 
                        Indianapolis
                     could produce and she was declared to be one of the best readers of her time. In her
                    second program orchestral accompaniment was added, but its loudness detracted from the effectiveness
                    of her reading.61 Mrs. Coleman Pope, long a theatrical performer, had taken up
                    residence in the Hoosier capital to add to the number of those

                     who might be labelled as a local stock company. In 1878 she
                    gave a reading or lecture which was a benefit.62 Mrs. Amy Dunn also lectured in
                    1878 and again in 1879.63 In the advertising columns of the News in 1879, Mrs. Hattie A. Prunk offered her services as an elocutionist and dramatic reader
                    for church and literary programs.64
            
            As noted above, the depression years were marked by inactivity of the lyceum and lecture platform.
                    The year the depression was felt in full force in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1876, only one lecture was mentioned, and that a scientific one.65
                    Earlier in 1874 and 1875 few had been offered, and their topics are indicative of the caution and
                    fear which gripped the upper social and economic classes. In 1874 Robert Collyer, noting a small but
                    good audience at Masonic Hall, switched his subject to "Clear Grit," expressing
                    the idea that an honest day's work would bring out one's best qualities, and that
                    the important things were home, family, and contentment.66 A little later a
                    large audience at Masonic Hall listened to a lecture on astronomy and at the same time the
                    Metropolitan Theater was jammed for a play and a variety show.67 In 1875 but
                    three lectures were mentioned—one on temperance, one on Lincoln by Schuyler Colfax, and a
                    program of readings and recitations by Mrs. Fred Wright.68
            
            By 1877 the worst aspects of the depression had somewhat subsided, and the effect is noted at once in
                    the increased number of lectures. A popular program was held at Harmonic Hall which included
                    features by Rev. James C. Fletcher, ex-Governor Thomas A. Hendricks, Rev. William A. Bartlett, Rev.
                    Myron W. Reed, Rev. Edward A. Bradley, and Dr. William B. Fletcher.69 Rev.
                    Fletcher had already delivered a series of lectures on Pompeii earlier that year in connection with
                    an exhibition of Pompeiian ceramics.70 That winter Riley's good friend,
                    Robert J. Burdette of the 
                        Burlington

                        Iowa
                    , Hawkeye delivered his famed humorous lecture entitled, "The

                    one was weary though for two and one-half hours Burdette talked through his nose in a thin,
                    effeminate voice!71
            
            The lectures in the 1878–1879 season included one by Robert G. Ingersoll, the noted
                    agnostic, with the Grand packed to hear him.72 Rev. Otis A. Burgess, president
                    of Butler University, replied to Ingersoll in the Masonic Hall about three weeks later and attracted
                    an audience of 400 despite the bad weather.73 Other lectures that season covered
                    scientific and literary topics.
            High on the list of causes being promoted in the 1870's were temperance and women's
                    rights, and prominent among their advocates were Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe,
                    and Mrs. Mary A. Livermore. Both Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Livermore were entertained several times by the
                    College Corner Club. Twice Mrs. Livermore surprised her audience by speaking on a literary topic,
                    not once mentioning the question of women's rights.74
            
            In 1878 a new and unusual organization was formed, the Social Science Association.75 It was not social science as understood in the mid-twentieth century, but in a somewhat
                    different sense. At that moment it constituted a reason for the series of lectures on cooking
                    delivered by Miss Juliet Corson. Behind the movement were some of the same women who were active in
                    the College Corner and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     woman's clubs.76 It therefore might be regarded as part of
                    the general effort of women of that day to find increasing avenues for self-expression. In October,
                    1879, membership totalled 130, less than half of whom were wholly interested in the
                    association's aims and projects, which were to "investigate questions arising in
                    the daily experience" of the members.77 Perhaps social was the proper
                    adjective, but in its lighter sense. Programs held were in the form of lectures,

                     and so contributed to that phase of the culture of the
                        decade.78
            
            No better indication of the cultural temper and achievement of a people is readily available than the
                    growth and development of libraries. For the country as a whole, the first three-quarters of the
                    nineteenth century showed very little progress in this direction, but in the last quarter there was
                    a great increase in the number and size of libraries. An increase in population and wealth, the
                    spread of education and culture, and the work of librarians with enlarged vision all contributed to
                    this growth. The 1876 Exposition at 
                        Philadelphia
                     , which did so much to stimulate activities in other cultural fields, had a share in
                    the development of libraries, for out of this meeting of minds grew the American Library Association
                    and the establishment of the Library Journal.
               79
            
            In 1870 
                        Indianapolis
                     had three libraries and a Library Association, but no free public library. The State
                    Library, occupying the west half of the first floor of the State Capitol with its 25,000 volumes,
                    was established in 1825, with its circulation restricted to state officials and legislators. It
                    operated on an extremely small budget furnished by action of the state legislature. The 
                        Marion
                     County Library, established in 1844, had 2,000 volumes and a fund of $2,000
                    with accruing interest. The township library was an indifferent collection of about 1,000 volumes
                    under the supervision of the township trustee. Of these three, none had adequate means or reason to
                    fulfill the purpose of a public library. The basis for such an institution was to be found in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Library Association, a group of public-spirited citizens who banded together in 1869,
                    each pledged to contribute a sum of $150.00 in annual payments of $25.00.
                    Within a few months' time 3,000 volumes were collected, the circulation of which remained
                    restricted to the membership.80
            
            A need for circulating literature had been felt in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1865, as evidenced by the Young Men's Library Association, whose directors
                    that year were Abraham C. Shortridge, Henry Lieber, Volney T. Malott, John M. Youart,

                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library is interwoven with that of the public school system. From the beginning
                    it was located in the high school, and later as the library was moved into its own building, the
                    school offices moved along with it, continuing this connection to the present time. From an early
                    date, 1871, financial support for a library came from a city school tax, so that legally the library
                    has always been part of the city school system.
            In 1873 the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library was established and quarters found in the Underhill residence at 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Michigan
                     streets,82 where it remained until 1876 when, in order to procure
                    much needed larger quarters, it was moved to the old Sentinel Building at the southwest corner of
                    Meridian Street and the Circle. No change was needed until 1880 when the library was moved to the
                    southwest corner of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     streets. Here it remained until the first new library building was constructed at
                    Meridian and 
                        Ohio
                     in 1893 (now the home of its business branch and of the city school offices), later
                    making a final move to St. Clair Street between Meridian and 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , its present quarters.83
            
            The library began with a collection of 15,560 volumes.84 At the end of the first
                    year, 5,220 readers held registration cards, and a total of 101,281 books had circulated.85 In 1876 a newspaper reading room was opened86 and that
                    year 20,766 books and 1,831 pamphlets were reported, with over 10,000 readers registered.87 Two years later the library's holdings were 27,900 volumes and 2,241
                    pamphlets. The circulation that year was 192,076, an increase of some 90,000 over the previous year.
                    In four years' time the record showed a total loss of only 57 books, total expenditures of
                    $64,392.17, and an

                     average cost of circulating a book of 2.42 cents.88 It was boasted that no library in the country showed a greater proportionate use of
                    books, and only 
                        Boston
                    , 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and 
                        Chicago
                     had a larger annual circulation.89
            
            By 1879 French and German books were added to the library's holdings, making a total of
                    34,649 books and pamphlets with a circulation for the year of 177,503 books and periodicals.90
            
            Library reports show that in 1877–1878 the aggregate number of books and pamphlets
                    circulated was 192,076, the largest figure since the library opened in 1873. The next year,
                    1878–1879, while there was a steady increase in the accessions of the library, the
                    circulation was 14,573 less than the preceding year. During 1877–1878, 2,209 new
                    registration cards had been issued while only 2,032 were issued in 1878–1879. Circulation
                    figures dropped again in 1880, and still more in 1881. The report stated further that this coincided
                    with a general falling off of library circulation throughout the country and was thought to be
                    caused by a general revival of trade and industry and a wide demand for labor of all kinds.91 At this time a relaxation of rules indicated a desire on the part of the
                    library's officers to make its book collection of greater service. Now each patron was
                    permitted to borrow three books at a time instead of one. Before this time only persons over twenty
                    were permitted to read bound volumes of illustrated papers; now, anyone, old or young, might use
                        them.92
            
            From the first year of its establishment the library steadily outgrew its quarters. The value of
                    connection with and nearness to the school was realized, but at the same time it appeared
                    impractical to attempt to house such a rapidly growing institution with another which was constantly
                    expanding. Two questions demanded solution—what sort of new quarters should be sought,
                    and their proper location in the city. The Circle was regarded by many as the proper site for a
                    public library as equally available to all parts of

                     the city. Although more people lived south of 
                        Washington
                     Street, four out of five books in circulation were borrowed by those north of this
                        street.93 Someone suggested that a library and a soldiers' monument
                    be combined together in the Circle as a fitting and appropriate memorial.94
            
            During 1878–1879 while the library officers with their limited funds were searching for
                    adequate quarters to house the books and provide suitable space for patrons, two offers were made
                    concerning a new library building. Mrs. James M. Hume proposed a new building at Meridian and 
                        Ohio
                     streets which would be 120 by 70 feet in modern Gothic style of brick and cut stone and
                    would provide space for 100,000 volumes. A few months later William H. English offered to erect a
                    building on the Circle, its front 40 feet wide, extending 150 feet back to the alley, and 50 feet
                    wide at the rear. Its fagade would be of iron and glass and the remainder of substantially fireproof
                    material. The library would be on the ground floor with space for school offices elsewhere in the
                    building. If the school board would accept the offer, English planned to extend the building in the
                    same style around the Circle from McKernan's residence to the church, which would make one
                    of the finest buildings in the city. He offered to donate $5,000 if the school board
                    would purchase the building, or he would lease it for twenty years at $2,400 a year,
                    which was $600 less than the rent the library was then paying.95
            
            The plan was thoroughly discussed by the press and from time to time English altered his proposed
                    plans at the suggestion of the school commissioners.96 Objections and criticisms
                    were offered and more plans were desired by the board to compare with the generous offers already
                        made.97 Finally, because of the spirit of carping and misrepresentation
                    English withdrew all offers he had made.98 though he had planned ultimately to
                    give the building and grounds to the city. No further mention was made of Mrs. Hume's offer
                    to construct a building at Meridian and 
                        Ohio
                     streets.

            Meantime the State Library was having its difficulties. Surprising losses were discovered, though
                    circulation was restricted to a favored few. Valuable sets were broken and were not then
                        replaceable.99
            
            In addition to readers who held library cards and made use of the public library's
                    collection of books and periodicals, many persons were building up private collections of books. The
                    presence of bookstores in 
                        Indianapolis
                     with their large stocks of books indicates such interest. Literary-minded persons
                    frequented these stores, spending much time around the stove in the back room discussing the merits
                    of recent publications.100 Long lines of persons might be seen standing or
                    waiting in rigs before the bookstores on magazine day when the first copies of the monthly issues of
                        Scribner's or the Atlantic arrived.
            Among the early booksellers who helped create this literary atmosphere were Francis M. Grouse, Herman
                    Engelbach, Samuel Merrill, and Bowen, Stewart and Company. Herman Engelbach had come to 
                        St. Louis
                     from 
                        Germany
                     in 1852 at the age of eighteen and in 1863 came on to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where he established a bookstore at Meridian and 
                        Washington
                     streets. He specialized in legal and medical books and kept on hand a stock of 30,000
                    volumes, large for that day. Such persons as John Collett, geologist, John B. Dillon, historian,
                    General Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Max Leckner, musician, were frequent callers at
                        Engelbach's.101
            
            Francis M. Crouse, a physician from 
                        Lafayette
                    , came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the early 1870's to join the Merrill and Company firm and later opened his
                    own shop at 40 North 
                        Delaware
                     Street. He collected rare historical pamphlets and nature books, issuing semi-annual
                    catalogues of rare books. His store had an atmosphere of learned leisure and such persons as Eliza
                    B. Browning, Professor Demarchus C. Brown, and Jacob P. Dunn were often seen there.102
            
            Samuel Merrill, born in Peacham, 
                        Vermont
                    , had come to Corydon in 1821, where he became state treasurer and

                     later moved the State Library to 
                        Indianapolis
                     along with the state's funds. His book-selling activities may have begun as
                    early as 1823.103 The business he started was later continued by his son, Samuel
                    Merrill, Jr., and by the end of the 1870's the firm emerged after several organizational
                    changes as Merrill, Meigs and Company.104
            
            Bowen, Stewart and Company, who later joined forces with the Merrill firm, were organized in 1854,105 but could trace their origin back to 1838.106 Merrill,
                    Meigs and Company began publishing activities as early as 1855 with the publication of Indiana Reports, Vol. V, by Judge Isaac Black-ford. Throughout the 1870's, they
                    continued as booksellers and as publishers of law books, adding elementary school texts to their
                    list. Midway in the next decade the firm underwent a great change. New policies and new partners
                    both contributed to the innovation, and the first important publishing firm of 
                        Indianapolis
                     was well launched.
            Early books published in 
                        Indianapolis
                     were largely utilitarian. Although citizens of the Hoosier capital greatly admired the
                    literary works of English writers, and American works were also popular, the few local imprints
                    displayed little creativity.107 No doubt the partial crippling of business by
                    the depression of the seventies had affected this field also. According to the recent bibliography,
                        Indiana Authors and their Books, of the 949 authors listed, 111 may be
                    identified with 
                        Indianapolis
                     by virtue of being born in the Hoosier capital or spending an extended period of
                    residence there exclusive of school attendance. Of this group of 111, seven belonged to the decade
                    of the 1870's, publishing a total of six books during those years, three of which are 
                        Indianapolis
                     imprints. One of these is a biography, and the other two, histories: William Wesley

            In the eighties all Indiana burned with a flame of literary enthusiasm. It was the period when
                    numerous county histories appeared, perhaps because the pioneers of Indiana had become prosperous
                    old men who were ready to pay the price for being immortalized. Some Indianans were writing novels
                    in series, such as Elsie Dinsmore, The Little Colonel, and the Brownie books;109 but more were enthusiastic about poetry.
                    "For some reason, about one Hoosier in ten writes what he believes to be poetry, whether or
                    not he admits it to his friends and associates."110 Newspapers ran
                    columns of poetry; clubs offered prizes for the best poems; and in 
                        Indianapolis
                     the cloak poets, who carried canes and wrote verses with a military air, strolled up
                    and down in the neighborhood of the newspaper offices on Market Street. They read their compositions
                    to each other; sometimes the listener had been seized by the coat lapel and pushed unceremoniously
                    into the nearest doorway for the purpose. The writer, of course, expected his lines to be published
                    in the Atlantic.
               111
            
            Ben D. House was virtual poetic dictator of the Inland City in the early eighties. Meredith Nicholson
                    was "giving an imitation of a young man reading law" in William Wallace's
                    office but spent most of his time composing verses and worshipping House.112
                    Daniel L. Paine wrote poetry, as did Mrs. Sarah T. Bolton, and Riley's star was rising. One
                    was as likely to be asked his opinion of a sonnet as of a cigar. A certain judge of the 
                        United States
                     court at 
                        Indianapolis
                     was said to have the habit of locking the door of his private office and reading Horace
                    to visiting attorneys. Indeed, for many, an abiding interest had been formed, and a few years later
                    Nicholson declared, "If you do not in this provincial capital meet an author at every
                    corner, you are at least never safe from men and women who read books."113
            
            The Hoosier capital had passed the pioneer stage of its literary development, and in the eighties was
                    entering a period of preparation which was to bear much fruit. No doubt business prosperity,
                    bringing with it more leisure for study,

                     effectively increased intellectual and creative activities. 
                        Indianapolis
                     was acquiring a national reputation and some Bostonians speculated that the Inland City
                    might well be the next literary center of the country.114 But elsewhere western
                    culture was interpreted in a different manner. In 1885 the 
                        
                            Philadelphia
                         Press stated that women were more responsible for culture than men but that
                    culture in the West tended toward scientific rather than artistic pursuits. "Botanical,
                    geological and art clubs are common among women of Western cities as far back as Omaha. The Western
                    man, portly, clear-skinned and keen-eyed, may never read a page of Browning, and would not give a
                    bushel of wheat for all of Emerson's primal truths, but he can give you promptly a reason
                    for the faith that is in him on evolution, or the scientific development of the soil, or railroads
                    or of races, in words as direct and strong as bullets. The whole mental growth of the Middle and
                    Western states since the war has been coarser, perhaps, and less scholarly than that of New 
                        England
                    , but more pithy and more masculine."115
            
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     could not boast a "greatest American author," but compensation could
                    be found in the amount of literary activity and the interest and enthusiasm of large numbers of its
                    citizens. A famous English clergyman and author, Frederick William Farrar, visited 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1885 and was surprised at the erudition displayed by people of the city. He
                    declared, "So many more people in America than in 
                        England
                     are well posted on English literature." The prevalence of clubs was largely
                    responsible for this attainment, and 
                        Indianapolis
                     proudly proclaimed her literary life to be more active and healthful than that of any
                    other city in the country.116
            
            Probably no answer can be found to the question of the cause for literary development in the Hoosier
                    capital. The spirit seemed to come "not from planted seed, nor from any known means of
                        cultivation."117 No doubt societies helped create the proper
                    atmosphere for the growth of the spirit of culture, but three well-known

                     Miller, Meredith Nicholson, and Booth Tarkington, were not
                    literary-club products.118 Yet these groups did serve as feeders to the
                    community, furnishing it with a constant supply of interested and inspired participants in the field
                    of letters.
            As many as fifty literary clubs may have been functioning by the late seventies, but evidence of the
                    names of all these is not extant and to follow their development is difficult. A number are
                    mentioned in newspapers throughout the decade of the eighties, but whether they had an earlier
                    origin or how long they continued to exist is not known. The Hesperian Club is an example of one
                    which was founded earlier and must have been popular, because among the members were many prominent
                    persons, such as Catharine Merrill and May Wright Sewall.119
            
            Some literary clubs were made up of independent groups, but many were sponsored by schools and
                    churches. Early in the decade such a program was given at a meeting of 
                        St. Paul
                    's Cathedral Guild; also the Aristotelian Club and the high school Literary
                    Society held meetings at 
                        Plymouth
                     Church.120 There were the Agiliar Literary Society, a Hebrew
                    organization; the Meridian Literary and Dramatic Club which held meetings at Emerald Hall; and the
                    Circle Literary Club. The last two societies were only then in process of organization.121 The Charles Carroll Literary Club and the Qui Vive Club were both active,
                    but the dates of their organization are not known.122 Catholic young men
                    organized a club in 1885.123 The Union Literary Society had developed from the
                    Young Men's Literary Society, which had been founded as early as 1835.124 The New Century Club gave a dinner at Bates House after its meeting late in January, 1889,
                    and among the members present, all of whom were men, were many prominent citizens.125 The Paragon Literary Society, which met at Celtic Hall, was made up of young men and women
                    from the southwest part of the city, and their stated objective was "intellectual

                     and social improvement."126 The
                    Fortnightly Literary Club was also active during the latter part of the decade.127
            
            Several literary societies at this time were organized by and restricted their membership to Negroes.
                    In 1883 the Garnett Literary Society was formed, admitting both men and women as members.128 Later in the decade the Parlor Reading Circle and the Douglass Literary
                    Society were organized.129 The Harrison Literary Society which met at Jones
                        Tabernacle,130 and a group organized at the Ninth Presbyterian Church,131 complete the available list of such clubs of the decade.
            In 1889, shortly after the founding of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the Indiana
                    Union of Literary Clubs, a statewide organization, was formed. Both men and women were admitted to
                    membership; and it planned annual meetings for the discussion of all questions pertaining to social,
                    educational, or literary matters. Any organization having for its objective the study of literature,
                    art, or music, was eligible to membership. By 1900 the Indiana Union joined the General Federation.
                    Since the former was a mixed group, this combination resulted in the odd situation of men as
                    legitimate members of a woman's club.132 Similarity in the aims of both
                    groups brought about this union.133 Twenty-six societies were charter members of
                    the federation, among which were the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club, College Corner, Fortnightly Literary, and Catharine Merrill
                        clubs.134
            
            The two leading cultural organizations in the city were still the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Literary Club and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club. The former continued regular meetings through the eighties, with
                    programs devoted largely to literary topics, though other subjects such as socialism, nihilism, and
                    various phases of education, were occasionally treated.135

                                 Literary Club, 24–35.
               
                     It was an exclusive club, so much so that Meredith Nicholson,
                    himself a member, once remarked that if all who belonged were to be expelled, none could hope to be
                    readmitted. A number of famous persons were entertained, including Maththew Arnold, Dean Farrar,
                    Joseph Parker, and John Fiske.136 Women were invited to participate for the
                    first time at its fifth annual dinner held at the New Denison Hotel in 1881.137
                    Once each month a regular guest night was held when ladies were invited and urged to participate in
                        discussions.138 Its meeting place during the early eighties was the Denison
                    Hotel parlors, where members sometimes remained after the program to indulge in a bit of
                    card-playing. Such a sedate group could not continue in this manner, for their wives and society
                    both frowned on such activity. So in 1884 the meeting place was changed to the 
                        Plymouth
                     Church at Meridian and 
                        New York
                     streets, where it remained until 1901.139 Their environment could
                    then lend support to their good intentions.
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Woman's Club during the eighties continued to encourage intellectual and
                    literary activities. Its early programs had been somewhat domestic in character; but during this
                    decade they became more scholarly, and plans were made for a five-year study of English as well as
                    French history.140 Membership was limited to a hundred and each year the names
                    of many prominent women were added to the list of life members.141 The problem
                    of a permanent meeting place was solved in 1891 when the organization met in the newly completed
                    Propylaeum at 17 East North Street.142 During this period it entertained many
                    similar groups throughout the state. Such activity expressed the movement designed to improve the
                    status of women, and the forming of the State Federation in 1889 further demonstrated the trend.
                    Mrs. May Wright Sewall was influential in this state movement as well as in the national and
                    international cause of women.143 Other

            What baseball was to other boys, history was to Claude Gernade Bowers. His was the good fortune to
                    live where a boy could indulge a fondness for letters—in quiet, friendly, cultured 
                        Indianapolis
                     during the 1890's. Authors, orators, and statesmen enriched the atmosphere;
                    scholars stocked the public library with good books; and encouragement was given to independent
                    scholarship. An undersized schoolboy, Bowers was a constant visitor to the public library, a young
                    scholar who dared engage the full works of Jefferson and Hamilton. Day after day he read near one of
                    the large windows, vicariously experiencing history, politics, and public affairs. In each field he
                    was to have moments of glory of his own.

            Bowers' interest in history germinated early. Born in Hamilton County, Indiana, on November
                    20, 1878, he spent his childhood in Whitestown and 
                        Indianapolis
                    . As the only child of a merchant, he was thrown much upon himself for companionship and
                    substituted books for playmates. At the age of ten, history became his favorite reading when he
                    chanced upon a standard history of the 
                        United States
                    ; at the age of twelve, a corollary interest was awakened by a biography of Calhoun.1 Seeing the biography in a store display, he begged his mother to buy it. She
                    refused at first, thinking it beyond his years, but relented and purchased her son's first
                    biography under the persuasion of Samuel M. Ralston.2
            
            Democratic governor, senator, and presidential timber,3 Ralston was among the men
                    of affairs who influenced the

                            editions between 1850 and 1857 in

                            in five hours, but his health would not allow him to accept.

                    youth could meet during a stroll: Benjamin Harrison, lately President of the 
                        United States
                    ; James Whit-comb Riley; General Lew Wallace; Booth Tarkington; and Albert J. Beveridge,
                    the "brilliant young orator" who was Bowers' boyhood idol.4 They encouraged letters and oratory, and Bowers absorbed both.
            Literature was a compelling interest in high school. Eschewing sports and hobbies, he spent much time
                    in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library where he could choose from 1,700 titles of history and 5,200 of
                        biography.5 His reading included the biographies of American and English
                    statesmen from Jefferson to Conkling and from Pitt to Gladstone.6 Inspired by
                    the biography of Lord Henry Brougham, he and a friend decided they would imitate the Edinburgh Review. Soliciting articles from literary men across the nation, they soon had
                    enough to fill a magazine for a year, and happily took the manuscripts to a printer. When the
                    printer told them how much it would cost to publish their material, Bowers says, it "scared
                    us stiff." Forthwith they returned the manuscripts, ending their literary venture.7
            
            Bowers also had a strong interest in political oratory. A partisan from the cradle, as he facetiously
                    remarks, he came from families of unequivocal politics. His paternal grandfather had been a
                    confirmed Democrat; his maternal grandfather, an original Republican who fell at Missionary Ridge.
                    The maternal line had the greater influence, for he reached the threshold of maturity thinking he
                    was a political kinsman of Alexander Hamilton. Planning a discussion of Hamilton for the state high
                    school oratorical contest of 1898, he read the statesman's complete works. To his dismay,
                    he discovered he could never agree with him on fundamentals. It was then too late to choose and
                    prepare a new topic. Rather than submerge his own principles, he confined the discussion to
                    Hamilton's role in the ratification of the Constitution.8 The

                     presentation lacked neither in research nor in the telling, for
                    he won the state contest.
            Yet he wandered in a political no-man's land. Trying to reorient himself, he carefully read
                    the works of Jefferson, becoming a devoted Democrat and ardent Jeffersonian in the process.
            III
            While he was certain about his politics, young Bowers was uncertain about a career when he graduated
                    from Short-ridge High School in 1898. Because his father had died and left him without resources,
                    college training appeared hopeless. However, financial assistance was proffered by Addison C.
                    Harris, an attorney who once was minister to 
                         Austria 
                    . Harris also promised a position in his law firm after college, but in exchange he
                    wanted Bowers' promise to stay out of politics. Though the offer assured a comfortable
                    start in life, Bowers refused to mortgage his future. Independently he began reading law in the
                    rooms of Burke and Warrum, studying history in the public library, and preparing for politics.
            During the two years succeeding graduation, the champion orator emerged as a budding spokesman for
                    the Democratic party. By addressing a state Democratic banquet and writing his first articles for an
                    obscure magazine, he came under the notice of Samuel E. Morss, editor of the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Sentinel. Morss sent for and talked with the young man. Later, in 1900, the
                    chief editorial writer—Jacob Piatt Dunn, who was also an Indiana
                    historian—employed him as an editorial writer for the Sentinel, which
                    had been the party's organ since 1841.9
            
            Bowers was delighted with the opportunity of the editorial page. Without a scintilla of guidance or
                    training, he relied upon his great store of reading—especially of eighteenth and
                    nineteenth century oratory—in developing a method and style of his own. Neither then nor
                    subsequently was he a reporter.10 After two years in this occupation, he
                    returned briefly to the study of law.

                            New York
                        , April 23, 1954. His first assignment was far from ordinary—a commentary
                        on William Jennings Bryan's speech accepting the presidential nomination of 1900, which
                        was delivered in 
                            Indianapolis
                        .
            
            
            Trying journalism once more, he went to 
                        Terre Haute
                     where he wrote editorials for the 
                  
                            Terre Haute
                         Evening Gazette and the 
                  
                            Terre Haute
                         Star from 1903 to 1906. A well-stocked mind, fluent tongue, and devotion to
                    party earned him status in the new community. Delivering a Jackson Day speech, he impressed 
                        Terre Haute
                     as he had earlier impressed 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Within fifteen months after his arrival as an unknown newspaperman, he was nominated
                    unanimously for Congress at the age of twenty-six.
            Knowing that 1904 would be a landslide year for Theodore Roosevelt, and lesser Republicans along with
                    him, Bowers was reluctant to run. But politicians persuaded him he would obligate the party if he
                    would campaign, because a good congressional candidate would help the local ticket. With that
                    prospect, he accepted the nomination. For seven weeks he spoke twice daily throughout the
                    seven-county district and wrote editorials at night by lamplight in country hotels. Though defeated,
                    he at least had the satisfaction of having run far ahead of the ticket. Two years later the party
                    repaid its obligation. In 1906, a more auspicious year for Democrats, he was again nominated
                    unanimously for Congress, but he lost by a narrow margin.11
            
            Nevertheless, he secured a political position the same year, beginning an eleven-year absence from
                    the editorial room. Because of party considerations, he accepted appointment on the 
                        Terre Haute
                     Board of Public Improvements, serving from 1906 to 1911. From first to last he was
                    unhappy in local politics.
            An opportunity to escape the narrow municipal field came in 1911—the same year that he
                    married Sybil McCaslin, who was to bear his only child, Patricia. John W. Kern defeated Albert J.
                    Beveridge for the 
                        United States
                     Senate in 1910, and offered Bowers a position as his secretary. Planning to spend one
                    year with Kern for the experience and then resign, Bowers found himself trapped by political
                    circumstances. Kern became Democratic leader of the Senate during the first Wilson administration,
                    and was absent from the office for days at a time because of caucuses, conferences, and floor
                    strategy. Upon Bowers fell the full burden of routine work, literally making him ex
                        officio senator from Indiana. Feeling resignation would be desertion, he remained 
                  
                            11
                            Ibid.
                        
               
                     with Kern for six years. In 
                        Washington
                     he gained experience that would broaden the insight and political instinct he was to
                    bring to historical writing.12
            
            But at the moment he was unhappy in the thought that even in 
                        Washington
                     he was wasting time. Fed by the grand designs of the great writers of 
                        England
                     and America, his talent demanded expression, and his restlessness yearned for an
                    outlet.
            Voracious reading led to a book on British address,13 which aroused his interest
                    in John Philpot Curran. Curious to know whether 
                        Ireland
                     produced other speakers whose art went beyond the endowment of the Blarney Stone, he
                    studied Henry Grattan, Edward Plunkett, Henry Flood, Daniel O'Connell, Thomas Meagher,
                    Isaac Butt, and Charles Parnell. Through the study he became known to Irish partisans in 
                        Washington
                    . Invited to address a Robert Emmett meeting in the National Theatre along with Champ
                    Clark, he was introduced to an Irish audience that took him for its own. For the next ten years he
                    was booked a year in advance for a St. Patrick's Day speech.14
            
            Using his knowledge of Irish orators, studying Irish histories, and searching 
                        Dublin
                     newspapers in the Library of Congress, he started a book. At night in Senator
                    Kern's office he wrote his first volume—Irish Orators,
                    published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1916, in the author's thirty-eighth year. Publication
                    coincided with the Easter Week rebellion in 
                        Ireland
                    , which in turn helped draw attention to the new book.15
            
            At the same time, Bowers found his way back to a newspaper. After Kern was defeated for re-election
                    in 1916, his secretary returned to Indiana as editor of the 
                  
                            Fort Wayne
                         Journal Gazette from 1917 to 1923. There Bowers devoted careful attention to
                    the editorials which were to interest the editors of the 
                  
                            New York
                         World. Yet he felt compelled to write something more than transient newspaper
                        pieces.16
            
            Turning to biography upon Kern's death, he wrote the Life of John Worth
                    Kern, published in 1918 by Hollenbeck

                    historians had been unjust to Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet, he consulted Beveridge, who
                    remained a personal friend despite political differences. In Beveridge's suggestion that he
                    survey the party conflicts of the Jackson period17 he found his literary
                    challenge. When at last he had completed a two-volume work, Party Battles of the
                        Jackson Period, he submitted the manuscript to Houghton Mifflin, who were to be his
                    publishers until 1950. In seeking an appraisal of the manuscript, the publisher sent it to William
                    E. Dodd, himself a Jeffersonian, who was then teaching history at the University of 
                        Chicago
                    . Dodd recommended publication and became one of the author's strongest
                    champions. Before publishing the book, Houghton Mifflin insisted that it be pared to one volume,
                    despite the strong objections of Dodd, who felt the work deserved the broader canvas of two volumes.
            The unabashed partisanship, flowing style, and extensive research of Party Battles
                    drew national recognition and enthusiastic reviews in 1922. In the 
                  
                            Mississippi
                         Valley Historical Review, a professional journal, Dodd wrote that
                    "few historians could have written so good and true a narrative of the Jackson epoch as has
                    this layman."18
            
            With Party Battles Bowers embarked upon a career as an historian of crisis,
                    choosing his themes from the "critical periods" of history: the triumph of
                    democracy over aristocracy in the Jackson period, the epochal conflict of Jefferson and Hamilton,
                    the retrograde decade after the Civil War, the election and administrations of Jefferson, and an act
                    from the French drama of 1789.
            Coincidentally, he was elevated in his profession. Editors of the 
                  
                            New York
                         Evening World, watching American newspapers for signs of a superior writer,
                    found Bowers and transplanted him to 
                        New York
                     in 1923. Once more he was in his element—a political crusader writing for a
                    crusading newspaper.
            Even on the comfortable eminence of the World, however, he could not and would not
                    lose the compulsion to write 
                  
                     17 Bowers to Knight, 
                                New York

                     history.19 Each noon he left his office to
                    spend the lunch hour doing research in the 
                        New York
                     Public Library. Using his intimate knowledge of the works of Jefferson and Hamilton, he
                    explored their era in detail.
            The result was one of his favorite books—Jefferson and Hamilton, The Struggle
                        for Democracy in America (1925). While he had seemed self-conscious in a new discipline
                    with Party Battles, his handling of Jefferson and Hamilton was
                    comfortable and confident. Conceiving that both men had been essential in creating the nation and
                    that enemies and idolaters had created myths about each, he sought to tell the story of their
                    struggle "with complete justice to both."20 His
                    two-dimensional writing re-created the figures of the era and the era itself.
            Scholars recognized it as a significant study by a man who was at home in the period and knew his
                    characters down to their slightest peccadilloes. Samuel Flagg Bemis judged that Bowers had surpassed
                    James Parton—the biographer of Jefferson—in both knowledge and accuracy, and
                    incidentally, called on him three years later to help write the chapters on William M. Evarts in the
                    seventh volume of The American Secretaries of State and Their Diplomacy. Nathaniel
                    W. Stephenson found it "a brilliant, confident book that bowls over the general reader, and
                    leaves him gasping with delight." J. Fred Rippy thought the characters were overdrawn and
                    the period overdramatized in an otherwise "great book."21
            
            After thirty years, twenty-nine printings, and two translations, Jefferson and
                    Hamilton is respected still. Historians in 1952 placed it on the list of preferred American
                    biography from 1920 to 1950.22 Even as recently as May, 1954, the reviewer of a
                    new book on the same period mentioned it as a

                     monument in the field.23 The University of 
                        Virginia
                    , which owed its founding to Thomas Jefferson, rewarded Bowers with the Jefferson Medal
                    at 
                        Monticello
                     in 1926.
            Despite full-time participation in a competitive profession that leaves little energy for other
                    writing, Bowers was indefatigible in writing books of fresh appeal; indeed, his total production has
                    exceeded that of many professional historians whose academic assignments theoretically allow time
                    for research. In 1927 he edited the Diary of Elbridge Gerry, Jr., mildly received
                    as a welcome but minor addition to historical literature. Then he mined the ever-rich Civil War and
                    Reconstruction period.
            Combining careful scholarship with a revisionist viewpoint toward Reconstruction, he fashioned The Tragic Era, The Revolution after Lincoln (1929). Recasting familiar characters
                    in new roles of hero and villain, he rode the riptide of the iconoclastic twenties and caught the
                    public fancy. His sometimes enraged tale of Reconstruction commanded a Literary Guild sale of
                    100,000 copies, three other editions, and the scrutiny of scholars.
            Preferring to recognize Bowers as the foremost American practitioner of something called personal
                    history, but not as a professional historian, Arthur Schlesinger, Sr., found the book admirable.
                    Nathaniel W. Stephenson was disappointed by the tone of The Tragic Era after the
                    promise of Jefferson and Hamilton. He said it was "an historical
                    misfortune" that so capable a man should be "an historian turned
                    advocate." Nevertheless, he hesitated to protest all the conclusions, because much in the
                    book was sound, and he recognized that the collection of additional dispassionate data might in time
                    establish the Bowers interpretation.24
            
            From a western viewpoint, James C. Malin gave it a high place in Reconstruction historiography. He
                    wondered, however, whether it was just to consider "carpetbaggism" an exclusive
                    southern custom since western states also were then governed by gentlemen with taking ways.25 Other critics found it "an unforgettable record of an unforgivable
                    period;"

                     a failure to make out a case for Johnson's acquittal;
                    and a success, where academic historians had failed, in reaching the public.26
            
            Despite the success of the two books, Bowers has bitter memories from Jefferson and
                        Hamilton and The Tragic Era. He received information that each book in
                    its year was chosen for the Pulitzer Prize by a committee of historians who were overruled by men
                    whose political beliefs, he feels, were antagonistic to his.27
            
            In 1932 he paid tribute to the man who held his esteem from boyhood and whose friendship weathered
                    the fortunes of politics that placed the two men on opposite sides of the fence. Albert J. Beveridge
                    had been something of an idol in earlier years, and his career as 
                        United States
                     Senator from Indiana further won the admiration of Bowers. Devoting himself to a
                    scholarly biographical study, Bowers produced Beveridge and the Progressive Era,
                    another Literary Guild selection. Building upon extensive documentary materials, he told the story
                    from Beveridge's viewpoint—the viewpoint of a Republican. By thus laying aside
                    his own partisanship, which had been honestly exhibited in earlier books, Bowers stepped into a new
                    literary milieu. Unable to brandish the bull-whip of political attack, he restricted himself to
                    portraying Beveridge as orator, statesman, and biographer against the background of his times. The
                    greater reserve of Beveridge and the Progressive Era forced a sacrifice of a good
                    part of the indignation and zest that marked the earlier books, but through it another side of
                    Bowers' talent was displayed. It was the work of a historian able to subordinate his own
                    political prejudice in making a systematic examination of a historical subject. The book fully
                    justified the serious attention it received,28 since the author could analyze
                    his subject against a broad spectrum of knowledge and experience.
            Respected in two professions and treated kindly by literary critics, Bowers had reached a high point

            IV
            Besides fighting the political battles of an age gone by, Bowers fought the party battles of his own
                    age. In the Democratic state convention of 1918—where his old friend Senator Samuel M.
                    Ralston started an abortive third-term movement for Woodrow Wilson29—he was chairman of the platform committee. To him came an emissary from the
                    President, bearing three or four resolutions dealing with postwar measures, which Wilson wanted
                    adopted, their White House origin secret—a difficult assignment, to be sure, but Bowers
                    carried it off.30 For the 1920 Democratic state convention he delivered the
                    keynote speech.
            As an orator he was in frequent demand. Drawing upon his wide knowledge for something to say and upon
                    his artistry with words to say it effectively, he made audiences forget he was a "homely
                    little runt."31 He worked the same magic in the keynote address at the
                    National Democratic Jackson Day banquet in 1928. When Bowers finished speaking, he received the
                    compliment supreme from Will Rogers who rose and said: "There isn't any use of me
                    or anybody else sayin' anything more. That little fellow stole the show!"32
            
            The Jackson Day speech was but a prelude to a greater oration. Needing a man who could whip them into
                    a frenzy of party devotion, the Democrats called on him for the keynote speech at the national
                    convention in 
                        Houston
                     in 1928.33 The shy little man who blanched at the thought of social
                        appearances34 walked onto a platform and electrified an audience of
                    thousands. Drawing the campaign line between Hamiltonian privilege and Jeffersonian democracy, he
                    cried: "We battle for the honor of the nation besmirched and be-draggled

                     by the most brazen carnival of corruption that ever blackened
                    the reputation of a decent and self-respecting people."35
            
            After the triumph he sat in a hotel room with a stack of congratulatory telegrams. One from the West
                    Coast read: "A fine speech but not one bit better than in 
                        Richmond
                     thirty years ago."36 A Hoosier had remembered the 1898
                    triumph of a schoolboy orator.
            V
            The demise of the World made Bowers available for a political appointment when 
                        Franklin
                     D. Roosevelt swept into office, and three decades of party service strengthened his
                    claim to preferment. Sure he would receive appointment, his friends expected him to choose a
                    position compatible with his plain Hoosier likings. But he surprised them: he sailed for 
                        Spain
                     as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary.
            Because 
                        Spain
                     was a quiet place on the diplomatic map in 1933, some thought Madrid would be restful.
                    Too, the Spanish experiment with a republic might provide new insight for the student of the early
                    American republic. But any hope of rest was shattered by the Civil War which began in 1936. When the
                    unrest and violence commanded the concern of other governments, Bowers walked the streets of Madrid
                    in old clothes and slouch hat. Returning to the embassy, he placed a direct call to Secretary of
                    State Cordell Hull with a personal report on what the people of the streets were saying. During six
                    years in Madrid he established a reputation as "a careful, painstaking executive,"
                    and was a consistent supporter of the Loyalists, whose government he saw as a democracy opposing
                    Axis totalitarianism.37 When the Loyalists were defeated, he was transferred.
            From 1939 to 1953 he was ambassador to 
                        Chile
                    . In Santiago the seasoned American politician recognized and appreciated the political
                    maturity and intelligence of the Chileans.38 Terminating a twenty-year

                     at the age of seventy-five, he retired with an editorial
                    tribute from the 
                  
                            New York
                         Times in these words: "Claude G. Bowers … was nearly as
                    well known as the Chilean President himself. It is in no small measure due to Ambassador Bowers that
                    our relations with 
                        Chile
                     have been among the best we have enjoyed with any nation. … he was rarely
                    without a cigar—and never without a long-range grasp of political realities and a
                    deep-seated sense of humor."39
            
            During his twenty years as an ambassador, Bowers kept in close and constant touch with the situation
                    at home through correspondence with party leaders, including President Roosevelt. His personal
                    relationship with Roosevelt began in 1925 when the future chief executive wrote a review of Jefferson and Hamilton for the 
                  
                            New York
                         World. Bowers was a guest in the Roosevelt home before Roosevelt became
                    governor of 
                        New York
                    . Roosevelt asked Bowers to make the nominating speech in 1932, but the
                    latter's personal situation forced him to decline, and he voted for Al Smith. However, the
                    Roosevelt-Bowers relationship remained close. The President personally requested Bowers to conduct a
                    cross-country speaking tour in 1936 (to which Bowers had previously objected, thinking it was not
                    proper for a diplomat to do so), but the Spanish Civil War forestalled it. In 1940,
                    Bowers—again on the ground of propriety—declined an invitation to make six
                    campaign speeches. During his years abroad, Bowers remained in correspondence with Roosevelt, and
                    the last letter he received from the President was dated and signed on the morning of the
                    President's last day. Bowers agreed with the drastic measures taken by the New Deal to
                    revive the nation's economy, knowing that Roosevelt thought he was saving the capitalistic
                    system in the 
                        United States
                    , with which Bowers also agreed. Likewise, Bowers says that he has maintained cordial
                    relations with Harry S. Truman. Looking back now, Bowers can sum up his reactions to the New
                    Deal-Fair Deal as a feeling that it was a time of revolutionary movements and inescapable changes
                    which made the New Deal-Fair Deal programs necessary. For him, it was a choice between reform and
                        revolution.40

            As ambassador Claude Bowers could no more lay aside historical writing than he could as a
                    newspaperman. During twenty years abroad he wrote five books and several articles. He wrote because
                    he felt he should, and for a pleasant change from ambassadorial care. While in 
                        Spain
                     he wrote Jefferson in Power (1936) and The Spanish
                        Adventures of 
                            Washington
                         Irving (1940), both published by Houghton Mifflin; in 
                        Chile
                     he wrote The Young Jefferson, 1743–1789 (1945) and Pierre Vergniaud: Voice of the French Revolution (1950), published by Houghton
                    Mifflin and Macmillan, respectively.41
            
            Admittedly partisan, Jefferson in Power is his more mature work; it discusses two
                    administrations and the last years of a great life. Bringing to full fruition a breath-taking power
                    to animate a period, its people, and its spirit, Bowers concentrated on the political contests and
                    their implications for America. A fairly popular book which went through five printings, it drew the
                    usual commendations. A member of the House of Commons wrote the 
                        London
                    
                    Times that: "The fascinating books of Claude G. Bowers … have
                    destroyed the illusion that American History is necessarily dull."42
            
            Amid the scenes of another literary diplomat, Bowers traced the travels of, and sought to visualize, 
                        Washington
                     Irving in 
                        Spain
                    . Encountering numerous difficulties in the search for the materials that revivify a man
                    and his time, he nonetheless found enough to guide him in restoring Irving's years in 
                        Spain
                    . He told the story of The Spanish Adventures of 
                            Washington
                         Irving for his own pleasure, originally intending Spanish publication only.
                    But the book came out in this country, too, where it was received somewhat coldly by reviewers who
                    pedantically criticized it for not contributing anything new. The Spanish edition, however, was
                    received enthusiastically by reviewers who knew he had re-created an atmosphere and long-forgotten
                    people, and it had a large sale in South America.43

               Young Jefferson, the skimpiest of the political books, completed a Jefferson
                    trilogy. Like Beveridge and 
                  
                            Washington
                         Irving before it, Young Jefferson was more restrained, less
                    fiery, perhaps more scholarly. Again the work suffered by comparison with the earlier Bowers. Yet it
                    was generally received with favor by scholarly reviewers, who nonetheless thought it still
                    fashionable in the forties to invoke the Menckenistic reservations of the twenties. Referring to
                    "plushy prose," Richard Hofstadter decreed that "within the limits of his
                    particular medium, which is long on romance and the merely personal, and somewhat short on sharp
                    historical insight, Mr. Bowers has, however, done a fairly good job." Conversely, Howard
                    Fast thought the Jefferson trilogy "makes one of the most thoughtful and profound
                    investigations of our history ever undertaken by one man." Looking at the three works in
                    whole, Carl Bridenbaugh found them "most influential in shifting popular conceptions
                    concerning the founding of the Republic." With much to criticize in detail, Bridenbaugh
                    decided the trilogy in general was of "prime value," although he suggested,
                    "Perhaps someone could edit Mr. Bowers for us."44
            
            
               Pierre Vergniaud was the realization of an ambition inspired by boyhood reading.
                    Bowers capitalized upon research in the French archives, where his daughter Patricia helped, in
                    writing the biography of the French revolutionary. Appearing under the Macmillan imprint in 1950,
                        Vergniaud was carefully, lengthily, and fondly done. But most American
                    reviewers gave it something distinctly less than rave notices. However, Bowers says, "The
                    intelligent reviews of Vergniaud were all highly complimentary. The review in the 
                        London
                    
                    Times was brilliant, and more than favorable. Andre Maurois, the brilliant French
                    biographer, reviewed it for the 
                  
                            New York
                         Times. Most of the American reviewers did not even know that
                    I had found very important manuscript material that had evaded the notice of even the French
                    historians. The 
                        London
                    
                    Times makes much of this new material."45 From French

            Bowers' later works show a decided change in style. Where the first several moved with the
                    impassioned pleading of an advocate at the bar, his later ones moved at a new
                    pace—slower, more circumspect, more judicious. An analysis of the cause of the change
                    must await a definitive biography, but several speculations suggest themselves now: His writing may
                    have been affected by a diplomat's habit of thought, more judicious than the partisan habit
                    of an editorial writer. Or he may have had less time to assimilate his material. Or he may have been
                    working with materials from a less familiar setting.
            His latest book, My Mission to 
                            Spain
                        : Watching the Rehearsal for World War II, was published in June, 1954. Written
                    first in Madrid and rewritten twice in Santiago, it draws upon his official dispatches, diary,
                    travels, and observations during a six-year period. It is a climactic achievement of a notable
                    career: a historian who left the study to help make the history of his times.
            VII
            Claude Bowers approached his work in the spirit of a crusader. Intensely devoted to liberty and
                    popular sovereignty, he early interpreted American history as a contest between privilege and
                    democracy. Representing the distortions of Federalist and Republican historians, he presented a
                    fresh picture with fully digested material in becoming the outstanding historian of Democratic
                    presidents. With the singleness of purpose of a debater in rebuttal, he sought to redress the
                    balance in favor of Jefferson, Jackson, and Johnson.
            Looking at Jefferson, on whom he has done his best work, he found the philosopher of 
                        Monticello
                     had made perhaps his greatest contribution to democracy in fighting the Alien and
                    Sedition Laws.47 Through eight years in the White House, he thought, Jefferson
                    charted the democratic course for America, acquired without blood the empire of 
                        Louisiana
                    , sponsored the nation's first scientific expedition, blazed a

                     trail through the wilderness to the sea, opened the 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley to enterprise, preserved freedom of the press, staunchly defended free
                    discussion, purged the judiciary of abhorrent evils, abolished sinecures, and introduced business
                    methods in government. Moreover, he believed, the Jeffersonians won office by appealing to the
                    economic and political interests of the people, not to their passions.48
            
            The accession of Andrew Jackson he viewed as overturning the aristocrats and intellectuals as the
                    source of political power, replacing them with the articulate people. Recognizing that party
                    politics in the modern sense began with Jackson, he conceded and defended the origin of the spoils
                    system as being so adaptable to party rank and file that politicians of all parties have used it.49
            
            In the Bowers perspective, prejudice against Andrew Johnson had fed on enormous falsehoods. After
                    examining the details of Johnson's life, he concluded that Johnson had not been a traitor
                    to the Republican party, because he had always been a Democrat; that he held steadfastly to his view
                    of the purposes of the Civil War; and that he certainly was not a drunkard.50
            
            Presenting a revised view at a time other historians also were revising the Reconstruction story,
                    Bowers was not content merely to state the facts as he saw them. On the contrary, he called earlier
                    historians to account, reserving especial sarcasm and ridicule for John B. McMaster and Henry
                        Adams.51 Carrying his resentment into his own day, he wrote in a book review
                    that some American leaders were supposed to be sacred from candid analysis, but they all happened to
                    be Federalist or Republican.52
            
            He did not always regard Federalists and Republicans as sinister villains, however. He respected
                    Hamilton's political genius and statesmanship; indeed, he said Hamilton's distrust
                    of democracy is easier to understand than Jefferson's faith. Even the Federalist party he
                    could view as the most brilliant and most attractive, in terms of leadership, that

                     America has known. Although he abhorred their machinations, he
                    yet described the Federalist leaders as "men of wonderful charm" who lost power
                    because they did not understand the spirit of their times, did not seek contact with the common man,
                    and set themselves against the current of democracy.53
            
            In Jefferson and Hamilton, he portrayed the various characters in appropriate light
                    and shadow. Even of Jefferson he could say that he used an "alibi created after the
                    crime" in explaining he had been deceived by Hamilton in the exchange of votes on
                    assumption of state debts and location of the national capital.54 But in later
                    works many of the grays gave way to sharp black and white. He flailed Chief Justice John Marshall
                    for appearing at a dinner with Burr just before he was to preside at the latter's trial.
                    But he had no criticism for President Johnson who appeared at a reception given by Chief Justice
                    Salmon P. Chase on the eve of the impeachment trial.55
            
            VIII
            The Bowers manner—vivid, picturesque, sweeping—commanded a popular following.
                    Mirroring his absorption of historic address, the sentences are fulsome, evocative, and emotional on
                    occasion. Rhythmically, they resemble the cadence of Macaulay, a kindred spirit in aim and
                    interests. Borrowing also from the lexicon of the editorial writer, he employs repetition and
                    innuendo to emphasize Henry Adams' "quaint" interpretation of history,
                    and to suggest turpitude in the making of John Marshall's "midnight
                        judges."56
            
            Insistent upon restoring a period, he incorporates an unrivalled description of time, place, and man.
                    Early in a book he records the tone and feel of the times—the houses, people, diversions,
                    morals, and food. Seeking an accurate picturization, he minutely attends detail: for instance,
                    Hamilton's "almost effeminate mahogany desk with the women's faces carved
                    on the legs."57 Vitalizing the men in the steel engravings,

                     he shapes trivial detail into vivid descriptions, essays
                    sometimes forming entire chapters which he calls portraits—"Andrew Johnson: A
                    Portrait," "Hamilton: A Portrait."
            Some of the portraits stand alone as monuments of the essayist's art. In a portrait he
                    explores every facet of a man's character—background, intellectual endowment,
                    dress, habits, sincerity, and other attributes. Yet he does so in a refreshing, matter-of-fact
                    manner, shunning the gobbledegook of psychological analysis. What he intends is a re-creation of
                    each man—"warts and all." Shown both in repose and disheveled in the
                    sweat of conflict, the figures of American history lose their austerity and remoteness. Under
                    Bowers' hand they emerge as ordinary beings who "lived in houses, danced, gambled
                    and drank, flattered and flirted, gossipped and lied, in a 
                        Washington
                     of unpaved streets and sticky black mud, made their way to night conferences through
                    dark, treacherous thoroughfares, and played their brilliant parts in a bedraggled, village-like
                    capital … peculiarly crude and filled with grotesque incongruities."58
            
            His conception of history embracing both Emerson (history is biography) and Belloc (history is
                    melodrama), Bowers never loses his sense of the dramatic. Using the novelist's third person
                    point of view, he establishes contact with the reader who is conducted to legislative gallery and
                    racetrack to see the men of history at work and play. A true narrator, he never loses the thread of
                    the story, never leaves impact to chance. The reader also feels the presence of the author as a
                    convivial guide.
            Bowers' pages are enlivened by his own expressionisms and sardonic humor. For example:
                    "Here let us enter and pay our respects to His Excellency Robert K. Scott of 
                        Ohio
                    , by the grace of bayonets Governor of 
                        South Carolina
                    ." Of Schuyler Colfax: "In speech he was the master of the
                    obvious." Of Thaddeus Stevens: "There was a suggestion of cruelty in his wit and
                    something clammy in his humor—like a surgeon joking at his job."59 Picturesque language restores the spirit of the moment. For example: "the bung
                    was knocked out of the barrel of illiterate oratory in the beer saloons." Of 
                        Washington
                     entering the presidency: "To the 
                  
                     58 Bowers, Party Battles, viii.
                  
                     59 Bowers, Tragic Era, 75, 85, 349.
               
                     masses he was the maker of a nation; to the world of fashion he
                    was the creator of a court."60
            
            His books are organized with precision. Opening with a brief, concise, and pungent preface, he
                    announces his purpose and partiality. Better than most, he knows the work that is expected of a
                    preface, and he makes it a succinct, interesting essay. The book proper is built around topical
                    chapters, following a general but not always specific chronological progression—in this,
                    his greatest weakness is that dates are not always indicated. The chapters are composed of a series
                    of descriptions of men or events in close focus—almost an episodic
                    treatment—set apart by Roman numerals. Beaded on narrative string, the vignettes often
                    are literary gems, such as the description of John Randolph, the boy who looked like an old man.61
            
            Still, there are occasional frailties in his style. Enthusiasm leads to overstatement and romanticism
                    on occasion, as when he has William B. Giles setting forth on a trip with his Negro slave,
                    "no doubt kicking, cursing, and loving him all the way."62
                    Sometimes the reader reacts negatively to the frequent parallels of American developments and
                    episodes of the French Revolution. The only serious complaint against The Tragic
                    Era, in a criticism written for the American Historical Review, was the
                    strident style and continuous indictment.63
            
            However, no critic can gainsay that Bowers achieves the purpose announced in the preface. Here he has
                    a distinct advantage over the historian who presents facts with finality but neglects to let the
                    reader know what beliefs he holds. Thus one is forced to read such a historian carefully and warily.
                    But, forewarned by knowledge of Bowers' sentiments and reassured by many direct quotations
                    in the text, one can read him in relaxed comfort.
            IX
            Bowers' methods are those of a careful scholar and literary artist who taxes himself with
                    exhaustive demands. Starting a new book, he avoids exercise and diversion of

                     every sort. First he reads everything available on the subject,
                    completing all notes before ever fashioning a line.64 Research is more than
                    gathering and assessing the significance of facts; he does not cease until able to visualize his
                    subjects. Nor is he content to create a mental picture of them with their materials alone. No, he
                    even wants to know the kind of wine and brand of snuff preferred by their associates.65 He enjoys writing history more than he enjoys any of his numerous other activities. For
                    him, writing is relaxation, but it is hard work, too. He writes each book at least three
                    times—the first draft rapidly, the second for proportion, the third for publication.66
            
            He is a synthetist, not content to add a brick and splotch of mortar, but desirous of erecting a
                    noble literary edifice. In re-creating a period, he must work on a broad canvas, pulling together a
                    composite picture from biographies, autobiographies, diaries, correspondence, newspapers, memoirs,
                    congressional debates, contemporary pamphlets, and magazines. While the original material of the
                    monographic historian is conspicuous by its brevity in the Bowers bibliography, one notices the
                    works consulted emphasize published personal papers. However, original material was used without
                    stint in The Tragic Era and Pierre Vergniaud. Bowers has high
                    respect for newspapers as source material, but he uses them in their best adaptation—for
                    descriptions and as an indication of the rumors, anger, and feeling of the age. For he feels that
                    actual historic truth is no more important than what participants believed was the truth.67
            
            His books are well documented. Sometimes he will show the reader how he critically evaluates sources.
                    In describing Jefferson's person, he notes that the report of a woman without objectionable
                    prejudice is preferable to that of an embittered enemy. Again, in describing public men of the
                    1830's, he notes that the remarks of Miss Harriet Martineau and Mrs. Margaret Bayard Smith
                    are in harmony.68

            Now living in 
                        New York
                     City where his life follows the pattern of fifty years—writing, lecturing,
                    and speaking—Bowers refuses to closet himself from the main currents of life. With
                    Polybius, he feels the historian should be a man of action. Further, he thinks a man actively
                    engaged in the affairs of today is better able to understand the affairs of yesterday. He has
                    observed that historians of the cloister, finding a document issued by a public man in explanation
                    of conduct, are apt to consider it as final authority. Actually, he says, the man of affairs,
                    politician, or journalist knows these documents often are camouflage. Bowers wants to see the
                    letters exchanged at the time the document was prepared as well as the memoirs of after years.69 While his critique has some merit, it does not give proper weight to the
                    historian's internal criticism.
            Summing up his work to date: Bowers thinks Party Battles and Jefferson
                        and Hamilton introduced a new method that has been adopted rather widely. Prior to his
                    work, he finds, most books on Jefferson were hostile; since his work, later writers have treated
                    Jefferson with greater respect. Likewise, he thinks The Tragic Era helped change
                    northern opinion of Reconstruction. He disavows an original intent to defend Johnson, but in writing
                    honest history he found—and, to his satisfaction, proved—that Johnson was a
                    great man, a courageous defender of the Constitution. Since The Tragic Era, he
                    believes, historians have treated Johnson more respectfully.70 However, a
                    contrary opinion must be noted: Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., denies that the Johnson of Bowers is
                    essentially different from the Johnson of Dunning, Rhodes, and Oberholtzer.71
                    One critic said Bowers is in rebellion "against the sort of historical writing that merely
                    analyzes, merely understands … and his own aim is to arrive at an imaginative
                        understanding."72 Some few commentators have challenged his
                    interpretations and conclusions, but none his accuracy or choice of sources.

            In evaluating the work of Claude Bowers, one cannot ignore his popular standing. Whereas eighteen of
                    the sixty best histories of 1920–1950 average about seven thousand sales each,73 Bowers averaged about thirty-two thousand sales with each of the eight books
                    published by Houghton Mifflin between 1922 and 1945—from Party Battles
                    through Young Jefferson.
               74 If the contrast means anything, it
                    means the American public is interested in and wants to read history, provided the historian
                    troubles himself to write for them as as well as for his colleagues.
            Bowers took that trouble. He found and used the formula for the compound of accurate history and
                    entertaining narrative in fifteen books and at least nine articles—"history as
                    it should be written."75

            The Historian's Bias

            When the motor car was still a novelty, as you traveled about in the Midwest, you would often see, as
                    you approached some village, a more or less battered signboard by the side of the road. On the board
                    you might notice an advertisement for the grocery, the bank, the drug store, the hardware store, the
                    drygoods store, and the blacksmith shop. At the top of the sign appeared the name of the village and
                    just beneath it these words, "The hub of the universe." You would smile at that,
                    but it was no joke to the people who lived there. Here their fathers had lived and died and here
                    they were buried. From this place they looked out on the affairs of the world and viewed the stars
                    at night. Here the sun rose and set. It was the hub of the universe to them. A distant Tennyson
                    might complain, 
                        They think the rustic cackle of their burg
                        The murmur of the world,
                     but they were not disturbed. The wiser among them recalled that larger cities had their
                    provincialisms, had even called themselves "The Hub," 
                        Boston
                    , for example.
            We are all like that. We see through our own eyes. Sunrise and sunset occur where we are. The
                    distance to any spot on the continent is measured from our present location. It is not easy to
                    imagine how the world looks to another. We who are men find it hard to see life through a
                    woman's eyes. Women claim a superior advantage at this point, an advantage which men would
                    better politely concede, meanwhile keeping any skeptical reservations discreetly to themselves.
            All of us tend to look down on the people we study in history for, after all, we are studying them.
                    To be able to write May 26, 1956, at the head of our letters is still better than to write the same
                    date in 1856, or 1656, or unfortunate folk, 1256! We are alive, a very distinct advantage although
                    not a very permanent one! It seldom occurs to us that presently this turbulent twentieth century
                    will take its place, for

                            Society on the campus of

                     good or ill, in the procession of receding times, when our day
                    will be merely a set of problems in historical study. The time may come when some future historian
                    may not even find our century interesting.
            This universal human frailty, to imagine our perspective the favored one, besets the historian as
                    well as the scientist. I am not a historian. I doubt if I could pass an eighth grade examination on
                    the history of Indiana without considerable cramming. But I welcome this opportunity to speak to
                    people interested in history in order to voice a protest against a popular caricature of science.
                    The popular notion has it that the scientist simply makes his mind blank, opens his eyes and ears,
                    and lets the truths of nature pour into his empty mind and form themselves into general ideas. Rid
                    yourselves of all prejudice; lay aside all preconceived notions;—how often we hear that
                    kind of advice. Generally, it seems to me that that is precisely the time to hang rather tightly to
                    some of your prejudices, for the man who speaks wants to make you the easy victim of some ideas that
                    will not stand too close a scrutiny. At any rate, that is not what the scientist does when he enters
                    his laboratory. Before such a vacant mind nature will always maintain a stony silence. She never
                    answers questions until they are asked and part of the growth in science consists in learning to ask
                    the right questions. A scientist has an hypothesis to test, a prejudice if you please. He knows that
                    if his hypothesis is correct he can deduce certain consequences and among them there will be one
                    that can be tested by experiment. And the curious thing is that for any given problem quite a wide
                    variety of hypotheses may be confirmed. Which one of them the scientist chooses to test reflects his
                    interest, his previous notions, his bias.
            It was our American pragmatists, Charles S. Peirce, William James, and Josiah Royce, that first saw
                    this clearly. Royce used to say that any idea is a plan of action. All thought reflects an interest
                    on the part of the thinker. The pure intellect is a myth. One's idea of sword, pen, fly
                    rod, hammer, and so on, always includes the knowledge of how to use them. "Ideas of things
                    never consist of mere images of the things, but always involve a consciousness of how you propose to
                    act towards the things of which you have ideas."1 Knowing what

                     a tiger is always involves knowing how to behave in the
                    presence of a tiger. "We observe no outer facts without at the same time more or less
                    clearly observing our attitude towards those facts, our estimate of their value, our response to
                    their presence, our intentions with respect to our future relations with these facts."2 Or as William James put it with his brisk language: "If you want an
                    absolute duffer in an investigation, you must, after all, take the man who has no interest whatever
                    in its results: he is the warranted incapable, the positive fool. The most useful investigator,
                    because the most sensitive observer, is always he whose eager interest in one side of the question
                    is balanced by an equally keen nervousness lest he become deceived."3
            
            The historian is no exception. Without some preconceived notion, some symptom of a philosophy of
                    history, some bias, he is utterly helpless. You might give him the keys to the census bureau in 
                        Washington
                     with access to all the census reports that have been taken since 1790. But without some
                    interest, where would he begin? A biased historian is better than a completely
                    "objective" historian, simply because an objective historian cannot be a historian
                    at all. Or to take an illustration that comes home more closely to you all, suppose you were to
                    write a history of southern Indiana, Indiana south of the old national road between the years 1850
                    and 1860. Where would you begin? Would you start searching for letters written during that period?
                    For what would you look in them? You would scour newspapers, court records, church records, observe
                    the price of land? But you would have millions of such records to scan. Why would you turn to them?
                    But if you have a thesis to prove or disprove, say, that since most of the people in southern
                    Indiana were not more than a generation out of 
                        Kentucky
                    , 
                        Tennessee
                    , and 
                        Virginia
                    , and you wanted to see if the abolitionist sentiment was not weaker there than in other
                    parts of the country, then you could begin to work. To be sure, if a historian is not a fool, that
                    is a dogmatist, he will be willing to modify his assumptions from time to time, as his own
                    discoveries may dictate. But again and again I have heard the philosophy of history decried as an
                    obstacle, or worse, as a meaningless preoccupation, for the objective historian. We repeat, the
                    historian who has no previous

                     notions about how things ought to happen, and this is at least
                    in part a philosophy of history, has nothing to do. Like the Irishman on Saturday night, he is all
                    dressed up and has no place to go.
            In his recent book on Christianity and History Herbert Butterfield has made much of
                    the difficulties of writing history. He writes: "Amongst historians, as in other fields,
                    the blindest of all the blind are those who are unable to examine their own presuppositions, and
                    blithely imagine therefore that they do not possess any."4 We shall be
                    reminded that historians have agreed on certain canons for the discovery of fact. But the discovery
                    of all such fact as can be agreed upon by historians is not yet history. It is only the skeleton of
                    history. All such facts demand something more for their understanding—the wild,
                    complicated story of the inner life of innumerable people. From Butterfield again: "History
                    deals with the drama of human life as the affair of individual personalities, possessing
                    self-consciousness, intellect and freedom. Imagine human beings without these three things and you
                    will find it difficult to write historical narrative at all … And the historian deals
                    with historical events not as though they were things which could be mechanically and externally
                    explained but as they come out of personalities and run into personalities; so that the insides of
                    human beings have to be brought into the discussion—mind and motive, hope and fear,
                    passion and faith have to come into the question—before we can begin to connect one fact
                    with another and understand anything at all."5 And you can reach the
                    reality of the men and women you study in history only when you realize that you have assumptions,
                    that like the midwestern villager who called his town the hub of the universe, each one of us sees
                    through his own eyes.
            It is likely that any two of us could soon unearth some places where our assumptions differ. So with
                    two historians. And in such cases it is relatively easy for us to become aware of our assumptions,
                    and to recognize that they give our work a bias. But the baffling side of this question is not where
                    we differ, but where we agree. For deep down beneath our differences are the assumptions about which
                    we never

                     think. They are like the air that we breathe; we are seldom
                    aware of them. And here the assumptions of a whole generation are apt to be alike and if so, they
                    are extremely hard to uncover. The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once observed that no
                    generation can become conscious of its deepest and most universal assumptions; it takes a later
                    generation to bring them to light.
            Thus in the later Victorian era, in the period up to the outbreak of the first world war, men just
                    took it for granted that they could look forward to progress. Some of us grew up in that period:
                    while there were individual puzzles about our own future, we gave no worry to the future of mankind.
                    All was secure and stable. I find that young college men stare today with open mouth when I try to
                    explain that mood to them. We were sure not only of safety and peace in the future, not only of
                    industrial and technological progress, but we were on a sort of moral escalator as well which would
                    presently take us to the land of promise. One eloquent clergyman—whose name has been
                    forgotten—about the turn of the century described it thus: "Just over the crest
                    of the hill, the promised land stretches away to the far horizons, bathed in eternal
                    sunshine!" It may be that that generation was under the early spell of Darwinian
                    evolutionism. And they looked back incredulously to an earlier generation that did not share their
                    faith in progress. All we can say today is that the world does not look the same to us. It is likely
                    that no child of today will live long enough to see the return of anything like the placid comfort
                    of late Victorian life. Instead, as Nicholas Berdyaev, Russian historian, put it not long before his
                    death: "We are entering into the realm of the unknown and the unlived, and we are entering
                    it joylessly and without much hope. We can no longer believe in the theories of progress which
                    deceived the minds of the nineteenth century and made the near future seem always to be better, more
                    beautiful and more desirable than what had gone before."6
            
            Ferdynand Zweig, formerly of the University of Cracow, in a recent book lays stress on what he calls
                    the "collective social subsconsciousness," which embodies the assumptions of a
                    given period and society. Thus he thinks the marginal 
                  
                     6 Nicholas Berdyaev, The End of Our Time (
                                New York
                            , 1933), 12–13.
               
                     utility school was rooted in the whole philosophy and
                    atmosphere of the second half of the nineteenth century. Because our own period is interested in
                    planning for a maximum national income, Zweig thinks we have a special advantage in understanding
                    the mercantilist period. But when the basic assumptions are changed then the theories based on those
                    assumptions are no longer relevant. "When the age passes and the assumptions become hollow
                    and empty, the generalizations resemble a deserted palace, visited by tourists and students of
                    history and culture."7
            
            Now these assumptions dictate the interests of the historian. Things that seem important to one
                    generation become trivial to another. That is why good histories have to be rewritten every
                    generation or two. And some day to the discerning historian, the history of histories will become a
                    revealing portrait of the changes in the human mind.
            This is all I have to say about the writing of history. But before closing I should like the
                    privilege of making two brief observations. The social studies would better not lose sight of the
                    perspectives that make the individual what he is. There is some good in statistical studies. They do
                    help to locate problems, but so far as I have found they never solve them. The kind of research that
                    goes on in many colleges of education today is a logical monstrosity. Behind all the statistics are
                    living human beings with their living interests. The social studies had better be aware of that
                    fact. Let me illustrate by supposing two lawyers, one the attorney for a corporation and the other
                    for the union with which that corporation bargains. Let us further suppose that there has been a
                    long record of trouble and that our two lawyers are personal friends. Suppose they go off together
                    to be alone for a weekend at a quiet hotel in the mountains, in the hope that they can work out a
                    basis of future understanding. They will need, of course, all the economic information about the
                    financial position of the company, how the wages of the workers compare with other similar
                    companies, and so on. But this will not be enough. Each man will also need a sympathetic and
                    imaginative insight into the interests that find expression in the theory of the other man, and an
                    honesty in acknowledging his own. It will not be easy to

                     achieve. But until they do they will not even be talking the
                    same language. Wherever vital interests are involved, the semantic difficulty can be met only on the
                    moral level.
            And now may I confess my own bias in writing this paper? I believe that individual human beings are
                    priceless, of immeasurable importance. I further believe that in our society we are in grave danger
                    of losing most of the priceless gifts that genuine individuals can bring forth: in science, in
                    industry, in politics, in art, and in religion. Our society, with its worship of bigness, its
                    gigantic currents, its curious fear of novelty, its demands for conformity, is in danger of
                    destroying the individual and thus of destroying itself in the end. I am told, for example, that in
                    the younger grades of some of our public schools if a boy develops some curiosity or interest that
                    takes him off by himself, he is to be discouraged: he needs adaptation to the group. And if he
                    persists in following this private interest he becomes a problem child: the parents are notified
                    that he requires psychiatric treatment. Of course, we need to learn to live and work with other
                    people and the best time to learn that is in early childhood. But can the price be too high? If we
                    suppress all special interests, and turn out of our schools a race of identical intellectual twins,
                    what have we done?
            You see, I am defending the right of our midwestern villager to be different, to call his place the
                    hub of the universe, if he so believes. My protest against the so-called objective scientist is just
                    that he depersonalizes the human being. The individualism for which I plead is not that of the
                    pirate, who wants no rules to inhibit his banditry, but that of the loyal citizen. For the measure
                    of any civilization is not how many motor cars it can make and sell in a given year, but how many
                    free and creative individuals it can accommodate.

            Charles A. Beard on the Founding of Ruskin Hall
            
                    Edited by Burleigh Taylor Wilkins
                    *
                
            Through the courtesy of Ruskin College, 
                        Oxford
                    , I have received permission to publish two manuscripts in which the historian Charles
                    A. Beard recalled at the request of latter-day Ruskin College officials how in 1899 he had helped
                    another American, Walter Vrooman of 
                        Kansas
                    , found Ruskin Hall, a center for British workingmen's education.1
            
            Beard had been graduated from DePauw University in 1898, and in the fall of that same year he arrived
                    in 
                        Oxford
                     to undertake graduate study in history. Aroused by Vrooman's plans for a labor
                    "college," young Beard persuaded his advisor Frederick York Powell, Regius
                    Professor of Modern History at 
                        Oxford
                    , and several prominent trade unionists as well to lend support to the project. In fact,
                    it appears that Beard was far more responsible for the actual success of Vrooman's plans
                    than was Vrooman.
            With the exception of a semester spent at Cornell University in the fall of 1899, Beard continued to
                    live in Britain

                            Ruskin Hall was founded in the month of John Ruskin's eightieth birthday. Ruskin
                                had been informed as to the proceedings: "His secretary wrote that the
                                students' letter had been brought to Ruskin's attention (as my memory
                                has it)—at all events the new labor college had his benediction."

                                Brant-wood, Coniston Lake, to the students of Ruskin Hall, March 1, 1899. "Mr.
                                Ruskin received with great pleasure on his eightieth birthday a photograph of Ruskin

                                encouragement, and he desires to convey his most grateful thanks and best wishes for the
                                success of Ruskin Hall and its students."
                        
               
                     from 1898 to 1902, first in 
                        Oxford
                     and later in 
                        Manchester
                    . In addition to pursuing his graduate studies in history, young Beard taught at the
                    newly established Ruskin Hall and spent two years giving classes for cooperative educational
                    committees in 
                        England
                     and 
                        Wales
                    . Beard's labors for workers' and adult education did not cease with
                    his departure from 
                        England
                    , as his subsequent efforts in the 
                        United States
                     on behalf of the Workers Education Bureau of America and the New School for Social
                    Research well demonstrate. Beard's Ruskin Hall experiences are significant, therefore, not
                    only for the history of British workingmen's education; they also reveal how in his early
                    manhood Beard outlined a pattern of living he would follow always, a pattern combining historical
                    scholarship and social consciousness.
            The first manuscript was sent by Charles A. Beard from New 
                        Milford
                    , 
                        Connecticut
                    , to A. Barrett 
                        Brown
                    , principal of Ruskin College.2
            
            In the Autumn of 1898, on the day that I entered 
                        Oxford
                     to pursue advanced studies in English and European History, I met Mr. Walter Vrooman
                    who had come to the University with a double purpose in mind—to study philosophy and to
                    found a new type of labor movement. Our first meeting was followed by many long conversations about
                    the political and social questions of the day. In the course of these discussions, Mr. Vrooman
                    expressed the conviction that we were at the verge of a great political uprising on the part of
                    labor throughout the western world and that it was the duty of "educated" persons
                    [to] prepare for it. With respect to the several groups that claimed to speak for
                    labor—socialists, individualists, and trade unionists—Mr. Vrooman could
                    scarcely be called a partisan. He repeatedly said that capitalists and workingmen wasted more each
                    year in strikes, lockouts, bickerings, and inefficient organization than the total amount of the
                    surplus values over which they were presumably 
                  
                     2 A. Barrett 
                                Brown
                             was principal of Ruskin College from 1926 to 1945. Although Beard's
                            manuscript was dated only "July 7," F. Smith, longtime general secretary
                            of Ruskin College, suggests that it was in 1940 that Brown requested Beard to write this
                            account. Letter from F. Smith, 
                                Oxford

                     quarrelling. Co-operative intelligence, he thought, was
                    "the need of the hour."3 Therefore, he planned to found, with
                    the sympathetic support and financial assistance of his wife, a labor center in 
                        Oxford
                     where labor interests could be brought together and the discussion of social questions
                        promoted.4 It could not be said that he had in mind primarily a college. He
                    was rather concerned with starting a moral and philosophical movement within the ranks of advancing
                    labor. He chose 
                        Oxford
                     on account of its strategic advantages, although it was celebrated as the home of lost
                    causes.
            Without any difficulty Mr. Vrooman enlisted my interest in the enterprise, for I had made a special
                    study of labor and social problems in college and had spent a season in a social 
                  
                            
                        3 Beard in emphasizing Vrooman's idea of cooperative
                                intelligence is remembering the area of opinion where he and Vrooman were most in
                                accord; see Charles Beard, "Cooperation and the New Century," in
                                Vrooman's magazine Young

                                Christian socialist, had already attracted unfavorable notice in the

                                    Baltimore

                                human affairs from the domain of chance and making them subservient to law."
                                (p. 5). The competitive system of economics had, according to Vrooman, already been
                                destroyed in recent times by the "principle of combination"; the real
                                issue of the times lay between paternalism and democratic socialism. Although the
                                "centralized money power" of modern capitalism had temporarily gained
                                control of political institutions, Vrooman insisted that the "whole trend of
                                our times is toward some form of fraternal socialism." (Ibid., 10). "I believe," he wrote, "that there is now
                                sufficient existing concrete socialism in the world to give a substantial foundation for
                                the hope that the brotherhood of man, the true cooperative commonwealth shall one day be
                                realized." (Ibid., 12).
                            Although Vrooman's influence upon Beard's social convictions has been
                                exaggerated, it has not yet been noticed that Vrooman's view of history is
                                essentially that which Beard would present in his Industrial
                                Revolution (
                                    London
                                , 1901). Both men patently disliked laissez-faire theories and monopolistic
                                practices; both had the same optimism concerning the future effects of the
                                "socializing forces" then emerging. The difference between Vrooman and
                                Beard is that Vrooman's writings were explicitly socialistic while
                                Beard's were not.

                             soon after the founding of Ruskin Hall. His wife remained behind and became a
                            member of the governing council of Ruskin Hall, serving alongside Keir Hardie and Frederick
                            York Powell.

               5 where I had come into first-hand contact with them. It was agreed
                    that I should work particularly on the task of outlining an educational program, besides seeking
                    supporters for the idea in various directions. The name Ruskin Hall was chosen by Mr. Vrooman on my
                        suggestion,6 after many long debates. We were both students of that great
                    moralist and, while we dissented from many of his opinions, we came to the conclusion that Ruskin
                    had laid the best foundation for a humane labor program.
            For many weeks Mr. Vrooman and I worked on plans. As a student of Professor F. York Powell,7 I took advantage of my privileges and discussed the scheme with him one day at
                    the close of his lecture. To my delight he approved enthusiastically, gave me invaluable advice, and
                    agreed to preside over the opening meeting. At Mr. Vrooman's request, I visited Mr. Dennis
                        Hird,8 at Kidlington, and secured his consent to act as warden of the new
                    hall. It also fell to my portion to appear before the 
                        Oxford

                     6 While an undergraduate at DePauw University, Beard had read
                            Ruskin's Unto This Last. Also his 
                                Oxford
                             teacher Frederick York Powell was an admirer of Ruskin. Perhaps J. A.
                            Hobson's John Ruskin, Social Reformer, published in 1898, was the
                            immediate occasion for Beard's suggesting that the new "college"
                            be named Ruskin Hall. Beard did at some time read this book, for in 1936 he wrote movingly
                            that the spirit of Ruskin still lives on, for instance, in Hobson's book. Beard,

                            his death. It was under Powell's supervision that Beard began his study of the
                            justice of the peace in medieval 
                                England
                            , which was later to be the subject of his doctoral dissertation at

                            and an outspoken Ruskinian. During his lifetime Powell was of assistance not only to Ruskin
                            Hall but also to the newly established University College in Reading. See Oliver Elton, Frederick York Powell (2 vols.,

                            Hird broke away from the Church and wrote for the Rationalist Press Association. He served
                            as principal of Ruskin Hall from 1899 to 1909 and later helped found the Central Labour
                            College, after the Executive Committee of Ruskin College had called for his resignation. In
                                An Easy Outline of Evolution (

                            , 1907), written while he was still principal of Ruskin, Hird described
                            environment as "little short of an almighty power" (ibid., 122), thus presenting vividly one of the basic presuppositions of the founders
                            of Ruskin Hall.
               
                     Council, explain our project, and obtain and [sic] official
                        endorsement.9 In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. Vrooman were busy, in their way,
                    enlisting recruits and preparing plans for the equipment of the hall. Almost daily the three of us
                    held council on our problems and it would be difficult to say who among us contributed this or that
                    idea to the common undertaking.
            On surveying the ground early in the next year, we found that we had numerous endorsements from labor
                    bodies and labor leaders, the good wishes of several 
                        Oxford
                     professors, tutors, and students, and many promises of co-operation. By that time the
                    program of studies had been outlined, the scheme of management completed, a project for a
                    correspondence school formulated, a number of students enrolled, and a corps of teachers and
                    lecturers engaged. At last on February 22, 1899, Ruskin Hall was formally opened. Since that time
                    the history of its development appears in its records and achievements.
            The second manuscript was sent by Charles Beard to Lionel Elvin, principal of Ruskin College, on
                    December 18, 1945. Despite certain duplications of the first manuscript, it supplements
                    Beard's first account of Ruskin Hall and describes more comprehensively his stay in
                    Britain.
            Late in August or early September, 1898, I arrived in 
                        Oxford
                     for the purpose of pursuing "graduate studies" in English history,
                    especially constitutional and political history. My ignorance was, as American movie magnates might
                    say, "colossal," but my enthusiasm was high. From 
                        England
                     my ancestors had gone to America long before, some in the seventeenth, others in the
                    eighteenth century. From my immediate forebears I had acquired a deep interest in 
                        England
                     and I was more than casually acquainted with the great classics in English history and
                    letters. I wanted to learn more and was willing to pay the price of hard work.
            
               
                  9 Beard also enlisted the support of the 
                            Manchester
                         Trade Union Council. James Sexton brought in the Liverpool dockworkers, and Ben
                        Tillet the 
                            London
                         dockworkers. Keir Hardie also figured prominently in the efforts to establish
                        Ruskin Hall.
            
            
            Professor F. York Powell, then Regius Professor of Modern History, received me cordially, talked with
                    me about my backgrounds and interests, and helped me to plan my program of studies. Through his good
                    offices I was soon elected a member of the Stubbs History Club and met several young Englishmen who
                    made me feel at home. Within a few days, I had many acquaintances and was happily settled in my
                    lodgings at 11 Grove Street, ready for work and intellectual adventures.
            Very soon, on an occasion which I do not recall, I met an American who had come to study philosophy
                    at 
                        Oxford
                    , Walter Vrooman. I had known something about his family in the States and was
                    acquainted slightly with his brother, Carl Vrooman, who later served under President Wilson in the
                    Department of Agriculture; but this was my first meeting with Walter.
            Mr. Vrooman and I had many interests in common, particularly economic theory and the labor movement
                    in the Old World and the New. Strange to relate, he had an idea that in the coming years the Briton
                    and the Slav would collide and that the 
                        United States
                     would be forced to cooperate in turning back the Slavic tide! We often discussed that
                    subject. Mr. Vrooman also believed that the labor movement would become increasingly powerful in 
                        England
                     and the 
                        United States
                     and that the labor leaders of the two countries should go beyond trade union interests
                    and equip themselves for statesmanship. He was convinced that this cause could be aided by
                    establishing a labor college in 
                        Oxford
                    , with branches in various parts of Great Britain, and by establishing similar
                    institutions in the States. Out of this undertaking, he thought, the workers of the two countries
                    could be brought into a better understanding of their historic role.
            Mr. Vrooman and his wife then lived on Banbury Road and they made a practice of having friends in for
                    tea. At these teas, Mr. Vrooman's ideas were discussed and within a short time several
                    persons expressed a willingness to cooperate in launching the project for a labor college (or
                    "hall" as we called it then) in 
                        Oxford
                    . After a tentative plan had been drawn up, I presented it to the Trades Union Council
                    of 
                        Oxford
                    , held a long discussion with members of the Council, and won their enthusiastic
                    endorsement. Through  members of the Council I was invited to
                    speak at several places in 
                        Oxford
                     and explain the design for a labor college.
            Alas, owing to my failing memory, I cannot recall the names of all the men and women who were early
                    interested in the project. But I remember that before or soon after Ruskin Hall was opened in St.
                    Giles, in February, 1899, the following friends had been gathered together in support of the
                    project: H.B. Lees Smith, Mr. [A. J.] Hacking, Mr. Scott, Miss [Mary Payne] Giles, and Mr. Hird.10 Later, Mr. Wilson came to aid as secretary general (if my memory serves me
                    well). Doubtless somewhere in the archives of the College may be found the names of the first
                    teachers and the courses they offered.
            Besides giving a course in English history,11 in which references were often made
                    to American institutions, I took charge of organizing the correspondence school, with the heroic
                    assistance of Miss Giles. It was our hope thereby not only to serve young labor people who could not
                    come to 
                        Oxford
                     but also to discover talents through correspondence, so to speak. Before the Spring of
                    1899 came, we had a number of men in residence, several night students from the city of 
                        Oxford
                    , and hundreds of correspondence students. Ruskin Hall was well under weigh [sic]!
            After a visit to my native land in 1899, I returned to 
                        Oxford
                     early in 1900—with my young bride, Mary Beard.12 It was
                    then decided that I should make my residence in 
                        Manchester
                    , the heart of industrial 
                        England
                    , offer lecture courses in English

                            part of Hird's controversial tenure, afterwards professor of economics at Bristol
                            and postmaster-general in the first Labor government. A. J. Hacking lectured on
                            constitutional history at Ruskin. In "Ruskin and the Babble of Tongues,"
                                New Republic, LXXXVII, 372, Beard also includes Edward Caird, master
                            of Balliol College, among the initial supporters of the Ruskin Hall venture.
                  
                     11 On February 27, 1899. five days after the inaugural meeting had
                            been held under the chairmanship of Frederick York Powell, Charles A. Beard gave the first
                            lecture in Ruskin Hall, its subject: English constitutional history. (The Story
                                of Ruskin College, 9).
                  
                     12 Mrs. Beard was also a graduate of DePauw University, class of 1897.
                            It was during this same visit to the 
                                United States
                             that Charles Beard spent a semester studying under Professor Moses Coit Tyler
                            at Cornell University. Tyler offered Beard a fellowship in a vain effort to keep him at
                            Cornell, and wrote, "It is with extreme regret that I now yield him up to the
                            superior claims and attractions of the mission which calls him to educational work in the 
                                United Kingdom

                        Oxford
                    .
            The longer I remained in 
                        England
                    , the warmer became my affections for the country and the people. My wife shared my
                    sentiments in this respect. But in time we felt that we had to decide whether to fix our home for
                    the rest of our days in 
                        England
                     or return to our native land. At length and with great reluctance, we came to the
                    conclusion in the Spring of 1902 that it was "now or never," that we
                    "belonged" at home. So, in April or May of that year, we sailed on the Campania for the New World, wiser for our happy experiences in 
                        England
                    , sadder for the necessity that broke precious ties. But it was well, for, after all, we
                    had little to give Ruskin Hall and the British labor movement. Strong and able men and women in 
                        England
                     were in charge of the Hall and prepared to carry on. It was right and proper that they
                    should do this, without the interference of "cousins" from beyond the seas.

            Charles Denby, 
                        United States
                     minister to 
                        China
                    , served in that capacity from May 29, 1885, when he was appointed by 
                        Cleveland
                    , until July 11, 1898, when he was removed by McKinley.
            A highlight of his career was the role he played in bringing an end to the Sino-Japanese War, which
                    began on August 1, 1894, and was ended by the Treaty of Shimonoseki, April 17, 1895, in which 
                        China
                     recognized the independence of 
                        Korea
                    , ceded Formosa, the Pescadores, and the Liaotung Peninsula to 
                        Japan
                    , and agreed to pay 200,000,000 taels as indemnity. Russia, 
                        Germany
                    , and 
                        France
                     quickly brought about the return of the Liaotung Peninsula to 
                        China
                     but permitted 
                        Japan
                     to collect additional indemnity.
            The letters quoted below, in which Denby wrote about the peace negotiations while the war progressed,
                    are available to historians for the first time through the graciousness of Mrs. George Vyverberg of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , whose daughter, Mary, recently was a student in one of my classes. Mrs. Vyverberg is a
                    granddaughter of Charles Denby.
            The letters were written to Thomas Edgar Garvin, 1826–1912, who was a prominent lawyer of 
                        Evansville
                    , Indiana. Denby had read law in the office of Baker and Garvin at 
                        Evansville
                     in the 1850's. The friendship between Denby and Garvin lasted throughout their
                    lives.
            Denby's official reports of the events in which he played such a prominent role are found in
                        Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the 
                            United States
                        
                for the years 1894 and 1895. Typical is his dispatch of late November, 1894,
                    to Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham: "I informed the ministers that I was advised by my
                    Government that 
                        Japan
                     would consider any direct overtures for peace made by 
                        China
                     to her through myself."1
            
            Denby also described the negotiations briefly in a general account of his experiences in the Orient
                    titled,

                        Japan
                     is reserved and impersonal. In the private correspondence published below, Denby casts
                    aside his reserve and relates the events in a chatty and highly informative manner to a close friend
                    of long duration.
            The first letter describes the significant role that Denby assumed as a negotiator, and the second
                    relates his continuing efforts to bring the warring nations together and tells of the dangers faced
                    by foreigners in Peking during the war.

                        My dear Garvin
                        I suppose that long ere this you have returned from your trip to Europe. Although it
                                    deprived me of some days of your society, I hope you found it pleasant. My own
                                    journey to Peking was attended with no remarkable incident, and was altogether
                                    agreeable. I was received in 
                                        Japan
                                    , and 
                                        China
                                    , with all honor and consideration. It happened that the Emperor of 
                                        Japan
                                     and his Court were at Hiroshima, so I missed some Court festivities.
                                    The Secretary of State regretted this circumstance. No where in my absence, either
                                    at home or abroad, did I meet with such genial hospitality as your own. No where was
                                    I so truly at home, or so much at my ease. Your kindness, and your good cheer, did a
                                    great deal to restore me to health. I cannot too earnestly thank Mrs Garvin and
                                    yourself, and Cunningham, Edgar, Dunkerson, Morris, and their dear wives, for their
                                    treatment of me, which could not have been more affectionate if I had been a member
                                    of your family. Will you please convey to each of them this expression of my
                                    gratitude?
                        It goes without saying that since I arrived I have been a prominent actor in the
                                    important affairs which are now transpiring.
                        The members of the Foreign Office found an article in one of our treaties by which
                                    the 
                                        United States
                                     agreed to assist 
                                        China
                                     to arrange matters in case any nation treated her
                                    "oppressively". They proceeded at great length to show that 
                                        Japan
                                     had done so, and to invoke our mediation. I agreed to help 
                                        China
                                    . Much wiring has been had to this end.  The final result came the 21st, when, at 
                                        China
                                    's request, I made to 
                                        Japan
                                     direct overtures for peace on the basis of the independence of 
                                        Korea
                                    , and the payment of a war indemnity. I am now anxiously awaiting an
                                    answer which may terminate this war. It is exceedingly gratifying to me to have
                                    these two nations turn to us as intermediaries. My friends of the Yamen3 are grown up children, absolutely ignorant of international
                                    law, and they look to me as their teacher and guide.
                        They follow all my counsels, copy my papers, and send them, always interlarding them
                                    with compliments and thanks to the U S and to me personally. I am Supreme judge,
                                    attorney general, confidential adviser all in one. I would blaze with decorations
                                    and roll in presents, but, unfortunately, or otherwise, I can take nothing from 
                                        China
                                     except her empty thanks. A man of your well known
                                    benevolence—having attained a position in which you no longer care to cut
                                    into a "fund"—will clearly appreciate the pleasure it
                                    gives me to practice high international law with two great countries for
                                    charity—and nary fee in sight!
                        Long ere you read these lines you will know the result of the labors of which you
                                    have now the inside. If peace comes I made it—if war goes on I have done
                                    my best to stop it. 
                                        China
                                     exhorted foreign intervention. I told them to ask for peace themselves,
                                    and then I wired 
                                        Japan
                                     as 
                                        China
                                    's agent. I have made history all alone, and I hope I have made
                                    fame. Whatever betides I shall always find my chief delight in the society of you
                                    and yours.
                        
                                    Your loving friend
                                    Charles Denby
                                
                     
                  
               
                
            Charley4 leaves Monday the 26th to find happiness I hope. He leaves me desolate,
                    solitary, and full of sorrow—the first sorrow he ever caused me. He is a bright fellow,
                    and he will brighten all your lives for a time.

                         My dear Garvin
                        Your letter to me which seems to have caused you to think of mental telegraphy, by
                                    reason of my having written about the same date, was dated November 24th or nearly.

                        When I got your letter—which is the second, I think, you ever sent
                                    me—I was struck with the similarity of ideas to those expressed in mine.
                        You spoke of the employment of myself as negotiator between 
                                        Japan
                                     and

                                     almost in the same tone as I wrote thereof. I have often noticed that
                                    when after a long interval one writes to a friend he writes at the same time and the
                                    letters cross each other, but I have, also, often noticed that nothing of the kind
                                    happens.
                        It is quite natural that the same causes should operate on two persons apart from
                                    each other at the same time. I have sometimes tried to put the thing to practical
                                    uses and have always failed. However, I hope that this theory or some other will
                                    induce you to write again and often.
                        I have twice brought the two oriental nations [together] after very great and
                                    annoying labor. The first time the Chinese deceived me by substituting their own
                                    letters patent for those that I had prepared. The second time I took the precaution
                                    to wire to 
                                        Japan
                                     copies of the letters in Chinese and English—and when they
                                    made some slight objections to the verbiage I wired them amended as suggested in the
                                    two languages. I hope Li Hung Chang5 will stick and that peace
                                    will result.
                        In many ways war annoys the foreigners in the Far East. My colleagues—all
                                    but one—have marines here. I have not brought mine up from Tientsin.
                                    Should the Japanese march on Peking I will order up marines to
                                    protect—not myself particularly—but the seventy or so
                                    Americans—men women and children who are at Peking. Our danger will come
                                    if at all from disbanded soldiers. Mean time Peking is perfectly quiet. A company of
                                    Chinese soldiers armed with spears and swords are at my gate—but they
                                    would probably run from a mob. I have received many thanks from the Chinese
                                    Government—among them an autographic letter from the
                                    Emperor—and much commendation from the foreigners for my efforts for
                                    peace. Several erroneous despatches by wire have been sent from Peking as to my
                                    utterances. Discredit all such—I wire nobody but the Dept and I do not
                                    talk. Love to all.

                        Fayette
                     County, Indiana, Marriages, 1825–1830
            In this issue the third and last installment of 
                        Fayette
                     County marriages is presented, bringing them down through 1830. By this time 
                        Fayette
                     County was no longer the focal point in central Indiana that it had been during the
                    first years following its formation in 1819, when many residents of the surrounding area had to go
                    there to obtain their marriage licenses. In the March, 1956, issue marriages from the first record
                    book (1819–1822) were printed; the June issue contained the marriages from Book A
                    (1823–1826); while in the present issue marriages from the first 221 pages of Book B
                    (1825–1833) are printed. Although the dates of Books A and B overlap there does not seem
                    to be any duplication of names. Persons using the series should watch for variant spellings of
                    family names. Book B is the first in which the pages are numbered.

               Standard Oil Company (Indiana): Oil Pioneer of the Middle West. By Paul H.
                    Giddens. (
                        New York
                    : Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc., 1955, pp. xviii, 741. Illustrations, maps, charts,
                    bibliographical note, and index. $7.50.)
            In the past twelve months nearly a dozen books have been published on various aspects of the
                    petroleum industry, several of them major works by mature scholars. The range of these studies
                    encompasses almost every phase of the industry, from the history of individual units and
                    oil-producing regions to specialized monographs dealing with the economics of oil production,
                    distribution, marketing, and transportation. The result of this major addition to our knowledge of
                    the development, structure, and operation of one of the world's leading industries has
                    caused historians, economists, and educated laymen generally to pause and reappraise some of their
                    long-accepted views on the growth of the industry and its relationship to the operation of the
                    American and world economies. One of the works which will contribute materially to our knowledge of
                    the American oil industry is Paul H. Giddens' history of the Standard Oil
                        Company (Indiana).
            
            Here is a notably comprehensive record of a major mid-western industrial enterprise. Though the theme
                    is the growth of a business, Giddens' concept of business history is far from a narrow one.
                    There is valuable material here for the social, political, and economic historian as well as for the
                    specialist in business and entrepreneurial history. Indeed, some specialists may question the wisdom
                    of having included so much that is not specifically the primary domain of the business historian.
                    Although everyone may not agree with the author's choice of material and allocation of
                    space, everyone will profit from reading this work carefully.
            Organized in 1889 as a manufacturer of refined petroleum products for the Standard Oil combination,
                    Standard of Indiana continued almost exclusively in this capacity until the 1892 reorganization of
                    the Standard Oil Trust. One of the immediate effects upon the Indiana company of this regrouping of
                    interests was to increase the company's capital  stock,
                    thus facilitating its acquisition of several companies with marketing agencies in 
                        Minnesota
                     , 
                        Chicago
                    , northern 
                        Illinois
                    , and northeastern 
                        Wisconsin
                    . From that time until 1911, when the Standard Oil combination was dissolved by the 
                        United States
                     Supreme Court, Standard of Indiana experienced a period of remarkable growth and rapid
                    expansion. At the time of the Trust's dissolution the Indiana company owned three
                    refineries and marketing facilities representing investments of $11,725,000.00 and
                    $7,956,508.32 respectively, but it did not own one piece of crude oil-producing land or
                    any pipeline facilities.
            The history of Indiana Standard since 1911 is largely the story of physical growth, corporate
                    expansion, and functional diversification. By mid-twentieth century the Company had become a great,
                    almost totally integrated oil company "engaged in every phase of the oil business from
                    drilling wild cat wells to selling gasoline."
            In the limited space available here it is impossible even to begin to cite the many fresh insights
                    and acute observations which Giddens sets down on internal corporate changes, industrial
                    developments, and public policies. What was the actual effect of the 1911 dissolution upon the
                    constituent companies? How was separation achieved? What problems did it involve? To what extent
                    were the former members of the combination "independent" after 1911? Why did
                    "active competition" among the newly independent companies take so long to
                    materialize? These are just a few of the important questions that are raised and answered in this
                    book. Heretofore much of the evidence on such questions as these was incomplete, and the commonly
                    accepted explanations not always based upon careful research. By judicious use of private company
                    sources and the extant public record, Giddens supplies, often for the first time, a more complete,
                    certainly more realistic, understanding to many of these long-debated questions.
            One of the more interesting sections of this history is Giddens' description of early
                    petroleum technology and the role of pure and applied science in the development of the modern
                    industry. The problem of manufacturing Lima crude, "pole cat oil," as it was often
                    called because of its offensive odor, is an example of the author's ability to make a
                    technical  and complex subject interesting and informative. In
                    discussing the various important technical and scientific innovations in the petroleum industry,
                    Giddens is always careful to avoid technical jargon which can easily confuse the general reader. The
                    style is always lucid, often interesting.
            The new material and interpretations which the author sets forth in this work are of wide import and
                    of vital significance not only to the specialist, but to everyone who is interested in coming as
                    close to the truth as possible. The history of the Standard Oil Company (Indiana)
                    is a good example of the important information that can be derived from a judicious and
                    discriminating use of a large collection of private papers, augmented and checked by a careful
                    survey and evaluation of the public record.
            Giddens has written a careful and detailed account of the second largest oil company and the fourth
                    largest manufacturing corporation in the 
                        United States
                    . Within these pages there is much valuable information on many of the problems and
                    issues involved in the administration of a large corporation. Certain of these are treated more
                    fully than others. It is difficult, for example, to get a clear picture of the various financial
                    policies employed over the years and their total effect upon the expansion of the business. Costs,
                    profits, and the employment of capital resources are not always clearly set down. More tables and
                    charts graphically pointing out such matters would have been very helpful. Although the author is
                    careful to indicate how much Standard of Indiana's success resulted from the high quality
                    of its management, the evolution and formulation of long-range policy is often not readily apparent.
                    While labor relations in the oil industry have been far more tranquil than in many others, the
                    reason for this might have been more fully developed. But these are minor criticisms, and are in no
                    wise meant to detract from the overall high quality of this work. Most readers will find what they
                    are looking for in this book. The combination of a fascinating story and a felicitous pen

               Money at Interest; the Farm Mortgage on the Middle Border. By Allan G. Bogue. (
                        Ithaca
                    , 
                        New York
                    : Cornell University Press, 1955, pp. x, 293. Bibliography and index. $4.00.)
            This is a study of one aspect of free enterprise. Professor Allan G. Bogue has written the first
                    full-scale account of the western farm mortgage business in five states during the last decades of
                    the nineteenth century.
            The sources in the bibliography presage the achievement in the monograph. A fair-minded picture of
                    the eastern investor has been presented (pp. 7–75). Equally balanced and even more vivid
                    is the picture of the middleman (pp. 77–204). But the farmer who actually used the money
                    shares his fewer pages with the analysis of two townships and remains a shadowy figure (pp.
                    205–261). Unfortunately this part of the study was made without the representative
                    personalities that gave a sympathetic understanding of the investor and middleman.
            During the period studied by Professor Bogue, in fact until the federal government regulation after
                    1932, in spite of state laws to regulate there were enough unscrupulous men engaged in loaning money
                    that all in the business suffered in reputation. Fortunately the author has centered his study on
                    the men with ability and character who are the main support of any constructive activity.
            Investors, such as John and Ira Davenport, loaned their own money and made repayment a main aim. The
                    rates of interest, analyzed in four tables, were 10 per cent to 17 per cent before 1879; moreover
                    there were such additional costs to the borrower as the commission. As would be expected, there were
                    numerous foreclosures; but later, when the rate dropped to 7 per cent, foreclosures practically
                    ceased. Legal rates, expenses, risks, competition, and what the borrower was able to pay set the
                    rates. Money was loaned for from one to five years to finance not more than one-third of the value
                    of such investments as livestock, equipment, and land; or to tide over bad times. Much depended upon
                    the character of the man to whom the loan was made and the purpose was to help him as well as to
                    have a return on the money loaned. Foreclosure was a last resort, sometimes with a low return of 2.5
                    per cent on the investment.
            
            The middleman, who was represented in this study by J. B. Watkins, had to be able to serve both
                    investors and borrowers. Funds were obtained both in the 
                        United States
                     and in 
                        England
                    . One of the ways investors were located was through the religious press; newspapers and
                    agents were also used. Emphasis was placed on rising land values, the policy that loans should not
                    exceed one-third of the value of the property, the policy that loans were made only to resident
                    farmers for productive purposes, and, sometimes, the guarantee of interest and principal by Watkins.
                    Borrowers were located by newspapers, circulars, and agents. The agents, who received a commission,
                    also made the important inspection to evaluate the risk. For it helped to secure the business if
                    rates were lower than those of competitors, and this meant that in order to make money the security
                    had to be good. Drought, distance, unfavorable publicity, inspection of land titles, adjusting
                    rates, and fraud by both agents and borrowers tested the ability of the middleman. Violent
                    competition resulted in incorporation in 1883 and then a period with substantial surplus.
                    Nevertheless, spreading interests over too wide an area, purchasing too much land, and depression
                    resulted in receivership for the Watkins Land Company in 1894. Watkins was not dishonest but used
                    the provisions of the law to save part of his fortune.
            The last two chapters show the use made of credit in two townships. Probably of most interest to
                    Hoosiers will be the possible application of this method to their townships.
            The summary gives a convenient statement of the welcome contribution of Professor Bogue. Future
                    studies should give more attention to what has often been considered the main weakness of the
                    mortgage system before the Federal Land Banks in 1916: the failure to provide for a gradual paying
                    of loans over a reasonable period.

               The Rise of the National Trade Union. By Lloyd Ulman. (
                        Cambridge
                    : 
                        Harvard

            This is a comprehensive and scholarly study of the emergence and development of the national union in
                    the latter half of the nineteenth and early years of the twentieth  century. Professor Ulman examines the forces which gave rise to the
                    national union and which conditioned the development of its structure, governing institutions, and
                    economic policies. From a detailed analysis of the constitutions, convention proceedings, and
                    journals of five national unions he presents a graphic account of how these unions, through a
                    process of trial and error, worked out acceptable solutions to the many problems which accompanied
                    the formation of a national union.
            The study is divided into seven parts. In Part I a survey is made of important historical and
                    economic developments during the latter half of the nineteenth century which influenced the growth
                    and structure of the trade union movement. Professor Ulman singles out for examination the following
                    factors: (1) immigration, (2) the extension of markets, (3) innovation, (4) the big firm, and (5)
                    business conditions. Ulman feels that Common's theory that the expansion of markets was
                    primarily responsible for the growth and character of trade unions requires amplification.
                    "Specifically, it fails to account for the absence of national unions in some industries
                    which had national markets" and it "also fails to account for the presence of
                    national unions in industries which did not have national markets." (p. 45).
            In Part II Ulman shows how (in the absence of a national market for products) the existence of a
                    national market for labor proved, in fact, to be a sufficient cause for the rise of national unions.
                    He finds that during the period in which the first national unions emerged the geographic mobility
                    of labor was economically more important in terms of the geographic range of its effectiveness and
                    the percentage of the working population engaged in migratory activity than in preceding periods or
                    in more recent times. Though local unions were reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the
                    increased geographic mobility of labor, it posed certain inescapable problems which could only be
                    handled by a national union.
            Part III is concerned with the extension of national authority over the initiation and conduct of
                    strikes. Ulman finds that while the presence of a national fund was in some cases sufficient to
                    bring about national control over strikes, this was not always the case. Other factors such as
                    skill, the nature of the market, benefits, the age and date of formation of the national union, and
                    the scope of employer relations  were important, not only in the
                    extension of national control over strikes but in the establishment of strike funds.
            Part IV deals with the evolution of the governing institutions of the early national unions. As a
                    frame of reference Ulman gives a brief summary of British experience. He then shows how the power
                    and authority of the executive gradually increased with the acquisition of power by the national
                    union. The local unions sought, with little success, to maintain control over the national union and
                    the executive by investing superior powers in various institutions such as the convention of
                    delegates and the executive board, and by providing in some instances for the referendum and the
                    direct election of officers.
            The "foreign affairs" or relationships of the national union with outside
                    organizations are covered in Parts V and VI. Part V deals with jurisdiction and federation. Here
                    Ulman has examined the economic aspects and implications of jurisdiction and the national
                    unions' relations with—and ultimate dominance over—both local and
                    national federations. In Part VI he considers various aspects of the national unions'
                    relations with employers. An examination is made of union attitudes and reactions toward certain
                    employer wage and output practices and of the development of bargaining strategy and policies with
                    reference to strikes, union work rules, national collective bargaining, equal pay, and so forth.
            In Part VII Ulman presents a reappraisal of two leading theories of the labor movement (those of
                    Commons and Perlman), and a sketch of a different hypothesis, in part alternative and in part
                    supplementary to the other theories. He finds both theories inadequate in certain important respects
                    and is particularly critical of Perlman's stress on the "psychology of the working
                    man" in explaining American labor's ultimate choice of collective bargaining.
            In his foreword to this book Professor Sumner S. Slichter points out that, though there have been
                    excellent histories of particular national unions and good studies of different aspects of union
                    government and selected union policies, there has been lacking a comprehensive study such as this.
                    He feels that Ulman's study "will quickly win recognition as one of the most
                    competent and distinguished books on American industrial relations." (p. x). Professor

            During the past few years British historians have been engaged in a publishing project "to
                    make generally accessible a wide selection of the fundamental sources of English history."
                    Under the general editorship of David C. Douglas, English Historical Documents
                    will cover in thirteen volumes the years from Anglo-Saxon times down to the beginning of World War
                    I. The four volumes under review are the only ones that have already been published. In setting
                    forth the aim of the series, the general editor notes that there has been a tremendous accumulation
                    of primary historical materials over the past fifty years in many scattered periodicals and volumes.
                    Oftentimes the student and the non-specialist scholar have had difficulty in obtaining these
                    authorities. There is need, therefore, for a large-scale series that will bring together in one
                    place a "comprehensive corpus of evidence" relating to specific historical
                    periods.
            The large scope of the series (the four volumes thus far published range from 867 to 1014 pages)
                    makes it possible to print the documents in full wherever it is feasible to do so. In this respect
                    the series differs from traditional source books which often contain only brief extracts of key
                    documents. Another basic feature is the sketching of the main outlines of the period covered by each
                    volume in a general introduction and the inclusion of shorter introductions for particular groups of
                    documents. One of the very useful features of the series is the inclusion of selected annotated
                    bibliographies which accompany the introductions.
            In the case of Volumes I and II the editorial tasks have been particularly demanding. This is true
                    because numerous Anglo-Saxon, Latin, or Old French texts, normally incomprehensible  to many readers because of the language barrier, have been given fresh
                    and authoritative translations. For example, approximately two hundred pages of Volume I have been
                    allotted to the translations by editor Dorothy Whitelock of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and
                    Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation. In Volume II, which
                    is mainly concerned with the causes and consequences of the 
                        Norman
                     Conquest, similar extensive translations of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, as well as the
                    Domesday Book, are provided. In addition, a forty-page pictorial representation of the Bayeux
                    tapestry has been wisely included in this volume. Such heavy reliance as this upon a few lengthy
                    contemporary accounts, supplemented by many shorter documents, distinguishes Volumes I and II from
                    Volumes VIII and IX. No such preponderance of any one document is apparent in Volume VIII, edited by
                    Andrew Browning and covering the later Stuart period. This is perhaps an indication of the greater
                    number and richer variety of materials which have become available to scholars in the early modern
                    period.
            The Browning volume deals primarily with Restoration institutions: the monarchy, Parliament, and the
                    church as well as the revolutionary settlement following 1688. The great variety of historical
                    materials, plus the age's penchant for character sketching, make it possible to present
                    some leading personalities as they were viewed by their contemporaries such as Gilbert Burnet, John
                    Dryden, John Evelyn, and Samuel Pepys. Quite properly, a rather lengthy section is devoted to public
                    finance, for this was the fundamental dilemma which plagued the Stuarts throughout the century and
                    allowed disaffected religious elements to make known their grievances in Parliament. Another section
                    on trade and plantations conspicuously avoids documents referring to the American colonies except
                    for a few parliamentary statutes such as the Navigation Act of 1660. The reason behind this
                    editorial decision was to eliminate duplication, for this volume is one of three (the other two
                    being the forthcoming Volumes VII, 1603–1660, and X, 1714–1783) which will chronologically parallel the one volume in the series
                    solely devoted to American colonial development from Jamestown to the Declaration of Independence.
            Volume IX, American Colonial Documents to 1776, edited by the project's
                    lone American historian, Merrill Jensen,  will be of particular
                    interest to teachers and students of the American colonial period. Apart from the introductions and
                    bibliographies, the book is divided into eight major sections which tend to stress political and
                    economic factors more than social and intellectual forces. They are (1) the foundation of the
                    English colonies, (2) the evolution of colonial governments, (3) the economic development, (4)
                    population and labor, (5) religion and education, (6) expansion and social discontent, (7) British
                    colonial policies and the growth of colonial opposition, 1763–1773, and (8) the coming of
                    the War for American Independence, 1773–1776. The documents themselves, 179 in number,
                    are arranged chronologically under topical sub-sections of each of the eight major sections. This
                    organizational principle is on the whole quite satisfactory and consistently followed. However, the
                    editor decided to subsume under other unrelated topics the various plans for colonial union which
                    occurred at widely divergent times. For example, the Galloway Plan of Union (1774) is adequately
                    treated under "The First Continental Congress" and the Dominion of New 
                        England
                     (1688) under "British Policy and Colonial Government." This
                    organization may account for the omission in the volume of two plans for colonial union: the New 
                        England
                     Confederation (1643) and the 
                        Albany
                     Plan of Union (1754).
            Inevitably, this volume will be compared with existing collections of colonial material such as the
                    relevant pages of Henry S. Commager's Documents in American History,
                    Samuel E. Morison's Sources and Documents Illustrating the American
                        Revolution, 1764–1788, and such specialized collections as Miller and Johnson,
                        The Puritans. Most of the important documents in the Commager book have been
                    included in the Jensen volume except for the Quebec Act of 1774. Although the Morison collection
                    contains only about one-half as much material as Jensen's for the period
                    1763–1776, nevertheless the former contains excerpts from some important pamphlet
                    material which the latter does not. Some of these tracts, among the finest examples of colonial
                    political thought, are the Letters from a Farmer in 
                            Pennsylvania
                         to the Inhabitants of the British Colonies, James Otis' The Rights of the Colonies Asserted and Proved, and James Wilson's Considerations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British
                    Parliament. The  Morison volume, then, remains useful as a
                    supplement to this new book. This is even more true of the Miller and Johnson volume on Puritanism.
                    Professor Jensen does include a very brief extract from Roger Williams' The
                        Bloudy Tenent, of Persecution, which is a unique and important contribution to early
                    American political thought. However, it is not at all representative of the federal covenant
                    theology of New 
                        England
                     Puritanism, of which there is no representative selection. And yet to have included all
                    of these omissions would have meant editing another volume.
            A large number of the documents printed in the Jensen volume have been published in historical
                    collections before. In most cases the editor has chosen to reprint these texts rather than obtain
                    microfilms of the originals. Certainly, in the case of some manuscripts, there would be little point
                    in repeating, for example, the recent fine editing by Julian Boyd of the Declaration of Independence
                    or Morison's Of 
                            Plymouth
                         Plantation 1620–1647 by William Bradford. Yet some of the printed
                    documents, both pamphlet literature and official papers, were edited many years ago—a
                    few, more than a hundred years ago—and by much less distinguished editors. On the other
                    hand, a small portion of the material, primarily dealing with the economic development of the
                    colonies, has been taken directly from the manuscript collections of the Public Record Office and
                    Her Majesty's Stationery Office. Included in these documents are about twenty pages of
                    statistical tables on colonial commerce.
            No two historians, of course, can agree on the same documents to be included in a work of such
                    magnitude as this one. Some would put more stress on relations with the Indians; others would omit
                    trade statistics. In the main, however, most of the important documents are included, and this
                    volume will be indispensable for the colonial historian. Indeed, the whole series, when it is
                    finally completed, will be, despite its high cost, a distinct contribution to English and American
                    historical studies if only because of the convenience of having the important documents assembled in
                    one place.

            Paul M. Angle has certainly succeeded in producing a unique work; namely, a history of a historical
                    society which is witty, readable, and, at the same time, informative and factually accurate. He has
                    accomplished this result by a skillful selection of letters, documents, and news clippings which he
                    allows to speak for themselves, with but brief introductions and comments. It is a work of stark
                    impressionism, done with broad strokes and in vivid colors. In consequence, it communicates to the
                    reader a sense of identification with events in the life of the 
                        Chicago
                     Historical Society and of 
                        Chicago
                     which no dry chronological record of the minutiae of society records could possibly
                    accomplish. It stimulates the imagination of the reader to cooperate with the author to amplify his
                    pungent comments. There is a laugh on nearly every page.
            Of course, no one could tell the tale of the 
                        Chicago
                     Historical Society in the first century of its life (1856–1956) without
                    reflecting the highlights of 
                        Chicago
                     history in this fabulous era when 
                        Chicago
                     was transformed from a crude trading village set in a wilderness to a mighty
                    metropolis; the true capital of the Middle West; the financial center of the richest empire the
                    world has even known; and a formidable cultural and educational venture.
            The only astonishing phenomenon is that, considering the vast effort necessarily expended in this
                    century by the citizens of 
                        Chicago
                     in the material realm, they had energy left to cultivate the arts and foresight to
                    document their history in the making by supporting so generously their historical society and
                    accumulating the documents, letters, books, and records which perpetuate their experiences.
            In the great 
                        Chicago
                     fires of 1871 and 1874 the Society's building and all of its original
                    collections were destroyed, including two thousand volumes of sermons with which the more pious
                    early inhabitants seem to have endowed the library. But the Society arose from the ashes, and in the
                    ensuing seventy-five years has accumulated a distinguished library and collection of invaluable
                    historical source material contained in a beautiful building of noble proportions, in  which likewise is housed a museum which displays & visual
                    pageant of 
                        Chicago
                    's history. The vigilance of the Society's officers is to be
                    commended, particularly in their solicitation in 1882 of a gift of the Lincoln papers then in the
                    custody of Robert Todd Lincoln, who, in his reply to the Society (August 27, 1882) made one of the
                    most colossal understatements of all times when he said: " 'In reply to your
                    letter of August 7th respecting the custody of letters and documents received and preserved by my
                    father and mother, I have to say to you that the idea of placing them in the custody of the
                    Historical Society would strike me with favor if there were anything of sufficient consequence to
                    include in such a collection. …' "
            While the Society acquired none of the 
                        Washington
                     papers, we are relieved to learn that it has one of his razors. Amongst its more
                    gruesome artifacts are the bones of John Lalime, one of the earliest settlers of 
                        Chicago
                    . But the Society felt obliged to decline, in 1943, the preferred gift by Sally Rand of
                    the fan which she used so effectively in her famous dances at the 
                        Chicago
                     World's Fair of 1933. The 
                  
                            Chicago
                         Daily News headline of this event is duly recorded: "Sally Rand
                    pitches curves to fan Historical Society."
            Angle modestly described his work as an unconventional chronicle. And so it is. But it will be read
                    with chuckles by succeeding generations, which is more than can be said of the mine run of society
                    histories.
            The book is a most attractive example of printing and binding, and contains a serviceable index.

               The Parkman Reader: From the Works of Francis Parkman. Selected and edited by

                    : Little,

                    $6.00.)
            This is a book designed to attract the general reader. Unfortunately in the writing of history the
                    number of failures to accomplish this task are much more numerous than the successes. When the works
                    of perhaps our greatest literary historian are out of print it seems necessary that new readers
                    should be given the opportunity to sample his writing in the hope that they will beg for more.
                    History need not be dull, as Parkman demonstrates again and again. Samuel E. Morison has selected
                    chapters from Parkman's study of 
                    
                        France
                     and 
                        England
                     in the New World in an effort to make the era live again in the mind of the reader. In
                    this task he has succeeded admirably.
            Some historians may find fault with Morison's selections but in this reader's
                    opinion the choices are excellent. The continuity of the volume is remarkable. One may follow the
                    story from the description of the Indian tribes in their native habitat and the coming of the French
                    to the fall of the French at Quebec in 1759. Whole chapters are presented sometimes in sequence
                    rather than excerpts. There is no selection from The Conspiracy of Pontiac but
                    this seems justifiable from the standpoint of the continuity of the story.
            The selections may be divided conveniently into four parts. Group number one includes a description
                    of the early settling. Following the picture of the Indian tribes from The Jesuits
                    one is led to the story of early French exploration and settlement. Individuals such as Champlain
                    seem alive through the magic of Parkman. The role and trials of the Jesuits are vividly illustrated
                    through the story of the martyrdom of Father Jogues. A second division includes selections from The Old Regime in 
                            Canada
                        
                portraying life in the area. Trade, industry, marriage, morals, manners,
                    feudalism, government—all aspects of life in the era are described. From here Morison
                    decided to turn to the westward movement through the eyes of La Salle. All this prepares the reader
                    for the final story of the struggle for control of North America between the French and the English.
                    The sack of Deer field, the siege of Louisbourg, and the battle on the plains of Abraham are all
                    epic narratives of this contest. Parkman's scholarship, imagination, and literary qualities
                    make this a thrilling presentation that grips and holds the attention of the reader.
            These chapters are preceded by an exceedingly interesting introduction by the editor.
                    Morison's admiration and defense of Parkman is evident yet he presents a clear picture of
                    the historian and the man. An interesting description of Parkman in 1871 written by
                    l'Abbé Casgrain is included. Many of Parkman's notes are omitted since
                    the book is designed for the general reader, but Morison has added some of his own, including
                    corrections of fact and summaries of new research and conclusions. The bibliography includes an
                    account of the various editions of Parkman's works and a summary of the sales of these
                    volumes.

               The Original Has This Signature—W. K. Kellogg. By Horace B. Powell.
                    (Englewood Cliffs, N. J.: Prentice Hall, Inc., 1956, pp. ix, 358. Preface and illustrations.
                    $5.00).
            This volume will appeal to the general reader because it is a typical success story and deals with an
                    activity that involves practically all consumers of food. The historian will be interested for an
                    additional reason since the book will be one more addition to the list of volumes dealing with
                    American business institutions and their founders.
            The personal record of William K. Kellogg is presented in an interesting and forthright narrative and
                    the author, while treating his subject with understanding and sympathy, does not hesitate to point
                    out the limitation of this self-made "rugged individualist." Powell underlines
                    some of the faults of William K. Kellogg by telling the story of his estrangement from a brother, a
                    son, and a grandson. His older brother, John Harvey Kellogg, won fame as the founder of the Battle
                    Creek Sanitarium and the promoter of health foods. William, who began his successful career as an
                    aid to the widely known John Harvey Kellogg, soon broke with him on questions of policy. The younger
                    brother by virtue of a court decision was permitted to use the Kellogg name in his advertising.
            It was with the caption: "The Original Has This Signature—W. K. Kellogg"
                    that the great advertising campaign of corn flakes was launched. William K. must be credited with
                    sound judgment in the use of advertising, but he never displayed equally sound judgment in
                    recognizing his brother's important, if unwilling, contribution to the popularity of the
                    trade name. William K. Kellogg's estrangement from his son and his grandson underlines a
                    quality of willfulness that seems to mark many self-made men. As an employer he had a high sense of
                    loyalty to his workers and dealt justly with them but the relationship never developed into one of
                    personal friendship. Even his immediate aids and advisors never penetrated the barrier caused by an
                    apparently conscious desire to keep all "employees in awe of him."
            In his last twenty-five years W. K. Kellogg turned his attention to philanthropy and established a
                    foundation "for improving the health, happiness and well being of children and
                    youth." This part of the story is told with sympathy and understanding in the final
                    chapters of the book. Those  readers interested in more details
                    can find them in The First Twenty-five Years—W. K. Kellogg Foundation
                        1930–1955, published in Battle Creek, 
                        Michigan
                    , in 1955.
            Powell gives only brief attention to the relation of the Kellogg organization to other companies or
                    to the retail phase of the business. An unpublished history of the company, which the author lists
                    in his "Acknowledgement," would probably fill this gap.
            The book is written in simple and direct style, the text is excellent, and the illustrations are well
                    selected. The author indicates that the work was designed for the general public, but this
                    explanation does not satisfy the scholar's need for an index and bibliography.

               Eisenhower the President. By Merlo J. Pusey. (
                        New York
                    : The Macmillan Company, 1956, pp. 300. Index. $3.75).
            In every presidential election year the American people have campaign documents of various types
                    through which they can become acquainted with the candidates and issues of the campaign. When the
                    President seeks another term, he naturally runs on his record. Merlo J. Pusey's Eisenhower the President is a campaign document but a first-rate one. The author,
                    who won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Charles Evans Hughes, knows how to tell a story. He
                    has a readable style and in the Eisenhower administration he has a story worth telling.
            The present regime in 
                        Washington
                     is pictured as one of clean politics and fair play and is contrasted with the dirty
                    politics and foul play of the Democratic administrations. Although the author does not admit it,
                    both of our major parties have their honest leaders and their corrupt spokesmen. When the reader has
                    finished Eisenhower the President, he should turn to the May issue of Harper's Magazine and read Warren Unna's article, "Republican
                    'Give-aways': The Charges and the Facts." The contrast is appalling.
            "Probably no President," says Pusey, "has ever done more than Eisenhower
                    to promote good causes, to help people in distress, to cheer the victims of misfortune, or to lift
                    the general morale of the people." (p. 99). Evidently, the return  to work of about one-third of our employables beginning in 1933 was
                    forgotten. Much will be made in the ensuing campaign of Republican prosperity. One looks in vain in
                    this book for any mention of approximately 30 per cent decrease in farmers' income since
                    1952 and for any indication of the more than 40 per cent increase in little business failures in the
                    same time. These facts may presage trouble ahead.
            In foreign affairs the difference between the Taft and Eisenhower wings of the Republican party is
                    labelled as merely "differences of degree," whereas the contrast was fundamentally
                    that between isolationists and cooperationists. Nowhere, perhaps, in Mr. Pusey's book is
                    his thesis of Republican "light" contrasted with Democratic
                    "darkness" more obvious than in his treatment of Dulles and his predecessor
                    Acheson. When Dulles became Secretary of State Acheson had already hurled the unfortunate South
                    Koreans to the Communist wolves. Dulles, however, "with a fabulous store of knowledge and
                    wisdom," is pictured as having prodigious energy and a superb technique in deflating the
                    Soviet bluster. Such is the nature of this campaign document. Certainly, the author would not
                    contend that he has written an objective book. As Republican campaign propaganda it is excellent.
                    Otherwise it has no reison d'être.

            This brief history of Indiana Central College, located at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was written at the request of its Golden Anniversary Committee. The material is
                    divided into five sections: The Origin and Growth, 1902–1905; Building Period,
                    1915–1930; Progress, 1931–1944; The New Era, 1944–1955; In
                    Retrospect. Within each section the author discusses such topics as administration, departments and
                    faculty, and student life.
            Indiana Central College is one of the younger church-related institutions of the state. Founded by
                    the Church of the United Brethren in Christ, the college was incorporated in 1902 and its doors were
                    opened to students in 1905. Higher  education was not new to the
                    church, however, for Otterbein College in 
                        Ohio
                     had been established in 1847. The author also states that the "institutions
                    which might be considered predecessors of Indiana Central were 
                        Roanoke
                     and Bourbon Seminaries, North 
                        Manchester
                     College, and Hartsville College." (p. 3).
            The struggles of Indiana Central are typical of the small college with inadequate financial support.
                    Not infrequently statements such as these are found: "By 1912 the college required a
                    substantial loan in order that it might continue." (p. 15). "It was voted that the
                    teachers would be paid … in cash or in notes with six per cent interest." (p.
                    19). Such an entry is found frequently in the minutes of the Executive Committee. "On
                    December 30, 1915, Indiana Central College was $80,000 in debt." (p. 27).
                    "By 1920 the campaign had succeeded in gaining pledges totaling $333,000.
                    Unfortunately … a considerable number of the pledges in this campaign and subsequent
                    campaigns were just promises and nothing more." (p. 28). In 1931, $190,000 were
                    borrowed at 6 per cent interest.
            A better day came, however, following World War II. In 1945 the last of the mortgage indebtedness of
                    the school was paid off, and the merger of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ with the
                    Evangelical Church was helpful in providing better support. In 1947 the college was accredited by
                    the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The campus has grown from eight
                    acres to fifty-nine, and building facilities have expanded accordingly. Starting with seventy-four,
                    student enrollment now not infrequently reaches the five hundred mark. Of the thirty-two full-time
                    faculty members, about half of them have the doctor's degree. Throughout the years, the
                    purpose of the college—that of providing an institution of higher learning in a Christian
                    atmosphere—has remained.
            This reviewer has little to offer in the way of adverse criticism. To say that here and there the
                    English could have been improved is merely to say what is true of much writing. Some questions that
                    may arise in the reader's mind are not answered, but the work cannot be judged as a full or
                    definitive history for it was not intended to be such. Very little, if anything, is said, for
                    instance, about religious problems which the school might have had on the campus or in its  relation with the supporting church, and one wonders whether
                    these were inconsequential.
            The author and Indiana Central College are to be congratulated for publishing this work, brief though
                    it is. Our church-related colleges have made an invaluable contribution to American civilization,
                    and historians and others will welcome this additional contribution to our cultural history.

            Any history of a denominational college is the history of a group of dedicated people. The story of
                    the growth and development of 
                        Goshen
                     College is no exception, as shown in this book written by a retired faculty member of
                    the school. Author Umble traces the patterns of the college's life from 1894 through 1954.
            
               
                        Goshen
                     College began as the 
                        Elkhart
                     Institute with only a few of its students high school graduates, with a shifting
                    student population, and always with problems of finance. For years, another of its major problems
                    was the question of its relationship to its conservative sponsor, the Mennonite church. Gradually,
                    the various difficulties worked themselves toward solution as the college gained both denominational
                    and lay recognition as an institution worthy of support.
            As is usual in such cases, the support never equaled the demands; nevertheless the school moved onto
                    firm and stable footings. Leadership made this possible: President Byers, Hartzler, Kauffman, Yoder,
                    and Miller are but a few of the men to be remembered. Underpaid and overworked faculty members,
                    devoting their lives to the ideals of the college, should also be listed in full, for without their
                    services the present strong and influential educational institution could not have developed. They
                    have nobly served under the college motto: "Culture for Service."
            The use of footnotes and citations, and the organization of material in this book may disturb the
                    professional historian. Still, the work is adequate for the lay person for  whom it is intended. It is sure to be a source of great pride and
                    warmth to those who have personal associations with this school.
