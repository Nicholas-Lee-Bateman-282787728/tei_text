                    in 1855 to keep the political fires burning, the manipulators of Fusionism were cautiously observing
                    the cooling-down process, waiting to see what they had created. The year 1855 would reveal whether

                    political affiliations and to forward the new movement. They declared that freedom, temperance, and
                    pure elections should be the watchword of the party. The "people" resolved that

            <p>When the meeting adjourned, the Know Nothings in the group stayed on to hold a conclave of their
                    state council. After many arguments, they chose Godlove Orth as their candidate for <placeName>

                    for the brittle new party, for the politically experienced realized that organization should come
                    before a search for party spoils. Men like Jacob Chapman and Michael C. Garber had hoped that strong
                    organization would be developed.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the legislature convened in January, 1855, the new party was given its first opportunity to
                    carry out its political promises. The first obstacle to hurdle was the election of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator. Rather than permit the choice of a Fusionist, the Democrats refused to caucus.
                    Some Fusionists who reasoned that the so-called old liners could not refuse to go into an election
                    felt that the stalemate was temporary. As Orth wrote: "For this would, more than anything
                    else [serve] to drive us together &amp; Keep us together for the next campaign—nor
                    will the Prest. Election swallow up this dereliction of duty as they confidentially
                        hope."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A week went by, and with it went the hope of ending the deadlock. Orth's optimism was gone;
                    now he wrote: "If they [the old liners] had the assurance that a Natl. Whig—who
                    didn't fuse, don't fuse, and who is anti-Sam, could command the necessary
                    strength—they would, in my opinion, give him the old line vote—and elect

                    encounter. As a consequence of this stalemate, Jesse Bright alone represented Indiana in the United
                    States Senate until 1857. In the meantime, the legislature attempted to co-operate on other matters.</p>
            <p>The temperance advocates of 1854 were still to be satisfied. Early in February, 1855, the general
                    assembly approved an act which prohibited the sale of liquor in the state, following the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName> law principle. The new law passed with a comfortable majority and in the senate, where
                    the Democrats held a slight advantage, seven members of that party supported it. Popular reaction
                    among the "cold water" boys was spontaneous. Indiana had again joined the ranks of
                    the reformers. Governor Joseph A. Wright's faithful correspondent, John Hunt, reported that
                    "the people here are Laughing all over their faces on account [of] the passage of the
                    Temperence Bill; we have had 2 illuminations. they are becoming intemperate on
                        temperence."<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The so-called Whiskey Democrats were not yet defeated, however. Within a short time, an <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> saloonkeeper named Roderick Beebe opened for business. His immediate arrest made
                    possible a test case. The Indiana Supreme Court received the case in the November term, and Judge
                    Samuel E. Perkins, who had declared the legislation of 1853 unconstitutional, handed down the same
                    decision on this temperance bill.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Thus the door was opened once again for
                    unhampered liquor traffic. Politically, the Democrats had won another victory, this time in the
                    courts of the state.</p>
            <p>Their defeat stimulated the temperance advocates to action again, but this time their sphere of
                    activity was within the new party. As a direct result of the Beebe decision, the state temperance
                    convention met in <placeName>

                    </placeName> on February 22, 1856. The resolutions of the convention were the same as those of the
                    past, and the advocates declared they would not support for a state political office any candidate
                    who opposed a prohibitory law. The leaders of this convention were familiar <list type="footnotes">

                    turbulence of the sectional conflict. The Democrats, however, by refusing to approve a prohibitory
                    law were seemingly taking a calculated political risk. They kept the good will of the foreign

                    success. The bank run of 1854 had exposed the frailties resulting from the mushroom growth of the
                    free banks. As the time for expiration of the charter of the Second State Bank drew near, the
                    politicians stepped in to create a new structure. The new bank bill was promptly vetoed by the
                    governor, whose antibank sympathies were well known. The legislature, however, overrode the veto
                    with the result that a new system went into effect.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While this new system was an economic success in itself and provided a stable banking structure, the
                    maneuvers attendant on its organization were significant politically. At the instigation of Governor
                    Wright, an investigating committee appointed by the state senate in 1857 revealed some of the
                    machinations of 1855, when politicians had engineered the charter through the legislature in such a
                    way as to secure control of he system. Calvin Fletcher accused Judge Thomas L. Smith of <placeName>

                    efforts of the lobby headed by Smith, provision was made to sell the bank stock between 9 and 12

                    showing their hand. They were elements of the still shaky new party, for the Fusionist effort was
                    becoming more than a crusade.</p>
            <p>The adjournment of the legislature brought to an end the political maneuvers in the general assembly,
                    but the organization of the parties continued throughout 1855. The session had revealed that the
                    politicians were not out of the troubled waters of the previous summer. The Democrats were busy
                    reorganizing their efforts for the coming presidential year while the Fusionists needed to maintain
                    the semblance of political organization they already possessed, meanwhile hoping that structure
                    could be given to the amorphous mass.</p>
            <p>During 1855 the state Democracy was not very active, since the elections were local in nature. At a
                    meeting in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> in April, the party reiterated its claims of 1854, with particular emphasis given to
                    anti-Know Nothingism.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fusionists had more difficult problems. After the elections of 1854, the once harmonious elements
                    became suspicious of one another. The Free Soil elements had begun to "feel quite
                    offish" after Milton Gregg was nominated for state printer, while the temperance forces
                    generally lost interest once the new law was in the legislative mill. Under the guidance of Joseph
                    G. Marshall of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> the old Whigs had aspirations of their own for senatorial nominations. Finally, there
                    was the question of what would become of the Know Nothing movement. Among the leaders of 1854 who
                    were in the state capital attempting to weld the Fusion more firmly was Schuyler Colfax, the
                    congressman-elect from <placeName>

                    Know Nothings might not be the chief opposition of the Fusion. The ex-Whigs themselves, after the
                    initial success, felt that instead of remaining in the background they should come to the fore to
                    manage affairs for the Fusion.</p>

            <p>In other states, early in 1855, the hitherto secret Know Nothing order was coming out in the open and
                    was entering the political arena as an out-and-out party. The president of the Indiana state council
                    seemed to feel that this was the course for the Hoosier Know Nothings to follow. He queried:
                    "Will it not be necessary to organize an open Native American party in our
                    State—as they are preparing to do in other States? Or what shall be done in the
                    future—The ‘fusion’ party is necessarily of temporary duration and
                    the Whig Party cannot be galvanized into existance again."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A few months later, however, Colfax gave his opinion as to the future course of the factions that
                    were not yet fully anchored to a solid foundation, when he wrote: "‘My path is
                    to harmonize, if possible, all the elements of opposition to the Adm'n on one ticket, if
                    they will consent to give us a ticket we can conscientiously support.’" Colfax
                    believed that if the antislavery and Know Nothing elements would not be able to work together, so
                    that two tickets became inevitable, it would then be time enough to choose one or the other horn of
                    the dilemma. His own choice was antislavery, "‘with the happy assurance that we
                    go into a minority again, which-ever horn we hang upon. There are strong hopes now, how-ever, that

            <p>In the correspondence of Colfax and Orth, it is possible to observe the differing tactics of these
                    two Fusionist leaders. Orth was more reluctant to sacrifice the Know Nothings to a combination that
                    might be more expedient, since he was a figure of some importance in the movement; he was prone to
                    consider the value of nativism as a political whip at all levels. On occasion he chided Colfax for
                    not keeping "Sam" alive and kicking in local elections. When South Bend Democrats
                    in the spring elections defeated the Fusionists, he reminded Colfax that in <placeName>

                    to one. On another occasion, Orth wrote to his friend: "We must not lose sight of the fact,
                    that while there is a strong Anti-Slavery feeling in the State, there is also a strong American
                    feeling—and both must be preserved &amp; united if possible, else both go by the

            </p>
            <p>In the same tenor, Orth seemed most clearly to define his position in the following statement:
                    "I am in favor of the formation of an open American Party—upon a platform of
                    principles acceptable to our people in Indiana—with a central organ here devoted
                    exclusively to our cause with open State &amp; County conventions—presenting open
                    issues—and the order Kept as now, auxiliary to the Ant. Party—directing its
                    public movements."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewise in the nation the Know Nothings were experiencing political difficulties. Hoosiers watched
                    closely the developments in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. When Henry A. Wise defeated the Know Nothing candidate in the May elections, the
                    Indiana Democrats cheered loudly and held victory meetings in the state. But in order to maintain
                    the spirit of the order, the Know Nothings also held a meeting, on May 30, at the Bates House in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Among the speakers were the Fusionist leaders, Henry S. Lane, Daniel Mace, and David
                    Kilgore. The common cry was that "Sam" in Indiana was not dead in spite of the <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>A week later, June 5, an Indiana delegation attended the national convention of the Know Nothings in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. After several minor clashes over the admission of certain delegations, the explosion
                    came when the platform was presented. The resolutions declared that the order should "abide
                    by and maintain the existing laws upon the subject of slavery, as a final and conclusive settlement

                    convention's attitude indicated rather clearly that its members were involved in Know

                    include all native-born and naturalized citizens except Roman Catholics. One resolution, however,
                    favored an alteration of the constitutional provision which permitted aliens to vote after a
                    residence of six months and a declaration of intention to become a citizen. As to the disturbing
                    sectional question, the Americans favored the restoration of the Missouri Compromise and opposed
                    slavery extension. Finally, the party wanted no alterations of the recent prohibitory liquor law.
                    Thus the Indiana Americans repudiated many of the national features of the American party as a
                    whole. This move, however, was not completed without its attendant dissension, for at least fifteen
                    county delegations seceded and charges that the abolitionists had gained control of the party were
                    hurled in the press. The cleavages were observed happily by the Democrats, who hoped that this was
                    the first step in a complete disintegration of their opposition; yet the seceders could not be
                    classed as a large group, and the portion that chose to remain was the larger of the two.<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>At the mass meeting of the "people" of Indiana on July 13, the enthusiasms of 1854
                    were once again aroused. Many of the same speakers repeated their sentiments before the assemblage.
                    The principal address, however, was delivered by General Henry Wilson of <placeName>

                    the Know Nothing program of the day before, for both supported a limited franchise and agreed on
                    slavery and temperance. The only marked difference was that the Know Nothings proscribed Roman
                    Catholics. The Fusionist stand approached the standards of the preconvention call which had been
                    sounded by Schuyler Colfax: "‘The watchword now is <hi rend="i">ACTION</hi> and
                    our battle cry, not that stereotyped demagogue catchword, "No North," but the

            <p>In the 1855 local elections the Fusionists and Americans usually promoted combined tickets; only in
                    the southern seceding counties did the latter party present a ticket of its own. The sentiment for
                    further erasure of the slight barriers between the groups rose during the year. One newspaper editor
                    proclaimed that he would "rejoice to see the day when Republican, Know Nothing and Know

            <p>While progress had been made in the organization of the opposition to the Democrats during this off
                    year, it cannot be denied that instead of one party, there were now two open political
                    organizations. More important, perhaps, was the fact that the old liners knew where to find the
                    enemy: the "dark lantern" days were passing. The hope of the Democrats lay in
                    encouraging the factors dividing the opposition; at the same time, the latter was laboring to

            <p>Still another Hoosier Whig spoke of his southern brethren: "I admit… the South
                    has somewhat the advantage of the North,—that her Statesmen, as a general thing, have
                    been more able and more distinguished. But slavery has nothing to do with this, unless it be that,
                    in the South, Statesmen have more leisure to prepare themselves for their public duties."
                    As for the new party in the North, the orator continued: "They have no ideas about <hi rend="i">slavery</hi> and <hi rend="i">office</hi>. If they can only exterminate slavery and all
                    the national men of the North, then they'll have <hi rend="i">all the offices</hi>. That is

            <p>These were the observations of men who were opposed to the Democracy in 1855. If the incipient
                    Republican party were to carry the state in 1856, it would be necessary to transmute the
                    incongruities in men's thinking into a common frame of mind which in turn might become a
                    potent political bludgeon to wield against the South.</p>
            <p>In a sense the turn of events in Congress was the prelude to the political season of 1856. The
                    speakership fight of 1855-1856 revealed the organizational difficulties of the opponents of the
                    Democrats. The seemingly endless balloting which completely stopped the legislative mill caused

            <p>Meanwhile, the Americans were dutifully attempting to sublimate the radicalism of the party. The
                    so-called "twelfth section" men who were in accord with the seceders of 1855 were
                    gaining strength in the state. Among the delegates who appeared in the <placeName>

                    brought forth a secession movement, just as it had in 1855. This time, however, the Indiana
                    delegates remained, while almost all those from the other states of the Northwest trooped out of the

            <p>This split further weakened the Americans, and the groundwork was firmly laid for a North and a South

                    would co-operate with the People's party of Indiana or maintain a separate identity. One
                    political fact, however, the politicians could not ignore: the American party was becoming
                    sectionalized within the state. The old Whigs of the lower <placeName>

                    Republican convention aroused brief turmoil when some Americans claimed that the meeting could not
                    elect delegates because it was not wholly a Republican convention. One of the less faithful
                    Americans, however, declared that Americanism could wait but the <placeName>

                    acquiesced.</p>
            <p>The next test of the framework of the embryonic Hoosier Republican party was the organization of the
                    convention and the selection of officers and candidates. The Whigs had made inroads on their
                    competitors in the party since 1854, and in the convention appointments the anti-Nebraska Democrats
                    received a relatively small share of posts; however, as candidates the bolters from the Democracy
                    seemed to have considerably more to offer in the way of availability. The choice for governor was
                    Oliver P. Morton, an anti-Nebraska Democrat from <placeName>

                    influence in northern Indiana, completed the list of former Democrats on the state ticket. The sole

                    Fusion's own making. The platform of 1856 carried the extension issue one step further when
                    it opposed the admission of any more slave states out of territories "secured to freedom by
                    the Missouri Compromise" and then added the phrase, "or otherwise." To
                    accommodate the Americans, a resolution was formulated that favored "naturalization laws of
                    Congress with five years' probation, and that the right of suffrage should accompany and

                    </placeName> and Illinois Republicans offer interesting comparisons with Indiana's. All
                    three states had much in common geographically, socially, and economically so that the differences
                    among them are quite apparent. The resolutions of the <placeName>

                    </placeName> leaders were ready to make definite overtures to those who had previously been
                    discouraged. One resolution declared, "We will proscribe no one by legislation or otherwise
                    on account of religious opinions, or in consequence of place of birth." The Ohio
                    Republicans, however, outdid their neighbors to the west. The general tenor of their platform was
                    much more vindictive and filled with phrases of bitter hatred for the Democracy. It bluntly declared
                    that all territories should be free. As to the problem of support, the Ohio Republicans invited the
                    "cordial support of all citizens, whether of native or foreign birth."<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>These platforms show that the state parties expressed a considerable degree of unanimity of
                    principle, if not of mode of expression. The significant difference was in the treatment of the
                    foreign vote. The Indiana People's party, in order to appeal to the nativists, supported a
                    stringent naturalization measure; its neighbors appealed directly to the foreign voter. Indiana did
                    not have as large a foreign population as did its neighbors; there was no concentrated German

            <p>Reactions to the People's convention varied. The "South" Americans refused
                    to stand by the nomination and a plat-form that was so strongly "Republican" in
                    character. One American editor blamed William Sheets, the president of the state council, for the
                    failure of the party. He bitterly growled: "The officiating head of the American party in
                    Indiana is rotten to the core! He has sold us to our enemies."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Such
                    reports as these, however, were exceptional.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, to such radicals as George W. Julian, the party had not gone far enough in its
                    denunciations. Julian was unable to find a single true antislavery man on the whole ticket. He
                    called the People's party a "combination of weaknesses, instead of a union of
                        forces."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> One of Julian's friends, Daniel Worth,

                    for the benefit of Knownothings and old fossil Whigs who have just emanated from their old political
                    graves where they have been ‘per-severing to rot,’ and are now ready to take
                    office at the hands of antislavery men provided they are not compelled to take more antislavery than

            <p>The People's convention, however, was antislavery enough in sentiment to frighten away the

            <p>The tremendous importance attached to national questions in the progress of the state party brought

                    According to the various writings of George W. Julian, he played an important role. He did serve as
                    chairman of the committee on organization and was one of the vice-presidents. William Grose of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName> was appointed to the executive committee, and Oliver P. Morton was a member of the
                    resolutions committee. Julian explained later that the Fusion had "subordinated every
                    question of principle to its desire for political success. The situation was most
                        humiliating."<hi rend="sup">54</hi> This preliminary meeting, which served primarily to
                    formulate more solid propositions upon which a permanent organization could be established, was an

            <p>Henry S. Lane was elected president of the second convention. In his address the former Whig extolled
                    the virtues of Henry Clay. Had the Kentuckian been alive, he would have been leading the Republican
                    party, declared Lane. The disunion cry, he claimed, came from <placeName>

                    party. He was careful to state that his party would not interfere where slavery already existed, yet
                    since the institution was always aggressive, the Republicans were the only party that would maintain
                    the principles of freedom. These <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Taken as a whole the membership indicated Whig entry into the leadership of the National Republicans
                    of Indiana. The respected and prosperous of the now defunct party were gaining control of the new
                    organization. For the most part it was a conservative leadership, replacing the more radical
                    elements that had rushed into the Fusion in 1854. This Whig group, however, did not include the old
                    Whigs of the river counties but came rather from the northern and central sections of the state, the
                    areas in which significant economic and social change was taking place in the fifties. These
                    Hoosiers, who were taking strides to secure political advantage, were to determine the character of
                    the future Republican party of Indiana.</p>
            <p>With the nomination of John C. Fremont, the Indiana delegation, Republican in fact if not in name,
                    returned home to stump the state in the new party's first national campaign. Back in
                    Indiana, as a result of the problem of the course of the Americans, the important political question
                    was the matter of support. Before the convention met in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, <pb n="210" id="VAA4025-051-3-030"/> John Defrees, chairman of the state central
                    committee, called for a ratification meeting to be held at <placeName>

                    </placeName> on July 15, 1856. The Americans, however, decided to await the results of the
                    People's convention before meeting; consequently they called their gathering for July 16.
                    The decision was of some significance since it seemed to mean that no longer were the Know Nothings,
                    now Americans, attempting to set the pattern for the Fusionists.<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

            <p>By the time of their state convention on July 16 the Americans had been reduced largely to the
                    position of an irreconcilable minority of the old Whig party. The seceders of the conventions of the
                    previous year had brought many of the Indiana Americans into the People's party; those left
                    behind were chiefly from southern Indiana. An important leader of the party in Indiana was Richard
                    W. Thompson, who was made permanent chairman of the state party. In June, Humphrey Marshall of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> had written Thompson: "‘We must have a <hi rend="i">separate</hi>
                    Fillmore ticket in Indiana. You must go to the Convention—and you must head the movement

            <p>The convention itself was not particularly impressive as compared with the People's meeting
                    of the day before. Only about one-fourth of the counties were represented, for the Americans had

                    Buchanan, had divided opposition. After the convention, Thompson labored to organize Fillmore clubs

                    was beginning to operate as a responsible group and which had to resort also to defensive actions in
                    the rough and tumble tactics of the canvass. At the state level and in Congress its leaders had the

            <p>The political capital in firing the emotions of those who were already enlisted in the ranks of the

                    friends hoped the excitement would end. "The <placeName>

                    view that was not exactly high doctrine in Democratic circles. He wrote: "Anything that

            <p>The campaign centered about the sectional issue, and with the cry of "Black
                    Republicanism" ringing in their ears, the excitement of the people grew as the October
                    state election day approached. The Democrats made the most of the American-People's party
                    split as well as of the fact that most Hoosiers hated the Negro. In one Democratic neighborhood, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Dubois County</region>
                    </placeName>, it was reported that several young ladies of the community, dressed all in white,
                    paraded through the streets carrying a banner, "‘Fathers, save us from nigger

                    results, the Democrats stressed the theme that the Black Republicans were plotting abolition and the
                    bestowal of full social and political rights upon the Negro. The brunt of the state campaign was
                    borne by Oliver P. Morton, an anti-Nebraska Democrat. He was rather evenly matched on the stump with
                    Ashbel P. Willard, who was a brilliant speaker.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The results of the local campaign were indicative of the events to come in the November elections.
                    Willard carried the state by almost 5,000 votes. Examination of the results in the congressional
                    districts reveals the sectionalism of the state. Morton carried the <geogName>Whitewater

            <p>Fillmore men were a thorn in the side of the People's party, and the Democrats, as the
                    canvass grew more exciting, did not commit any errors that might help close the gap. The Democratic
                    press became friendly to the Americans; the latter also had trouble within their ranks, for three of
                    their state electors deserted the party. Realizing their hopeless position, the Fillmore national
                    leaders held out the possibility that the election would be thrown into the House of
                    Representatives, where Fillmore then would be the compromise choice; consequently an attempt was
                    made to withdraw the ticket in Indiana. J. R. Thompson of <placeName>

                    comply with the request. When rumors spread that their ticket had been withdrawn, the Americans
                    issued an appeal to the Republicans to support Fillmore because chances of restoration of the
                    Missouri Compromise line would be greater under a Fillmore administration: "a

                  <hi rend="sup">73</hi> For many years a belief existed in Indiana that Dick Thompson was paid
                        to keep the American ticket in the field. Brand, "History of the Know Nothing Party in
                        Indiana," <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi>, XVIII, 282n, mentioned the
                        charges but claimed that no evidence was ever found to support these claims. The fact that Jesse
                        Bright was vigorously supporting Thompson in the claim against the government during the summer
                        of 1856 aided the rumors of a plot; see Julian, <hi rend="i">Political Recollections</hi>,
                        155-156. From a purely circumstantial point of view, the events do raise several questions.
                        Thompson had been employed by the Menominee to recover damages incurred in their removal to the
                        West. The Hoosier lawyer won the case. By a prior agreement Thompson was to receive the
                        customary fee of one-third of the award; his share of the $242,000 compensation was
                        thus more than $80,000. George Manypenny, the Indian commissioner, protested and
                        payment was halted. The resulting private bill in Congress, allowing Thompson one-half the
                        amount due, was pushed aside for a long time. In the summer of 1856, Jesse Bright championed
                        Thompson's claim in the Senate. Bright was on the floor more during the summer of 1856
                        than at any previous time in his career,</item>

            <p>When the November returns were in, the Hoosier Democracy was back in power. Although not a complete
                    rout, it was a comfortable victory. Buchanan received 118,670 votes, while <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> gathered 94,375. The Americans trailed with 22,386.<hi rend="sup">74</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Political behavior is difficult to gauge but several conclusions seem to have a degree of validity.
                    First, even if there had been no American party, the Democrats would have won, since the combined
                    strength of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fremont</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Fillmore would not have been enough to overturn the Buchanan forces in the state.</p>
            <p>Second, the People's party apparently failed to gain the Whig vote completely. George Julian
                    charged that along with the Know Nothing refusal to unite, there was the inability to rally the
                    Whigs. Those who had not floated into the American party seem to have preferred Buchanan to <placeName>

            <p>In addition to real or assumed defections, one of the serious weaknesses of the new party was its

                    resurrected the old tried and not-so-true dogmas of the defunct Whig party. It was on this score
                    that Michael C. Garber, who had been a successful state chairman of the Fusionists in 1854, was
                    bitter. He editorialized: "The gentle-men who engineered the Republican party in Indiana
                    are clever, estimable men, every one of them; but as political leaders they are imbeciles.
                    … They have been outgeneraled in every particular. … Southern Indiana was
                    indubitably the Republican missionary field… [yet it] was given up to the combined enemy
                    without a struggle. … You see what has been done with the present leaders; it could not
                    have been worse done without leaders. If more fortunate men cannot be found in the Republican ranks,

            <p>The radical element of the new Republicans was also dissatisfied. In the prospectus for a new

                    </placeName>, Andrew and Solomon Bidwell deplored the fact that the great mass of the antislavery

                    offense, as to render it entirely impotent against the opposition, and worse than useless as a
                    support to the cause it was designed to sustain.</p>
            <p>"The course which the Republicans have pursued toward the Know Nothing party of Indiana, has
                    also tended greatly to weaken the party of Freedom, by driving from its support thousands of honest

                    fraudulent voting, along with liberal naturalization of the foreign-born. In the state elections in

                    claimed that fully 20,000 illegal votes had been cast against his party. Governor Wright in his
                    message to the legislature in January, 1857, and Ashbel Willard in his inaugural address a short
                    time later warned of the effects of the practices of the last election. Wright appealed for stricter

            <p>These, then, were the contemporary reactions to the results of the election of 1856. The Democracy
                    was still a firmly entrenched political organization, but it was not as all-encompassing in its
                    power as it had once been. The Republicans had committed political blunders, but as a new party they

                    confusing temper of the times in the nation was reaching out to rural Hoosier neighborhoods and
                    villages. The People's party leaders themselves were admittedly in the new party to stay
                    and they were organizing for the future. The initial successes of 1854 had perhaps been a handicap
                    in that the crusading spirit lost some of its drive by 1856. Also in 1854 there had been no
                    responsibilities to a national party program, but in 1856 in some districts, for example, it was
                    difficult to explain <placeName>

            <p>It would seem that a great deal of importance should be attached to the natural reluctance to
                    innovation on the part of many who could not divorce themselves from their political memories. A
                    Methodist clergyman from Great Britain who was a guest in the governor's mansion during the
                    campaign observed: "We have had some insight into American political and public life while
                    here, and facilities for observing party associations and party struggles, such as we could hardly
                    have had, if our entertainer had been a person merely in private life. The governor is a professed
                    Democrat (that is, a moderate reformer); so are most of his friends with whom we have conversed on
                    politics in his house; and nearly all of them have made no secret of their being extreme partisans.
                    They have no forbearance towards others who are forward to proclaim political convictions; and
                    though moderate and temperate men in other matters, in politics they are most resolute and
                    determined. Public men, periodicals, and newspapers maintaining sentiments in common with theirs,
                    are outrageously be-praised, as it seems to us; and their censures appear equally unsparing and
                    overdone. … Unflinching adherence to party is principle with them, and to forsake a party
                    is regarded as an act of the greatest dishonour."<hi rend="sup">83</hi> In such a political
                    climate, the People's party members, who were now calling themselves Republicans more

            <p>Of transcendant importance in the formation of the Republican party in 1854 were the third party
                    movements of the preceding fifteen years, such as the Liberty party of 1840 and the Free Soil party
                    of 1848, which in 1852 called itself the Free Democracy. Predicated on the conviction of a minority
                    that the slavery question was political in nature and that it could be solved by political processes
                    in a democratic community, these movements were a positive factor in the disintegration of the major
                    parties prior to the successful formation of the Republican party. For politicians especially the
                    third parties provided a refuge in which they could agitate against the immoralities of slavery
                    without necessarily giving up their political careers. Indeed, in searching for the motivations that
                    led these men into the third party movements one is almost certain to find a combination of moral
                    convictions and mundane political ambitions.</p>
            <p>Historical perspective reveals at once the potential strength of the political antislavery
                    organizations in the milieu of mid-nineteenth century America, with its prevading idea of progress,
                    its reforming zeal, and its abiding faith in democratic processes; yet it is doubtful in the extreme
                    that men living in the 1840's could foresee clearly what the future held in store for them.
                    For those with their political careers before them, novices as well as experienced politicians, the
                    decision to join the Liberty or the Free Soil party was a calculated risk, and it was seldom made
                    hastily or ill advisedly. Charles Sumner was willing to adopt any organization aiming at the
                    abolition of slavery. Joshua R. Giddings, who was in complete sympathy with the aims of James G.
                    Birney and his Liberty party, fought the antislavery fight from within the Whig party until 1848;
                    after that time, when he was finally convinced that the Whigs were not dedicated to the antislavery
                    cause, he could no longer stomach the compromise attitude of the two major parties. Salmon P. Chase,

            <p>In similar fashion, George Washington Julian of Indiana, entering politics as an ardent Whig in 1840,
                    underwent a political metamorphosis that by 1848 made of him a Free Soiler and a bitter enemy of the
                    Whigs. While it would be erroneous to suggest an absolute parallel between Julian's
                    decision and the decisions of other men, in some respects at least his case seems typical: there was
                    the intense political ambition, the dedication to a cause, the difficulty intrinsic in breaking old
                    bonds—political or other, an acceptance of the idea of progress, and the religious factor
                    that is often intricately related to reform activity.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

            <p>It was men as these who were the original leaders of the Republican party. By 1854 their third
                    parties had ceased to be effective organizations; hence they were ready to take advantage of any
                    situation conducive to a new antislavery political movement. Their opportunity came with the
                    Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which was followed in the various states by the formation of a number
                    of separate anti-<placeName>

                    fusion of many different groups with varied interests, such as protective tariffs, a homestead act,
                    internal improvements, a temperance law, and a transcontinental railroad. But in its chrysalis stage
                    the one point upon which all could agree—an indispensable requirement for the formation
                    of a new party—was the Free Soil doctrine that there should be no further extension of
                    slavery into the territories and that Congress had the constitutional <list type="footnotes">

            <p>George W. Julian was born and reared in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. In 1822 his father had been elected to the state legislature in Corydon as a
                    follower of Henry Clay; other members of his family, brothers, uncles, and cousins, many of whom
                    were leaders in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>

                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and Webster. Jacob Julian, an older brother who made George his junior law partner,
                    remained one of the Whig leaders of the county after George had ended his affiliation. Indeed
                    "Old Wayne," one of the earliest Hoosier counties to be settled, was a National
                    Republican-Whig stronghold, and it remained so even after the Democrats gained control of the state
                    in 1843.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus because of the influence of his early associations it was almost foreordained that Julian would
                    cast his first presidential vote, in 1840, for William Henry Harrison. Later he was to remember the
                    election as a "grand national frolic" virtually devoid of issues, but as a young
                    man of twenty-three he joined in the enthusiasm for the hero of <placeName>

                    stood for the rights of the oppressed and poor against the aloof aristocrat, Martin Van Buren. Once
                    he rode 150 miles through mud and swamps to attend a mass meeting, a journey for which he felt
                    compensated by the spirit of the immense crowd and the abundance of hard cider. Later he went to a

            <p>When young Julian first entered the political world, the Hoosier state was experiencing perplexing
                    problems, the most pressing of which was her debt. By 1840 the state owed the tremendous sum of
                    $12,000,000 because of its efforts to construct an elaborate system of internal
                    improvements during the hard times which followed the Panic of 1837. Because the debt was contracted
                    during a period of Whig political dominance, the situation was slowly weakening that
                    party's hold on the state. Other important issues were river and harbor legislation, public
                    land policy, banking, and the tariff. Indeed, the fact that the Whigs had relied too much on the
                    attractions of personalities like William Henry Harrison and too little on positive programs to deal
                    with these questions helped to defeat them in 1843.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>As a part of the Old Northwest, Indiana was in a region which was rapidly gaining the balance of
                    political power between the Northeast and the South: which way she would throw her weight was a
                    paramount interest up to the Civil War. Commerce with the South and the southern origins of many of
                    her people help to explain a legislative resolution of 1839 which declared that interference with
                    slavery in states where it already existed would be "injurious to the peace and stability
                    of the union."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> But if the resolution represented a majority sentiment
                    against antislavery agitation, a vocal and ardent opposition was already developing. Even before the
                    advent of the Liberty party in 1840, the abolitionist Stephen S. Harding had carried the fight into
                    southern Indiana, the stronghold of the proslavery forces.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Thus, as young Julian entered politics, he was in direct contact with issues on which he would have
                    to formulate ideas and policies, and the environment undoubtedly stimulated the process of
                    development; but not until 1844 was he ready to state his views with precision and conclusiveness.
                    The period from 1840 to 1844 was one of professional and emotional preparation for his real entrance
                    into politics.</p>
            <p>Admitted to the bar in 1840, Julian began to practice in <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Before Julian could hope for a career in law or politics he had to overcome an extreme
                    and painful timidity about speaking in public. His struggles began at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greenfield</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the company of a young man named George Pattison, who had similar difficulties.
                    Together they formed an organization of which they were the only members, the Dark Lyceum. At
                    meetings held in total darkness, where they were not intimidated by probing human eyes, the young
                    men orated to each other on legal matters and current topics. In 1843 Julian accepted the invitation
                    of his older brother Jacob to become a junior law partner. Hence he returned to his native <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he established a second Dark Lyceum, with a larger membership and more ritual
                    than the original organization. Apparently it helped Julian overcome the almost paralyzing fear that
                    gripped him in his early court room efforts. As Julian himself described it, the purpose of the
                    organization was intellectual improvement and the development of the art of public speaking. But the
                    Dark Lyceum served another purpose of which Julian might not <list type="footnotes">

                    belonging as nothing else did. Certainly the practice of law did not provide it for him as it seemed
                    to do for others. Al-though Julian rode the Whitewater circuit occasionally with others, his
                    introspective nature led him away from participation in the frolic in the taverns where the lawyers
                    lodged or in the practical jokes and story-telling around the campfire. The practice of law per se
                    never had great appeal for him; it might provide him with the means of making a living or give him a
                    start in politics, but once he discovered the allure of politics, this, rather than the law, became
                    his chief interest.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By 1844 the Dark Lyceum and practice in the court-rooms of Indiana's sixth circuit had given
                    Julian the courage to take the stump in a presidential campaign. But which party ought he support?
                    On economic issues he was falling away from the Whigs, and had these been the determining factors he
                    might logically have gone over to the Democrats. He was beginning to think of the national bank as
                    an obsolete idea, and he was out of sympathy with the Whigs' use of the public lands as a
                    source for revenue rather than for homesteads for the landless poor. Nor was he any longer attracted
                    by the Whigs' ideas on the tariff, their "pet dogma of ‘the higher the
                    duty the lower the price of the protected article.’"<hi rend="sup">11</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for Julian the question of slavery overshadowed all other issues, and, as he later explained it,
                    this alone bound him to the Whigs. His avid reading of the speeches of John Quincy Adams and Joshua
                    R. Giddings had thoroughly aroused him and had led him to the conclusion that Polk's
                    election would be an "‘irretrievable national calamity.’

                    Democratic candidate. In his autobiography he recalled the strong emotional reaction that he
                    suffered when Polk was elected, how he brooded for a week and found it difficult to sleep. He was

                    the election of Polk.<hi rend="sup">13</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Julian's categorical rejection of the Liberty party in the election of 1844 and his bitter
                    denunciation of those who sup-ported it strongly suggest that personal political ambition was one of
                    the forces tying him to the Whigs, and equally as significant are the clues to his character present
                    in his own explanation of his decision that appeared in his unpublished autobiography and in his <hi rend="i">Political Recollections</hi>, written some three decades later.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very existence of the Liberty party was predicated on the antislavery movement that Julian had
                    come to regard as paramount, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName> was the center of the Liberty party's activity in Indiana. Yet Julian, even
                    though within four years he was to ally himself with a similar third party movement, seems to have
                    eliminated from his thinking even the possibility that in 1844 the Liberty party offered a feasible
                    alternative for an antislavery man. As he described it, his vote for the Whigs was based purely on
                    his opposition to slavery, with no hint of political expediency; yet Julian was becoming politically
                    ambitious and the Whig party offered the best chance of success, perhaps the only chance, in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. The presence of men like Joshua Giddings and John Quincy Adams among the northern
                    Whigs makes Julian's choice of that party logical enough, but his effort to convince
                    everybody, including himself, that he acted only on principle is significant because its reveals so
                    much of his personality. The idea that principle could be combined with self-interest never seemed
                    to occur to him, or else he successfully blocked it out of his mind. Throughout his life he seemed
                    compelled to find vindication through a cause outside of himself for his every act. This trait, in
                    combination with his intense ambition, put him under a strain from which he never really felt relief
                    and that he apparently did not fully understand.</p>
            <p>Whatever the basis of Julian's decision in 1844, his participation in the campaign
                    apparently bolstered his confidence and gave him something of a local reputation as a stump speaker.

            <p>Julian's nomination on the Whig ticket came rather easily, but to win the election he had to
                    overcome an insurgent movement from within his own party. The cause of this opposition is not clear,
                    but Julian was able to overcome it and to go into office along with the other Whigs of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>. In electing their entire slate in 1845 the Whigs of "Old Wayne" were
                    still bucking the political trend in Indiana, for in that year the Democratic domination begun in
                    1843 continued; the state senate was divided equally, but the Democrats maintained undisputed
                    control of the house and elected all but two congressmen.<hi rend="sup">16</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon entering the legislature Julian began to display those reforming proclivities for which he would
                    become so well known before the end of his political career. Immediately he became the leader of a
                    successful movement to modify the criminal code dealing with capital punishment. He also became
                    interested in removing divorce from the control of the legislature and placing it under the courts,
                    a change that finally came with the new state constitution in 1851.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> But by far
                    the most important legislation of the session, and that which most profoundly affected
                    Julian's future, was the Butler Bill, adopted to deal with internal improvements and the
                    state debt.</p>
            <p>The history of the internal improvements and debt question dated from 1828, when the federal
                    government granted land to be used toward the construction of a canal to connect the
                        <geogName>Wabash River</geogName> with <geogName>Lake Erie</geogName>. But regional jealousy was
                    so great that four years elapsed before the necessary legislation passed the general assembly. The
                        <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName>, which sought appropriations for projects of its own, was
                    especially adamant in its opposition; it was David Hoover, Julian's uncle, who led the
                    delaying faction in the legislature. Disagreements were finally resolved in 1836, and a grand scheme
                    providing for a state-wide system of roads, canals, and railroads was finally adopted. It provided
                    for the extension of the Wabash and Erie Canal, which had been begun four years earlier,

            </p>
            <p>So great was the optimism about the future of these internal improvements that no adequate plan was
                    drawn up for payment of the resulting debt. Jubilant political leaders and internal improvements
                    proponents were convinced that tolls would soon take care of construction and maintenance; hence no
                    tax funds were set aside even for payment of interest charges. After 1836, depression,
                    mismanagement, and floods combined to disrupt the system, so that in 1839, amidst a general
                    financial and engineering breakdown, all work stopped. Corruption too took its toll; from the bond
                    issues, which amounted to approximately $15,000,000, the state had received only
                    $8,600,000 in cash, while state officials and agents made off with an estimated
                        $2,000,000.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In some quarters a desperate fear developed that repudiation might be the final result, and this
                    apprehension brought protests that it ought never be allowed in Indiana. The general assembly
                    reflected these views when in January, 1845, it adopted a resolution that repudiation of the debt
                    would be a blot on the honor of the state.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It was easy to denounce repudiation
                    as a crime; it was quite another matter to take positive action to prevent it, and as the election
                    of 1845 approached nothing had been done.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 1845 Charles Butler appeared in Indiana as the agent of the bondholders to find a
                    way to salvage at least part of their investment in the internal improvements system. After speaking
                    in various localities, he finally met with a joint committee of the general assembly, from which
                    emerged the first Butler Bill, passed in January, 1846. Under its provisions, the state was to pay
                    half the interest on the debt, while the bondholders were to rely on the profits of the Wabash and
                    Erie Canal for the other half. The bondholders were to complete the canal to the <placeName>

                    supporting it. Julian's argument was, essentially, that the debt could not be paid off in
                    full by the state because the people were already being taxed to the limit of their ability to pay.
                    In addition to a scourge of sickness and crop failure, they were burdened with a heavy delinquent
                    tax list under a rate of only 20 cents per hundred dollars' valuation. His painstaking
                    efforts to explain his position were useless, and the heated controversy between Julian and Holloway
                    in the columns of the <hi rend="i">Palladium</hi> was the beginning of an enmity between the two men

            <p>In alienating Holloway and men like him Julian was doing inestimable harm to any chance for immediate
                    political advancement in his home district, for he was making enemies of the outstanding political

                    good graces of men who might have been expected to assure him a political future. Although political
                    expediency seems to have been a factor in 1844 and in some of his later political decisions, he
                    stood firm on the Butler Bill because he thought that he was right. In 1847 Julian sought the Whig

                        1845 or 1846, the future alignment between antislavery men and Democrats that made possible his
                        election to Congress in 1849 in spite of Whig opposition; there seems to be no positive evidence
                        to suggest that he did.</item>

            <p>Thus ended a phase of Julian's life that had begun in 1844. Since then he had tasted both
                    victory and defeat in politics, and he had tested himself in an area bigger than the local courtroom
                    or lyceum. His name was no longer unknown in Indiana, and his political metamorphosis, of which his
                    defection from the Whigs on the internal improvements issue was an important part, was well under
                    way. The antislavery crusade would complete it.</p>
            <p>In the complex of motivations that may have led Julian into the abolitionist crusade the most
                    obvious, and probably the most important, was his struggle with personal religious problems that had
                    plagued him for years. Since his adolescence Julian had found that he was not altogether satisfied
                    with the faith of his family. Several years before reaching manhood he had struck up a friendship
                    with an old Universalist preacher, Jonathan Kidwell, who had journeyed from time to time through the
                    vicinity of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Centerville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Kidwell and his ideas were anathema to most of the members of the community, but
                    Julian found him fascinating; his invective against orthodoxy seems to have spurred young Julian to
                    investigation and reading on religious matters.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Even while entering into
                    politics he was still searching for spiritual satisfaction. Too much of the orthodox Quakerism
                    taught by his mother seemed to him to be folklore, fantasy for bolstering up those not capable of
                    thinking for themselves. Yet this faith had been the source of much of the strength of his mother,
                    who had cared for her family and managed through years of trouble following the death of the father.
                    Understandably, Julian found it difficult lightly to lay aside the religion of this beloved parent.</p>
            <p>It was while he was still trying to work out these personal difficulties that Julian discovered the
                    writings of William Ellery Channing. Here he finally found many of the answers for which he was
                    searching; here was a reasonable faith and a logical argument to support it. Before long Julian had
                    consumed the six volumes of Channing. The effect was magnificent. "I felt," he
                    wrote, "like one coming out of a fearful darkness into the full light of day."
                    Here, indeed, was support for Julian's own conclusions about religion from a great <list type="footnotes">

                    depravity, and vicarious atonement Channing treated as corruptions of the pure Gospel. From the
                    religious works of the great Unitarian Julian turned to the antislavery tracts, and they became his
                    "constant companions… [and] ceaseless trumpet-call to battle against oppression.
                        "<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Channing did more than merely undermine the old superstitions
                    that Julian was growing to distrust; he provided something better, some-thing positive, in their
                    place. The belief, closely related to the idea of progress, that man was a rational being with some
                    measure of control over the society in which he lived must have appealed very strongly to Julian.
                    From it followed logically Channing's reflections about good works.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In seeking a way out of his religious perplexities Julian also turned for advice to Lucretia Mott,
                    who remained a warm friend, and he began reading the works of Harriet Martineau. He found that he
                    could not, with Miss Martineau, reject religion altogether or follow her into "positivism
                    and the denial of a future life," but she, along with Channing, gave him more
                    "tranquility of mind." As he became more deeply involved in the antislavery cause
                    and gave his "whole heart to its service, … doctrinal doubts and anxieties
                    … seemed unworthy of one who loved his neighbor and believed in the brotherhood of
                        man."<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An additional factor, and one that cannot be omitted from an examination of his adoption of the
                    antislavery crusade, was the very milieu in which he lived, for as a resident of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and of the <geogName>Whitewater Valley</geogName> he had been in the midst of
                    antislavery activities for many years. The Quakers of that area were, of course, leaders in the
                    antislavery movement; in 1836 they had organized the State Anti-Slavery Society of Indiana, an
                    organization whose membership was virtually confined to the Valley. Into this region Levi Coffin had
                    come to carry on his antislavery activities, and by 1836 his house in <placeName>

                    slavery he was upholding what had become practically a tradition of the Quaker church. Conceivably,
                    therefore, his breaking away from religious ties was less irrevocable, less final, than it otherwise
                    would have been.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly Julian's disagreements with fellow Whigs over internal improvements and state
                    debts, as well as his adoption of the antislavery crusade, weakened his affection for the Whig
                    party; yet even after the nomination of Zachary Taylor Julian hoped for a resurgence of northern
                    Whiggism that would repudiate Taylor and establish itself as the anti-slavery party. This failing,
                    he saw no choice for antislavery Whigs except to repudiate the party. In a letter to the <hi rend="i">National Era</hi>, under the pseudonym "A Northern Whig," he rebuked
                    northern party men who would vote for Taylor and branded the candidate himself as "merely a
                    military chieftain … exclusively in the hands of the South, and the undoubted exponent of
                    Southern… policy and interest." Taylor had waged an unconstitutional war, Julian
                    raged, in which he had "waded up to his eyes in the blood of a people with whom we were at
                    peace. In plain Saxon truth, he stands before the country as the chief of our national cut-throats;
                    and while his hands are yet reeking with the blood of his victims, and the gore is still dripping
                    from his garments, he asks the American people, <hi rend="i">in return for his sweet services in the
                        merciless work of death, to elect him President of the <placeName>

            <p>On this bitter and hyperbolic note Julian quit the party of his youth and made his way, along with
                    Joshua R. Giddings of <placeName>

                    element of compromise at the convention, for it was unhampered by a southern wing. Any doubt as to
                    Martin Van Buren's adherence to northern principles, he felt, was more than compensated for

                    convinced that Van Buren, who had been driven to political retirement by southerners, would never
                    again align himself with the slave power. These were the arguments that Julian used as he stumped

            </p>
            <p>But for Julian the great significance of the campaign was his conception of it and his interpretation
                    of his individual role in it; for he saw himself engaged in the greatest crusade of his life, and he
                    never abandoned this interpretation of the experience. Decades later he described it with the same
                    fervor that he had felt in 1848. Whig leaders had tried to force him back into the party, he said,
                    but "I was obliged to offer them open defiance. … I was subjected to a torrent
                    of billingsgate which rivalled the fish market. … The charge of
                    ‘abolition-ism’ was flung at me everywhere. … I was an
                    ‘amalgamationist’ and a ‘woolly-head.’ I was branded as
                    the ‘apostle of disunion’ and the ‘orator of free-dirt.’
                    It was a standing charge of the Whigs that I carried in my pocket a lock of the hair of Frederick
                    Douglass, to regale my senses with its aroma when I grew faint."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>In the midst of the campaign Julian's brother Jacob requested that their law partnership be
                    dissolved, so that Julian found himself not only an outcast from his old political party but
                    "thrown entirely upon [his] own resources" professionally. "Men who <hi rend="i">know</hi> that I am honest in my convictions and that I could have no sinister
                    motives," he lamented, would prostrate him. "And now even a brother, chiming in
                    with the popular clamor, sees proper to join the general cry of ‘mad
                        dog.’"<hi rend="sup">32</hi> But the cause for which he worked, Julian
                    believed, was a source of strength that made the contest less uneven than it otherwise would have
                    been. Or, as he stated it: "I was so perfectly swallowed up in my work and dominated by the
                    singleness of my purpose, that I took no thought of anything else. … With the truth on my
                    side, I was delighted to find myself perfectly able, single-handed, to fight my battle <list type="footnotes">

            </p>
            <p>One might logically ask why, if Julian's crusading impulse was so overpowering, he did not
                    join an abolition society where he would have been in the company of other crusaders. One reason why
                    he did not must certainly have been the influence of Channing, who vehemently opposed the agitation
                    and the defiance of law fomented by Garrisonians. Channing firmly believed that slavery could be
                    abolished legally if it were kept constantly open for discussion as a great national issue. Too
                    often, he discovered, the emphasis had been placed on abolitionist agitation rather than on the
                    issue of slavery itself.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Julian certainly took many of these views, or
                    modifications of them, as his own. He was probably thinking of the abolitionists when he wrote to a
                    local paper in 1846 criticizing the tendency toward too much organization in place of individual
                    action. "Solitary thought and independent <hi rend="i">individual</hi> action, have done
                    more for the world than all other agencies combined." Indeed, too much association, he
                    believed, was in opposition to the very tenets of Christianity "whose great Author came
                    into the world to teach the natural equality of man … and the indispensable necessity of
                    individual rectitude."<hi rend="sup">35</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This rejection of co-operative and organized effort represents Julian's acceptance of the
                    individualist credo so persistent in the development of an American democratic faith. From it
                    logically follows his championing of the homestead law, not merely as land policy but in accordance
                    with the law of progress and as a corrective for social ills. Consistent with it, also, was his
                    adoption of Unitarianism. Moreover, Julian could never have accepted the Garrisonian view of the
                    Constitution as a proslavery instrument; rather, in accordance with Free Soil doctrine, the
                    Constitution was an antislavery instrument that had merely been distorted by the slave power
                    successors of the founding fathers. While not eschewing agitation, Julian would have used that
                    agitation to encourage political activity that would lead to the readoption of the rightful
                    interpretation of the Constitution. Such views were, of course, well suited to the purposes of a
                    politically ambitious <list type="footnotes">

                    impulse. Hence the existence of the Free Soil party was fortunate for him personally, for here was
                    no mere experiment of a group of cranks; here was, possibly, a force that might bring untold
                    recognition to those who abetted it.</p>
            <p>In 1849 Julian was nominated by the Free Soilers as candidate for Congress from his district and,
                    with the aid of Democrats, won a hard-fought victory. In Congress he took his place with Giddings,
                    John P. Hale, and other Free Soilers as an antislavery advocate and an opponent of the Compromise of
                    1850. Although defeated in his bid for re-election in 1851, Julian became the vice-presidential
                    candidate of the Free Soil party in 1852, on the ticket with John P. Hale. Out of office during the
                    remainder of the fifties, he was one of the formulators of the Republican or People's
                    movement in Indiana; before the end of the decade he was undisputed leader of the radical faction of
                    the party in opposition to Oliver P. Morton's conservative wing. Re-elected to Congress in
                    1860, Julian took his place in the ranks of the Radical Republicans and served as a member of Ben
                    Wade's Committee on the Conduct of the War.<hi rend="sup">36</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Julian's conversion to Free Soilism in 1848 and his activities in the movement during the
                    next four years remained, in his own mind, the most significant experience of his life. Here, he
                    believed, he had fought the hardest in what he saw as a continuing battle for human rights; here he
                    made his greatest sacrifices; to the rigors of these years he attributed the illnesses that burdened
                    him throughout the remaining years of his life. Julian's decision of 1848 and his role in
                    the Free Soil movement did indeed bring an end to a period of doubt and uncertainty, and it helped
                    him to establish a set of guides and standards that were to serve him well for the next quarter
                    century.</p>
            <p>With the recrudescence of the political antislavery movement after the adoption of the
                    Kansas-Nebraska Act, it was logical enough that Julian, and men like him, should be among the
                    leaders in the formation of the Republican party. They had behind them valuable experience in the
                    application of politics to the slavery question; they were not afraid of new political
                    organizations. From them came much of the vital leadership in the formation and early stages of the
                    Republican party.</p>

            <p>The forces commanded by Governor William Henry Harrison at the battle of <placeName>

                    relative merits of the militia and the regulars was waged in the columns of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, edited by Elihu Stout. The dispute culminated in an attempt by
                    Colonel John P. Boyd, second in command at <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> and commander of the principal regular force, the Fourth United States Infantry
                    Regiment, to do personal injury to the editor. Boyd had been offended by editorial remarks directed
                    at him by Stout.</p>
            <p>Actually the whole quarrel was only a segment of a much older political struggle in Indiana Territory
                    between Harrison's supporters and opponents. The controversy first attracted public
                    attention in the second session of the third general assembly in November and December, 1811. Here
                    Harrison's opponents seemed determined to praise the conduct of units commanded by Boyd and
                    Colonels Luke Decker and Joseph Bartholomew in an effort to embarrass the commander-in-chief.
                    Harrison felt impelled to reply to a house resolution which he felt had slighted the role of the
                    volunteers; his message was a forceful defense of the militia. In this dispute, as on most other
                    questions of his administration, Harrison had the backing of Stout and the <hi rend="i">Western

                        flowed from the same source, to wound the feelings and injure the character of Governor

                        acknowledged as such by the whole army.</item>
               <item>3. That our indignation is justly excited at the false and contemptuous manner in which the
                            <hi rend="i">Militia</hi> who served under Governor Harrison are treated, in the said
                        address; being there represented as an <hi rend="i">untutored, undisciplined</hi> band,
                        possessing, indeed courage, but none of the other requisites of soldiers; and owing eternal
                        gratitude to Col. Boyd and his Regiment, for the preservation of their lives.</item>
               <item>4. That the <hi rend="i">Militia</hi> which served under Governor Harrison were neither <hi rend="i">untutored</hi> nor <hi rend="i">undisciplined</hi>, but in common with the Regular
                        troops, they shared the attention of the Commander in chief, and that by his <hi rend="i">personal exertions</hi>, both the Militia and Regulars were brought to a state of
                        perfection in that kind of manoevering calculated for Indian warfare, and that they were enabled
                        to perform all the directions of the Commander in Chief with promptness, facility, and

                        by the troops during the action of the 7th ult. and by which the victory was secured, were made
                        by the direction of the Commander in chief, and generally executed under his immediate

                        given, and to pass resolutions and ad-dresses in the name of a neighborhood.-And we do further

               <item>8. That we have the most perfect confidence in the Commander in Chief, and shall always feel a

               <item>9. That we would prefer serving under him to any persons that could be designated by the

                            For reasons best known to himself, he did not print it until January 4, 1812; however, he
                            did announce the meeting of the militia officers called for December 7 in the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi>, November 30, 1811. At this time Parke was judge of the general court

                    <pb n="242" id="VAA4025-051-3-062"/> we think it highly proper that the Officers under his command
                    should present him a complimentary address for his great attention to the Regiment, and the skill he
                    discovered in bringing them to the high state of discipline which they possess, together with the
                        <hi rend="i">unity</hi> and <hi rend="i">harmony</hi> he has preferred in his
                    Regiment—but should they refuse, we think it would well comport with military etiquette
                    that a similar address should be presented by the Sergeants of the Regiment. The thing might be done
                    in this way—Let the Colonel prepare a Farewell order, without date or signature, together
                    with an answer to suit his own palate; give them a supper in some public house, and entrust the <hi rend="i">Sergeant-major</hi> with the execution of the plan—after supper when they
                    have become warm, and their spirits elevated with the Colonels hospitality, the Farewell order can
                    be produced and read in which they will be highly praised—after which the answer may be
                    produced for their signatures; we cannot suppose but the thing would take, but should it fail, and
                    some prove refractory, they can prepare another, better to suit their own ideas from the one
                    previously read.</p>
            <p>We cannot withold from the Colonel our sense of his <hi rend="i">merit</hi> and the great <hi rend="i">loss</hi> our country will sustain by being deprived of <hi rend="i">his</hi>
                    services.—Should there be a second expedition against the Indians, the Man, who by his
                        <hi rend="i">personal</hi> skill and bravery decided the action of the 7th November, and took
                    with his own hands the <hi rend="i">war club</hi> of their great warrior, the <hi rend="i">magic

            <p>In the attack made by the Great Chief on Sunday last upon the <hi rend="i">poor Printer</hi>, he

                    has the least idea of military affairs will believe that with an army of disciplined troops
                    consisting of <hi rend="i">two</hi> to <hi rend="i">one</hi>, opposed to raw and undisciplined
                    militia, can be <hi rend="i">defeated</hi> unless from cowardice, or a lack of generalship in the
                    commander.—Yet Col. BOYD, with all the advantages on his side suffered himself to be <hi rend="i">defeated.—Shame</hi>, shame on the Colonel—Yes, I hear my country
                    cry out <hi rend="i">shame</hi>!!—The causes which led to hostilities of the parties, and
                    a correct statement of the <hi rend="i">battle</hi> is as follows.</p>
            <p>On <hi rend="i">Sunday</hi> the 19th about 1 o'clock, the Colonel drew up his forces after
                    the old Roman manner, or perhaps in the <hi rend="i">Maratta</hi> mode of warfare, as we are told he
                    pretends to have commanded a brigade in that service for a number of years.—There was no
                    fire arms used in the contest, the parties fought <hi rend="i">hand</hi> to <hi rend="i">hand</hi>,
                    but unfortunately the Colonel had lost or mislaid his shield, and the hair having deserted his
                    crown, his head suffered considerably in the contest.—The Colonel is accused of a great
                    want of military skill in conducting the expedition, or a most egregerous want of <hi rend="i">courage</hi>, otherwise he <hi rend="i">must</hi> have came off victorious, his force being two
                    to one to that of the Printer. The Printer acknowledges himself to be extremely ignorant of military
                    tactics, especially of <hi rend="i">this</hi> mode of warfare, both as to theory and
                    practice—but no man can suppose that JOHN P. BOYD, who was honored with the command of
                    the 4th United States Regiment, because of his <hi rend="i">long</hi> experience in military
                    affairs, after having spent the greater part of his <hi rend="i">most invaluable life</hi> in the
                        <hi rend="i">tented field</hi>, could be charged with deficiency on that score.—The
                    Colonel, it seems had taken umbrage at a publication which appeared in last Saturdays paper, and
                    commissioned <hi rend="i">Eastman</hi> and <hi rend="i">Bacon</hi> as plenipotentiaries to demand of
                    the Printer the <hi rend="i">author</hi> of the publication; this however, the Printer refused to
                    gratify <hi rend="i">them</hi> in, as they were neither named nor alluded to in the
                    piece—they returned to the Colonel with this decisive answer, who in about fifteen
                    minutes afterwards, accompanied by <hi rend="i">Bacon</hi> and his Orderly, knocked at the door of
                    the Printer, who opened it and politely invited them in, not in the least suspecting but that the
                    sanctuary of his house would shield him from brutal violence) and desired them to be seated, the
                    latter they declined.—The Colonel "brim full of wrath and cabbage," in
                    an authoritative tone, demanded the author of <pb n="244" id="VAA4025-051-3-064"/> the
                    piece—the Printer with mildness and a smile natural to him, answered, "you may
                    consider <hi rend="i">me</hi> as the author."—Now began the dreadful
                    conflict!—The Colonel having a stick in his hand, made the first pass at the Printer who
                    was sitting on the table.—Bets running high, five to one in favor of the Colonel.</p>
            <p>The Printer instantly colored the Colonel, took his stick from him, made a pass, and hit the Colonel
                    with his own stick—bets even, some offering odds in favor of the Printer.</p>
            <p>

                    seized the Printer round the body and arms—but Mars had decreed that Lieut. Robert Buntin
                    (of the militia) should be present, who seeing two well trained Regulars opposed to one poor, raw,
                    undisciplined militia man, hauled off Bacon—the Colonel finding himself deprived of the
                    further use of his body de reserve instantly commenced his retreat.—No bets, to be
                    had-ten to one in favor of the Printer.</p>
            <p>Here the Colonel certainly shewed his want of military skill in conducting a <hi rend="i">retreat</hi>, which was made in the utmost confusion and disorder, either from the bad arrangement
                    of his force or some other cause, <hi rend="i">cowardice</hi> more likely.—It was in vain
                    the Colonel attempted by signs, gestures, wild, and frightful looks, to rally his <hi rend="i">corps

                    mind enough left in their great agitation to tell the Printer <hi rend="i">"they would see
                        him again,"</hi> merely we suppose, as a compliment for their abrupt departure. As it
                    is somewhere recorded, that <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Boyd, and witnessed the ardent solicitude evinced by him for our respective
                                    interests and honor, as blended with the honor and reputation of the 4th U. States
                                    regiment of infantry—we should justly be considered as destitute of every
                                    military principle both of propriety and duty, as well as manly feeling, were we to
                                    omit this public avowal of the detestation with which we view the various
                                    publications that have been made in the news-paper of this place called the Western
                                    Sun, evidently intended to cause dissentions in the corps. The abusive and vulgar
                                    piece contained in the paper of Saturday last, together with others we have before
                                    observed, having the same object have excited our indignation, and we declare that
                                    we view them as scurrilous attempts to degrade and lessen the consequence of our
                                    commanding officer, and to deprive him of the respect due his character.</p>

                    disagreeable sensations in the breast of any of its members, (col. Boyd only excepted) or produce
                    dissentions in the corps—but as they, or a part of them, have thought it necessary to
                    declare that to have been their ideas as to the views of the pieces, I have no hesitation in saying
                    that I respect at least a great part of the regiment as gentlemen and as soldiers, that nothing
                    could be farther from my wish than to produce party dissentions, or destroy that harmony and good
                    understanding which is so necessary in military bodies; that they were aimed at col. Boyd alone,

                                    Prescott and myself on the subject, as well as the answers of several of the
                                    officers of the 4th U. S. regiment, to queries proposed by me similar to those
                                    addressed to Capt Prescott on the 9th inst.—By these it will appear how
                                    far the Militia, who were in the action of <placeName>
                                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                                    </placeName>, have merited those severe animadversions upon their conduct in which
                                    the Colonel and the Captain have thought proper to indulge
                                    themselves.—There were in the action, exclusively of the Dragoons, ten
                                    companies of militia, or volunteers, for each company partook of both these
                                    characters. It will be seen that Capt. <list type="footnotes">
                              <item>regular troops in spite of the "dastardly" conduct of
                                            some of the militia units. Boyd justified his special report to the War
                                            Department because of "various paragraphs contained in newspapers
                                            published here [<placeName>
                                                <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                                            </placeName>] and in the neighboring towns." His wish was merely to
                                            "correct the many errors contained in these publications."
                                            This justification seems weak when it is noted that the <hi rend="i">Western
                                                Sun</hi> was the only newspaper in <placeName>

                                            </placeName>, and that by December 11 it had not yet printed the address of
                                            the militia officers, the address of Van der Burgh, Johnson, <hi rend="i">et

                                            on the matter. Of course, Boyd probably knew of the addresses mentioned but

                                    <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-051-3-068"/> Prescott and all the other officers who have
                                    answered my queries, admit that of these, Biggers and Robbs companies alone
                                    abandoned their posts.—Lieut. Peters indeed says that a small company or
                                    detachment under the command of Capt. Beck, also gave way, but this detachment which
                                    was attached to Geigers company consisted on nine men only. It will be observed too
                                    that all these gentlemen admit that the other companies behaved with distinguished
                                    bravery, and that Robbs company, after it had fallen back from its first position
                                    was rallied and taken to a post of greater danger, where it not only retrieved its
                                    reputation, but established a character for bravery equal to that of any other
                                    company in the army.-As Capt. Prescott has acknowledged that the observations
                                    contained in his and the Colonels letter with regard to whole companies abandoning
                                    their posts, had reference to Biggers and Robbs only, the conduct of the former
                                    alone in this respect remains to be examined. It will be seen by the letter of Capt.
                                    Adams, who acted as Adjutant to the army, that this company was so unfavorably
                                    placed as to be subjected to an attack in front flank and rear by the enemy. As my
                                    design by this address is not to criminate anyone, but merely to defend the militia
                                    from what I consider an unjust attack; I shall not stop to enquire into the reason
                                    of their being so placed, or by whose mistake it was done. It is enough for the
                                    exoneration of the company to state and prove the fact. And let me ask, what company
                                    of <hi rend="i">regulars</hi> or <hi rend="i">irregulars</hi> could have stood in
                                    that situation. I blame them only for not rallying behind some of the other
                                    companies as Robbs did, but for this also they have an excuse, Their captain
                                    commanded the main guard and was of course not with them, and from the direction
                                    that the attack was made upon the left flank, it is probable that they were obliged
                                    to retreat some distance down the front line before they could get within the
                                    encampment. Under such circumstances and in such darkness, it is not surprising that
                                    they were much broken and scattered-I have been told and believe, that most of the
                                    men joined other companies, and that as soon as the day broke the greater part of
                                    them embodied. The conduct of these two companies then, one of which was entirely
                                    without the lines and formed no part of them, is the sole pretext for the assertion
                                    "that the dastardly conduct of some whole militia companies led to exposure
                                    and consequent loss of the life of some of the militia <pb n="249" id="VAA4025-051-3-069"/> officers, whose men deserting the lines were seen
                                    behind trees and waggons where many were actually killed." That some of the
                                    militia took refuge behind trees and waggons I have not the least doubt, I found
                                    some myself in that situation, but I do believe that the number was comparatively
                                    trifling. The statement of capt. Adams very properly accounts for the number being
                                    supposed greater than it really was. But in my enquiries to ascertain whether any
                                    were killed in that situation, I have not met with a single individual (capt.
                                    Prescott excepted) who ever heard of the fact. That "some of the militia
                                    officers lost their lives by their men deserting the lines," is a most
                                    extraordinary assertion, as the returns will shew that those companies which are
                                    accused of behaving badly had no officer killed or wounded, the loss of officers
                                    being entirely confined to the companies which were admitted "to have
                                    displayed the most distinguished bravery." —Why was this mistake
                                    made more than a month after the action? Capt. Prescott says that he was
                                    unacquainted with the names of the Captains—But was Col. Boyd ignorant of
                                    the companies which composed his brigade? The battle of Tippicanoe has attracted
                                    much of the public attention, the people however must be fatigued with the numerous
                                    newspaper discussions to which it has given rise. I regret the necessity I am under
                                    of adding to them; but it was impossible that I could disregard the various and
                                    urgent considerations which called upon me to make this statement. The vindication
                                    of the fame of those patriots and heroes who fought and suffered by my side would be
                                    a sufficient motive; but it appears to me that the American character is deeply
                                    concerned in the affair, and my fellow citizens will not be uninterested in a
                                    discussion which established the fact that our countrymen have not degenerated, that
                                    they still possess the undaunted valor of their ancestors. I could more easily have
                                    forgiven any reflection, however unjust, upon the living—but I never can
                                    forgive those cruel and unmerited reflections upon the memories of those gallant
                                    mortals who fell so gloriously and so disinterestedly, whose bodies are now exposed
                                    to be mangled by beasts of prey, &amp; their bones whitened by the dews and
                                    winds of heaven. … Unhappy men! you have been deprived of your graves by
                                    the savages, but your <hi rend="i">Commanding Officer</hi> still more cruel, would
                                    strip you of your good name, &amp; consign your memories to reproach. Your

                                    consolation that remains to them. Their griefs were lightened by the reflection that
                                    you died in the discharge of your duty &amp; in the bed of honor, they are now
                                    called upon to believe that you died "as a fool dieth," fugitives
                                    from your posts, and under the influence of the most cowardly fears. But while I

                                    ashes or tarnish the glory you have acquired.</p>

                    interest in genealogy will likewise grow.</p>
            <p>Genealogy and history are common interests for numerous individuals, but history of course
                    encompasses far more than that embraced within genealogy. The editor does not consider himself
                    adequately qualified to edit the usual genealogical materials, but he hopes to publish such items
                    from time to time as has been done heretofore. He has had and is carrying on correspondence and
                    discussions about possible arrangements concerning the pages in the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> which
                    concern genealogy. If all goes well, either the forthcoming December or March issue will indicate
                    the results of these efforts which it is believed will be in keeping with the traditions of the <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> and also of considerable aid to those who have a particular interest in

                    is reason for satisfaction in this achievement, but the total should be pushed above the 2,500 mark
                    during the next few months. Then during the ensuing year the membership committee might perhaps

            <p>Such growth in quantity should enable the Indiana Historical Society to increase its effectiveness

            <p>Hoosiers are rich in self-knowledge. Few other states, perhaps none, can boast of so many studies of
                    their historical and cultural aspects. The publishing program of the State Historical Bureau, the
                    Indiana Historical Society, the university presses, and even trade publishers has encouraged the
                    preparation and issuance of a bio-bibliography of Indiana authors, bibliographies of eminent
                    writers, biographies of prominent Hoosiers, interpretations of the state's culture, a state
                    history and state guide book, an account of the capital city, the prehistoric era of Indiana, the
                    Indians and the pioneers, special groups and localities—until it is a real problem to
                    determine what has been neglected and deserves study today. Now the state is blessed with the
                    findings of Wilbur D. Peat about early Indiana artists.</p>
            <p>Peat began his investigations years ago, and his unrelenting pursuit of information has almost always
                    been re-warded. Much of his digging has been original research, by car, on foot, personal
                    interviews, and correspondence. His dedication to his task has rescued many pioneer artists from
                    undeserved obscurity. As a result he is able to reconstruct the rather astonishing parade of artists
                    who penetrated and some-times settled in Indiana, and by implication the widespread interest in art
                    in a pioneering period. Hoosiers, who have never apologized for their culture, may even preen
                    them-selves on the reception and encouragement they gave to artists and the schools or colonies of
                    painting that developed.</p>
            <p>After long consideration on how to organize his diversified material, the author adopted a fresh and
                    logical arrangement. Rather than catalogue the artists in encyclopedic fashion, or relate a strictly
                    chronological story jumping about the state, he begins with an account of the earliest tourist
                    painters who happened to pass through Indiana. Then he takes up certain districts, in rough
                    chronological sequence, and discusses the artists who settled or developed there. He begins with the <placeName>

                    1885, with biographical summaries, forms a useful appendix. The book also contains a bibliography,
                    an index, and is enriched by eighty-four illustrations!</p>
            <p>The book has greater significance, however, than adding considerable light to the history and
                    development of Indiana art. By this intensive study in one state, Peat has afforded us a view of how
                    art must have been practiced in other new states of the Middle West. Moreover, we now have for
                    perhaps the first time a clear conception of how art was received in pioneer times. The prevailing
                    theory has been that opening a new country, with its attendant political, military, and economic
                    absorption, did not permit time or money for appreciation of the arts. Yet one is now hard put to it
                    to explain how certain artists were able to earn a living exclusively by art in small and new
                    communities of Indiana, other than by admitting that enough people did patronize them. Since a
                    sufficient market does not always exist today, it would appear that we must revise our thinking
                    about the lack of culture near the frontier.</p>
            <p>Peat's book enlarges and supplants the work on Indiana artists done by Mary Q. Burnet in
                    1921. Moreover, he maintains a judicious perspective throughout, never inflating the competent
                    artist into a genius nor yet dismissing primitive painters with contempt. It is the same
                    sympathetic, even temper that has endeared him as director of the John Herron Art Museum in <placeName>

            <p>A historical society, nowadays, is generally dedicated to the idea of encouraging a historical
                    interest in the minds of all citizens living within its particular bailiwick. Diligent study of the
                    people, customs, and institutions, runs the argument, will help the individual understand the
                    relationship between local people and events and the larger pattern of development in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. By studying the specific and local we are able to move, with more comprehension, to
                    the general and the regional or national.</p>
            <p>Take an institution, for example, say the advocates of state and local history. Find out its history,
                    relate it to the larger historical and geographical picture of similar institutions and then tell
                    the story in such a way that the "average reader" will not lay it down before he
                    finishes.</p>
            <p>Few historical societies, however, heed their own exhortations. Very few people, it seems, write
                    histories of historical societies. Those who do, write them more as propaganda pieces than as case
                    studies of the role of the historical society as a vehicle for dissemination of
                    knowledge—competent, significant, and interesting historical knowledge.</p>
            <p>During the last twenty years, many societies have been content with mere brochures which outline in
                    sketchy form the key dates and names usually identified with the organization's success,
                    together with a few outstanding collections. <hi rend="i">Making History Live, The Story of the
                        Vermont Historical Society</hi> by John McDill; <hi rend="i">The New Hampshire Historical

                    of this type of publication. Floyd C. Shoemaker's <hi rend="i">The State Historical Society

               </hi> was a little more intensive.</p>
            <p>We can now add to the extremely skimpy bookshelf of historical society histories one of the first
                    full-length treatments of a historical agency—the New-York Historical Society, emanating
                    from the society as part of its sesquicentennial celebration in 1954.</p>
            <pb n="256" id="VAA4025-051-3-076"/>
            <p>In many respects, however, Vail's enlarged story takes on many of the defective
                    characteristics of earlier and smaller histories of historical societies. Other than the vast amount
                    of detail he included, Vail might as well have told his story in brochure-length publication. For
                    one searching for obscure details or for one who does not have the society's catalog at
                    hand, the volume may serve as a rich source. Long lists of members and page after page of art,
                    manuscript, and book collections (all carefully indexed) provide the kind of detail which will
                    undoubtedly cause happiness among members and close friends of the society but which, at the same
                    time, will discourage many outside the select circle from attempting to wade through the amassed
                    statistics and lists. Vail's excellent training in bibliography is in evidence as he
                    gathers together his facts—with one notable exception. On p. 350 where he lists other
                    great collectors of Americana he includes Lyman C. Draper "whose great collection of
                    Western manuscripts is at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>." The statement is close to the truth. The State Historical Society of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, a separate state agency which owns and services the Draper manuscripts, is on the
                    university campus.</p>
            <p>The first two-thirds of the book is chronological, each chapter covering the period of one of the
                    illustrious presidents of the society. Gouverneur Morris, DeWitt Clinton, Hamilton Fish, and Albert
                    Gallatin were some of the nationally famous men to hold the high office. Before getting down to
                    summarizing events, Vail spends a few paragraphs giving the background of the period to be covered
                    in the chapter. Unfortunately, the brief history amounts to a bibliographical list of events.</p>
            <p>The following excerpt (p. 60) from the background paragraphs for the period 1820-1827 is staggering
                    in its thumb-nailed all-inclusiveness: "The Monroe Doctrine was declared; the Government
                    built its first lighthouse; <placeName>

                        <country reg="lb">Liberia</country>
                    </placeName> was founded. The Erie Canal was completed with a great celebration; <placeName>

                    </placeName> began canal building; the first American-made locomotive was built by John Stevens; the

                    commenced its hundred years of publication. …" and so on and so on.</p>
            <p>The last third of the book is given over to accounts of distinguished people who have belonged and
                    contributed to the society, and a long chapter about "Elegant Dinners and Eloquent
                    Diners." Throughout, Vail gives generous donors their due-in generous detail. Quite often
                    he shows rare candor as when he notes that the presidency of Gouverneur Morris "gave the
                    society considerable prestige" (p. 47) though Morris never presided at a meeting. Or when
                    he points out that in 1827 the society elected the entire state legislature to membership.</p>
            <p>As a handbook of facts, <hi rend="i">Knickerbocker Birthday</hi> will be an addition to
                    one's library; as a meaningful story of the role of a historical agency, it falls short of

            <p>These lectures make up a group of charming and interesting essays. They display Bowers's
                    well-known literary qualities of intense and detailed study, homely and striking illustrations, and
                    a partisan concern for the reputation of his heroes. His method involves setting forth a condition
                    of trouble facing the Republic, and, in this case, the manner in which each one of his protagonists
                    checkmated dangers to democracy, while on the other hand advancing democratic principles and
                    practice. Bowers is not only partisan, but partisan in the most political sense; several of his most
                    interesting pages constitute a defense of parties and politics. His present volume could almost be
                    issued as a campaign document by one of the two major political parties; it will not here be
                    revealed which one.</p>
            <p>The question is what this kind of bias does to Bowers's history. Does it make a caricature
                    of reality? Is it calculated to deceive uninitiated readers? Does one tire of the author's
                    untiring admiration for Jefferson, Jackson, and Polk? Worse still, is one able to predict his
                    attitudes toward their views <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-051-3-078"/> and operations? The first thing
                    the patient and friendly reader will note is that Bowers's method does produce certain
                    valid results. His awareness of differences and passions in American political life, his desire to
                    set forth what seems to him the palpable truth, give him energy and variety in research. His desire
                    to explain and defend the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> Resolutions of Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for example, sets off a vivid and elaborate description of the manner in which the
                    Alien and Sedition Acts were conceived, the threat they posed to democratic life and anticipations,
                    the cruel fashion in which they were administered. To be sure, the Jefferson and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> resolutions had a strong tendency, if nothing more, to impugn constitutional processes,
                    too; but one has refreshed his sense of the serious challenge to civil liberties which Federalist
                    party leaders had underwritten, and the excitement attending the "Great
                    Revolution" of 1800 which swept Jefferson into the presidency.</p>
            <p>Of course, if the reader should not happen to be aware of the determined attack which the Jefferson
                    administration made on the rights and privileges of the Supreme Court, it would be difficult for him
                    to put it into the balance of Jefferson's services to democracy and the Constitution; for
                    he will not read about it in Bowers's pages. There is no doubt that he is best read in
                    company with some more temperate scholar. But his eloquence is stimulating, is, in its fashion,
                    informative, and involves a consistency of execution which can be quite useful and even, to some
                    degree, self-correcting. Bowers makes no secret of his likes and dislikes. It is also evident that
                    he prefers to emphasize some points, rather than others. The curious and alert reader will wonder
                    why. He will wonder why, for example, Bowers has rather vaguely indicated that Alexander Hamilton
                    was "a genius of a very high order," if his party was leading us toward
                    totalitarian-ism; what may not have been included in his manifestly loose defense of Polk's
                    leadership, in the crisis with Mexico which ended in a war; what is meant by his saying that Jackson
                    "cut the red tape of diplomacy in the fight in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName>." Bowers, incidentally, takes particular pains to answer to his own
                    satisfaction his question: Why was James K. Polk one of the great American presidents? He hopes that
                    "the time will come when a statue of heroic proportions will be raised in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
                    </placeName> facing the Golden Gate, from which he never took his eyes until that beautiful city and
                    great port <pb n="259" id="VAA4025-051-3-079"/> unfurled the American flag to the breezes of the
                    Pacific sea." One can for himself add up Bowers's evidence, and judge the validity
                    of this dream.</p>
            <p>Two general observations about Bowers's method and point of view seem in order. In the first
                    place, his emphasis upon character and conflict, though they make for vivid and interesting reading,
                    seem to do so at the expense of underlying factors. He sees Jefferson as a great democrat, scarcely
                    at all as a product and leader of the agricultural interest in the nation. He sees the low tariff
                    view as representing justice and humanity, not at all as, among other things, reflecting differences
                    between southern and Democratic, as opposed to Federalist, politics. He sees Jackson as marshaling
                    forces to make an end of, of all things, personal government. It is the People who are in control
                    during that great figure's administration. Perhaps. And perhaps he represented all that was
                    manly, honest, and democratic-this gentle constitutionalist who regretted that he had been unable to
                    shoot <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> and hang Calhoun. But Bowers, who believes in politics-who believes that it represents
                    our insurance against totalitarianism-must also realize that Jackson was not raised high for his
                    personal qualities alone, but also because an amalgam of social and economic tendencies found him
                    preferable in the White House to others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Bowers, in retailing the democratic convictions of his major figures, almost entirely
                    forgets to mention the Negro and slavery. He passes with the lightest of sentences over the gag rule
                    which was intended to stifle discussion of the great American problem, and mentions neither the
                    Whigs nor the Democrats who fought it to its death. He refers to the "fanatic,
                    irresponsible crusade of the abolitionists," but does not make clear whether he is
                    including in his strictures John Quincy Adams, James G. Birney, the Tappan brothers, Salmon P.
                    Chase, Samuel G. Howe, William H. Seward, Charles O. Dana, Theodore Parker, and the hosts of others
                    who fought to preserve civil liberties, communication, democratic processes of government, and
                    social action. His lectures are stimulating, forceful, entertaining, and they serve to remind us
                    that Americans have differing interests and compulsions which, up to a point, need to be taken into
                    account, and occasionally, discounted.</p>

            <p>When one knows what a document says and means, then one may intelligently determine whether the
                    document should be amended to conform with what one prefers that it say and mean. First, there must
                    be power to amend. Second, of course, someone must determine the document's meaning. With
                    respect to the power to amend, the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution provided for its own amendment. The picture remained to be completed, and,
                    in 1803, Chief Justice John Marshall, in determining who should determine what the Constitution
                    means, announced that the natural and intended instrument for this purpose was the Supreme Court. In
                        <hi rend="i">Marbury v. Madison</hi>, John Marshall held that, since the Constitution did not
                    warrant Congress' enacting a statute conferring upon the Supreme Court the authority to
                    issue writs of mandamus to public officers, the statute so enacted was null and void. Thus did the
                    Supreme Court, fourteen years after ratification of the Constitution, first assert its power of
                    judicial review of the validity of acts of Congress.</p>
            <p>This book is commemorative of that occasion. Coincidentally, the year 1953, when the portions of the
                    volume were first assembled, was also the tercentennial of the first modern written
                    constitution-Oliver Cromwell's Instrument of Government. Professor Edmond Cahn, the editor,
                    professor of law at New York University, has collated and assembled in this book a series of short
                    discussions, papers, and major articles delivered at a group of meetings at the New York University
                    School of Law in 1953. The contributors are a distinguished lot of constitutional lawyers indeed,
                    including, in addition to Professor Cahn, Professors Willard Hurst, formerly of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, now of New York University; Paul A. Freund, Fairchild professor of law, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName>; John P. Frank, associate professor of law, Yale; Ralph F. Bischoff, professor of law
                    and assistant dean, New York University School of Law; and also Charles P. Curtis, a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> bar. The purpose of the writers was to study the effect of judicial review on American
                    history since <hi rend="i">Marbury v. Madison</hi>. Specifically, the questions to be answered,
                    according to the preface (p. viii), were: "What <pb n="261" id="VAA4025-051-3-081"/>
                    practical, working differences does judicial review make in the contemporary American scene? Has the
                    Supreme Court exercised its power to determine constitutionality too extensively or too narrowly,
                    with wisdom or imprudently? By passing on the validity of laws and executive actions, in what
                    directions does the Court turn the dynamic force of the Constitution?"</p>
            <p>As a collective scholarly articulation of the one hundred years' history of judicial review,
                    the book is excellent. How-ever, no one remotely familiar with the problems of contemporary
                    constitutional law will be surprised to find that the writers generally have difficulty assaying the
                    effect of judicial review and that there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with some aspects of
                    judicial review as it has some-times been exercised. Professors Freund and Hurst seem most lenient
                    and satisfied of all, the former excusing the Court (and blaming Congress) for the failure to
                    enforce the civil rights guaranteed by the Civil War amendments, the latter urging that the
                    Court's standing in the way of social legislation in the 1930's lasted only two
                    years, which shows that the Court cannot long deny urgent demands of policy. Professor Frank is
                    dissatisfied with the Court and its hand-ling of civil liberties, and Professor Cahn and Curtis are
                    dissatisfied that the Court has not done more to declare the "immanent component"
                    in constitutional law. Actually the words "immanent law" were used only by Curtis
                    but seem not dissimilar to the import of Professor Cahn's statements. The closest proximity
                    to unanimity to be found in these essays is in the general consensus that the Court has failed to
                    preserve basic liberties, and in the consensus that judicial review cannot be adequately evaluated
                    in the absence of sufficient available factual information. Unanimity on the former is certainly a
                    serious indictment of the Court after one hundred fifty years' experience; unanimity on the
                    latter is certainly a serious indictment of legal scholarship and its persistent failure properly to
                    delve into facts in order intelligently to evaluate the impact of a doctrine upon a people.
                    Professor Hurst particularly laments this lack of factual information in the first footnote of his
                    article in Chapter VI (pp. 216-217).</p>
            <p>Professor Cahn's introductory essay, "An American Contribution," is a
                    brilliant historical piece of work. Tracing the history and content of other written constitutions,
                    he develops the thesis that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Constitution and <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-051-3-082"/> judicial review together have
                    evolved a flexible instrument capable of molding itself to the changing currents from 1787 to 1953.
                    Likewise, Professor Freund approvingly refers to the written constitutional provisions as being
                    couched in "calculated generality," thus making for "pragmatic as against
                    nominalistic judgements" (p. 87). <hi rend="i">Marbury v. Madison</hi> announced the
                    supremacy of the judiciary, including the finality of the decision of the Supreme Court and the
                    peculiar function of the Supreme Court as the instrument through which congressional enactments are
                    tested against the Constitution as an image of the American culture. In concluding his essay,
                    Professor Cahn correctly states (p. 25): "<hi rend="i">[Marbury v. Madison]</hi> introduced
                    an unending colloquy between the Supreme Court and the people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, in which the Court continually asserts, ‘You live under a Constitution but
                    the Constitution is what <hi rend="i">we</hi> say it is,’ and the people incessantly
                    reply, 'As long as your version of the Constitution enables us to live with pride in what
                        <hi rend="i">we</hi> consider a free and just society, you may continue exercising this august,
                    awesome, and altogether revocable authority."</p>
            <p>Charles P. Curtis further carries out the thought of the Court as the mirror of the American scene,
                    and alleges that whatever vagueness there is about present constitutional conceptions, it is due
                    more to the Court's failings than to the founding fathers. Thus, he says, the Court has
                    been inadequate to the task of defining properly the "immanent law" (a
                    Whiteheadian term), which, to Curtis, is the consensus of Americana. The Court must search for this
                    "immanent law," much as Savigny would have us search for our <hi rend="i">Volksgeist</hi>. In the face of the general assumption that the "immanent
                    law" is strictly Anglo-American, Professor Cahn points out, possibly justifiably, a caveat
                    that American society contains a "high proportion of individuals who do not share
                    Anglo-Saxon origins" (p. 63).</p>
            <p>Throughout the volume, one finds the contributors tacitly accepting the conception that Supreme Court
                    decisions in the area of judicial review should be pragmatic, with due considerations to be given
                    the consequences. This is particularly true in the remarks of Professors Freund and Frank, although
                    Professor Bischoff registers some shock over the possibility that the Court has "succumbed
                    to the flexible logic of the pragmatist, using legal concepts and precedent only as support for
                    desired ends" (p. 79). If pragmatism has indeed taken <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-051-3-083"/>
                    hold, this will not sit well with those who regard the written Constitution as itself containing all
                    the fundamental legal principles, the search for which is the primary task of the Court and was, in
                    the past, the key to the unaniminty of that bench.</p>
            <p>The most serious criticisms of the Court may be found in the three short discussions immediately
                    following Professor Cahn's introduction. They have to do with status to challenge
                    constitutionality (Bischoff); political questions (Frank); and review of facts in constitutional
                    cases (Freund). In addition, there seems to be a general feeling that the Court is amiss in denying
                    to itself sufficient power to hear constitutional cases, or, after hearing, to decide them in the
                    broadest sense. Such self-limitations as the insistence of an actual "case or
                    controversy" in the traditional sense, narrow requirements of "standing to
                    sue," the refusal to hear "political questions," development of the rule
                    of the "presumption of constitutionality" of acts of Congress—all are
                    deplored by many of the writers here. Professor Freund, however, favors the conventional lawsuit,
                    and worries lest anything else would permit the Court to decide abstract questions rather than
                    tangible legal problems.</p>
            <p>The book is a mine-lode of ideas and is skillfully devised. Indeed, it may very well have an effect
                    so far as working changes in the exercise of judicial review in the future. Certainly it can be said
                    that the contributors to this volume and the Indiana University Press are to be congratulated on
                    providing such a valuable addition to an important portion of our constitutional history.</p>

            <p>Few states possess a handbook containing brief biographical sketches of all their governors. Such a
                    reference guide, if properly compiled with an eye to completeness and objectivity, is an invaluable
                    aid, not only to citizens generally, but also to librarians, newspapermen, business firms, and
                    pupils and scholars. The Ohio Historical Society, carrying on its tradition of service, once again
                    has made a worthwhile contribution with its collection of the lives of the governors of the Buckeye

               </hi> presents condensed biographies of fifty-seven leaders written by twenty-six
                    authors. The series begins with the colorful Virginian, Edwin <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tiffin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and concludes with Thomas J. Herbert, whose term ended in 1949. Between these two
                    administrations lies an assemblage of characters, each of whom contributed in some degree to the
                    growth and development of the commonwealth. Even a casual glance at their sketches reveals that all
                    of them were gentle-men of great virtue and possessed of exceptional political talent and acumen.
                    Indeed, some of the interpretations remind this reviewer of the old-fashioned laudatory biographies
                    that appeared toward the close of the nineteenth century in subscription county histories.</p>
            <p>It may be possible to justify in a volume of this type lack of appraisal, but it is difficult indeed
                    to defend omission of essential facts, a defect which mars too many sketches. It is stated, for
                    example, that William Allen was born in 1803, but neither the month or day is given; the year of
                    Thomas Kirker's death is listed, but not the month or day; the month and year of David
                    Tod's death are given but not the day. The place of burial is indicated for some governors,
                    but not for all. Only in some sketches are next of kin named. A quick glance at standard reference
                    works, such as the <hi rend="i">Dictionary of American Biography</hi> or the <hi rend="i">Biographical Directory of the American Congress</hi>, might have enabled authors to fill
                    obvious gaps. It would have been helpful also if the title of a biographical article or book had
                    been appended to each sketch to guide readers to additional information.</p>
            <p>Despite imperfections, these lives of the governors fill a genuine need. Their rapid, over-all
                    coverage furnishes elementary information quickly and within the boards of a single book. The
                    publisher is to be commended for bringing the sketches together in an attractive format. Perhaps
                    other states will be stimulated to compile and publish thumb-nail sketches of their governors.</p>

            <p>The history of Confederate finances has always seemed to contain all the elements of a
                    nightmare-frustration at every turn and ultimate futility. Most historians have agreed that no
                    government could have committed more errors in its financial operations than the Confederate
                    government. The detailed and careful works of John C. Schwab, <hi rend="i">The Con-federate States
                        of America, 1861-1865; A Financial and Industrial History of the South during the Civil War</hi>
                    (1901), and Ernest A. Smith's <hi rend="i">The History of the Confederate Treasury</hi>
                    (1901), and numerous books and articles dealing with certain aspects of the subject are fairly well
                    agreed in the assumption that the finances of the Confederacy were managed in the worst possible
                    fashion.</p>
            <p>Professor Todd's <hi rend="i">Confederate Finance</hi>, largely factual, nevertheless seems
                    to the reviewer to present a subtly different point of view. Basing his work on the financial
                    archives of the Confederacy and related documents now assembled and processed in the National
                    Archives and Library of Congress, he presents a far more authentic, penetrating, and objective
                    account than any of his predecessors. The broad outlines of Confederate finance are unchanged by his
                    study; but his painstaking step by step history of each financial move reveals significant
                    differences: (1) that numerous measures later condemned as foolish were adopted as choices of the
                    lesser <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-051-3-087"/> evils; and (2) that, while ultimate failure naturally
                    came with the failure of the Confederacy to gain its independence, Confederate finances still had a
                    considerable over-all success. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Confederacy financed one
                    side of the biggest war of modern times until World War I. Professor Todd does not suggest this, but
                    the reviewer has reached the conclusion that our thinking about Confederate finances needs
                    considerable reorientation. A glance at the principal financial expedients that the Confederacy
                    improvised gives the impression of one picking himself up by the bootstraps, or even more drastic,
                    of a person keeping himself warm by burning his own house, plank by plank.</p>
            <p>The Confederate government's domestic financial operations were carried on by several
                    expedients: paper money, bonds, certificates, the impressment of supplies, the tax in kind and in
                    money, private donations and sequestration of the property of citizens of the enemy. The author
                    finds that the Confederate government issued over a billion and a half dollars in paper money, and
                    about three-quarters of a billion dollars in bonds during the four years of its existence. It raised
                    over one hundred and fifty million dollars in money taxes, and at least sixty millions in produce
                    tax or tax in kind. Finally, it impressed about five hundred million dollars' worth of
                    supplies. The figures on tax in kind and the impressment of supplies are very misleading. The
                    supplies were bought at set government prices far below market prices. It is probable that had the
                    market value been placed on the tax in kind—and the supplies impressed by the
                    military—these would have proved to be of more value than the bonds and currency issued.
                    It would be seen here that the Confederacy was "living off the country." Another
                    item in Confederate finance that had an important bearing on the private economy of the South is
                    worthy of further consideration: By purchasing 400,000 bales of cotton and other produce, the
                    Confederacy kept the cotton market alive so that those who so desired could sell their cotton.</p>
            <p>The chief foreign operations were carried on at first by the sale of cotton bonds or certificates,
                    the principal under-taking being the floating of the Erlanger Loan of about $15,000,000,
                    only half of which was finally disposed of. Finally and most successfully, the Confederate
                    government <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-051-3-088"/> assumed control of the exporting of cotton and
                    importation of supplies in its own vessels and in those of private companies. As a result, its
                    credit in Europe was better at the end of 1864 than it had been since the spring of 1863, when the
                    Erlanger Loan was made.</p>
            <p>Professor Todd's work cannot be superseded as a factual presentation of Confederate finance,
                    for he has examined all the material and presented it carefully. Any further study of this subject
                    should be in the realm of interpretation.</p>

            <p>In 1952, Norwalk Truck Lines, serving parts of <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>

                    </placeName>, rated sixth in the industry in gross revenue and second in tonnage of general freight.
                    Its personnel had earnings, in 1950, almost 11 per cent above those of all workers in the industry.
                    Obviously, an organization capable of achieving such marks is worthy of careful study.</p>
            <p>The business, under the leadership of John Ernsthausen, began as the Norwalk Produce Company which
                    supplied but-ter, eggs, potatoes, and other farm goods to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Toledo</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
               </placeName>, and intermediate points. In 1923, the independent
                    truckers serving the Produce Company sold their equipment to Ernsthausen. In a short time, trucking
                    was the major operation. During the 1930's, Norwalk Truck Lines expanded rapidly and the
                    produce business was dropped.</p>
            <p>The steady growth of Norwalk Lines in the depression years was typical of the entire industry.
                    Emphasis on reduced inventory, on the purchase of small lots by retailers rather than volume buying,
                    was extremely beneficial to the truckers, who could move small shipments quickly and could deliver
                    directly to the dealer's door.</p>
            <p>Among the major problems of the trucking firm have been the acquisition of routes, the keeping of
                    adequate records, and the maintenance of equipment. The general reader will find that the
                    author's handling of these problems leaves him with much better understanding of the men
                    and methods <pb n="269" id="VAA4025-051-3-089"/> behind the huge cargo carriers which roll along the
                    highways.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Norwalk</settlement>
                    </placeName> made public a plan by which control of the firm would eventually pass to the
                    administrative and clerical employees.</p>
            <p>Broehl's work provides an introduction to one area of business history hitherto almost
                    untouched by writers. It should interest those in the field of historical research who consider the
                    interview an important source of information. There is evidence that the author encountered some
                    difficulty in organizing his material, owing to the fact that the company has grown rapidly, largely
                    without careful planning, and has depended upon the personal direction of a few very energetic and
                    extremely capable leaders.</p>

            <p>This widely circulated volume by Dean Griswold of the Harvard Law School has already become
                    influential in relation to its subject. It deals mainly, as its title in the context of contemporary
                    events indicates, with that feature of the Fifth Amendment which confers the so-called privilege
                    against self-incrimination. Because of the timeliness of the subject, it has been printed in both
                    paper-backed and board-covered editions.</p>
            <p>The book consists of three lectures, two of which were delivered before lawyers' groups and
                    one as the Phi Beta Kappa address at Mount Holyoke College. The first and third lectures deal with
                    the history, significance, and interpretation of the self-incrimination clause; the second deals
                    with the concept of due process of law and its application to legislative investigations. All three
                    lectures are written with a clarity that enhances the effectiveness of the accurate scholarship and
                    sound judgment they express. The lay reader will find them easily comprehensible.</p>
            <p>In an important opinion of the Supreme Court in May, 1955, dealing with procedure for invoking and
                    giving effect to the Fifth Amendment in legislative investigations, Chief Justice Earl Warren cited
                    the opening pages of Dean Griswold's <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-051-3-090"/> book as
                    presumably the best available summary of the history of the privilege against self-incrimination,
                    which goes back to the twelfth century in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. Others have spoken and written in the same vein as Dean Griswold on particular aspects
                    of the problem of the Fifth Amendment, but probably no one else has brought together the whole
                    congeries of related issues with equal effectiveness. Of particular significance are his striking
                    examples of situations in which invocation of the Fifth Amendment by witnesses under questioning as
                    to communism does not raise a valid inference of criminal guilt on their part, or even of
                    non-criminal connections with communism. The injustice perpetrated by the stigma of "Fifth
                    Amendment Communist" is thus vividly portrayed.</p>
            <p>Dean Griswold does not compromise with those who would weaken hard-won constitutional guaranties in
                    the pursuit of immediate goals, however urgent. The Fifth Amendment has value, he maintains, not
                    only for the specific protection it affords but also as a symbol of wider aspects of procedural
                    decency. Even though precise distinctions must be drawn in interpreting it, as must be the case
                    whenever a principle is applied to specific situations, it serves as a constant reminder of the
                    integrity of the individual person, which it safeguards. What stage of debasement would we have
                    reached during the anti-Communist crusade of recent years if the constitutional absolute of the
                    Amendment had not been there, requiring obedience? As Dean Griswold states, "It has been
                    one thing which has held quite firm, although something like a juggernaut has pushed upon it. It
                    has, thus, through all its vicissitudes, been a symbol of the ultimate moral sense of the community,
                    upholding the best in us, when otherwise there was a good deal of wavering under the pressures of
                    the times" (p. 73).</p>
            <p>New applications of constitutional principles are needed too in times such as these. In dealing with
                    due process of law in relation to legislative investigations Dean Griswold sets forth some of the
                    principal reforms of committee procedures for which the protection of individuals calls. All in all,
                    his book is a valuable guide to serious thought on some of the basic issues of our times.</p>

            <p>Any mention of the frontier these days immediately brings to mind the ubiquitous Davy Crockett and
                    his kind, coonskin-capped and busy at backwoods turkey-shoots hammering nails into stumps at fifty
                    yards with their long rifles, or neatly puncturing the pipe-clayed cross belts of Mexican regulars
                    unfortunate enough to encounter them. The West produced other types, however, and this volume is a
                    solid account of one of these-the frontier promoter. The archetype of the genius himself, Colonel
                    Beriah Sellers, never exhibited the boundless energy, the unlimited audacity, or the fabulous
                    optimism of James Duane Doty. Had Doty never been born the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> would not have been materially affected; but this emphatically cannot be said of that
                    group of men that he typified. The history of the West is to a large degree the record of their
                    ceaseless pursuit of self-interest through land speculations; town-jobbing; and canal, river, and
                    railroad promotions. This Miss Smith admirably demonstrates in her well-written and historically
                    well-crafted case study of a man who became territorial judge, delegate, and governor, Indian
                    superintendent, agent for the powerful Astor interests, <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> congressman, and friend and confident of party leaders and cabinet ministers, all
                    largely to advance his promotions.</p>
            <p>Doty was not content to buy up farmlands and wait for a rise in their value; this was too slow for
                    one consumed by the feverish desire for a grand coup that would glitteringly produce a fortune
                    overnight. His specialty was speculation in town sites, his most brilliant feat the imposition on
                    the <placeName>

                    </placeName> territorial legislature of a platted wilderness for the new capital. Doty's
                    formula was to select a likely spot-based on his wide knowledge of geography acquired in his travels
                    as a circuit-riding judge and attorney, explorer, military road builder, Indian attorney, and
                    tireless roamer-then "organize a group of investors into a company, purchase the land, lay
                    out a village, sell a few lots and bring in a few settlers, and then turn his energies to working
                    out land or water connections with the outside world" (p. 176).</p>
            <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-051-3-092"/>

                    his failing fortunes when an appointment as Indian superintendent sent him to the Utah Territory in
                    1860. Here in 1865, now territorial governor, Doty died, still in harness and with one eye cocked on
                    the promise of far western railroad schemes to lead him at last to the promised wealth that had
                    forever eluded him.</p>
            <p>Through the baffling complexities of Doty's tortuous schemes Miss Smith conducts us with a
                    sure hand. Her triumph over the paucity of evidence and her evident ability to ferret out of many a
                    hidden corner the records which did exist represent historical research in its best tradition. Her
                    finished picture is well done, and if it is only at infrequent intervals that Doty the man emerges
                    from the enigma automatically pursuing its endless convolutions, this is no criticism of the author
                    but rather a comment on the difficulty of drawing full-length portraits without the mass of personal
                    papers needed to put flesh on otherwise bare bones.</p>
            <p>The general reader might at times wish he had been spared some of the minutia of Doty's
                    schemes, but to the special student such a close analysis of a promoter's technique is
                    fascinating. Especially interesting is the light thrown upon the frontier agents for powerful
                    eastern capitalists and speculators, who often gave their representatives carte blanche to use their
                    money for them to best advantage, and who represented for the agents—as the Astors did
                    for Doty—powerful friends and sources of influence and support.</p>
            <p>Anyone who is interested in the history of the West, especially that much neglected area of American
                    history, the territorial experience, will find Miss Smith's scholarly book a valuable
                    study.</p>

            <p>James Burrill Angell was the president of the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> from 1871 to 1909. During that period he not only led this great state university in
                    its remarkable growth and achievements, but also played a leading role in furthering the cause of
                    education as a whole in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> and participated in important diplomatic missions for the Department of State. For
                    these reasons he can be called "an American influence."</p>
            <p>President Angell was evidently a person of great personal charm, for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> alumni who had come into contact with him as students greatly venerated him, and
                    Shirley Wheeler Smith, his biographer—an alumnus who served as teacher of English,
                    secretary and chief financial officer, and general secretary of the Alumni Association during his
                    incumbency—has helped preserve this veneration.</p>
            <p>Unlike most presidents of large universities today, President Angell was not solely an administrator.
                    He gave instruction in international law and the history of American treaties, personally
                    interviewed all the students who entered the Department of Literature, Science, and the Arts,
                    maintained cordial relations with the faculty, and addressed the students and alumni on many
                    occasions. It is not surprising that his biographer, who recalls with pride the welcome which he
                    received from the president at his matriculation, should find it difficult to see mistakes in the
                    man.</p>
            <p>A personal friend of John W. Foster, John Hay-one of his former students at Brown University-and
                    other import-ant political figures of his day, President Angell devoted much time and thought to
                    political, particularly diplomatic, matters. He served as minister and chairman of a commission of
                    three in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> from 1880 to 1881; on the fishery commission comprising British, Canadian, and American
                    members which met in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D.C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in the winter of 1887-1888; as chairman of the deep waterways commission which met
                    with the Canadian commission in 1896; and as minister to Turkey from August, 1897, to August, 1898.
                    Although his missions produced no remarkable results, they displayed his wisdom and tact in dealing
                    with difficult problems and personalities and increased his reputation both at home and abroad.</p>
            <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-051-3-094"/>
            <p>Although Smith brings a great amount of detail into his biography, beginning with a discussion of
                    President Angell's ancestors and concluding with a summary of his personal contacts with
                    students, he holds the reader's interest throughout. More attention might have been devoted
                    to the growth of the university during its thirty-eight years under President Angell. The book
                    contains a good index and a number of interesting illustrations.</p>

            <p>This volume, based on a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>
                    </placeName> doctoral thesis, is a study of obituaries and opinions expressed in various journals at
                    the time of the death of six of America's most important business men: Stephen Gerard, John
                    Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, John Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry Ford. The
                    research obviously involved much persistent and tedious work; the author, for example, examined 194
                    newspapers on Astor and found material in 164; of the magazines he examined 296 on Ford, but found
                    material in only 28. On the last three tycoons named above, the author also had the use of trade
                    union publications and, house organs. The general method used by the author was to begin with the
                    majority opinion as illustrated by the publications of the Northeast, where all but Ford operated,
                    and then the dissenting opinions, followed by the reactions of those of the West and South.</p>
            <p>On none of these men was there a unanimity of opinion, although with the development of the
                    commercial press and associated news gathering agencies the reactions and interpretations revealed a
                    certain sameness. Perhaps the most significant contribution of the author is his effort to explain
                    the opinions of the press in relation to the spirit of the times, and the efforts of the upholders
                    of these business men to interpret their life and deeds as representing the true American way. As
                    might be expected the major portion of the book is given over to quotations; these alone tell the
                    story, but the author injects enough interpretation to clarify the picture.</p>
            <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-051-3-095"/>
            <p>With the exception of Morgan all of these men rose from humble circumstances, and this was emphasized
                    in most obituaries with the lesson that this was uniquely possible in America. Perhaps Gerard, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> banker, who gave only 2 per cent of his fortune ($7,500,000), the largest in
                    America at the time, to his relatives and friends, and the rest to charities, the improvement of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, internal improvements in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, and the founding of Gerard College, received the most unanimous approval. The chief
                    criticism came from those who resented his elimination of the clergy from participation in the
                    college and his lack of concern over Negro slavery. While the comments on Astor's life
                    showed great admiration for his economic success, there was some condemnation of his business
                    methods, "skepticism as to the value of money-making, scorn for his manner of living,
                    concern with the problem of the proper uses of money" (pp. 24-25). It was noted by some
                    writers that his wealth came in part from the unearned increment on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> real estate, and a belief that the donation of $500,000 for a public library
                    out of an estate of $20,000,000 was not enough. There was, in brief, a growing interest
                    in the getting and spending of money.</p>
            <p>With the death of Vanderbilt came the new image of the "robber baron," a concern
                    over non-business activities, a modification of the praise heaped on the acquisition of wealth, and
                    an emphasis on the relation of man to the system, not discussed before. But this challenge to the
                    established order brought a quick defense. By the time the imperious Morgan passed away the nation
                    had been aroused by the development of monopoly, the money trust, and the election of the
                    progressive Wilson. A new psychology had appeared and many contemporaries believed a "new
                    era" had come. There was less talk about Morgan's wealth and more on how he had
                    used it, and it was often critical. The newspapers, now more than ever tied closely with big
                    business, tried to meet the criticism by identifying Morgan and his use of money with the greatness
                    of the nation. The implication was that if you were against Morgan you were against the nation.</p>
            <p>When John D. Rockefeller died in 1937 at the age of 97, the pattern of thought regarding his life had
                    been well formulated, and to no small extent by the work of the suave Ivy Lee. With amazing
                    conformity both the United Press and the Associated Press passed over the questionable practices of
                    his <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-051-3-096"/> early years to picture him as the kindly old gentleman who
                    had made a fortune in his early years through industry, frugality, personal morality, and high
                    ability, only to give most of it away in his later years. His was the "‘greatest
                    Horatio Alger story of all time’" (p. 127), and his success closely identified
                    with the nation's progress. True, not all had forgotten the criticisms of his early years,
                    but they were largely submerged in the general approval expressed after his death.</p>
            <p>When Henry Ford died, his weaknesses and abilities were well known, but few made the differentiation
                    as clearly as Max Lerner. His accomplishments were "‘mass-production,
                    standardization, high-speed belt-line, high wages, large volume,’ "but his mind
                    was a" ‘jungle of fear and ignorance and prejudice in social
                    affairs’" (p. 160). But most newspapers followed the usual line "of the
                    dead nothing but good" and pictured him as the symbol of all that was right in industrial
                    capitalism.</p>
            <p>In summarizing his conclusions, Diamond suggests that in the early nineteenth century the
                    entrepreneur was described as a man with certain personal qualities who performed certain business
                    acts, and that non-business acts were private and not relevant to the discussion. Personal qualities
                    and character were stressed and the destination of his fortune rather than the methods of acquiring
                    it. In the twentieth century, the non-business roles of the enterpreneur are emphasized and the
                    economic environment which made success possible, an environment synonymous with the nation itself.
                    This differentiation by periods does not seem so clear to the reviewer as to the author. All types
                    of opinion seem to appear in both periods and for all six men. The book throws light on such
                    problems as the making of public opinion, propaganda, and interpretative reporting as well as the
                    contemporaneous evaluation of some of the most important business men.</p>

            <p>The Kentucky Historical Society was organized in 1836 and some of its members began collecting
                    manuscripts at an early date, but the present collection represents only gifts, deposits, and
                    purchases since the late 1880's. Much of the <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-051-3-097"/> material
                    gathered earlier found its way into other collections. It is not an extensive collection and is
                    characterized by very small groups containing five or less items.</p>
            <p>There are 1,149 entries which have been classified under nine headings-Autograph Original Papers,
                    Account Books, Church Records, Confederate Pension Records, Diaries and Journals, Hotel Registers,
                    Local (County) Records, Military Records, Tax Books, and Vital Statistics. A brief description of
                    the papers, the names of individuals to whom letters were written, and a statement on the size of
                    the collection has been given. It is unfortunate that the birth and death dates were not given after
                    each name. If it was not possible to supply this information, a date when the individual was active
                    would have enhanced the use of the <hi rend="i">Guide</hi>.</p>

            <p>The fact that the index of thirty-one pages includes the people to whom and from whom letters were
                    written and other pertinent information in the manuscript collection should prove of great value.</p>
