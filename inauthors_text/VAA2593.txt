                PREFACE.
                Doubtless you have heard of the artless Irish maid who went to the postoffice and
                    asked:
                 "Is ther-re anny letther fur me?"
                 "What name, please?" the polite postal clerk queried.
                "Faith, that will be on the letther!" she replied with a slight
                    show of resentment.
                If you shall ask us why we should inflict the public with another volume of
                    verse, the answer will be in the book itself. The author believes he has a
                    genuine mes- sage in this book, one which the world will do well to read and
                    ponder over.
                It reflects the loftiest sentiments and the noblest aspi- rations of, at least,
                    one humble, human heart. We can climb no higher. We can aspire no further. Many
                    of the sentiments herein expressed may not coincide with your views, your bias,
                    your prejudices. We are sorry for that. We love to be in perfect accord with all
                    of our friends. But the Truth, as we see it, compels us, and we must not be
                    disobedient to the heavenly vision, as poor, old, beaten-up, persecuted Paul
                    might have said.
                 From our standpoint, the most beautiful ideal of all time, of all history, is
                    the character of Jesus Christ, and the next, that of our beloved country, best
                    typified and -represented by what we call "Old Glory". We
                    believe that no nation under the sun comes as near placing be- fore the eyes of
                    humanity the principles of that first ideal as our glorious union of the States.
                    We are sorry that lthe great guns of this Republic should ever be trainedto the destruction of any portion of the human
                    race. We are thankful that our noble President tried every reasonable means of
                    averting this sad condition. But law-violators, truce-breakers, treaty-ignorers
                    must be punished, and we are happy to know that we have a nation and a people
                    that are as unconquerable as God's eternal right itself!
                What a pitiable situation had faced crushed, enslaved, outraged Belgium,
                    bleeding, but heroic France, and the land of our fathers, the isles of Britain,
                    had there been no "God's Country", no America! What a
                    message the Old Flag carries across the seas! No wonder the French and the
                    English wept frantic tears of joy when "the starry banner of the
                    free" swept down their boulevards! And a part of the message that the
                    Old Flag bore and is bearing has been caught, we trust, within the pages of this
                    book!

                    WHEN THE OLD FLAG CAME
                         (A Belgian War Story Poem)
                    
                        My name is Frida Von Armon,
                         And I lived near the village of Ans
                        When the German began his invasion
                        And assembled his numerous clans;
                        Myself and my father and mother
                        All dwelt in a house by the way
                        That his armies pursued in the marching
                        After crushing of Liege that day.
                    
                    
                        I then was a girl scarcely twenty,
                        My parents were feeble and old;
                        My brother, a soldier of Belga,
                        Had fought with her regulars bold
                        For our home and our country so sacred,
                        For the honor of Albert, our king,
                        Till the foeman had taken the city
                        And crushed it within his steel ring.
                    
                    
                        But now, our resistance exhausted,
                        The foe had gone by like the blast,
                        And had left us all helpless, forsaken,
                        To gaze on our sorrow aghast;
                        And oh, my dear brother, where was he?
                        I shuddered and paled at the thought;
                        For over beyond, on the hillside,
                        Was the last place the Belgians fought;
                    
                    
                    
                        And a taint in the wind and the breezes,
                        And a stain on the rivulet's flood,
                        Made me think though I fain would forget it,
                        Of death and the wounded and blood!
                    
                    
                        Soon the evening came and the darkness
                        Bringing shadows of night and their gloom,
                        And there settled a deep, awful silence
                        Save a now-and-then, air-breaking boom
                        Of the cannon that told how the German
                        Was blasting and drilling his way
                        Into the heart of my country
                        To mangle and cripple and slay!
                    
                    
                        My soul cried in bitterest anguish,
                        And I longed to slip out in the night
                        To the battlefield there in the distance
                        And search for my brother in spite
                        Of the stern command of the German
                        Who had published it loudly and bold:
                        "Civilians found out in the darkness
                        Will be shot!" 'Twas thus we were told!
                    
                    
                        And my father was old and decrepit,
                        And my mother so nervous and ill
                        With the day's loud bellow of cannon,
                        That I dared not such errand fulfill!
                    
                    
                        Oh, the anguish and fear and the horror
                        That came with the slow-moving hour;
                        I prayed to my God up in heaven
                        For strength to be brave and for power
                    
                    
                    
                        To help and defend my dear brother
                        And bring him safe back to our fold.
                        I've always believed a swift answer
                        Came straight from the portals of gold!
                    
                    
                        For there came' through the vine-latticed window
                        A sound soft as autumn's leaf fall,
                        And the voice, like the wail of a lost one,
                        Sounding far in the distance a call,
                        "Oh, Freetzy!"--my brother's pet
                            nick-name,
                        The one he had used since a child!--
                        I ran to the door in a phrensy,
                        Like a person grown suddenly wild.
                    
                    
                        I tore loose the bolts and the fast'nings
                        That stood my swift eit before,
                        And held up the lamp and then listened
                        As I stood in the wide-opened door;
                        "Oh, Freetzy! oh, Freetzy!" came
                            softly,
                        As soft as the wind in the trees;
                        Was it psychic or real sound I pondered,
                        Borne afar on the September breeze?
                    
                    
                        I held up the lamp still and higher,
                        And gazed into shadows profound,
                        Till I fancied my dim eyes could fathom
                        The way to the dank battleground;
                        I could hear the faint cries of the wounded,
                        Whom the stretchers had failed to reach still,
                        And "Freetzy, oh, Freetzy!" came
                            plainly,
                        As it seemed, from the league-distance hill!
                    
                    
                    
                        'Twas my brother's voice, could I doubt
                            it?
                        And a fear pierced my heart like a thorn;
                        Was he wounded and bleeding and dying,
                        And calling to me sad and lorn?
                        I crept back once more through the doorway,
                        Put the lamp on the table again;
                        My father was lying in silence
                        And my mother complained of no pain.
                    
                    
                        Then out at the vine-covered portal
                        That faced toward the battlefield view,
                        I ran down the path to the roadway
                        Then out at the postern I flew,
                        And over the road to the meadow
                        I climbed in the night the dim stile,
                        Where brother and I in the bye-gones
                        Had played and romped many a while!
                    
                    
                        I scarcely had stepped down the platform
                        On the side toward the near battlefield,
                        And taken a step in the darkness,
                        Ere I stumbled o'er something concealed.
                        What was it? Oh, God, with a shudder,
                        I saw 'twas the form of a man,
                        Some poor, wounded soldier forsaken,
                        Who had dropped in the battle's fierce van!
                    
                    
                        With his wounds unbound and still bleeding,
                        Seeking shelter and help in the night!
                        Should I aid him, nor hasten to brother?--
                        God prompted my action aright;
                        For so vivid had been my quick fancy
                        That my brother's far call I should greet,
                        That I never once thought 'twas my Andre
                        Whose person now lay at my feet!
                    
                    
                    
                        I seized then the form there before me,
                        And with more than man's courage and strength,
                        I carried him back to our cottage
                        And laid him in bed at full length;
                        And joy, yet deepest affliction,
                        When the lamp on his features once shown,
                        'Twas my own dear brother, my Andre,
                        Who had crawled thus far all alone!
                    
                    
                        He had fought that day and was wounded,
                        And had lain where the battle-tide broke
                        Unconscious with dead all around him
                        Till in the night air he awoke;
                        Then thinking of home and his dear ones,
                        And the cottage just over the hill,
                        He had crawled thus far on his journey
                        Though growing each step the more ill!
                    
                    
                        Three months passed by in our cottage,
                        Three months of privation and woe;
                        Our crops and our fruits were destroyed
                        By the purposely wanton foe;
                        The German had left us no forage,
                        Had left us no cow and no food;
                        Our money was gone and no doctor
                        Could be found in many a rood.
                    
                    
                        And brother, poor brother, was raging
                        With a fever that burned like a flame,
                        And mother grew weaker and weaker
                        And father more helpless became;
                        I could see that my loved ones were dying
                        Almost for a morsel to eat;
                        I tried every plan T could think of,
                        And plied every scheme that was meet.
                    
                    
                    
                        Soon bitterly cold came December,
                        With its blasts from off the North Sea;
                        We'd no fuel, no food and poor brother
                        As dangerously ill as could be;
                        And father and mother so poorly--
                        Starvation affects e'en the mind!--
                        There was nothing that promised assistance
                        Nor help in the future to find!
                    
                    
                        Do you know what it means to be starving,
                        Your dear ones to have all around,
                        Sick and helpless, beseeching,
                        And no way to help them be found?
                        No fuel when winter comes howling
                        With his pitiless drifts of the snow?
                        The strain on the body is frightful,
                        But that on the mind trebly so!
                    
                    
                        I looked from my window e'er hourly,
                        And prayed Holy Mother on high,
                        But no one had come but the German
                        Pretending to look for a spy;
                        He was ready to kill in a moment,
                        Aye, ready to shoot to the heart,
                        But to give Christian help or to succor,
                        That certainly wasn't his part!
                    
                    
                        One morning I peered from our cottage
                        To the village of Ans below;
                        I heard the clear tones of a bugle,
                        Saw the marching of men to and fro;
                    
                    
                    
                        Then out at the top of a building
                        Like a token of peace and good will
                        I saw a bright banner unfolding
                        And riding the breeze cresp and chill!
                    
                    
                        Not the black-white-red of the German,
                        But a cluster of silver-white stars
                        In a field of azure appearing
                        And a series of red and white bars;
                        Was it beeautiful? Aye, as the daybreak
                        That comes with the sunburst combined;
                        How this new banner unfurling
                        Had captured my heart and my mind!
                    
                    
                        "What is it?" with clasped hands I
                            shouted
                        To my neighbor just over the way;
                        "Th' Americans have come!" she
                            answered,
                        "Have come from their ships in the bay;
                        It's their flag!" she further informed
                            me,
                        As I gazed on the beautiful sign;
                        And what does it mean?" I asked her;
                        No words could her rapture define!
                    
                    
                        "Have they conquered the German?" I
                            queried;
                        "No, no!" she answered again;
                        "They've not come with cannon and
                            bloodshed,
                        But with loving and good will to men;
                        They've brought us all food in abundance
                        And nurses and medicine, too,
                        And the flag that kisses the sunshine
                        Is christened the Red, White and Blue!"
                    
                    
                    
                        Holy Saints! how I wept and shouted
                        And prayed on my beaded knees,
                        And almost worshipped that banner
                        That gracefully danced on the breeze;
                        And then I ran in and told brother,
                        "Cheer up, my dear Andre, I pray,
                        For some folks who love us are coming,
                        Not the spy-hunting German today!"
                    
                    
                        "Who are they?" he brightened up,
                            asking;
                        I lifted him so he could see
                        Through the uncurtained window before him,
                        That glorious flag of the free;
                        He saw the bright sign in the distance,
                        That token of freedom and love,
                        And said: "It has come likethe angels
                        From the loving all-Father above!"
                    
                    
                        And they came with food and with fuel,
                        And the Red Cross ladies came,
                        Not like the German with cannon,
                        >Nor "the trumpet that sings of fame,"
                        And sweet was their coming, oh, Jesus,
                        They came in thy name to fulfill
                        That tenderest purpose of heaven
                        Of peace on the earth and goodwill!
                    
                    
                        And brother's wounds healed in a fortnight, 
                        And father and mother so dear,
                        Though their ailments seemed hopeless when starving, 
                        Began to look up and take cheer;
                    
                    
                    
                        They saw all the world was not
                            cruel,
                        Not all the world gloried in war,
                        But love was still left in God's kingdom,
                        And mercy had not flown afar!
                    
                    
                        "Oh, give me that token, dear Martha!"
                        I thus to our nurse made request,
                        And touched a small lag onher boom;
                        She kissed me and softly caressed;
                        "This flag," she said, "is my
                            safe-guard,
                        But, Frida, I'll give it to you,
                        And charge you forever to cherish
                        The beautiful Red, White and Blue!"
                    
                    
                        I went to our cure with my token,
                        The suffering Father La Sage
                        Who had thrice been arraigned by the Germans,
                        And about to be shot in their rage;
                        I showed him my wonderful treasure,
                        This glorious flag of the free,
                        And said; "Oh, my teacher, my pastor,
                        How sweet is this emblem to me!
                    
                    
                        May I treasure this flag with my rosary,
                        Do you think 'twould be awfully wrong?"
                        And he patted my head while the tear-drops
                        O'erflowed from his eyes swift and strong;
                        Then the sweet-faced priest took the emblem,
                        And his eyes with weeping were red,
                        And he held it up gently before him;
                        "'Tis a blessed old flag!" he
                            said.
                    
                    
                    
                        "The stains that e'en redden this
                            banner
                        Were not wrung from tyranny's hold,
                        But came in the battle of freedom
                        From the blood of thy heroes bold;
                        And the white- it is purity's emblem,
                        The faith of the maid and the wife;
                        And the blue stands for truth and high honor,
                        More precious by far than our life!
                    
                    
                        "And the vision of stars in their beauty
                        Lift the mind from all sordid concerns
                        To the patriot's loftiest duty
                        Where the altar of country e'er burns;
                        There, there may he sacrifice truly
                        His life as a type of his Lord,
                        And e'en in the battle-shock duly
                        Ennoble the use of the sword!"
                    
                    
                        "Nay, daughter!" he further said
                            kindly,
                        "No wrong will it do to your soul,
                        If you love not in selfishness, blindly,
                        But deep in a heart pure and whole
                        The flag of this great western nation,
                        Which prefers much rather than strife,
                        The peace urged by Christ's inspiration
                        To save and not to take-life!"
                    
                
                
                
                    TO LIVE IN OUR FRUIT.
                    
                        There was once a cherry blossom,
                        >Blooming fair upon a tree;
                        It was just the prettiest posy

                        And just below it on the ground
                        >A Johnny-jump-up grew--
                        It had a yellow spot or two,
                        But all the rest was blue.
                    
                    
                        And little Johnny-jump-up says,
                        While tears his soft eyes lave:
                        "It will not be so very long,
                        They'll put me in my grave!"
                    
                    
                        The cherry blossom, pink and white,
                        Then smiled with visage rare,
                        And says: "I'll be a cherry soon,
                        All red-lipped, sweet and fair."
                    
                    
                        "And then I think, if die I must,
                        Such fate none may dispute,
                        How very grand and sweet 'twill be,
                        To live just in my fruit!"
                    
                
                
                    HUNGER.
                    
                        A biscuit and cup of cold water,
                        When hunger attendeth the meal,
                        Is better than turkey and cranberry sauce,
                        To theone whom no craving may feel.
                    
                
                
                
                    OH, WIND OF THE SUMMER'S SEA
                    
                        Oh, wind of the summer's sea;
                        The poets all rage about thee;
                        Their language is strong
                        Both in poem and song--
                        "Thy breath is the breath of the June,
                        From the groves of the orange and prune;
                        And the sun-kissed isles
                        Are cheered by thy smiles"--
                        And this is just part of their tune!
                    
                    
                        Oh, wind of the summer's sea,
                        A bit of advice I've for thee,
                        For now is the time
                        From yon sunnier clime,
                        To whisk o'er the mountain and bay,
                        Make haste from old ocean away,
                        And our glad hearts shall sing
                        Like a bluebird in spring,
                        When thou're come with thy zephyrs so gay!
                    
                    
                        Oh, wind of the summer's sea,
                        Let me bask in a huge slice of thee;
                        From the zone of the sun
                        Thy journey hast run;
                        And then I shall dream of the cave,
                        Where nightly thy blue waters rave,
                        And think me at ease
                        Neath the great flow'ring trees,
                        And blush while the mcrmaidens lave!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE OLD WOODS PASTURE
                    
                        Down in the old Woods Pasture,
                        Where the "crick" flows 'midst the
                            trees
                        Like a blade of shining silver
                        A-flashing in the breeze.
                    
                    
                        Where grow quaint old Sweet Williams,
                        Hid deep in wooded nook,
                        Lifting up their dainty petals
                        That God's children all may look.
                    
                    
                        And the lovely Johnny-jump-ups,
                        As skies above are blue,
                        And Buttercups all varnished up
                        With country air and dew.
                    
                    
                        'Tis here my precious youngsters,
                        As I sit ensconced in shade,
                        Will wander up and down the "crick"
                        Or in its waters wade.
                    
                    
                        There are folks who have ambition
                        To seek fame's wide renown;
                        Whilst others find their greatest joys
                        Cooped up in some old town.
                    
                    
                        But to me this life seems sweeter,
                        As I view it year by year,
                        To travel softly down the hill
                        With those I love so dear.
                    
                    
                        And bask in such old-fashioned scenes
                        Care free as birds that fly,
                        God's blessed, sweet, old Out-o'-Doors
                        Bound in by wood and sky!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE FALL O' THE YEAR.
                    
                        The Fall o' the Year has come back again,
                        And it's jest as delightful as't ever has been,
                        With the odors o' apples and must of the grape,
                        And the leaves all colored jest any old shape,
                        And plaintive Bob White whistles cheeriest when
                        The Fall o' the year has come back again!
                    
                    
                        The Fall o' the Year has come back again,
                        And I let down the bars o' the stubble field then,
                        And hie me away to the woods and the wold,
                        Where the trees are all purple, the weeds all of gold,
                        And somehow or other-jest how I can't tell--
                        I'm caught in the maze of a mystical spell,
                        And the breeze as it whispers in both o' my ears,
                        Brings back to me visions of far-away years;
                        And I'm happy and sad both together jest when,
                        The Fall o' the Year has come back again!
                    
                    
                        The Fall o' the Year has come back again,
                        And the weather jest sizzles no longer like sin;
                        And the trees in the distance are hazy and brown,
                        And the lazy, old cattle are standin' aroun';
                        And I love jest to bask in sich halcyon days,
                        And throw away trouble that on my soul weighs;
                        Ah, they tinge up the future with some sort o' hope,
                        Like seein' the scenes in a ka-leidoscope,
                        And I love all around me the tenderest when
                        The Fall o' the Year has come back again!
                    
                
                
                
                    YE MERRIE CANDIDATE
                    
                        I met ye gentel candidate--
                        Was for the house, he said;
                        His brow was wet with honest sweat
                        That trickled down his head.
                    
                    
                        "Ah, now," quoth I, "my merrie
                            man,
                        just tell me how you'll vote?"
                        When with a sigh he wank an eye
                        And 'gan to clear his throat.
                    
                    
                        "I run the Bangtown Sunday School,
                        And never have I yet
                        Heard mortal say in any way
                        It is a school that's wet"'!
                    
                    
                        "Ah, gentel one," quoth I again,
                        "You scarce have answered me;
                        Pray now declare, with no hot air,'
                        Your purpose full and free!"
                    
                    
                        "I never took in all my life
                        A drink of liquor, man,
                        The hated stuff, ain't that enough
                        To indicate my plan?"
                    
                    
                        But still I pressed ye gentel one
                        His purpose to disclose,
                        When with a skill that boded ill,
                        He went and blew his nose!
                    
                    
                    
                        "Confound it, sir, I needs must know
                        Your true intent to note;
                        Now please to say, nor aye nor nay,
                        just how you 'spedt to vote!"
                    
                    
                        At last, ye metric candidate--
                        I had him cornered dead--
                        And this I heard in falt'ring word:
                        "The platform, sir!" he said.
                    
                    
                        "The platform is the brewer's,
                            knave!"
                        I spake forth bold and strong,
                        "Please don't demur!" He answered,
                            "Sir!
                        I know that it is wrong!"
                    
                    
                        "You gentel, yet most wary dolt,
                        Is that your lay' at last?
                        You sing your song: I know'tis wrong,'
                        And yet, they've got you fast!"
                    
                    
                        >But spite of everything I'd say,
                        This humbel, modest man,
                        Or wrong or right, was wedded tight
                        Unto ye brewer's plan.
                    
                    
                        And then I said within my soul:
                        "How many can there be,
                        Who claim, forsooth, to love the truth,
                        And yet, will vote as he?"
                    
                
                
                
                    THE HAPPIEST HOUR
                    
                        "When should be one's happiest
                            hour?"
                        I asked the artless child,
                        Who played at will midst tree and flower
                        Where soft winds sported mild;
                        he said with merry heart and voice:
                        "In childhood's hour we most
                            rejoice!"
                    
                    
                        I asked it then the maiden fair
                        Who stood at womanhood's door;
                        And she replied in accents rare:
                        "Just married--ask no more!"
                    
                    
                        The stateman heard me ak it then,
                        And stopped 'midst wild applause,
                        To think it o'er and o'er again,
                        Then answered after pause:
                        "One's happiest hour, I think, should
                            come,
                        When vict'ry follows campaign drum!"
                    
                    
                        The old saint stood aloof and smiled
                        With glance so far away;
                        He saw in wondrous height up-piled
                        A city bright as day;
                        Beyond the clouds, beyond the sung
                        A heavenly life he saw begun,
                        And said in tones most deeply sweet,
                        Like far church bells with chime complete:
                        "My happiest day on earth shall be,
                        When I shall greet eternity!"
                    
                
                
                
                    A POEM BY JUNE.
                    
                        They say that Heaven is beautiful,
                        And I know it must be so;
                        For God never touched the lily fair
                        With its breast of the driven snow,
                        That He left one thing to be added
                        To make it with beauty aglow!
                    
                    
                        And the old earth, too is beautiful;
                        When I walked forth this forenoon,
                        With the sun and the sky and the blithesome birds,
                        I said: "This is a poem by June,
                        A nature festival on ev'ry hand
                        With its joyous life attune!"
                    
                    
                        I've no use for a gun or a dog,
                        Nor a fishhook either, my man;
                        When the earth is a-thrill with such gladsome joy,
                        Do you think I'd disturb their plan--
                        Send pain and wounds and suffering
                        Amidst this merrisome clan?
                    
                    
                        And I thought if never were sin or death,
                        No anguish, sorrow, nor woe;
                        No wolf at the door to bark and to snarl--
                        With my loved ones around me so!--
                        I could spend a small-sized eternity
                        On this old earth below!
                    
                
                
                
                    A PERTINENT QUERY
                    
                        A grumpy old owl was he,
                        And he sat on the limb of a tree,
                        And watched at the hole
                        Of a soft, fluffy mole,
                        He hoped he could eat him, you see!
                    
                    
                        He thought the mole was a rat,
                        And what are you thinking of that?
                        And he watched until morn
                        For the "rat" to return
                        To make his repast sure and pat!
                    
                    
                        And some of the children of men
                        Have scarce as much sense as a hen,
                        For they'll watch at the hole
                        Of a burrowing mole
                        And wait till he cometh again!
                    
                    
                        E'en some of such fellows betimes
                        Are a making of blustering rhymes,
                        And expecting to win
                        Both of glory and "tin,"
                        The plaudits of ages and climes!
                    
                    
                        And some are as far out of plumb
                        As the owl we've mentioned, by Gum!
                        And they'll never strike oil,
                        Though for ages they toil--
                        Perhaps, of this number we're some!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE LITTLE MINISTER.
                    
                        'Sir, we would see Jesus 1'-St. John's Gospel,
                            XII-21.
                    
                    
                        A sweet little minister came to our fold,
                        Perfum-ed and dainty was he;
                        His shirt was as white as the frost on the wold,
                        His clothes were all new, his jewels of gold--
                        One neater you seldom would see!
                    
                    
                        And he brought in his basket so cheery and light,
                        Sweet flowerets from many a field;
                        There were posies and rosies in endless delight,
                        In great blooming bunches like rainbows so bright,
                        No finer a garden could yield! 
                    
                    
                        But we were all hungry, so hungry were we,
                        And thirsty, oh, how can I tell,
                        For the bread that was promised to you and to me,
                        And the water of life to be given so free,
                        From a wonderful crystalline well!
                    
                    
                        And our dear little minister standeth afar,
                        He bath charge of this food from on high;
                        And he knows just how hungry we all of us are,
                        But he feeds us on blossoms though bright as a star,
                        When he knows we are ready to die!
                    
                    
                        Yes, we hunger and thirst, oh, shepherds of men--
                        The flowers are all good in their way,
                        But when people are starving and dying, ah, then,
                        Will you give them such trifles again and again,
                        This, this in our anuish we say!
                    
                
                
                
                    FROM OUR BROTHER'S VIEWPOINT.
                    
                        On a midnight Pullman sleeper,
                        The lamps burned dim and low,
                        While a man with a crying baby
                        Paced restless to and fro;
                        In vain he tried to soothe her,
                        This fretful, weeping child;
                        For she screamed and sobbed the louder
                        In her infant sorrow wild!
                    
                    
                        Then a great big Boston drummer,
                        With a voice like the roll of a drum,
                        Thrust his head from behind the curtains
                        And made things fairly hum:
                        "Here, you," he shouted fiercely,
                        "A fine man sure you seem,
                        just take that brat to mother,
                        And let us sleep and dream!"
                    
                    
                        Then the poor man stopped his pacing,
                        And said as he stood afar,
                        "Her mother is there in the coffin,
                        In the distant baggage car!"
                        Then that great big Boston drummer,
                        With a word on his lips like a prayer,
                        Rolled out of berth in his night dress,
                        And rushed to that infant's care!
                    
                    
                        And the other restless sleepers,
                        Who had heard what the poor man said,
                        They arose to yield assistance
                        To the child with its mother dead!
                        
                        Ah, sometimes how quickly it softens
                        Our fierce and implacable ire,
                        If we just could know from our brother's view
                        How it feels to be tested by fire!
                    
                    
                        When you feel like condemning your brother,
                        And you're saying he's this and
                            he's that,
                        just try going 'round there to see him
                        For a tender and heart-felt chat,
                        Yes, try to unravel the trouble
                        With a tender and Christ-like mind,
                        And then I am morally certain
                        It will stifle your strictures unkind!
                    
                
                
                    THE PATIENCE OF THE OLD
                    
                        The patience of the old--a blest completeness
                        That crowns the tide of years when ebbing mild
                        and low;
                        Unto life's latter years it gives a noiseless
                            sweetness,
                        Like slippered feet that travel soft and slow.
                        For all the ties of life that bind them here
                        Have weaker grown from fleeting year to year;
                        The hearing gone, the eyesight dim,
                        And trembling seen in hand and limb!
                    
                    
                        The patience of the old-'tis thus I reason:
                        Their grinding work in life is almost, almost done;
                        Their constant toil sustained through ev'ry
                            changing
                        season,
                        Their burdens borne in blinding rain and sun;
                        
                        And then there comes the gentle, healing calm
                        Of vict'ries nobly won--a precious balm
                        That soothes the chastened, ling'ring soul,
                        While life's remaining moments roll!
                    
                    
                        The patience of the old-ah, blessed token;
                        A life serene, at peace, it tells to me and you,
                        Of harvests gathered in, life's duties high,
                            unbroken,
                        And then the waiting for the last adieu.
                        God's peace is like a river deep, 'tis
                            said,
                        And they submerged from foot to silver head;
                        The soul made all in sweet accord,
                        This is the spirit of the Lord!
                    
                    
                        The patience of the old- me thinks the singing,
                        The angel voices of the loved ones gone before,
                        Borne on the misty tide of years they now hear ringing,
                        And note above the furnace blast and roar;
                        Entranced they sweetly listen as they stand,
                        As to a message from the golden strand;
                        These blessed accents of the past
                        They hear above the raging blastI
                    
                    
                        The patience of the old-oh, grant it heaven,
                        When earthly scenes grow dim my fading sight before,
                        To me may this contentment, e'en to meI be
                            given,
                        And may it go with me unto the farther shore;
                        Then down the jeweled aisles I'll walk
                            enraptured,
                        My new-found senses blest, my new heart captured,
                        And see at last. no clouds between,
                        All wondrous patience and all love serene 1
                    
                
                
                
                    THE ANGEL IN THE STONE.
                    
                        The world's greatest artist and sculptor,
                        Angelo, erstwhile of Rome,
                        Was one day passing some ruins
                        That chanced to be near his home.
                    
                    
                        He said to a friend who was with him,
                        For he seldom went forth alone;
                        "Behold here, this block of rough marble,
                        An angel is hid in this stone!"
                    
                    
                        He took then the stone to his workshop,
                        And with stroke of a genius so rare,
                        He gave to his city this angel--
                        Beautiful, shining and fair!
                    
                    
                        A crippled and sodden old stranger
                        Today passed in front of my door,
                        So ugly was he and so dirty,
                        So helpless and wretched and poor.
                    
                    
                        Then I said in my soul; This old stranger,
                        With such outwardly, uncouth frame,
                        Hath yet within him though dormant,
                        A spark of the heavenly flame.
                    
                    
                        And a word or a smile or a token
                        From the lips of a loving friend
                        May rouse into being an angel
                        To bless the sad world to its end!
                    
                    
                    
                        In the lives of the lost ones around us,
                        Though outward the form be grim,
                        God's beautiful, shining angels
                        We may find and lead them to Him!
                    
                    
                        Let us take e'en such to the workshop
                        Of a tender and loving heart,
                        With the mallet and faith and its chisel
                        We may quickly this new life impart!

                    Written June 21, 1909.
                
                
                
                    THE SNOWY OWL
                    
                        The snowy owl sat on a tree,
                        His feathers were ruffled and torn,
                        A bump on his head that was swollen and red
                        Made him feel very wretched and lorn.
                    
                    
                        He had come from the far, frozen north,
                        And feeling his worth in the land,
                        He had tested the skill of a fluttering mill
                        That a farmer had placed there to stand.
                    
                    
                        And a fan of said fluttering mill,
                        Took a smash at the head of the owl,
                        And hit him its best on the top of the crest,
                        And down went both feathers and fowl.
                    
                    
                        He lay quite a while in a trance,
                        Then arose with an unsmiling face,
                        And spluttered and croaked like a fellow half choked,
                        And sat down his misfortunes to trace.
                    
                    
                        "The white bear is cruel and cold I"
                        He said with a snap of his beak,
                        "But he beats half a mile this blamed thing that
                            will
                        smile,
                        And knock off your head ere you speak!"
                    
                    
                        Then I thought that the wail of Sir Owl
                        Had a moral we all could well take;
                        For how often do we travel country and sea
                        Life's better conditions to make.
                    
                    
                    
                        And find at the end of the race
                        The new thing we sought hard and far
                        Is a deal more unkind to our sensitive mind
                        Than the old thing we sought to debar!
                    
                
                
                    THE CRESTED HILLS
                    
                        "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills whence
                            cometh
                        my help."--Psalms CXXI-I..
                    
                    
                        Look up! look up! to the crested hills,
                        To the fortified hills on high,
                        Where the ordnance is placed and the cannon boom,
                        And the trained battalions lie;
                    
                    
                        Where the Captain standeth with glass in hand,
                        With his officers there beside,
                        All ready to launch, if the battle turn,
                        His troops like a mighty tide!
                    
                    
                        If you look to the hills with the eye of faith,
                        Though fighting so far below,
                        You may ever be sure though the battle rage,
                        It will never your strength o'erthrow!
                    
                    
                        For your Captain above, with glass in hand,
                        Well knowing each conflict and grief,
                        When he sees uplifted your. face to His,
                        Will send you an instant relief!
                    
                    
                        Oh, wonderful hills that are seen by faith,
                        Oh, wonderful Captain on high,
                        Though our lot may be cast in the valleys of earth,
                        We may ever know Thou art nigh!
                    
                
                
                
                    TILLUS RUFFIN.
                    
                        Tillus Ruffin's come to town,
                        You don't know Tillus? Hush!
                        He'll talk you up and talk you down,
                        And thrill your soul with gush;
                        And then to hear Till's hearty laugh,
                        And see him wink an eye,
                        I tell you those who hear him chaff
                        Don't stand around and sigh!
                    
                    
                        The other day, Till glanced around
                        And saw imprinted fair,
                        These very letters--I'll be bound!
                        "G. P. C." everywhere;
                        And Tillus read the message clear
                        That he should preach that day,
                        And hastened to an aged seer,
                        And this was heard to say:
                    
                    
                        "What meanin' have these letters bright
                        Which ever' whur I see;
                        I can't avoid 'em day or night,
                        They keep a hauntin' me;
                        The letters G. P. C.' I mean,
                        They must have this in store:
                        Go preach the Christ' it is, I ween,
                        And lift sin's burdens sore!"
                    
                    
                        The aged seer with visage bland
                        Did then to Tillus say:
                        "Don't think that such a calling grand
                        Is laid before your way;
                        
                        The letters 'G. P. C.' I'm sure, 
                        You see from night to morn,
                        Mean simply this and nothing more, 
                        Oh, Tillus, 'Go plow corn'!"
                    
                
                
                    THAT OLD-TME RELIGION.
                    
                        Some things, they make me smile, I guess they do,
                        jest to see how quare some folks air actin,,
                        'Bout this religion that they call the
                            "new",
                        And say that ever'thing's a fact in;
                        They want us jest to run and jump and whoop,
                        And leave the Rock o' Ages in a troop;
                        And if we don't they jist git mad and say:
                        "Yer narrer cause ye won't come this a
                            way;
                        And then ye haven't gone to college, nuther,
                        To learn things taught in Rockefeller's
                            school!"
                        But then we've stood beside a dear, old mother,
                        And heard o' Jesus and the Golden Rule;
                        And in my simple An pate, it's fur the best
                        To know jest whur our holy faith to rest,
                        Than go a troopin' round frbm good to bad,
                        A chasin' ev'ry tarnal, worthless fad!
                    
                    
                        Why, don't you know it's one blamed thing
                            ur 'nuther,
                        To cheat God's faithful few and steal their
                            crown;
                        The precious future hope to kill and smother,
                        And cause our sweetest trust in Christ to down?
                        But don't ye let 'ern ketch ye
                            nappin', brother,
                        jest anchor to the teachin' o' your
                            mother,
                        In God's good time-He'll not our prayers
                            deny!-
                        Ye'll see all clouds o' doubt go
                            rollin' by!
                    
                
                
                
                    'NOUR CHURCH.
                    
                        There's the awfullest crank you ever did see,
                        'Nour Church;
                        He never is happy no way it can be,
                        'Nour Church;
                        He growls at the preacher
                        And ev'ry "new feature",
                        'Nour Church!
                    
                    
                        Only once was he happy and glad
                        'Nour Church;
                        It was at the time when the "meetin' was
                            had,
                        'Nour Church;
                        When he and some people
                        Left the great, towering steeple,
                        And went to the jail
                        And strove to prevail,
                        To save a poor fellow or two
                        Who was lost and wretched and "blue";
                        Then he said 'twas sweeter and richer,
                            completer,
                        'Nour Church!
                    
                    
                        The rarest of songs of the sweet, vested choir,
                        'Nour Church,
                        Make him no better and lift him no higher,
                        'Nour Church,
                        But to save a lost soul from the gath'ring
                            gloom,
                        That gives to his soul a mighty, big boom,
                        'Nour Church;
                        He says it is better to do,
                        By preacher and men in the pew,
                        Than throwing bouquets at the rich,
                        And pand'ring to self love and sich,
                        Nour Church!
                    
                
                
                
                    A WELCOME TO OLD GLORY.
                    
                        I stood by thle bay of Naples
                        'Yond th' Atlantic's raging
                            tide
                        As the sun rose o'er the city
                        From the waves on the eastern side;
                    
                    
                        From off the masts and the rigging
                        Of the craft that lay in the bay,
                        The early beams of the morning
                        Flung weird shadows far away.
                    
                    
                        I noted from countless nations
                        The banners of kingly pride
                        Shake forth theirlaunting colors
                        To the breezes far and wide.
                    
                    
                        I stood there a total stranger,
                        Nor friend nor kindred near,
                        And none with whom to parley
                        In the speech I hold so dear.
                    
                    
                        I saw far down the harbor
                        A white-painted warship ride,
                        Coming in from the realms of Neptune
                        A-crest of the rippling tide;
                    
                    
                        And as she passed by the fortress
                        I heard then the great cannon boom,
                        To welcome this peerless stranger,
                        And bid the ships all to make room!
                    
                    
                        And as she drew near and nearer,
                        From her masthead tall and high,
                        She let loose a silken banner--
                        Stars of gold in an azure sky!
                    
                    
                    
                        And oh, what a flood of glory
                        Surged over my homesick soul
                        When I saw the old flag flying,
                        And its stars and stripes unroll!
                    
                    
                        And I thought of that matchless nation
                        Beyond the waves of the sea,
                        My country, my own loved country,
                        I shall ever sing of thee I
                    
                    
                        In fancy I saw her cities,
                        Her billowy fields of grain;
                        The wonderful, cloud-touching mountain,
                        The prairie-land and plain;
                    
                    
                        Then I thought of the deeds of her heroes,
                        Of her love of the right and truth;
                        Her laws and her schools and her freedom,
                        And the happy days of my youth!i
                    
                    
                        And I wept and yelled like a madman
                        And danced all over the quay,
                        just to see that old flag flying,
                        And to feel what it meant to me!
                    
                    
                        The people all 'round me jabbered,
                        Some laughed and some of them jeered,
                        But I pointed up to "Old Glory",
                        And stood in their midst and cheered!
                    
                    
                        And if they could have known the reason
                        I shouted and wept like mad,
                        And threw up my hat to "Old Glory",
                        Their dull hearts, too, had been glad!
                    
                    
                    
                        Oh, Flag of thle Free, forever,
                        The stains that e'en redden thy fold,
                        Are not the stains of oppression,
                        But the blood of thy heroes bold;
                    
                    
                        And the blue of that peerless banner
                        Stands for honor and home and truth,
                        And the white for the faith of thy women,
                        And the spotless names of thy youth!
                    
                
                
                    A PUCKERY PERSIMMON.
                    
                        I wandered in the woodland
                        When the autumn trees were bare,
                        And saw a green persimmon
                        Before me lying there.
                    
                    
                        I quickly seized the tempting fruit,
                        And placed it on my tongue,
                        Then swallowed down the tempting pulp,
                        When Gosh! what change was wrung!
                    
                    
                        For now in truth, one eye looks up,
                        The other glanceth down;
                        My erstwhile placid features
                        Disclose a constant frown!
                    
                    
                        This mouth of mine, Apollo's mouth,
                        Behold, what change is here?
                        For lo, 'tis drawn so far around,
                        I whisper in mine ear!
                    
                
                
                
                    SWEETEST THOUGHTS OF JESUS.
                    
                        When in the midnight watches,
                        When day's bright chariots roll,
                        The sweetest thoughts of Jesus
                        Come stealing o'er my soul;
                        They lead me down the ages
                        By storm-tossed Galilee,
                        And I see Time's greatest Teacher,
                        As he walks beside the sea!
                    
                    
                        I see the throngs before him
                        Hang breathless on his word,
                        For never truths so golden
                        Before on earth were heard;
                        I see the world's dark sorrows
                        Flee from before his face,
                        And sodden, sin-cursed people
                        Are healed and saved by grace!
                    
                    
                        I note each step in Jewry,
                        When steadfast was his face
                        To suffer there for human kind,
                        Nor seek a safer place;
                        Each thing He did and all He said
                        Is brought before my view,
                        That I may always know just how
                        To suffer and be true!
                    
                    
                        Oh, wondrous, Living Presence
                        Forever by my side,
                        I love Thy precious promise:
                        "With Thee I'll e'er abide,
                        
                        And to Thy fond remembrance
                        These things I'll bring again,
                        How Christ has wroght and suffered
                        To redeem the race of men!"
                    
                    
                        Oh, blest and Holy Spirit,
                        Though dark waves 'round me roll,
                        I feel Thine inward presence
                        In the deep recess of soul,
                        And ever I am ready
                        Earth's treasures down to lay,
                        For just this sweet abiding
                        Forever and a day!
                    
                
                
                    MR. BRYAN'S DRINK.
                    
                        Some folks are makin' fun o' Billy
                            Bryan,
                        Grape juice, they say, is fur too mild for them;
                        They want it hot to set their brains a-fryin',
                        It must jest burn and sizle to the rim;
                    
                    
                        They want to cuss and swear and fairly raise the Devil,
                        And spend their nights in orgies mad with rum;
                        To pass away God's golden years in evil,
                        Nor help to make His precious "Kingdom
                            Come!"
                    
                    
                        To such as them, o' course, it stands to reason,
                        They'd have contempt fur Billy's mild,
                            sweet drink;
                        They can't commend it in nor out of season,
                        They want a draught that makes 'em snap and
                            wink!
                    
                    
                        Yes, Billy's modest ways are awful tame and
                            homely,
                        The gait he goes is common-place, we own,
                        And they could no more 'preciate this statesman
                            comely,
                        Than skunks could 'preciate a bottle o'
                            Cologne!
                    
                
                
                
                    YE OWL AND SPARROW.
                    
                        "Dost know me?" quoth ye sparrow
                        To ye wilde-eyed, hungry owl;
                        "Just wait a bit, my blithesome bird!"
                        Replied ye ugly fowl.
                    
                    
                        Then down beside his owlship lone,
                        On slender twig at hande,
                        Ye verdant, little, sparrow birde
                        Took roost at his command.
                    
                    
                        And there he rested sweetly till
                        Ye western landescape o'er,
                        Ye shades of night had settled down,
                        Ye birde could see no more.
                    
                    
                        And then ye ugly bubo fierce,
                        With chuckle in his throat,
                        just swallowed down ye littel birde,
                        And seemed to laugh and gloat!
                    
                    
                        And later, on sequestered stump,
                        Ye houre was still and lone,
                        He cough-ed up with scarce a retch,
                        Some feathers, skin and bone!
                    
                    
                        And there 'tis seen unto this day
                        All white and bleached and spare,
                        A monument to verdancie,
                        It preacheth sermons there!
                    
                    
                        Ilk man and mother's son take heed,
                        And daughters, too, attend,
                        Sometimes an evil habit comes
                        Your future good to end;
                    
                    
                    
                        And will you then, oh, wayward youth,
                        Despite of all I say,
                        just place yourself within its power,
                        Nor try to run away?
                    
                    
                        Ah, if you do, this much I'll say--
                        My heart is all a thumpl--
                        Such fate may come to you some day
                        Like that upon ye stumpe!
                    
                
                
                    THE HEAVENLY SEAL.
                    
                        The lamp on the cottage table
                        Burns with low, uncertain ray,
                        And the children, sadly weeping,
                        Throng the bed where mother lay;
                    
                    
                        But that mother passed from earth's scenes
                        In the night-tide dark and drear,
                        And she left her huddled darlings
                        Wrapped in sadness, crushed with fear!
                    
                    
                        But the gracious, heavenly Father,
                        Whether noon or night or morn,
                        Tempers e'er the cruel windblast,
                        Just to suit the lamb that's shorn;
                    
                    
                        So the Father, in His kindness,
                        Dropped a smile, a heavenly seal,
                        On those wan and wasted features
                        For the daylight to reveal.
                    
                    
                        And those children, on the morrow,
                        When they looked upon her face,
                        Caught a vision of the glory
                        Of her new, abiding place!
                    
                
                
                
                    FAITH'S SWEETEST ARGUMENT.
                    
                        "For whether in mid sea, or among the breakers of the
                        farther shore, a wreck must mark at last the end of each
                        and all. And every life, no matter if its every hour is
                        rich with love, and every moment jeweled with a joy,
                        will, at its close, become a tragedy as sad and deep and
                        dark as can be woven of the warp and woof of mystery
                        And death! --Ingersoll.
                    
                    
                        I know not whence my being came, nor distance short
                        or far;
                        Nor whence this spark of life derived, from earth or
                        utmost star;
                        But this know, I know full well, that days before I
                        came
                        God had my early coming known and had foretold the
                        same!
                    
                    
                        And when I dropped down to the earth from hidden nest
                        above,
                        God had prepared an help for me-had given a
                            mother's
                        love;
                        And though I was for many months an infant weak and
                        prone,
                        A surer source of helpfulness I never yet have known I
                    
                    
                        And may I not, His servant, hope in His great name
                        that when
                        This fitful life shall pass away that He will once again
                        Observe with care my going forth, my course and bearing
                        take,
                        And on some distant, golden shore for me a welcome
                        make?
                    
                    
                    
                        And if He shall for me prepare on far-off, shining
                            strand,
                        A haven 'gainst the storms of death when sails are
                            furled
                        to land,
                        And make such warmth of welcome wait, like nest of
                        gentle dove,
                        Such tender welcome as was found in mother's
                            perfect
                        love,
                        I shall not then, oh, Doubter, quail nor dread the awful
                        roar,
                        Of breakers dashing high above when I shall near the
                        shore;
                        Igor shall I fear that there will be a wreckage of my
                            craft,
                        When such, Thy loving, tender care, surrounds me fore
                        and aft!
                    
                
                
                    JOHN MORLEY.
                    
                        John Morley lived and living, wrought in vain,
                        And fell and rose and fell and rose again;
                    
                    
                        And cried toward heaven in his baffled woe:
                        "Oh, let me win ere I'm compelled to go!"
                    
                    
                        He thought his time had come, could almost feel
                        The helplessness of age upon him steal!
                    
                    
                        And yet, the Powers above, with grace benign,
                        Had watched is course, observed his phrensy fine;
                    
                    
                        When failure had his ev'ry stroke surpassed,
                        They dropped the crown of sweet success at last,
                    
                    
                        And said: "Both time and fate are in our hands above,
                        And happiness we give away to him whom we may love,
                    
                    
                        And for thy noble striving against unnumbered odds,
                        We give to thee a ripe, old age and favor with the Gods!"
                    
                
                
                
                    ONLY TWO BY FOUR.
                    
                        Only Two by Four was about his size,
                        And he moved in a narrow sphere;
                        No startling vision bedazled his eyes,
                        And naught that he did would the world surprise,
                        He cut but a small figure here!
                    
                    
                        But then, all the same, in an earnest way,
                        Whate'er he did was right and clean;
                        He traveled along from day unto day,
                        With a heart to love and a soul to pray,
                        And he sang from morn till e'en!
                    
                    
                        When at last to his journey's end he came,
                        The end we must meet or false or true,
                        There came not the crowd that worships a name,
                        There was heard no trumpet "that sings of
                            fame",
                        Neither drums that beat a tattoo!
                    
                    
                        And the meagre few that followed his bier,
                        A crawling slow through the village street,
                        Were some humble folk who in love sincere
                        Had been blessed by his life and his deeds of cheer,
                        And his smile ever beaming and sweet!
                    
                    
                        But in vision I stood at the Golden Gate,
                        And behold, Two by Four drew nigh,
                        And all heaven awoke with a joy elate,
                        And smote on their harps at a wonderful rate,
                        I had sworn a great man came by!
                    
                
                
                
                    GOT TO FLOP.
                    
                        "We've got to flop" Tom says, says he;
                        "We've got to flop" Tom says to me,
                        "This temprunce cause gains rapid-leel"
                    
                    
                        "We've got to flop!" I says, says I;
                        "I wisht you'd please to specify;
                        What temprunce cause?" I says, says I;
                        "I guess you'll have to amplify!"
                    
                    
                        "What temprunce cause, you donkey grey?
                        Jest see it grow from day to day,
                        And then ask me in foolish way,
                        The meaning' that my words convey!"
                    
                    
                        "It's captured cities by the score;
                        It's gobbled counties, yes, and more,
                        It's got the congress one to four,
                        We've got to climb the wagon, shore!"
                    
                    
                        And then Tom goes and talks a spell:
                        "I guess you've got to give'em-well!
                        They must obey the law, nor sell
                        A drop of booze on Sunday, Bell!"
                    
                    
                        Ah, well, the light is shinin' through
                        The clouds that once obscured our view;
                        And if these folks do change their cue,
                        We'll welcome them with fervor, too!
                    
                
                
                
                    "OLD NATCHRAL SELECTION."
                    
                        'Way back in the dim, dusty ages so grey,
                        Ten trillions or more I am told,
                        There was nothing and nothing and nothing for aye;
                        Nor darkness nor heating nor cold;
                        Nor upward nor downward nor inward nor out;
                        Nor sickness nor sorrow nor sin,
                        just how Nothing came to bring Something about,
                        With never a kinfolk nor kin,
                        To tell I can only begin!
                    
                    
                        Old Natchal Selection, he happened about,
                        He came not from heaven nor hell;
                        He just came from Nowhere within or without,
                        And he stationed himself in a cell;
                        But it seems he could think pretty fairly just then,
                        And he liked not his bearings at all,
                        His food it was nothing it ought to have been,
                        It made his old appetite pall,
                        And his clothing was thin in the fall!
                    
                    
                        And then he began!i and he wriggled around
                        (He had neither mate nor a wife!)
                        He started a Something somewhere, I'll be bound,
                        And soon it was seen to be life!
                        He kept e'er a thinking and scheming along
                        While the cycles went by with a throb,
                        Till he just made us men with our soul thirst and song,
                        But he didn't then throw up his job,
                        He didn't relinquish his job!
                    
                    
                    
                        We don't need a God nor a Savior to save,
                        And there's no such a folly as sin;
                        Old Natchral Selection, the cunning, old knave,
                        Has made and can make us again;

                        "Oh, what is truth, I pray?"

                        Unto that distant day!
                    
                    
                        And still the battle goeth on,
                        Like storms this April weather,
                        The struggle of the warmth and sun,
                        And wintry winds together;
                    
                    
                        And as, at last, the summer's smile,
                        So calm, so sweet, so cheering,
                        Will loosen chains of snow and ice,

                        The distant ages filling,

                        poem entitled "The House by the Side of the Road".)
                    
                    
                        Should we live, as you say, "by the side of the
                            road,"
                        And be "but a friend to man,"
                        We hardly should follow the worthiest line,
                        Or live by the princeliest plan;
                        For to tread in the paths of the sweetest of lives
                        That ever this old world trod,
                        We rather should choose, than the plaudits of man,
                        To merit the plaudits of God!
                    
                    
                        And to live by the side of the road alone,
                        And be "but a friend to man,"
                        Is too dull and too slow in this work-a-day world
                        To show forth the loftiest plan;
                        For sometimes the one who would do the most good,
                        And would bless and brighten the race,
                        Receives but the hatred and scorn of the world,
                        Nor honor nor treasure nor place!
                    
                    
                        My friend, the hist'ry and lives of the past
                        From Jesus to humble John Brown,
                        Will show when the world takes a higher plane,
                        Some martyr has laid his life down;
                        It has taken the toil and the sweat and the blood
                        That the best of our kind may give,
                        To lift from the ditch this stubborn race
                        That the Christ life within may live!
                    
                    
                    
                        The picture you paint is too easy I fear
                        To show forth the noblest in men;
                        'Tis a struggle, a battle, a sacrifice, too,
                        Not to "smile" at the door of your
                            "den";
                        Truth's suffering army of bold pioneers
                        Have marched down the steeps of the past;
                        They have conquered diseases and cannibal lust,
                        Discovered new lands so vast,
                        But they had more to do in the ages' swirl
                        Than to live at their ease and plan,
                        How the days should go by in "the house by the
                            road",
                        While being a "friend to man"!
                    
                
                
                    ERROR.
                    
                        Error clothed in robes resplendant,
                        Often sits on golden throne,
                        And like Herod asks for worship,
                        Honor due to God alone.
                    
                    
                        As with Herod, so with Error,
                        At the climax of its reign,
                        When it claims the highest vantage,
                        When its boast is loud and vain,
                    
                    
                        Then the Truth, like daylight shining,
                        Pierces through its tinsel guise,
                        Shows its flesh corrupt and rotten
                        Only fit for worms and flies!
                    
                
                
                
                    "JOHNY SELDOM"
                    
                        I feel like writing poetry
                        Concerning brother, John,
                        And I hope you'll 'xcuse the effort.
                    
                    
                        "Johny Seldom" was the name
                        We gave him long ago,
                        just for fun, you know.
                    
                    
                        John's had his ups and downs
                        They're mostly downs--in life.
                    
                    
                        I remember when he lost his darling child,
                        His precious Dorothy
                        She was the apple of his eye;
                        His honest soul was buried deep
                        In love for her.
                        It almost broke my heart
                        To see him struggle with a grief so poignant
                        In his simple-hearted way!
                    
                    
                        But after all the jolts and blows,
                        The disadvantages of life and birth,
                        For such an awkward colt,
                        He's come out most surprising!
                    
                    
                        Faithful in church and Sunday school,
                        And at the bedside of the sick
                        He can't be beat!
                    
                    
                        I think of Him who said:
                        "As ye have done to these,
                        The least of these, my brethren,
                        So have ye done to me!"
                    
                    
                    
                        I used to feel chagrined
                        When Johny, in the old debates,
                        Would talk about the "Poke o' Rome";
                        I don't know what he thought was Pope,
                        Or who!
                    
                    
                        But I've got over that a long ago.
                        I look beyond mistakes in words,
                        And see the honest, home-spun soul behind,
                        Big of heart, faithful and true,
                        But awkward!
                    
                    
                        God bless you, "Johny Seldom"!
                    
                
                
                    MRS. D. A. BREWER.
                    
                        Out of the shadows and gloom of the night,
                        Up to the glorious, glorious light,
                        Where the shadows dissolve, and the day star is bright,
                        Weary-foot wanderer, thou didst well come!
                    
                    
                        Now as a child with a sweet blossom fair,
                        Climbs to the light up a dark, winding stair,
                        Leaving a breath of the perfume so rare,
                        Happy-heart journeyer, thou hast gone home!
                    
                    
                        And though thou are gone thou has left in thy train
                        The odors of lilies from gardens in Spain
                        Where old Moorish fountains splash softly amain,
                        So nobly and well hast thou done!
                    
                    
                        And when it shall be that our struggle is o'er,
                        And we take our brief trip to that time-hidden shore,
                        The light thou hast left us will go on before,
                        Till all of our journey is run!
                    
                
                
                
                    POPE PIUS THE TENTH.
                    
                        The golden bowl is broken,
                        And the sands of life are run;
                        He sank beneath the burden
                        Of a life-work nobly done;
                        But just before life's fastenings broke,
                        With glance of christian seer,
                        He notes those mighty armies
                        That on the plains appear;
                        In vision sees the carnage
                        And hears the shrieks of pain
                        As flames of rage inhuman
                        Engulf the vast termain;
                        He sees the rivers redden
                        As they flash beneath the sun;
                        Disease and death now fatten
                        Where had rugged life begun;
                        And that old-time demon, Famine,
                        Comes stalking on behind,
                        And thus the hopes of all his years
                        Are blasted in his kind;
                        And all the gentle teachings
                        Of the humble Nazarene
                        Forgotten in the rage and lust
                        That thrills the awful scene;
                        And as he stands and weeps and prays,
                        Mad carnage sweeping o'er
                        Those lovely scenes in early life
                        Oft visited before,
                        His great and loving heart then breaks
                        With sorrow deep and wild
                        Such awful deeds of frightfulness
                        He left--unreconciled!
                    
                
                
                
                    A MOONSHINE MEDITATION.
                    
                        The moon I saw on yesternight
                        A shining crescent clear and bright,
                        Above the steeples shone;
                        The wan stars hid their twinkling light,
                        As'round its beams were thrown!
                    
                    
                        And just behind the shining rim,
                        Moving along so faint and dim,
                        A pale round disc was seen
                        Amidst the fleecy clouds to swim,
                        The shadow and the sheen!
                    
                    
                        'Tis sunshine makes the crescent glow,
                        But earth's soft light the disc must show,
                        Or else 'twere darkness there;
                        Oh, how the dull world here below
                        From thence must shine most fair!
                    
                    
                        And so may I, unfit to shine
                        Where dwell the great in mansions fine,
                        Yet on some darkened soul,
                        My feeble rays many may fall benign,
                        And heal like sacred stole!
                    
                    
                        And to that one whose life they bless,
                        And soothe with love's sincere caress,
                        Though I of modest rate,
                        Such lowly deeds shall shine no less,
                        Than were I rich or great!
                    
                
                
                
                    MY SAVIOR'S LOVE.
                    
                        There are some problems, brother,
                        That I cannot fully solve,
                        Some very vexing questions
                        That the critics may evolve,
                        But I'm just content to lay them
                        At my Savior's blessed feet;
                        I'm out and out for Jesus,
                        Oh, His wondrous love's so sweet!
                    
                    
                        To have His love around me
                        And below like downy nest;
                        To have His love above me
                        Like a warm and pulsing breast;
                        To walk His green and flowery earth,
                        To breathe His blessed air,
                        And then to know "I cannot drift
                        Beyond his love and care!"
                    
                    
                        O, no grisly death can scare me,
                        Of the grave I'm not afraid;
                        No life can be a failure
                        With my Savior as an aid,
                        But groweth ever sweeter, 
                        As I press my journey on,
                        Through rifted clouds His city
                        Shines brighter than the sun!
                    
                    
                        I'm just wrapped up in Jesus,
                        Each piece of armor's on;
                        He's big enough and grand enough,
                        My battle will be won,
                        
                        And nothing e'er shall come between,
                        Oh, Christ, my love and Thee,
                        Or the present or the future
                        Is just to live with Thee!
                    
                
                
                    THE HERO OF MY VERSE.
                    
                        Some years ago, a donkey tried
                        An artist rare to be;
                        He had the bristles for the brush,
                        Enough of industry and push,
                        He had an eye and shapes and shades could see!
                    
                    
                        But then, but then, the donkey failed;
                        Must I confess, alas!
                        In outward circumstance he led,
                        But had not that inside his head,
                        That makes an artist differ from an ass!
                    
                    
                        How often do we see to-day,
                        A donkey pushed along;
                        We see his name in public press,
                        We note his form in varied dress,
                        We hear the awful burden of his song!
                    
                    
                        My wife, she cometh from the stair,
                        She would not me asperse;
                        She does not know what's written here,
                        And this she says without a fear:
                        "Don't make yourself the hero of your
                            verse!"
                    
                
                
                
                    "DISCHARGED!"
                    
                        "Now Misther, yer honor", the sheriff then
                            said,
                        "We caught 'um full-handed, indeed, sir, we
                            ded;
                        He'd stholen a ham, 'twas a foine, joocy
                            mate,
                        And had taken it home fur his fambly to ate,
                        And ther-re was they all, jist a atein' and
                            fryin,,
                        His wife and the childer that's sittin' and
                            cryin'!"
                    
                    
                        The magistrate then from his bench good and tall,
                        Looked down on the culprit, his family and all;
                        Adjusted his glasses most carefully, too,
                        To bring the whole bunch of them closer to view;
                        "And what is the charge, Mr. Sheriff, please
                            answer!"
                        "'Tis the sthalin' of mate from
                            the home of John Hant,
                        sir!"
                    
                    
                        "They seem to be poor", said the magistrate
                            then,
                        And he thought of the days of his boyhood and when
                        In a humble, log cabin with little to eat,
                        His father and mother had struggled to meet
                        The needs and the. wants of a family so growing,
                        While the bleak winds of winter around them were
                        blowing!
                    
                    
                        "Did you steal?" he asked in a voice soft
                            and low,
                        "And why did you steal? I just want to
                            know?"
                        The poor wretch shrank from the glance of the court,
                        Then laughed in his face as if in great. sport.
                        "Send me up!Send me up! If you want to, yer
                            honor;
                        I knew all the time I was surely a goner!
                    
                    
                    
                        But you see!" coming close to the
                            magistrate's view,
                        "That's my wife an' my
                            chil'ern air sittWd there, too;
                        They were hungry, oh, Jedge, jist as chil'ern kin
                            be,
                        An' I hadn't a thing fur to give
                            'em, you see,
                        So I stole'em some meat jist to keep 'em
                            from dyin',
                        I jist couldn't stan' so to hear
                            'em a cryin'!"
                    
                    
                        An' Jedge, it may be, I'm a criminal,
                            too,
                        But I'd rather a darned sight, I want to tell
                            you,
                        Be punished like sin fur a crime or a wrong,
                        Than to have my sweet darlin's a sufferin'
                            long
                        Fur the want of a wee bit of food in the larder,
                        Now punish me, Jede, all the quicker and
                            harder!"
                    
                    
                        The judge ran his fingers bestudded with gold
                        Through the hair that encircled his forehead so bold,
                        And then through the past with his memory's
                            goad,
                        He stirred up the deeds that he'd done on the
                            road,
                        And said in his heart and said it quite sadly:
                        "We every blamed one have at times acted badly;
                    
                    
                        The difference'twixt me and this ignorant lout,
                        Is just that the poor cuss is simply found out;
                        If I had my full due as sure as dull fate,
                        I'd be breaking of rock in the hands of the state
                            P'
                        And then to the criminal he said in low tone:
                        "Your wrong, sir, the commonwealth must not
                            condoned
                        To punish a crime the statutes adjure it,
                        But mercy is given as one way to cure it I"
                    
                    
                        Then seizing a pen with a handwrite enlarged,
                        He wrote on his docket this legend:
                            "Discharged!"
                    
                
                
                
                    THEY ARE ALL FORGOTTEN.
                    
                        "I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions, for mine
                        own sake, and will not remember thy sins."--Isaiah
                        LXIII-25.
                    
                    
                        I care not, oh, my Savior
                        For the crown of shining gold,
                        Nor the harp with strings a thousand
                        Such as David had of old;
                    
                    
                        But oh, to feel within me
                        As I pace the shining strand,
                        Thou hast my sins forgotten
                        When before Thy throne I stand.
                    
                    
                        I've done some deeds, oh, Master,
                        In thoughtless days of youth,
                        So wicked and so heartless
                        'Gainst Thee and 'gainst Thy truth;
                    
                    
                        And sometimes in the darkness
                        When I'wake from startled sleep,
                        The specters of those by-gone years
                        Into my mem'ry creep!
                    
                    
                        And if I stood before Thee,
                        With Thy mind so clear and bright,
                        And felt that Thou wert thinking,
                        Of my past, nor clear nor white,
                    
                    
                        I fear my faith would fail me,
                        I might try to steal away,
                        Out from Thee, Thy throne so fair,
                        And that land of endless day!
                    
                    
                    
                        But oh, Thy precious promise:
                        "I'll remember them no more
                        Throughout the endless ages
                        That shall break on heaven's fait
                            shore!"
                    
                    
                        There may be some, O, Savior,
                        Not half so bad as I,
                        just give to them my crown and harp,
                        When I shall reach the sky;
                    
                    
                        But for me that precious promise
                        Will harp and crown replace,
                        just let me sing in modest nook:
                        "A sinner saved by grace!"
                    
                
                
                    IT BECAME WUSS.
                    
                        Doolins were happy
                        Or Doolins were sad,
                        He never complained that the weather was bad,
                        But always said
                        With a pleasant grin,
                        "It mout be wuss than 'tever hes
                            been!"
                        And he was right!
                    
                    
                        But one day Doolins
                        Contracted a boil
                        On the end of his nose in the midst of his toil;
                        He couldn't be cheerful,
                        No more could he grin,
                        And he said: "This is wuss than 't ever hes
                            been,
                        A blamed sight!"
                    
                
                
                
                    TO HARD TACK.
                    
                        (This brief poem is respectfully dedicated to Uncle
                        Eb Harbert, of Johnson county, Indiana, who for many
                        years, was a correspondent of the Franklin Democrat.
                        He possessed such a boundless enthusiasm and such
                        vivid imagination as a writer, that, had he received the
                        advantages of an early education, he would have un-
                        doubtedly made an impression on the literary world for
                        years to come. He died a short time ago full of years and
                        beloved by all who knew him.)
                    
                    
                        There's no great style about ye,
                        Nor skill in rhyme nor sich;
                        You'd hardly know a measure
                        From a. couplet or distich;
                    
                    
                        And when it comes to countin' feet,
                        It's jest as like as not
                        You'd go to work and put in ten,
                        When six would fill the lot;
                    
                    
                        But you're not dull in story,
                        Nor in fancy are you slow;
                        You can beat the hull creation
                        In a rale, poetic glow;
                    
                    
                        And it's a fact, I tell ye,
                        That you've sung some putty songs,
                        In kind of boundin', nat'ral verse,
                        That to Eb alone belongs!
                    
                    
                        I've sometimes wished that I could sing
                        With such a zeal unbounded;
                        'Twould tide me safe o'er all the
                            chunks
                        By which I am surrounded;
                    
                    
                    
                        I'd leap the rails that fence me in,
                        Float wide in fancy's sea,
                        And wouldn't we go a merry clip, 
                        Old Hard Tack, you and me!
                    
                    Written February 6, 1910.
                
                
                    MY SOUL.
                    
                        I think at time of future ages,
                        Of the aeons yet to be;
                        Is this mind, like God, immortal,
                        Doomed to live eternally;
                        Lasting through the mighty cycles
                        That shall never cease to roll;
                        Always will there be two beings
                        God, at least, and this--my soul?
                    
                
                
                    THE FLOWERS.
                    
                        There are bunches of blossoms 'way out in the
                            field
                        That are smelling far sweeter than clover;
                        And Old Bob goes out when his trappings are peeled,
                        And throws up his head and kicks up his heels,
                        And rolls himself over and over.
                    
                    
                        And his coat that had smelled of the labor and pain,
                        Smells sweet as the gardens before us,
                        And I wonder if Bob can see it as plain
                        As he drags out his days in a wearysome chain,
                        That He sendeth His flowers to restore us!
                    
                
                
                
                    A LESSON IN FAITH.
                    
                        I rise from a peaceful slumber
                        At the dawn of this autumn day,
                        And gaze at the eastern skyline
                        Where the morn makes her bright display.
                    
                    
                        I think of the summer departed,
                        With its sheen and glory of sun;
                        Then again, of the earlier autumn,
                        With its leaves of purple and dun.
                    
                    
                        Now, have we this mail of grey frost work,
                        Then winter comes silvery white,
                        As an old age weak and decrepit,
                        The end, it would seem, is in sight!
                    
                    
                        And yet, no ending e'er cometh,
                        No death of the year do we see,
                        For what we may think the last tussle,
                        Is anew life in bud and in tree.
                    
                    
                        The beautiful new resurrection,
                        The springtime as bride comes to earth,
                        And our hearts are filled with the gladness
                        Till we shout and sing in our mirth!
                    
                    
                        Oh, this lesson of faith sweetly given,
                        Stealing in at the dawning of day,
                        So tenders my heart to my Father,
                        That I just kneel down here and pray;
                    
                    
                        And I thank Him with eyes overflowing--
                        Such love to the children of men!--
                        From the winter of death he will give us
                        A beautiful springtime again!
                    
                
                
                
                    
                        ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
                        The first part- of the following story-poem was sug- gested to the author
                            by hearing Comrades David S. and George M. Whitenack, who were captured
                            during the civil war, and confined in Andersonville Prison, tell of
                            their experience in, and escape from, this loathsome pen. They both now
                            reside in Greenwood, Indiana.
                        The story-poem departs, to some extent, from the nar- rative they gave,
                            but not more, perhaps, than the rules of fiction and of verse allow.
                        The second part of the story-poem was suggested by hearing the venerable
                            Dr. P. W. Payne, of Franklin, Indiana, tell of his experience in passing
                            a mob late one night engaged in hanging some poor wretch. His prayer,
                            "Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul l" made such an im-
                            pression on the doctor, then a young man, that for weeks and weeks it
                            rang through his ears constantly. There was no rescue, however, in the
                            instance the doctor described.

                        A Memorial Day Story-Poem in Two Chaptes.
                        
                            CHAPTER I.
                            
                                From Anderson's foul prison pen
                                Brave Robert White came home again;
                            
                            
                                Some months had he, a captive there,
                                Been forced to eat the loathsome fare;
                            
                            
                                Been forced to drink the water bad;
                                In storm and rain no shelter had;
                            
                            
                            
                                No voice of woman ever heard,
                                No mirthful laugh, no loving word;
                            
                            
                                No child's sweet call, no hearty cheer,
                                No pleasant sound to bless the ear.
                            
                            
                                And as he sat upon the bank
                                Of that foul stream whose waters stank
                            
                            
                                With offal from the Rebel camp,
                                And shivered in the evening's damp,
                            
                            
                                He thought of loved ones far away
                                Where Kankakee's mild waters lay--
                            
                            
                                His babies he had left at home
                                When came his country's call to roam,
                            
                            
                                His wife so patient and so true--
                                Ah, how their forms uprose to view!
                            
                            
                                He sat and brooded day and night
                                And prayed and wept his bitter plight;
                            
                            
                                His heart grew sore and sorer still,
                                Nor did new hope the morrow fill;
                            
                            
                                His comrades died around like sheep,
                                With dying men death watch to keep;
                            
                            
                                The dead alone found rest and peace,
                                The living prayed for such release!
                            
                            
                                At last there came to Bobby White,
                                A firm resolve one stormy night;
                            
                            
                            
                                With all the fire and pent-up force
                                Of home-sick soul came this recourse,
                            
                            
                                That filled his utmost mental space:
                                To die or leave the loathsome place!
                            
                            
                                And he that night, in silence deep, 
                                No stars above a watch to keep,
                            
                            
                                No light for guard on rude stockade
                                To watch the rapid ditch he made,
                            
                            
                                With half a canteen digging deep,
                                He threw the soft lam in a heap,
                            
                            
                                And made beneath that Rebel fence
                                A tunnel scant and fled he thence;
                            
                            
                                The night of twenty-ninth of May
                                In sixty-three, White ran away!
                            
                            
                                For hours he fled through storm and gale
                                The bloodhounds ever on his trail;
                            
                            
                                But dark morass and swamp and rain
                                Betrayed brute instince and its train
                            
                            
                                Of fiercer ones than hound or cur
                                Were made in tracking him to err;
                            
                            
                                He hid in cypress swamp by day,
                                And on each night went on his way;
                            
                            
                                For three long nights with naught to eat,
                                He traveled north with bleeding feet.
                            
                            
                            
                                At last, emergeing from a wood,
                                He came where lonely cabin stood;
                            
                            
                                The smoke uprolling wheel on wheel,
                                Gave promise of the morning meal.
                            
                            
                                He feared it was a friendless host,
                                And dodged around from tree to post,
                            
                            
                                Until he saw a negress stand
                                And shield her face with swarthy hand,
                            
                            
                                And peer adown the narrow way
                                That stretched out north and far away,
                            
                            
                                Then turned away from opened door,
                                And disappear within once more.
                            
                            
                                And did his eyes no sooner trace
                                The features of that lowly race,
                            
                            
                                Than did his heart with hope beat high,
                                He felt that kindly friends were nigh.
                            
                            
                                He knocked upon that humble door,
                                'Twas opned by a negress poor,
                            
                            
                                A dusky child upon her arm; 
                                She said "cone in!" from out the storm,
                            
                            
                                And Bobby scarce more live than dead,
                                Just "tumbled in" he often said;
                            
                            
                                Here food was had and shelter free,
                                And nursing, care and sympathy!
                            
                            
                            
                                A week passed by, Bob starts once more,
                                And as he stands beside the door,
                            
                            
                                About to quit the humble place,
                                He tells the "mammie" face to face:
                            
                            
                                "If ever you should chance to come
                                Within the range of my dear home,
                            
                            
                                Though once a slave with skin so black,
                                You never shall kind treatment lack;
                            
                            
                                I'll ever be a friend to you,
                                And you will find this promise true!"
                            
                            
                                And then old "mammie" sweetly said:
                                "Yo' is a man de Lawd has led

                                His name is Sambo, Sambo Clo';
                            
                            
                                He went up no'th somewhah I know,

                                And then Bob promised good and tight,
                                That ne'er should come too dark a night,
                            
                            
                                Nor should such storms besiege the skies
                                That he would not in joy arise
                            
                            
                                And help that boy at midnight hour
                                By every deed within his power!
                            
                        
                        
                            CHAPTER II
                            
                                Some thirty years have passed away,
                                And Bobby White is grizzled, grey.
                            
                            
                                One night he went unto the town
                                All by himself a driving down;
                            
                            
                                Again 'tis twenty-ninth of May,
                                To-morrow's Decoration Day.
                            
                            
                                He stayed too late, perhaps, at most,
                                Some pressing business at the Post.
                            
                            
                                He heard the boys, in random way,
                                Discuss the news that very day;
                            
                            
                                Told of a negro in the jail,
                                An awful creature without fail,
                            
                            
                                Who'd just been seized by arm of law,
                                For crime that held the town in awe;
                            
                            
                                "And I'm afraid, it's what they
                                    say,
                                That he'll stretch hemp ere dawns the day!"
                            
                            
                            
                                But Bobby gave no though he
                                To what the gossips said, indeed,
                            
                            
                                And late that night went on his way
                                Unto his home, his spirits gay.
                            
                            
                                He lived two miles away from town
                                On gentle hillside sloping down;
                            
                            
                                But Bobby scarce had passed the line
                                That did the village space confine,
                            
                            
                                Than came he on a midnight crowd.
                                "They're bent on mischief!" he
                                    allowed;
                            
                            
                                To straggler there beside the way,
                                He then made haste to softly say:
                            
                            
                                "What means this throng so late at night?"
                                "Oh, them?" says he, "Why,
                                    they're all right!
                            
                            
                                They're out to hang a 'nigger'
                                    there;
                                You just keep still, you'll hear his
                                    prayer!"
                            
                            
                                And then upon the night air still,
                                Such awful tones, they made Bob chill,
                            
                            
                                These words from out the mob then stole:
                                "Oh, Lawd, hab mussy on mah soul!"
                            
                            
                                "What's his name?" asked Bobby
                                    then,
                                "The 'nig' that's
                                    prayin' 'mong the men?"
                            
                            
                                "His name," the man vouched-safe once more,
                                "His name is Sambo, Sambo Clore!"
                            
                            
                            
                                And when Bob heard that name gone o'er
                                He had not heard in years before,
                            
                            
                                His heart stood still with scarce a thump,
                                And then began to fiercely pump.
                            
                            
                                A vision comes from far southlands,
                                A lonely hut before him stands,
                            
                            
                                Before his eyes as once it stood,
                                A little house hard by the wood,
                            
                            
                                And old black "mammie" at the door,
                                He sees as once he saw before,
                            
                            
                                And hears himself in earnest way,
                                Make faithful promise, come what may,
                            
                            
                                That he would do a certain thing
                                Should ever ripe occasion bring;
                            
                            
                                And now her son in deep distress
                                Is in the hands of lawlessness,
                            
                            
                                And he had vowed a night too drear
                                Should never come for him to hear,
                            
                            
                                And hasten to the lad's relief--
                                The time had come, likewise the grief!
                            
                            
                                He leaped from out his buggy then,
                                And with the force of twenty men
                            
                            
                                He hurled around him, left and right,
                                These dark marauders of the night,
                            
                            
                            
                                Until beside their victim stood,
                                Tore loose the noose, snatched off the hood,
                            
                            
                                And said in tones no fear could awe:
                                "When did you men become the law?"
                            
                            
                                The prisoner saw that he was free,
                                And like a deer began to flee,
                            
                            
                                While Bobby, like a lion at bay,
                                Stood 'twixt the mob and fleeing prey!
                            
                            
                                They paused a moment in their rage
                                To see who dared with them engage;
                            
                            
                                They saw before them but one man,
                                And then as one upon him ran!
                            
                            
                                (The sure inducement mobs may know
                                Is helplessness in prey or foe!)
                            
                            
                                And fell upon him fist and scull,
                                And beat and hammered to the full!
                            
                            
                                Next day when Bobby lay in bed
                                With plasters on his broken head,
                            
                            
                                He heard his folks in room nearby,
                                Say that a man confessed the lie
                            
                            
                                That had been told the day before
                                That almost caused the death of Clore!
                            
                            
                                And that, although an awful scrape,
                                The negro had made good escape;
                            
                            
                            
                                And Bobby's eyes then filled with tears,
                                His mind went back for thirty years;
                            
                            
                                He sees himself, no friend around,
                                And chased by cruel foe and hound,
                            
                            
                                Till finding lonely cabin door,
                                He seeks such shelter, mean and poor,
                            
                            
                                And friend a friend with with kindly heart,
                                Who does for him a mother's part--
                            
                            
                                A dusky face and kinky hair,
                                A kindly face, if not so fair!
                            
                            
                                He thought of what a debt was due
                                This negro mother leal and true!
                            
                            
                                And then his heart leaped high with joy--
                                He'd paid the debt, he'd saved her boy!
                            
                            
                                He saw in glass upon the wall
                                His wounded head and face and all;
                            
                            
                                The woulds that pain had given before,
                                Now joy and peace and comfort bore.
                            
                            
                                "Thank God!" he said, "I'm
                                    happy now,
                                I've made all good that old-time vow,
                            
                            
                                And 'mammie,' for your kindness when
                                I sore was chased by evil men,
                            
                            
                                You saved my life and sent me home,
                                No more from loving hearts to roam,
                            
                            
                            
                                I've saved your boy and set him free,
                                Though't cost me pain and misery!"
                            
                            
                                That day White marched in no parade
                                Where muffled drums are softly played,
                            
                            
                                And grizzled "vets" string out afar
                                In faded panoply of war,
                            
                            
                                And keep the step and mark the pace
                                As if before great Sherman's face,
                            
                            
                                Whom they in memory can see
                                Through all the passing years so free,
                            
                            
                                Or march before reviewing stand
                                And see in mind their Lincoln grand,
                            
                            
                                As in the days of sixty-five
                                With he their Captain still alive;
                            
                            
                                Or feel in marching down the lane
                                Like noble Grant reviewed again;
                            
                            
                                Nor marched he where creped banners wave,
                                And flowers are strewn on many a grave,
                            
                            
                                Where sleep his fellowmen at arms,
                                Disturbed no more by war's alarms;
                            
                            
                                Nor elbows touched with living ones,
                                Who hobbled forth with flags and guns!
                            
                            
                                But though upon his bed he lay,
                                He kept good faith with soldier's day,
                            
                            
                            
                                That day, by memory sweetly blest,
                                Wherein we walk with those at rest,
                            
                            
                                And homely, old-time music falls
                                Adown the past's long intervals!
                            
                            
                                Though he, indeed, on lonely grave
                                No flowers bestrewed that incense gave,
                            
                            
                                There's holier'scent, there's sweeter
                                    breath
                                Than flowers may give in life or death,
                            
                            
                                That lifts the soul above the clod,
                                And reaches to the soul of God,
                            
                            
                                And joins with Seraphs' voices there,
                                And blesses man like answered prayer--
                            
                            
                                No powers' perfume may this exceed:
                                The perfume of a noble deed!
                            
                        
                    
                
                
                    THE TROUBLE WITH JOHNY.
                    
                        John's sich a little feller--
                        'Bout as big as I;
                        Johny's hair is sandy yeller,
                        And his laff is soft an' meller,
                        When he happens by;
                        But Johny's got the huppin' cough,
                        Mamma says 'twill be all off--
                        Run with him again, I'll die!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE WORDS OF LINCOLN.
                    I love the name of Lincoln,
                    His hist'ry, deeds and life;
                    I love to note the storm-beat course
                    He took in that great strife;
                    But sweeter far than all to me,
                    Like inspiration given,
                    His quaintand homely ut'rances,
                    They soothe like strains from heaven!
                    "God loved the common people"!
                    He once was heard to say,
                    "He made so many of them"
                    It seemed to him that way.
                    "The people always 'wobble'
                        right,"
                    Again he did declare,
                    n times of doubt and nation's gloom
                    This seems response to prayer!
                    "And all the people you may
                        fool,"
                    This once was what he said,
                    "A part the time, a little while,
                    A few until they're dead,
                    "But you can't fool all the
                        people
                    The whole enduring time,
                    For by and by they wiser grow!"
                    This saying is sublime!
                    Oh, homely prophet of our race,
                    Thy words akin to prayer,
                    Go down the swiftly passing years
                    In benediction rare! 
                
                
                
                    THE ONLY SINNER.
                    
                        I belong to the church on the corner,
                        Where the two great thoroughfares meet;
                        Where the big pipe organ pulses
                        With the music's lull and beat;
                        Where the people in silks and satins
                        jostle and press in a throng;
                        But I am the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                    
                        And the pastor there in the pulpit,
                        As he looks down the satined aisles,
                        Sees only the rich and the worldly,
                        And there he bestows his smiles;
                        He loves not the poor and the humble,
                        But worships the great. right or wrong,
                        And I am the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                    
                        They favor this new-flung preaching,
                        The idol and creed of the hour;
                        I stand by the old-time gospel,
                        To be preached in the Spirit's power;
                        They are seeking to follow each vag'rie
                        And fad that may wander along,
                        And I am the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                    
                        There are some who are short in virtue;
                        >There are some that are proud and cold;
                        There are some who are joined to their idols,
                        >As Ephraim was of old;
                        
                        There are some who to get the dollar
                        Will do to their neighbor wrong;
                        Still, I am the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                    
                        And what is my sin and my sinning,
                        And what is this wrong they deplore?
                        It is this: I believe in the Bible,
                        And, further, am old and poor;
                        They treat me with scorn, they despise me,
                        As I press down the aisles along,
                        For I am the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                    
                        And I think as I glance down the ages
                        Of the Savior we worship today,
                        Who suffered to save a lost kingdom,
                        And restore who had wandered away;
                        Who never had done a vile action,
                        >Who never had uttered a wrong,
                        And he was the only sinner
                        In a church some millions strong!
                    
                    
                        The thief said, gazing upon him:
                        "We suffer for what we have done,
                        >But this just man here between us,
                        No evil bath wrought'neath the sun!"
                        Then, upheld by my Savior's example,
                        My heart bursts forth into song,
                        To be thus the only sinner
                        In a church six hundred strong!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE BOOKWORM'S BELIEF.
                    
                        The scientist sat in his study,
                        And his brow was wrinkled with thought;
                        His mind was decidedly muddy,
                        And his soul with a burden fraught;
                    
                    
                        He thought of the world and its features
                        Of races of men and of bugs;
                        And noted some very strange creatures
                        That modern philosophy hugs;
                    
                    
                        For it now insists in believing
                        That the world and its living folk,
                        Came about by a constant conceiving
                        Of a substance thinner than smoke.
                    
                    
                        This nothing beginning gestation--
                        The result is so strange to tell!
                        I mention with much hesitation--
                        >It at last brought forth a Cell.
                    
                    
                        And this Cell in wonderful motion,
                        New Cells began to throw out,
                        Till the world was--such is the notion!--
                        In the progress of time brought about!
                    
                    
                        The rocs were all held in solution,
                        And laid down a film in an age;
                        And man in this time of confusion,
                        Was nowhere, thus reasoned the sage!
                    
                    
                        In all the vastness around us
                        He findeth no traces of Him
                        Whose kindness and love e'er surround us,
                        From the center 'way out to the rim!
                    
                    
                    
                        This rude and implacable muddle,
                        With no life nor feeling nor thought,
                        Was thus by a marvelous huddle
                        Into system and sympathy wrought!
                    
                    
                        And this is the dream of the Bookworm:
                        That chaos so dead and inert,
                        Was pregnant by whom I'm to yet learn,
                        Bringing forth then the quick and alert!
                    
                    
                        Ah, well, as for me, let me rather
                        Believe in a great and wise God,
                        Than my poor, little cranium bother
                        Embracing a notion so odd!
                    
                
                
                    TWO WORTHIES QUARREL.
                    
                        Said Old Quid pro Quo
                        To Old Nonc pro Tunc:
                        "You are much of a fraud,
                        And all of a skunk;
                        You never, siree, face the music quite,
                        But slip into place like a thief in the night!"
                    
                    
                        "Oh, that's just all right,"
                        Replied Nunc pro Tunc,
                        "You may call me a fraud,
                        You may call me a skunk;
                        But when I slip in, it is I, by Joe,
                        But when you get caught you are Quid pro Quo!"
                    
                
                
                
                    THE MILLIONAIRES' CHURCH.
                    
                        They tell me there's a church along the coast,
                        To which, alas I but millionaires belong;
                        And when a poor man comes to join their host,
                        They say to him at once: "You're seeking
                            wrong
                        Your bank account is too entirely low,
                        The house in which you live too small;
                        You may not hope our merry clip to go,
                        You must not think to trot with us at all!"
                    
                    
                        Once there was a man became persistent,
                        And knocked with force upon that gilded door,
                        And more and more he grew insistent,
                        It made no odds to him if he were poor.
                        And then the deacons told him go and pray,
                        "Perhaps, the Lord a message will impart,
                        And then you'll know to do a better way,
                        And seek a field from such as us apart!"
                    
                    
                        And so he went but soon came back once more;
                        "Hast thou a message from the Lord?" they
                            said.
                        And then he told them he had prayed it o'er
                        With this suggestion from the Fountain Head:
                        "My son, don't get discouraged but be
                            bold!"
                        Unto this man the Lord did kindly say:
                        "For I myself to get into that fold
                        Have tried and failed for lo, 'tis many a
                            day!"
                    
                    
                        This o'er true tale may this suggestion yield:
                        Don't make your churches quite so prank and fie,
                        With gilded nave and rug and painted shield,
                        And with the rich and satin-gowned to shine;
                        
                        For if it all becomes so spic and span
                        There is no room for honest-handed poor,
                        You may turn thence the lowly Son of Man,
                        He may, Himself, be driven from your door!
                    
                
                
                    THE DEFEAT.
                    
                        We never may know, oh, our Father,
                        As we travel earth's wearisome ways,
                        How the rod and the rack and the scaffold
                        May become sweetest angels of praise;
                    
                    
                        Nor how through our wonderful Captain,
                        From the harrowing gloom of defeat,
                        Are lighted the beacons of glory
                        That shine down the ages completed
                    
                    
                        Had we stood on the brow of old Calv'ry,
                        And witnessed its awful despair,
                        We had gone to our homes in the darkness
                        With neither a hope nor a prayer!
                    
                    
                        But out from the gloom of that mountain,
                        Where the nails in our hearts leave their prints,
                        God has given the boon of salvation,
                        Truth's rallying point ever since
                    
                    
                        Let us trust then this Captain of Ages,
                        just the deed he requireth of me,
                        The results he most surely will garner
                        When the earth is no more nor the sea!
                    
                
                
                
                    IF THERE BE NO CHRIST.
                    
                        My friend, you say there is no Christ;
                        You say the sciences reveal
                        Unto the world this fact!
                        Why do I turn my back?
                        That I may conceal the tears
                        That fill these dim, old eyes!
                    
                    
                        Long years ago, my precious son
                        Dropped from the ranks of men;
                        If there be no Christ, ah, then,
                        I never more his blessed face shall see
                        >Nor shall he call in tender tones to me
                        Across the wide abyss of weary years,
                        If there be no Christ, my friend,
                        If there be no Christ!
                    
                    
                        And then, my patient wife, for forty years
                        Walked by my stumbling side,
                        Until one day they said she died;
                        And as she went away, of Christ she sang--
                        Oh, those old songs so sweetly rang
                        From her dear, old faithful lips!
                        She went to Christ in joy she said,
                        But if there be no Christ she's dead,
                        If there be no Christ, my friend,
                        If there be no Christ!
                    
                    
                        If there be no Christ, no Christ!
                        Then what is left for me,
                        So old and weak and scare can see?
                        No hope, no life, no resurrection day;
                        No stores in heaven, where never may
                        
                        The thief break through nor steal;
                        Nor shall I hear the sounding peal
                        Of God's triumphant host!
                        Oh, the labor that I've lost,
                        No crown to follow cross,
                        If there be no Christ, my friend,
                        If there be no Christ!
                    
                    
                        I fondly hoped upon some happy shore
                        I'd meet my loved ones, where forevermore,
                        We'd dwell together in the crystal light,
                        Nor ever dread a coming night,
                        Nor shudder when the winds blew cold
                        >Across the field so bleak and bold!
                        Ofttimes I'd glance where white and still
                        I saw the graves my darlings fill;
                        I chuckled with a faith made bold:
                        "They're not out in all that
                            cold!"
                        And oh, the thought was sweet, you know,
                        But then, of course, it isn't so;
                        If there be no Christ, my friend,
                        If there be no Christ!
                    
                
                
                    ASSURANCE.
                    
                        >This is achievement the sweetest
                        That mortal may learn or may know;
                        The richest and, aye, the completest
                        Of successes we gain here below:
                        To stand with Truth's perfect Assurance
                        When the ending may come, of our durance!
                    
                
                
                
                    MY JEANIE AND I.
                    
                        My Jeanie and I, in the gloaming,
                        Go strolling out through the town;
                        She is four and she looks like a fairy
                        In her bright red cap and gown.
                    
                    
                        The bulldog that growls in the alley,
                        The donkey that brays in the yard,
                        The rumpled-horn cow cannot frighten,
                        For papa is near her to guard;
                    
                    
                        The engine, whistling shrilly,
                        The motor car, thundering past,
                        These monsters cannot appal her,
                        Papa's hand's holding hers fast!
                    
                    
                        And ever she thinks, this adoring
                        Wee one, with her confident eyes,
                        That I towering up there beside her,
                        All-powerful am, and all-wise!
                    
                    
                        Some day she'll discover, my darling,
                        This papa so wise and so strong,
                        Is only a mortal, a weakling,
                        And more prone than herself to go wrong!
                    
                    
                        And I ask in my soul this question:
                        Will she love me then as today,
                        When she learns that babyhood's idol
                        Has, alas for me! feet of clay?
                    
                    
                    
                        And I almost wish I were able
                        So to slacken Time's eagle-like flight,
                        That I to my Jeanie might always
                        Be great as she thinks me tonight!
                    
                
                
                    THE LIBERTY BOND AND THE BOY SCOUT.
                    
                        The Liberty Bond and the bold boy scout,
                        Have you taken the pains to reason 'em out?
                        The one is the life and the wonderful youth
                        Of a nation that stands for the God-given truth;
                        The other the sinews that truth to uphold,
                        And is typified best in the glittering gold;
                        These two put together all foes may defy
                        That may gather or march'neath the azurine sky:
                        The life and the manhood from near and from far,
                        And the wealth that e'en giveth the "sinews of
                            war"!
                    
                    
                        I, too, have a boy who wandered away
                        When first our great nation had joined in the fray;
                        His scout hat and blouse are still around home,
                        But his ship is now plowing the storm-beaten foam;
                        Out in the darkness and gloom of the night,
                        It may be to die for the glorious right!
                    
                    
                        I can hear him again in his confident way
                        As he said "Good-bye!" to his mother that day;
                        I can see him again as I toss in my dreams,
                        The sweet baby-boy, so near it all seems,
                        And my soul grows sick like a man far from home
                        For a sight of my boy on. the storm-beaten foam,
                        And I pray with a heart softly tender and fond:
                        "God bless the Boy Scout and the Liberty Bond!"
                    
                
                
                
                    THE PHILOSOPHY OF DEFEAT.
                    
                        I have lain in the dust with the vanquished,
                        When my banner went down in despair;
                        And I thought in my woe
                        That I never might know
                        The day of Success, oh, how fair!
                    
                    
                        And yet when the sun of the morrow
                        Came forth with his comforting light,
                        With a new-kindled zeal,
                        And a heart brave and leal,
                        I went forth again to the fight!
                    
                    
                        The world cannot judge of my motive,
                        Nor love me when thus I have failed,
                        But, behold, there's an Eye
                        That can see how I try,
                        And knows that I never have quailed!
                    
                    
                        And I think of that glorious heaven,
                        And of Him sitting high on its throne,
                        Who will chide not at all,
                        If we rise or we fall,
                        So long as right purpose is shown!
                    
                    
                        Oh, I shall never lie down in the shadow,
                        Nor crawl in the gloom of defeat,
                        For the promise is sure,
                        I shall ever endure,
                        And shall thus with the vict'ry meet!
                    
                
                
                
                    A SURPRISING DISCOVERY.
                    
                        My dear, little girl, in an artless way,
                        Was combing my hair one happy day;
                        Now I am her papa, as you should know,
                        And plump onmy head is beginning to show,
                        A smooth, round spot as bald as a knob-
                        I keep it concealed, though 'tis much of a job,
                        By combing my hair in a proper way
                        And thus appear younger by many a day!
                    
                    
                        But my dear, little lass, with comb and brush
                        Discovered the sot, then there came a hush
                        In her artless talk-her very eyes
                        Were fixed on the spot in complete surprise,
                        Now, still are the comb and the brush in her hands,
                        For this strange thing seen her mind commands;
                        At last, she cries in my very ear:
                        "Oh, papa, papa, look here, come here!"
                    
                
                
                    JUST A PLAIN ONE.
                    
                        When you know a marts a donkey,
                        Will you go and say he's wise?
                        When you know a town is "flunkey"
                        Will you praise it to the skies?
                        When you know a woman's homely,
                        Will you say her looks inspire?
                        If you will, why, you are only
                        just a plain and common liar!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE TWENTY-THIRD PSALM.
                    
                        The Lord my gracious shepherd is,
                        No want shall e'er I know;
                        >For He shall make me down to lie,
                        In green and fruitful pastures by
                        The quiet water's flow!
                    
                    
                        My soul He buildeth up once more
                        That was cast down by sin;
                        And into paths of righteousness
                        For his name's sake, my soul to bless,
                        He leads His servant in!
                    
                    
                        And though I pace with stumbling step
                        The valley dark and drear,
                        Where shades of death around me cling,
                        Since Thou art nigh, I'll shout and sing,
                        No evil will I fear!
                    
                    
                        Thy rod and staff, they comfort me,
                        >They give my soul great joy;
                        >I feast me, Lord, on viands rare,
                        >At Thy great table, such Thy care,
                        Nor shall my foes annoy!
                    
                    
                        Upon my head thine oil is poured;
                        My full cup runneth o'er;
                        Thy loving kindness shall endure--
                        Thy goodness to my soul is sure,
                        Till life shall be no more!
                    
                    
                    
                        And since through all my jorney here
                        Thy mercy shall abide,
                        I'll run with haste to make my home,
                        In Thy loved house, nor longer roam, 
                        And there fore'er reside!
                    
                
                
                    A PROBLEM IN HEREDITY.
                    
                        Lily White is a kitten as white as the snow;
                        Smutty Black is a kitten as black as a crow;
                        Their papa is brindle,
                        Their mamma maltese ;
                        Now, how could such parents
                        Have children like these?
                        No mortal could answer a question so hard,
                        But these cats and their kittens are now in our yard!
                    
                
                
                    TOIL.
                    
                        No rest can be sweet without labor--
                        "No, no, toil's a demon," you
                            say;
                        But 'tis he alone that can sweeten
                        Repose at the end of the day!
                    
                
                
                    CONTRAST.
                    
                        The sunshine is never so comely
                        As when shining just after a storm,
                        Nor shelter from danger so precious
                        As when we are snatched from great harm!
                    
                
                
                
                    THE DREAMS OF LONG AGO.
                    
                        I sit me here beneath a tree,
                        Where soft winds idly blow,
                        And dreams of youth return to me,
                        The dreams of long ago;
                        These scenes around me'waken
                        Such thoughts I cannot tell,
                        And back my soul is taken
                        By memory's magic spell!
                    
                    
                        I cannot tell how sweet to me
                        These visions that are given;
                        I only know again I see
                        Loved faces long in heaven;
                        And with those faces beaming fair
                        Once more I'm young and strong,
                        And mother with her silver hair
                        I see among the throng!
                    
                    
                        Oh, could I tell how sweet, how clear
                        These dreams from far off time
                        Again in mental sight appear
                        How you would love my rhyme!
                    
                
                
                    THE RARE, OLD ARTIST.
                    
                        The sun is the rarest of artists,
                        And a painter of views very fine,
                        He limns with the hues of the rainbow,
                        And touches with shimmer and shine;
                    
                    
                    
                        He builds you great castles, cathedrals,
                        Of diamonds and gold, if you will,
                        The loftiest, sky-reaching mountain,
                        The loveliest, crystaline hill.
                    
                    
                        He don't need to have a foundation,
                        He builds them, oh, ever so high,
                        >So wide and so massive in structure,
                        And he hangs them right there in the sky!
                    
                    
                        He don't need a paint brush or palette,
                        Or tablets of colors so fine;
                        But kisses each tower when he makes it,
                        And you just ought to see how 'twill shine!
                    
                    
                        I should love just to own such a castle
                        As I witnessed one evening last June;
                        It was wonderful, 'way beyond telling,
                        More beautiful far than the moon
                    
                    
                        For the moon, she can only wear silver;
                        My castle, 'twas purple and gold,
                        And diamonds and blazing red rubies,
                        And jewels of richness untold!
                    
                    
                        And I told Uncle Ned as I stood there,
                        And drank in the ravishing scene,
                        I should like some day in the future,
                        To own such a priceless demesne!
                    
                    
                        And Uncle Ned said to me: "May be,--
                        We're told of a land fair to view,
                        Where mansions are built for good children,
                        May be one is there building for you!"
                    
                
                
                
                    STAYIN' IN A FLAT.
                    
                        They's some folks think they're livin'
                        When they're stayin' in a
                            flat,
                        With the walls all frescoed purty,
                        An' the closets clean and pat;
                    
                    
                        >An' the floors air 'iled an'
                            shinin',
                        An' they's water in the sink,
                        An' if you'd turn some garbage in,
                        It wouldn't make a stink!
                    
                    
                        Where you never have to climb the stairs,
                        Jist take the elevator,
                        Nor have to hoe the garden truck,
                        Nor dig a sweet pertater!
                    
                    
                        Where you do your fishin' every day,
                        But not in lake or brook,
                        An' ketch the finest lot of fish
                        With jist a silver hook!
                    
                    
                        Where you have a landlord pokin' round,
                        With stately step an' slow,
                        An' if you have a child or two,
                        Like's not you've got to go!
                    
                    
                        No "Stromboli" or
                            "Richelieu"
                        Has any charms for me,
                        For I love God's sweet, old country,
                        And I want to feel I'm free!
                    
                    
                        I love to see the settin' sun
                        That paints in radiant gold
                        The evening clouds so beautiful
                        As tents of night unfold!
                    
                    
                    
                        I love to walk in summer eves
                        Qaint rural ways along,
                        And hear in far-off, distant field
                        The plowman's homeward song!
                    
                    
                        Oh, I'd rather live'way down the lane,
                        Where woods surround the scene,
                        Than in some tidy, high-toned flat
                        With blistering streets between!
                    
                
                
                    THE DOCTOR AND THE DENTIST.
                    
                        The doctor was a wealthy man,
                        His business was prodigious;
                        He served the Devil fifty years,
                        And then became religious;
                        He asked the dentist 'bout his
                            soul,
                        And he replied in accents droll:
                    
                    
                        "I'm thirty now", he said and
                            grinned,
                        "I've twenty yet to play on,
                        I'll drink and swear as you have done,
                        Then this new role I'll lay on;
                        I'll go to church and shout and sing,
                        And gain a crown and angel wing!"
                    
                    
                        The doctor shuddered then and said:
                        "The past comes up to haunt me;
                        When e'er I seek to do good deeds,
                        'Tis thus they ever flaunt me
                        The Devil builds a damning station
                        Of our past lives against salvation!"
                    
                
                THE END.
