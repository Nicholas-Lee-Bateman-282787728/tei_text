            The Indiana Central Medical College, 1849-1852
            George B. Manhart∗
            
            The Indiana Asbury University, which in 1884 became DePauw University, was established in 
                        Greencastle
                    , Indiana, in 1837. Its original charter authorized its Joint Board of Trustees and
                        Visitors1 to appoint such professors and instructors as might be necessary
                    to offer proper instruction "in the learned professions" as well as in the arts
                    and sciences.2 It was naturally impossible to start a complete university
                    program at once. A start was made with an "ABC," or primary, school in the spring
                    of 1837, followed by a preparatory department in the fall of that year; and by the year 1839-1840 a
                    four-year college program was in operation. During this same academic year the Trustees appointed a
                    committee to inquire into the expediency of establishing a "professorship of
                        law."3 In 1847 the Trustees started preparations for an
                    "Agricultural Professorship" and had an agent at work collecting money for the
                    purchase of a farm.4 But the first professional school to be actually set up by
                    Indiana Asbury was the Indiana Central Medical College in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .

            It was indeed high time to give attention to medical education in Indiana. The Old Northwest had a
                    reputation as a land of cholera, ague, malaria, and numerous fevers.5 An
                    "enormous amount of quack medicines" was consumed through the "credulous
                    confidence of our physic-loving people," said Dr. John S. Bobbs in 1849;6 and most of these concoctions, commented his contemporary, Dr. Robert Curran, were compounds
                    of cheap whiskey with dirty molasses covering the taste of the drugs, "generally the refuse
                    and sweepings of old warehouses."7 Some of the doctors were pure
                    quacks, with no training whatever. The majority had undergone apprentice training which Professor
                    Buley describes: "A young man ‘read medicine’ with some local doctor,
                    rolled his pills, mixed his powders, and took care of the horses. After a time he was ready to
                    doctor on his own."8 In addition, there were some who had supplemented
                    their apprenticeship with a term or two in one of the few medical schools available.9 At best, physicians were not well trained, and one book on frontier medical practices is
                    dedicated "to the Pioneer Doctor who boldly faced the wilderness; and to the Pioneer who
                    boldly faced the Doctor."10
            
            Attempts to improve medical training were being made gradually in Indiana as well as in other
                    midwestern areas. A Medical Society of the State of Indiana, with ill-defined power to regulate
                    admission to the profession, was provided for by law in 1819 and reorganized in 1825.11 Supplementing eastern medical publications, which had little circulation in the
                    Midwest, a Western Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences began publication
                    in 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1827 and was followed the next year by The Transylvania Journal of

                        Vincennes
                    , Indiana, entitled The Sick Man's Companion, or the Preserver of
                        Health, treating all diseases common to this country, by Dr. C. Vanhook.13
            
            There had been no medical school in English-speaking America until 1765, when one had been
                    established in connection with the institution which later became the University of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    .14 The first one west of the Alleghenies was the Medical Department
                    planned in 1799 and set up in 1819 at Transylvania University in 
                        Kentucky
                    .15 Within a year the Medical College of 
                        Ohio
                     was functioning in 
                        Cincinnati
                    . In 1837 the 
                        Louisville
                     Medical Institute began operation.16 Indiana temporarily caught up
                    with the procession when the 
                        Vincennes
                     University, which had been authorized to have a "Professor of Physic"
                    in 1806, set up a course of eight medical lectureships to run from December, 1837, to March, 1838.
                    Apparently this offering was discontinued after the first year.17 In 1838 when
                    Indiana College was renamed Indiana University, it was authorized to give instruction in medicine,
                    although it did not assume this responsibility until 1903.18
                    
                        Madison
                     Medical Institution was incorporated in 1843 and had a brief existence, but it did not
                    confer any degrees. Meanwhile, what has been described as the "first diploma mill"
                    in the 
                        United States
                     functioned for a few months during 1833 at 
                        New Albany
                    . Without bothering to offer any instruction, it granted—for a
                    fee—handsome diplomas awarding the degree of M.D. and signed by the "Chancellor
                    of the University of Indiana."19

            When in 1846 the Indiana Asbury authorities began seriously considering the establishment of a
                    medical school, there was only one such school functioning in the state. It was the 
                        La Porte
                     University School of Medicine, which had begun to function in 1842. Within its first
                    eight years of existence it enrolled 565 students and graduated 127. By the time Asbury's
                    medical college was opened, however, the Medical College of 
                        Evansville
                     was opening. The college at 
                        Evansville
                     was "a product of the religious fervor and temperance agitation of the
                    time," classes were opened with prayer, and the study of anatomy was said to have been made
                    more interesting by an "occasional injection of Bible-reading." Tuition was free
                    for students who promised not to use liquor, tobacco, or profanity.20 The
                    Committee on Medical Education reported to the American Medical Association in 1849 that there were
                    thirty-eight medical schools in the country, including a few that had been projected but were not
                    actually in operation. Of these, half were in 
                        New England
                     and the middle states, nine were in the South, 
                        Ohio
                     had three, 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Missouri
                     two each, 
                        Wisconsin
                     one, and Indiana had 
                        La Porte
                     and the projected school of Indiana Asbury.21
            
            On December 23, 1846, the Trustees of Indiana Asbury requested that Dr. D. J. Evens start an
                    investigation of the propriety of establishing a medical school and report to a later meeting of the
                        Trustees.22 In the following month an amendment to the charter was secured,
                    authorizing the Trustees to "organize and establish as part of said University, a
                    professional school or schools, whether of law or medicine, at such place or places in the State as
                    they may think best."23 In July, 1848, the Trustees appointed a
                    physician as agent in each of five cities—
                  Indianapolis, Terre Haute, Madison
               , 
                        New Albany
                    , and 
                        Lafayette
                    —instructing them to 
                        bring before the citizens of those places the subject of the establishment of a Medical
                            department of this University in

                            amount of contributions to said department and present the most advantages and facilities
                            for a medical school with the assurance that such department shall be established provided a
                            fund of ten thousand dollars or more shall be raised for the purpose.24
                  
                    
                
            Plans for the medical school caught the attention of the Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church,
                    and that body, the original sponsor of Indiana Asbury, in its annual conference at 
                        New Albany
                     in October, 1848, recommended a called session of the Trustees as soon as possible to
                    select the location and proceed with the establishment of the medical school.25
            
            On November 1, 1848, the Trustees met, with some unnamed "medical gentlemen"
                    sitting with them, and agreed on the founding "of the Medical Department of this
                    University," to be located in 
                        Indianapolis
                     "in the name of the Indiana Central Medical College." "Seven
                    Chairs of Tuition" were listed, and men were elected to fill each of them. The Trustees
                    agreed that they would "not incur any pecuniary responsibilities in the establishment or
                    maintenance of said Medical College." The medical faculty was to have full power of
                    government and to fix tuition, length of sessions, and qualifications for graduation. The medical
                    faculty might temporarily fill vacancies on their staff, subject to approval by the Trustees. They
                    might by majority action also recommend vacation of any chair. Final action on the staff itself and
                    on all matters not specifically delegated to the medical staff was reserved to the Trustees. The
                    newly appointed faculty was instructed to meet later that month to fix the time for opening the
                    school and to transact any other necessary business.26
            
            It would appear from these actions that instruction was to begin soon, but the minutes of the July,
                    1849, meeting of the Trustees indicate that there was confusion and delay. Since the meeting of
                    November, 1848, had been a called rather than a regular one, the Trustees in July, 1849,
                    "with a desire to remove the scruples of the most cautious," ratified and
                    confirmed their previous action, except in regard to the

                     vacating of professorships. The Trustees now affirmed that they
                    could act without the advice of the medical staff. They also straightened out some confusion
                    regarding one of the professors elected, and elected men to take the place of two who had
                        resigned.27
            
            Finally, a notice appeared in the Western Christian Advocate of August 8, 1849,
                    announcing the forthcoming opening of the Indiana Central Medical College. An accompanying editorial
                    called attention to its "eligible" location in 
                        Indianapolis
                    —which was "destined to become an inland city of no small
                    size," was already connected by rail with the Ohio River, and had
                    railroads under construction to Bellefontaine, 
                        Ohio
                    , and to 
                        Peru
                    , 
                        Lafayette
                    , and 
                        Terre Haute
                    , Indiana. The fact that political activity of the state centered at 
                        Indianapolis
                     would make possible good contacts with members of the supreme court, legislature, and
                    other officials. The editorial continued by calling attention to the acknowledged ability and high
                    moral tone of the faculty, men who were not materialists but who would "inculcate the great
                    principles of Christianity, so far as pertains to their connection with medical science."
                    Supervision by the Trustees of Indiana Asbury, it added, would further guarantee the high quality of
                    the first medical school to be established by any Methodist University.28
            
            In similar vein the official Visitors to Indiana Asbury reported back to the Indiana Conference of
                    the Methodist Church in October the splendid prospects for the medical venture. They mentioned
                    "the general character of 
                        Indianapolis
                     for moral and religious influence and general enterprize," as well as the
                    "long established experience in Medical Science and practice of at least a portion of the
                    gentlemen who compose the faculty of instruction." They urged members of the conference to
                        
                        lay their hand upon this department also, and infuse into it by the blessing of God, as they
                            have infused in the Indiana Asbury University the spirit of Wesleyan Methodism, which
                            acknowledges Christianity as a divine agency in everything in the power of the healing Art
                            as well as in the Kingdom of grace.

                    Such a spirit, they added, will teach us that "we are
                    fearfully and wonderfully made," and will also teach us to "magnify the riches of
                    God's wisdom."29
            
            Instruction in Asbury's medical college began early in December, 1849, on the third floor of
                    the Johnson Building on 
                        Washington
                     Street, between Meridian and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     streets. The rooms were described as capable of accomodating 150 students.30 This location was regarded as temporary, and the following year the college
                    was removed to Matthew Little's two-story brick building on the southeast corner of 
                        Washington
                     and East streets, described as "large and commodious,"31 where it remained for the rest of its short existence.
            The faculty for 1848-1849 included: John S. Bobbs, dean, general and special anatomy; Robert Curran,
                    physiology and general pathology; James S. Harrison, materia medica, therapeutics, and medical
                    jurisprudence; George W. Mears, obstetrics and diseases of women and children; Charles G. Downey,
                    chemistry and pharmacy; Livingston Dunlap, theory and practice; A. H. Baker, principles and practice
                    of surgery; and David Funkhouser, demonstrator of anatomy.32
            
            All of these men were physicians except C. G. Downey, who was transferred from his position as
                    professor of natural sciences in Asbury. Dr. Baker was from 
                        Cincinnati
                    ; the others were practitioners in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .33 Two former members of the 
                        La Porte
                     Medical College staff joined the Indiana Central faculty in 1850. Daniel Meeker took
                    the chair of anatomy previously held by Dr. Bobbs, who transferred to that previously held by Dr.
                    Baker. Elizur Deming assumed a new chair of special pathology and institutes of medicine. In the
                    final year, 1851-1852, the chairs of Drs. Dunlap and Funkhouser were vacant.34

            The student body during the first year numbered forty-nine. Two of these were from 
                        Illinois
                    , two from 
                        Ohio
                    , two from 
                        North Carolina
                    , and the rest from Indiana. Ten degrees were awarded at the close of the first session
                    in February, 1850. During the year 1850-1851 there were forty-one students and eighteen graduates.
                    In the final year, 1851-1852, there were again forty-one students, with twelve graduates. Seven
                    honorary degrees of M.D. were also conferred by the Indiana Central Medical College.35
            
            A total of over one hundred different students attended during the three years Indiana Central
                    Medical College was in operation. Of the forty graduates, twenty-eight received their degrees after
                    only one year of study, ten after two years, and two after three years. At least twelve of them
                    served as surgeons or assistant surgeons in Indiana infantry or cavalry regiments during the Civil
                        War.36 Four of the students may be specially mentioned. Thaddeus M. Stevens,
                    who was one of the students who attended all three sessions, became in 1881 the first secretary and
                    executive officer of the Indiana State Board of Health, set up one of the first clinical
                    laboratories in the country, and published numerous papers on medical subjects.37 Robert N. Todd in 1871 became the first graduate of any Indiana medical college to be
                    elected president of the Indiana Medical Society.38 Hiram Pitchlynn was one of a
                    group of Choctaw Indians brought to Indiana Asbury for education, and later practiced in 
                        Greencastle
                    . Joshua T. Belles, elected secretary of the first class, and who later practiced in 
                        Spencer
                    , became the grandfather of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan.39
            
            That Indiana Central Medical College was conducted along lines similar to those of other medical
                    schools of the time was evidenced by a survey made in 1849 by the Committee on Medical Education of
                    the American Medical Association.

                     39 Bobbs, Introductory Lecture, 3. It was primarily
                            through this connection that Prime Minister Macmillan was secured to deliver the
                            commencement address at DePauw University in 1958, in which he spoke proudly of his Hoosier
                            ancestry.
               
                     This study showed eighteen medical schools having a staff of
                    seven, eight with fewer than seven, and three with more.40 The staff of Indiana
                    Central with its seven professors and a demonstrator of anatomy thus fit into the general pattern,
                    and the professorships were similar in nomenclature as well as in number to those of other schools.
                    Requirements as to admission, graduation, and fees also followed the general pattern.41 The student had to be at least twenty-one years old, of good moral character, and to
                    present evidence of having studied medicine and surgery not less than three years. Each student had
                    a physician as a "preceptor"; in only a few cases was the preceptor a member of
                    the faculty. To receive the M.D., the student was to take two courses of lectures in a medical
                    school, one of which had to be in Indiana Central Medical College. The catalogue noted, however,
                    that "having been respectably engaged in the practice of medicine four years …
                    will be regarded as equivalent to one course of lectures."42 The annual
                    sessions lasted about four months, starting in October, November, or December and continuing through
                    February or into March.43
            
            The announcement for 1850-1851 states not only that the curriculum was to "embrace every
                    subject usually taught in well conducted Medical Colleges," but also that there were
                    adequate aids in the form of drawings, models, specimens, apparatus, and instruments, as well as
                    frequent examinations. During the evenings, the announcement added, the "Demonstrator of
                    Anatomy will be in constant attendance in the dissecting rooms, to afford the necessary instructions
                    and demonstrations in Anatomy." Furthermore, "each professor will afford
                    opportunities to such students as may desire it, for clinical observations, both Medical and
                    Surgical, in their private practice."44 During December, 1851, a series
                    of reports on "Cases brought before the Class of the Indiana Central Medical
                    College" was contributed to the 
                        Indianapolis

            A thesis on some medical subject was required of each graduate. Titles selected by the first class
                    included "Puerperal Fever," "Chloroform," "Acute
                    Rheumatism," "Lap tandra Alba," "Normal and Abnormal
                    Actions," "Hysteria," "Temperaments," "Acute
                    Hepatitus," "Vis Medicatrix naturae," and "Responsibilities of
                    the Profession."46 Graduates of the college during the other two years
                    of its existence wrote on a similar variety of subjects.
            Fees for the first year were set at $10 a "ticket" for the lectures of
                    each instructor, making a total of $70 for the entire course. In addition there was a
                    matriculation fee of $5 and a charge of $5 for a "dissecting
                        ticket."47 By the second year "tickets of all the
                    instructors" were reduced to $56, and a graduation fee of $20 was
                    added. Boarding, it was stated, could be obtained for $2 to $2.25 per week,
                    including lights and fuel.48
            
            No descriptions of the regular lectures seem to have survived. There are available, however, complete
                    copies of the addresses made at the opening of each of the three years during which the college
                    functioned, and there are also summaries of two addresses made at the commencements. Dean Bobbs made
                    the first opening address, in which he referred to the "cares, duties and
                    responsibilities" of the position in which he had been placed and called attention to the
                    need for more medical schools, especially for schools "domesticated" and brought
                    within the reach of all, so that there would no longer be any excuse for practitioners who had no
                    medical training. "Every day spent in storing the mind with the important practical truths
                    in the science of medicine," he asserted, "will as surely bring its reward as the
                    gentle shower of spring is succeeded by the golden fruits of autumn." He also referred to
                    the prestige that would accrue to graduates of a medical school affiliated with Indiana Asbury and
                    mentioned the obligation of Indiana Central Medical College to reflect honor on Asbury.49

            In the opening address the second year Dr. Curran referred to the success which had crowned the
                    efforts of the staff and expressed appreciation of "the strong interest manifested by the
                    intelligent members of our profession throughout our state and the surrounding borders." He
                    called attention to the necessity of educating physicians in reference "to those forms of
                    disease which they will be called on to combat," asserting that "no Eastern or
                    European school can furnish competent and complete instruction for a western practitioner."
                    Criticizing the "present absurd methods" used in liberal arts colleges
                    "by which the intellects are placed in a straight jacket and confined there," he
                    asserted that "three years pupilage in the office of an intelligent physician, including
                    public courses, is at least equal to three years at college" in cultivation and discipline
                    of the mind. As Dr. Bobbs had done the previous year, he assailed cheap nostrums,
                    homeopathy—"that cunningly devised fable," other new medical theories,
                    and especially that type of medical theory which was the basis of a group termed
                    "botanics." Members of this group, he asserted, traveled around the country
                    "with a good stock of braggadocia, cayenne pepper, lobelia and other course fodder, a cantering horse and a pair of pill-bags as large as a blacksmith's
                        bellows."50
            
            The 1851 address by Dr. Deming was largely a history of medical progress from the Greeks onward.
                    Deming disputed the allegation sometimes made that medicine "is last in the great race of
                    progress—that while all else travels with the velocity of the steam car, it has still its
                    snail-like pace." He too condemned homeopaths, eclectics, botanics, and others and went on
                    to assert that the interests of society demand well-educated and competent physicians.51
            
            In his address to the first graduates in 1850 Dr. Harrison urged professional industry and
                        integrity.52 In 1851 Professor Downey warned the young doctors that they
                    would often have to deal with "perturbed spirits" as well as diseased bodies. They
                    were advised to "enter into communion with the troubled spirit," leading it back
                    to God. A minister might well be called in to become, for the time being, an "assistant
                    physician."

                    command the "entire Materia Medica."53
            
            Following the end of the third session early in 1852 the Trustees declared all chairs in the medical
                    faculty vacant, then proceeded to re-elect three of the staff and to elect three new men.54 A glowing statement in the Asbury catalogue of 1852 announced that the
                    Trustees had "permanently located the Indiana Central Medical College at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , reorganized the Faculty, and adopted efficient measures to furnish a suitable college
                    building and other means of instruction."55 The added statement that
                    "the Institution may now be regarded as placed on a permanent footing" was soon to
                    prove highly inaccurate.
            The Trustees met in July, 1852, with some of the medical professors present. They were informed that
                    the medical faculty had held no meeting since February, that two of the newly elected professors had
                    declined to serve, and that no building had been secured. They wavered between two committee
                    reports, one recommending suspension of the school and the other stating that
                    "notwithstanding the difficulties that lie in the way … [the Trustees] will give
                    the department their most vigorous support." Finally the Trustees voted that
                    "lectures in the Medical department of the University be suspended until such time as means
                    can be obtained for the erection of suitable buildings." A committee was appointed to take
                    charge of the apparatus and equipment, and Professor Downey was authorized to sell whatever
                    equipment "would be likely to injure by keeping." Downey himself was re-elected to
                    the faculty of Asbury, this time as professor of mathematics.56 In 1855 the

                            exploded, and went to pieces." What the "pet scheme" may have
                            been, or whether there was a pet scheme, does not appear in surviving records.

                    Downey was authorized "to pay to the Medical Faculty first formed … the money
                    received by him on sale of their apparatus."67
            
            Indiana Asbury did not completely give up the idea of operating a medical school. In 1871 the
                    Trustees resolved that such a school should be reopened in 
                        Indianapolis
                     "as soon as it can be done without increasing our financial
                        liabilities."58 In 1877 a committee of the Trustees reported an
                    agreement with the faculty of the Indiana Medical College which had been founded in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1869 that it should be "received and adopted" as the medical
                    department of Asbury, but legal questions were raised and the report was laid on the table.59 Additional negotiations failed in 1879-1880.60 When in
                    1884 Indiana Asbury became DePauw University, plans for making the reorganized institution a real
                    university included a medical department. There was discussion of a 
                        Greencastle
                     location for the department and of a possible affiliation with one or both of the
                    medical colleges existing in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at the time, but in 1887 the Trustees decided that "the best interest of the
                    university will be conserved by taking no steps … at this time."61 The matter has not been seriously considered since then.
            The question naturally arises as to why the medical college, after a reasonably successful existence
                    for three years, should have been allowed to close in 1852. There is much evidence that such a
                    school was needed. From the closing of Indiana Central Medical College until 1869 there was no
                    medical school in 
                        Indianapolis
                    ; indeed, from the closing of the 
                        La Porte
                     school in 1856 until 1869 there was no medical school in the state.62 The relations of Asbury's medical college with the medical profession were
                        friendly.63 The temporary merging of the 
                        La Porte
                     school with Asbury's medical school not only removed a rival, but also brought

                    medical center of the state and to increase greatly the transient population and business of the
                        city.65 A correspondent of the Indiana State Sentinel, after attending the
                    first commencement, reported that the school had made a "bright and glorious
                    beginning," and that the large crowd present at the exercises showed a friendly feeling
                    toward it.66 A committee on education also reported to the Indiana Conference of
                    the Methodist Church "with great pleasure" that the school was functioning under
                    favorable auspices and with an able faculty.67
            
            Of the ability of the faculty there is ample evidence. The correspondent of the Indiana
                        State Sentinel remarked in 1850 that the professors, although "residents of a new
                    country, with no extrinsic influences, or bloated reputations to puff them into public notice
                    … would adorn the profession in any land, being practical men with sound heads and stores
                    of medical information."68 Dean John S. Bobbs was a graduate of
                    Jefferson Medical College in 
                        Philadelphia
                     who had located in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1835, held numerous public offices, was active in the formation of numerous medical
                    institutions, and is known in medical circles as the "father of cholecystotomy,"
                    for he was the first to open the gall bladder in a famous operation in 1867. He was described by Dr.
                    Wishard as the leading physician of the state in the middle third of the nineteenth century.69 Dr. Dunlap was a graduate of Transylvania and the only surgeon in 
                        Indianapolis
                     before 1830. Active in both public and medical affairs, he was the moving spirit in the
                    erection of the first city hospital in 
                        Indianapolis

                        Indianapolis
                     Public Library.72 At the founding of the permanent state medical
                    society in June, 1849, Dr. Dunlap was elected the first president, Dr. Bobbs the first secretary,
                    and all the members of the first staff who were 
                        Indianapolis
                     physicians were in attendance. Drs. Blears, Deming, Meeker, and Bobbs each served a
                    year as president later.73 Dr. A. H. Baker subsequently served as president of

                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1869.77
            
            Indiana Central Medical College did not fail because it was a poor one. Dean Bobbs frankly stated
                    that it could not start as a superior school,78 but as a good school. And after
                    it had operated two years he reported to the Asbury Trustees that with the fostering care the
                    Trustees could extend, it could "be made to take position, at no remote period, in
                    character and usefulness, with the most respectable schools in the West."79
            
            While the main cause of the college's failure was financial, there were several additional
                    factors. There was some criticism of the school on the ground that it was under Methodist influence.
                    Asbury's Trustees and the Methodist Conference of course took pride in its Methodist
                    auspices. To counteract the reports of undue Methodist control, a correspondent of the Sentinel pointed out that some members of the faculty 
                  
                     71 Dr. Deming was called "old man eloquent" in
                            connection with his presidency of the state medical society. Ibid., 9. For
                            some reason Dr. Meeker was called "Old Death Meeker." Pickard and Buley,
                                The Midwest Pioneer, 142. After serving the profession long and
                            honorably, Meeker was expelled in 1871 from the state medical society, of which he had been
                            president in 1857, for publishing a pamphlet entitled Prof. Meeker's
                                Opium Cure-A Certain and Safe Remedy for the Opium Habit, and for deriding the

                     "have not the honor of belonging to any
                    church," that they have not "even so much as alluded to the peculiar tenets of any
                    religious sect," and that the school was under Methodist auspices only because
                    "none other were equal to the task of originating and sustaining such a
                        school."80 That the conduct of the faculty was not impeccable from
                    the Methodist standpoint is indicated by this record in the Trustee Minutes: 
                        A communication from the Medical Faculty in relation to Profane and Vulgar Conduct of some of
                            the members of the Medical Faculty was laid before the Board … after considerable
                            discussion and some explanatory remarks … the communication was laid on the
                                table.81
                  
                    
                
            Numerous resignations of members of the staff immediately after their election or after they had
                    served a year or two might indicate faculty dissatisfaction with the school. That the Trustees after
                    the third year declared all positions vacant and proceeded to re-elect only half the staff is
                    further evidence of personnel problems.82
            
            One incident probably attracted unfavorable attention to the school. It was the expulsion of David J.
                    Lee, whose long letter explaining the circumstances was published in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Locomotive under the caption "Medical College Outrage." Lee was
                    a "botanic," one of a group strongly condemned by members of the medical faculty
                    and orthodox physicians in general. Among other cures, the botanics emphasized steam baths and
                    herbs. Lee's statement was that he purchased a "ticket" for Dr.
                    Meeker's lectures on anatomy and attended regularly for several weeks. When it became known
                    that he was not reading with an allopathic physician as his preceptor, Lee states, "a mere
                    faction of the baser sort of the students, began their insults, hissing, hollowing steam and
                    ‘yarbs,’ not only in the College, but on the streets." These students
                    also passed resolutions saying Lee ought to leave the class. Dr. Meeker defended Lee's
                    right to attend lectures, even though he might believe in doctoring with cornstalks. The faculty
                    met, and the majority decided against Lee. Dean Bobbs informed him that he had not matriculated
                    properly,

                            all" (p. 225) and to Dr. Dunlap as one of the "staunchest
                            supporters" of Christ Church (p. 151).

                     that the fee he had paid for his ticket would be refunded, and
                    that he "hoped Mr. Lee will understand that the harmony of the class renders this step
                    necessary." Lee pointed out that the majority of the students and some of the professors
                    acted as gentlemen and disapproved of the treatment he received because of a few students'
                    objections. He expressed the opinion that one reason for his dismissal was fear that he might
                    attempt to gain prestige for himself as a botanic from having attended the school; Lee went on to
                    defend the botanics against the orthodox practitioners by commenting, 
                        Our "School" will leave theirs as far behind, as the cantering horse, with
                            blacksmith bellows, for pill-bags, freighted with lobelia, cayenne pepper, and other coarse
                            fodder, (according to Prof. Curran) can leave a go-cart, laden with calomel, antimony,
                            opium, and other death dealing articles, used by the Scientific, Murderous Quacks.83
                  
                    Dean Bobbs evidently did not take the affair very seriously, however, as he reported to the
                    Trustees that he did not know of any occurence during this session which might "awaken an
                    unpleasant reflection in the bosom of teacher or pupil."84
            
            Lack of permanent quarters was an additional difficulty which the medical college faced. The two
                    rented buildings seemed to suggest that the college was of a temporary nature. In February, 1850,
                    Governor Joseph A. Wright, an Asbury trustee, headed a committee to look for a site, perhaps for a
                    combined medical and law building.85 In June of that year the state legislature
                    authorized the sale of an acre in University Square, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , to Asbury at its appraised value of $3,566, but apparently the price seemed
                    too high to the Asbury Trustees.86 The Asbury catalogue published in 1851 made the inaccurate
                    announcement that the Trustees had "adopted efficient measures to provide for the erection
                    of a suitable College building."87 About the same time, the Trustees
                    appointed a committee to receive propositions from other cities within the state regarding buildings
                    for the medical school.88 The only recorded response to this action is a report

                     from a 
                        Greencastle
                     citizen saying that he had obtained a promise of about $200 if the medical
                    department should be moved there.89
            
            The school was probably not sufficiently advertised. For instance, when an historian in 1883 was
                    trying to get information about early Indiana medical schools, he received word from an Indiana
                    physician who practiced in 
                        Marion County
                     from about 1840 to 1860 that he had never heard of either the 
                        La Porte
                     College or Indiana Central Medical College.90
            
            The chief difficulties, however, were financial. At the end of the first year of operation there was
                    a deficit of $200, and the Trustees recommended that this amount be collected by
                    subscriptions from "Bystanders" or by agents if necessary.91
                    At the end of the second year Professor Downey was appointed a special agent to travel through the
                    state "to disseminate information, collect funds for the erection or purchase of buildings
                    … and secure students." After he had labored three months, he had collected
                    $5 in cash.92 Reduction in the number of professors and the
                    assumption of the extra duties by the remaining faculty was of little help.93
            
            That Indiana Asbury did not give financial help to its medical college is hardly surprising. Through
                    the 1840's its annual deficits frequently amounted to two or three thousand dollars; at one
                    time it owed the president and faculty considerably more than a year's back salary. While
                    its finances had slightly improved by the early 1850's, it was still struggling to maintain
                    a balanced budget.94
            
            Indiana University's School of Medicine was established in 1903 and is now the only medical
                    school in the state. Twenty-two medical colleges had been founded in Indiana prior to that date;
                    these had functioned for periods ranging from a few months to twenty-seven years.95 Among them Indiana Asbury's Central Medical College had played a creditable and
                    promising, although disappointingly brief, role.

            During the years preceding the outbreak of the Civil War, citizens of 
                        Mishawaka
                     were confused and frustrated by the increasing sectional bitterness that threatened to
                    divide the nation. Being Hoosiers, they strongly supported their political convictions. Many
                    followed the leadership of Schuyler Colfax from nearby 
                        South Bend
                     and vigorously supported the new Republican party in the election of 1860, while others
                    continued to support the old Democratic party. As the nation drifted into the
                    "irrepressible conflict," there was a division of opinion on national affairs
                    among 
                        Mishawaka
                    's citizens. Some believed that the nation would be split by the secession of
                    the southern states and voiced threats against all traitors; others advocated the preservation of
                    the Union by reasonable concessions to and compromises with the southern people. Confused and
                    uncertain about national affairs, the citizens gave little vent to any manifestations of patriotism,
                    and, as the nation approached the time of crisis, they seemed to be waiting, along with the rest of
                    the North, for an overt act by the South.
            The news of the fall of Fort Sumter was received at 
                        Mishawaka
                     on the morning of April 15, and the response of Mishawakans to its fall was immediate
                    and enthusiastic. In a series of public meetings, citizens vigorously reacted in support of the
                    Union. A permanent organization was formed to represent the village in matters pertaining to the
                    war, and a Soldiers' Aid Society was organized, with over $2,000 subscribed for
                    the relief of volunteers' families. Forty-two men volunteered for the army, uniting with
                    fifty-five volunteers from 
                        South Bend
                     to form a company. The company was accepted by Governor Oliver P. Morton and ordered to
                    leave for 
                        Indianapolis
                     on Friday, April 19. Patriotism, war fever, and excitement were in the air. Over three
                    hundred 
                        Mishawaka
                     citizens accompanied the volunteers to 
                        South Bend

                     on Friday and remained with them until their train left for 
                        Indianapolis
                    .1
            
            The week following the departure of the volunteers for their training camp in 
                        Indianapolis
                     was anticlimactic for citizens of 
                        Mishawaka
                    . True, ladies wore badges—rosettes made of the national
                    colors—and stories of patriotism were being told. For example, there was the one about
                    the "prominent married lady who wished she were a man, so that she might volunteer and go
                    down and fight"; and a tale circulated about the young man who was told to leave a certain
                    young lady's presence and never return because of his expression of secession
                        sentiments.2 But the excitement of the past week, when the war meetings had
                    been held and men had volunteered for the army, simply could not be kept at its fever pitch. On
                    April 27, Editor Archibald Beal of the Enterprise stated that because of a
                    scarcity of help he was unable to collect much local news; nevertheless, he did manage to obtain the
                    information that eleven men had enlisted in a rifle company formed in 
                        South Bend
                     and had left for 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but that thirteen of the original forty-five volunteers had returned home, honorably
                    discharged for physical reasons. Summing up national news about the war, Beal wrote that "a
                    terrible civil war is at hand and that nothing but bloodshed and a final triumph by arms will
                    restore peace."3
            
            Meanwhile the 
                        Mishawaka
                     volunteers had arrived in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . They had left 
                        South Bend
                     on the evening of the nineteenth; after a sleepless night on the train, they had
                    arrived in the state capital at sunrise. They were pleased and surprised to be greeted by a
                    thirteen-gun salute. They marched to the 
                        Spencer
                     House for breakfast and later went to the Capitol where they were welcomed by Governor
                    Morton. Following this reception, they marched to the State Fairgrounds along streets lined with
                    people who cheered them as they

            The men had many new and exciting experiences while at Camp Morton. During the early part of the war,
                    there was fear that rebel sympathizers would gain control of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and a portion of Company I was detailed to guard the Statehouse. Two men of the
                    regiment later died, and it was believed that their deaths resulted from drinking water from a well
                    that had been poisoned, possibly by southern sympathizers. A peddler, nearly mobbed because he was
                    accused of selling poisoned oranges, had to be rescued from an angry gathering by the guards.6
            
            The volunteers began their training and were soon emitting the complaints of civilians being made
                    into soldiers. They had to sleep in the horse and cattle stalls at the State Fairgrounds. Although
                    their food was good, consisting of large quantities of bread, rice, potatoes, ham, beans, beef, and

                            volunteers' experiences, perhaps George Niles's letters to the Enterprise repeated camp gossip rather than actual experiences of Niles
                            and the other local volunteers.

                    drill conducted without uniforms and without guns.9 Perhaps the
                    volunteers' greatest disappointment came when they finally received their weapons. They had
                    hoped to receive the new Minie rifles that would shoot up to nine hundred yards, but instead they
                    received old (1844) muskets which had a range of only three hundred yards. But the men were
                    philosophical in their disappointment, for "they volunteered to fight and so they will do
                    even if they have to fight with nothing more than an Indian war club."9

                            annoying one was the food question. Charges were made that food was spoiled or adulterated;
                            then too, the men were not accustomed to army rations and wanted food such as they were
                            accustomed to having at home. See William Dudley Foulke, Life of Oliver P.

                            The troubles of the commissary department had little effect on the volunteers.
                            "There were no cases of starvation or epidemics. If anything, food was too
                            plentiful. The vast amounts bought from sutlers and received from parents and friends
                            eventually had to be regulated in the interests of discipline and physical training. The
                            chief problem seems to have been that the people of Indiana expected nothing but the best
                            for their volunteers in the early days of the war…. Six months later, when the
                            realities of camp life were better known. it is Drobable that no comdaint would have been

                            Enterprise, May 11, 1861. It is not surprising that the troops were
                            supplied with old muskets in view of the state's unpreparedness for war. There were
                            available in March, 1861, "3,436 small arms of sixteen different kinds, but of
                            uniform inferiority. They were fit for nothing, and were never used for anything but guard
                            duty or drill instruction." Indiana, Report of the Adjutant

                     at Camp Morton, who interfered so much with military routine
                    that the camp was closed to visitors on Sundays. Sunday duties were assigned to keep the homesick
                    boys occupied, and there was little to set the Sabbath apart from any other workday except various
                    religious services.10 Editor Schuyler Colfax, of nearby 
                        South Bend
                    , wrote in his paper that he had attended divine service with the Ninth Regiment. The
                    "attendance was very large—no church ever had a more orderly
                    congregation—and the melody of sacred music never fell more sweetly on our
                        ear."11
            
            Despite curtailment of the privilege of having visitors, there were plentiful opportunities for
                    recreation. Much of the soldiers' leisure time was spent in playing games, group singing,
                    and listening to regimental bands. Games brought from home included checkers, chess, and various
                    card games. There was the usual "rough stuff" such as the Knights of 
                        Malta
                     initiation, in which the initiate was tossed on a piece of tent canvas handled by a
                    squad of tormentors.12 Passes were given to the men so that they might visit the
                    city. Most of the men on pass simply looked at the sights, some attended Masonic meetings, while
                    others sought out more worldly pleasures. Some brought back whiskey, which they smuggled past the
                    guards by throwing the bottles into the creek that flowed through the camp and then hurrying inside
                    to retrieve the floating bottles. Letters home reassured the temperance people that the men who
                    smuggled the whiskey into camp were from 
                        Elkhart
                     and hence not 
                        St. Joseph County
                     men!13 In addition, letters told of the pride that the men had in
                    their organization. They were doing a job the best they could; as drill and discipline changed them
                    into soldiers, they grew confident in themselves and wrote home that they hoped to become the best
                    regiment in the state.14

            During the last week in May, through the influence of Schuyler Colfax, the regiment was reequipped
                    with the very best of Minie rifles.15 On May 29 the group left 
                        Indianapolis
                     for 
                        Virginia
                    —the first regiment to leave the state for that battle front.16 Through a misunderstanding of orders, the men had been brought to the depot at midnight
                    and therefore had no rest and no breakfast, yet they were in good spirits at the prospect of active
                    service. The 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Daily Journal noted: 
                        The possession of splendid Minie rifles, of the very best style … no doubt
                            contributed not a little to their good feeling. As almost all of them are
                            "backwoodsmen," accustomed to the rifle, they may be relied on to do some
                            ugly work with their terrible weapons if they can get within shot of the
                            traitors…. They went fully equipped. Every man had his … haversack
                            with two days' rations in it, his canteen, his tin cup, a complete uniform of
                            sheep's gray, durable and strong, his Minie rifle, with the spring bayonet, and
                            forty rounds of ball cartridges.17
                  
                    
                
            The regiment traveled by train to 
                        Virginia
                    . They left 
                        Indianapolis
                     at 10:00 A.M. on May 29, arrived at 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               ,
                    at 6:00 P.M., and were in 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , by midnight.
                    George Niles reported that the men were impressed by the cheering of citizens whenever the train
                    passed through a town or village. In particular they would remember 
                  Zanesville, Ohio
               , where they arrived at 6:00 A.M. on May 30, for the good women of that
                    town served them hot coffee, cakes, and biscuits; the men declared that these women "will
                    never be forgotten by us as long as we live."18 Arriving at Bellaire, 
                        Ohio
                    , at 10:00 A.M. they crossed the Ohio River by ferry to Renwood, 
                        Virginia
                    , and from there traveled via the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad to Grafton, 
                        Virginia

                    —on June 1, and was attached to Colonel B. F. Kelley's command.20 From Grafton it marched toward Philippi in the column commanded by Colonel
                    Kelley and took part in the surprise and pursuit of the rebels at that place on the morning of June
                        3.21 Later the regiment returned to Grafton and became a part of the Indiana
                    Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Thomas A. Morris. It participated in all the marches and
                    skirmishes of the brigade during General George B. McClellan's successful campaign against
                    the enemy at Laurel Hill and Rich Mountain. The regiment
                    was in action at Laurel Hill, July 7-8; Belington, July 10; Carrick's
                    Ford, July 12-14; and it was one of the leading regiments in the pursuit of the defeated southern
                        forces.22 General Robert S. Garnett, of the Confederate forces, was killed
                    while defending a ford over Cheat River against the attack of the Indiana
                        men.23 One Indiana soldier stated, "The Hoosiers are too much for
                    Secesh, fire too rapidly and with aim too accurate—nothing in rebel shape can resist
                    their impetuosity."24 John Auten from

            As their three-month enlistment was about to end, the Indiana men were being urged to reenlist for
                    three years. As early as June 10, Schuyler Colfax had written to Colonel Robert Milroy, and
                    referring to an order by President Lincoln, had told the Colonel that Indiana troops could be
                    mustered immediately into the federal service for three years. "Where less than one fifth
                    decline to (re-enlist), those declining are to be paid and discharged and their places filled with
                    recruits as soon as possible and the regiment to be accepted when four fifths full."26 Colfax urged Milroy to instruct each of his captains to encourage his men to
                        re-enlist.27 Governor Morton also put pressure upon the Indiana men, for he
                    sent letters by special messenger to all Indiana three-month regiments asking the men to reenlist
                    for three years' service.28 On July 13, however, Colfax again wrote to
                    Milroy stating, "The Secretary of War promised me today most postively [sic] that all our
                    three months regiments should be allowed to go home to recruit and re-enlist for the
                        war."29 The attitude of the men on re-enlistment was well stated by
                    Adjutant Henry Loring: 
                        not more than one fifth of the force would remain in the service unless permitted to return
                            home at the end of the three months as many have made arrangements for that time only, and

                                    Enterprise, July 27, 1861. In describing the action at Belington
                                    where John Auten was killed, a sergeant of the Ninth Regiment wrote that
                                    "it was solely and entirely a battle begun and fought to an end by privates
                                    and ‘noncoms,’ independent of leader ship except as some one
                                    more daring than his fellows would push to the front shouting to his fellows to
                                    ‘come on’ when a rush would be made to support him. In short,
                                    it was the enlisted men's fight; with not a commissioned officer in the
                                    fray." James H. Durham, "The Battle of Belington," Indiana Magazine of History, VII (September, 1911), 119. More

                             they could return for a short furlough and adjust their
                            matters, three quarters of this regiment would remain in the three years service.30
                  
                    
                
            In the latter part of July, the regiment was returned to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where Governor Morton welcomed the men home with a patriotic address at a magnificent
                    reception given in their honor.31 They remained in camp at 
                        Indianapolis
                     until July 29, when the regiment was mustered out of service.32
            
            During the period between mid-April and the latter part of July when the volunteers had been gone
                    from the village, life at 
                        Mishawaka
                     had been going on much as usual, and the citizens had taken part in numerous
                    activities. The Enterprise reported that the young folks' concert held at
                    Milburn Hall on April 26 "was very beautiful, and the original songs, modern Yankee Doodle
                    and Secession, were well timed and as such brought the house down."33
                    The corporation election, held Monday, May 6, was uneventful. Only 172 votes, representing about a
                    third of the eligible voters in town, were polled.34 On Sunday, May 26, the Most
                    Reverend Bishop John Henry Luers laid the cornerstone of the new 
                        St. Joseph
                     Catholic Church.35 In June a band of gypsies camped on the
                    outskirts of the town. The editor of the Enterprise stated, "They are a lazy and roving set
                    of thieves which should be driven from the country."36
            
            Patriotism and the war influenced 
                        Mishawaka
                     residents in some of their activities. On May 1, the people in the southern part of
                    town met at Schmitt's Hotel and raised the Stars and Stripes to the top of a sixty-five
                    foot black ash pole. Appropriate speeches were made, and cheers were given for

                             it was believed there would be little trouble in persuading them to re-enlist
                            for three years. However, unexpected delays in mustering them out caused great
                            dissatisfaction. When finally mustered out, many were so exasperated that they declared they
                            would never enter the service again. Foulke, Oliver P. Morton, I, 127.

                    which had become caught when the flag was raised.87 A Home Guard made up of about fifty men of the
                    village met once a week at Town Hall for drill, but more time was given to lively discussions of the
                    war and politics than was spent in soldiering.38
            
            In June the residents were again sharply reminded of their absent volunteers. According to the Enterprise:
                    
                        Not a little feeling was manifested here on Thursday last, on the arrival from 
                                Indianapolis
                             of a large box containing clothes, blankets, and quilts etc., of the volunteers
                            who went from this place. Government having furnished them new suits and ordered them into
                            service in 
                                Virginia
                            , the clothes and quilts which they took with them were of service no longer and
                            were sent back, They were unpacked and spread out in front of A. B. Judson's store
                            where each bundle or package was in waiting to be claimed by the person or relative to whom
                            addressed. The claiments in some instances were wives or mothers of those far away, who
                            burst into tears on receiving the bundle directed to them, being thus forcibly reminded of
                            their absent loved ones. Be assured that many prayers go up from here for the success of our
                            brave volunteers and their safe return.39
                  
                    
                
            Another mark of the war was the prosperity brought to 
                        Mishawaka
                     by government contracts for wagons, and the increased demand for the products of the
                    local farmers. The woolen factory of Palmer and Worden paid 22c to 38c per pound for wool, which was
                    a high price, and a brisk trade developed.40 The firm of Milburn, Eberhart and
                    Company, manufacturers of 
                        Utah
                     wagons, however, became chief benefactor of the war contracts.41
                    George Milburn, a partner in the company, had gone to 
                        Washington

                     41 In 1857 Milburn, Eberhart and Company received a contract from the
                            government for several hundred wagons having a six thousand pound capacity. These wagons
                            were to be used to supply the military force which was to be sent to 
                                Utah
                             in 1858 to force the Mormons to recognize the laws of the 
                                United States
                            . This was an important contract for the local factory, and henceforth heavy
                            transport wagons manufactured in 
                                Mishawaka

                     authorities, and by the end of July the wagon factory had
                    received contracts to make and deliver four hundred wagons. The factory was well equipped, employed
                    over 150 men, and used the very latest machinery, Availability of skilled workmen and an extensive
                    supply of good materials made it possible to turn out approximately fifty wagons each week.42
            
            The military campaign in far-off 
                        Virginia
                    , at unknown places and staged in movements not understood by civilians, had been of
                    great interest to the people of 
                        Mishawaka
                     while the Ninth Regiment had been in that state.43 After the Ninth
                    was safely back in 
                  Indianapolis, Mishawaka
                citizens lost their personal fascination for
                    military campaigns, but their interest in the movements of the armies remained. A bulletin board had
                    been erected in front of the Milburn, Eberhart and Company hardware store where telegraphic
                    dispatches were received and posted three times daily.44 When the report of
                    General Erwin McDowell's defeat at Bull Run arrived on July 22, crowds gathered in front of
                    the bulletin board and at the telegraph office to learn the latest reports regarding that disaster.
                    The reports were shocking in view of the fact that the Union army had been expected to win an easy
                    victory, smash the rebels, and end the war. When the telegraph reports indicated not victory but
                    defeat, there came the realization that it might be a long and bloody war; and on

                     the night after the reports were received there were many
                    sleepless men and women in the town.45
            
            On Wednesday morning July 31, the volunteers from the Ninth Regiment returned home to be welcomed
                    with cheers, music from the military band, and the firing of cannon. Yet the town almost missed the
                    homecoming. Rumor had it that the men would be returning on the 9:49 A.M. train, but so many other
                    conflicting rumors circulated that the people were really not prepared when shortly before 9:30 a
                    dispatch arrived from 
                        South Bend
                     announcing that the "boys" were indeed coming on the 9:49 train. The
                    news spread like wildfire, and practically everyone who was able went straight to the railroad
                    station. Business places were closed; members of the bands and of the drum and fife corps were
                    quickly assembled. The flag was waving and the cannon loaded when the long train pulled into the
                    village with the men aboard. There ensued a happy confusion of hugging, kissing, crying, talking.
                    The 
                        Mishawaka
                     volunteers had experienced rough service, but none had been injured, and now that the
                    men were home again, the dread and fear of the past months could be forgotten.46
                    Plans had been made for a march to the picnic grounds and a formal reception, but the
                    "boys" would not have any more of marching and soldiering. All they wanted was to
                    be allowed to do as they liked, and so some of them left for home with their families, while others
                    went to the Milburn House where they were served a large breakfast.47
            
            The most sincere and best welcome given to the returning soldier was no doubt that which he received
                    from his wife,

                            were small (less than thirty killed), but these men had learned that war was not the picnic

                        Mishawaka

                     decided to give them a picnic dinner on Tuesday afternoon, August 6. The soldiers and
                    their families were invited, along with the general public. Speeches, music, and other entertainment
                    were planned to enliven the occasion. In the evening there was to be a dance at the Milburn House in
                    honor of the soldiers and their ladies.48
            
            The young ladies' picnic for the volunteers was a fine affair. There was a large crowd, and
                    the tables were loaded with choice foods. Speeches were made by citizens who told the
                    "boys" that the home folks appreciated Company I's "deeds of

                    on poles placed near the river bank, and a tent had been stretched between these poles, giving the
                    picnic grounds the appearance of a military encampment. When the military band played martial music
                    and the cannon fired, everything seemed very warlike and brave, at least for the citizens who were
                        present.49
            
            There was dancing in the evening at not one but two dances. At the Milburn House there was an
                    invitational dance attended by some thirty couples from 
                        Mishawaka
                     and surrounding towns. A second dance was arranged by those who were dissatisfied with
                    the way the dance at the Milburn House was to be conducted. They did not approve of the invitational
                    dance or of having to pay $1.50 for a few hours of dancing. Permission to use the fire
                    engine house was secured from the town board, and money was collected from those attending the dance
                    to pay for the rent of the hall and for the dance band. A large number of people were present at
                    this dance and all who came had a pleasant evening. The dances proved to be a proper ending to the
                    big day of public welcome for the returned soldiers.50
            
            But dancing was only a pleasant interlude among the vicissitudes of civil war, for on August 10 the
                    following advertisement appeared in the Enterprise:

                        The undersigned proposes to raise a Company to join the "Old Ninth," and
                            invites those who wish to volunteer, to register their names at
                            "Head-Quarters" at Milburn, Eberhart & Co.'s Hardware
                            Store, and also with the undersigned at his place of business.

                            , Aug. 8th, 1861.
                    
                
            Some of the volunteers believed that they should re-enlist, for they wanted to see the war carried to
                    a victorious conclusion; but on the other hand they were in no hurry to join again. There was some
                    doubt that a company should again be raised in the village, despite the statement in the Enterprise that Captain Houghton was "a fine man, somewhat versed in
                    military matters, and just the one to go with."52 A large rally was
                    planned for August 16 to promote enlistments for the new three-year regiment. Schuyler Colfax and
                    Colonel Robert Milroy were invited and asked to give patriotic speeches to help arouse enthusiasm.
                    Colfax was unable to attend,53 but Milroy arrived in town about 5:00 P.M., and
                    after dinner at the Milburn House, where a large crowd of people had gathered to greet him, he was
                    serenaded by the military band and called upon to make a speech. The "old hero made a
                    speech, setting forth the necessity for putting down the rebellion and calling upon all his old
                    boys' to go with him." Later the band played patriotic music, and the people sang
                    songs and cheered as each man stepped forward and signed his name to the roll. A number of
                    enlistments were secured, but more were needed. The next day the Enterprise urged,
                    "Come along, boys, volunteer and go with Captain, he is just the man to go with, besides he
                    has secured the old place for Company I, in Colonel Milroy's Regiment, the
                    ‘Bloody Ninth.’"54
            
            Whatever the inducements, seventy men from 
                        Mishawaka
                     and Penn Township enlisted. Nine men from the three-month

                     company re-enlisted; the others were new volunteers.55 Soon it was time for them to join their regiment. The Ninth mustered at 
                        La Porte
                    , and on August 20, Captain Houghton's company left the village to take the
                    place of old Company I in Colonel Milroy's regiment, the "Bloody Ninth."
                    They took with them the flag which they had carried to victory in the 
                        Virginia
                     campaign.56
            
            The parting was sad for many who gathered at the railroad station to see the men leave. The festive
                    occasion of the three-month volunteers' homecoming was now overshadowed, and old fears and
                    worries had again returned. Outwardly there were the usual manifestations of patriotism, but
                    inwardly there was undoubtedly the dread feeling of loss. For the re-enlisted men, this second
                    departure was not the exciting experience of their April enlistment. They had already had a taste of
                    war and army life and had found nothing romantic or exciting about it; besides this enlistment was
                    for three long years. This departure was not one of flag-waving patriotism, but rather one
                    reflecting grim determination. A few days after the men left, Editor Beal mused: 
                        One could not help thinking of the necessity which should take from our midst, men of
                            families, some of them our most prominent business ones, and send them away to fight those
                            who used to be our brothers, but now traitors, engaged in trying to put an end to free
                            government and free institutions.57
                  
                    
                
            On September 5, 1861, at 
                        La Porte
                    , Indiana, one hundred and one officers and men, seventy of whom were from 
                        Mishawaka
                     and Penn Township, were mustered into the service of the 
                        United States
                     as Company I, Ninth Infantry, three-year Indiana volunteers.58 At
                    Camp Colfax in 
                        La Porte
                     the men chose as their captain James Houghton, a prominent 
                        Mishawaka
                     businessman, partner of Richard Stone in the manufacture of furniture and cane-bottom
                    chairs. Houghton had helped recruit volunteers for the company. Isaac Pettit,

                        Mishawaka
                     was elected first lieutenant, and William Merrifield was elected second lieutenant. The
                    company was brought to full strength when additional men arrived from 
                        Mishawaka
                    . Once the group's organization was completed, the men were kept busy with
                    drill and other preparations.59 The Southern 
                        Michigan
                     and Northern Indiana Railroad ran an excursion to the camp from the towns west of 
                        Elkhart
                    , and many of the folks from 
                        Mishawaka
                     took advantage of this opportunity to visit Camp Colfax. For both the soldiers and the
                    visitors this was an enjoyable event. The camp was inspected by the visitors; and when the men were
                    relieved from drill, there was a picnic supper for everyone. Later in the evening the bands
                    serenaded, and there was dancing until it was time for the train to leave for home. For some, this
                    was the very last time they saw their loved ones.60
            
            The Ninth did not remain long at Camp Colfax. It left on September 14, and was ordered directly to
                        Cheat Mountain, 
                        Virginia
                    , to reinforce the command of General Joseph J. Reynolds.61 The
                    train carrying the regiment passed through 
                        Mishawaka
                     about two o'clock in the afternoon. The people received news that the troops
                    were to pass through, and a large crowd gathered at the depot to bid them farewell. Food and other
                    gifts were brought to the depot, but, much to the disappointment of the people, the train did not
                    stop in the village. The men cheered and were cheered in return as the train slowly passed through
                    the town; and, as it disappeared down the track to the east, the heartbreak and sorrow caused by the
                    war must have again clutched at the hearts of many.62
            
            After the departure of the volunteers, local activities received increased attention from the
                    citizens. President Lincoln proclaimed a national fast day on Thursday, September 27.63 In 
                        Mishawaka
                     it was a day of fasting and prayer. Stores and shops were closed and all business
                    halted. Services were held in the morning at the Methodist, Episcopal, and Catholic churches, and in
                    the evening the Presbyterian and

            As elsewhere throughout the state, there was in 
                        Mishawaka
                     and especially throughout the neighboring rural districts some sentiment for a peace
                        movement.65 Among the people of Indiana there was considerable opposition to
                    the war. The chief cause of this opposition was in the political partisanship which a great many
                    politicians were unable to lay aside.66 When the war opened, Democrats found it
                    necessary to readjust themselves rather quickly. They had recently been engaged in political
                    campaigns of some intensity and had continued to be critical and even hostile towards the Lincoln
                    and Morton administrations.67 In the first days of the war public criticism of
                    the conduct of the war was unwise. As time passed, however, open expression of adverse opinions
                    became less risky, and soon it became apparent that most Democrats would support the war effort, but
                    that they intended to maintain their position as the opposition party.68
                    Continuing Republican partisanship and Republican political and economic policies soon caused the
                    Democrats to dread certain possible results of the war.69 The Bull Run fiasco
                    dispelled all hope that the conflict would be a short one. Despite numerous Union meetings held
                    throughout the state where speakers orated scornfully to the fainthearted and shouted their contempt
                    of the secessionists and peace-lovers,70

                            government and declared that any man who found fault with the administration was a

                     it was impossible to conceal the fact that the Union defeat had
                    had a very sobering effect upon the people.71 Thereafter the reaction of the
                    Democrats steadily increased:72
                    
                        Disloyalty began to speak out in sneers and doubts and disparaging suggestions. Growing
                            bolder, it condemned the war and arraigned the constitutionality of the military measures of
                            the Government. It abused Mr. LINCOLN. It charged corruption wherever it could create
                            distrust or disaffection. It began to hold meetings and declare resolutions.73
                  
                    The response of the Republicans to this growing opposition was both fierce and partisan, and
                    before long they were again raising the cry of treason and identifying any sort of criticism with
                    that term.74
            
            Partisan reaction in 
                        Mishawaka
                     to peace meetings was typical of the rest of the state. No meetings were held in the
                    village, but at Jimtown, a few miles to the east, some two hundred people gathered and listened to
                    speakers who stated that the "war was an unholy one which would bankrupt the
                    nation," that it was "a war of extermination and annihilation," and that
                    the people of the South had the right to withdraw from the Union, "for the Declaration of
                    Independence gave them the right to alter or abolish any government that became oppressive to their
                    rights." One speaker stated that he believed it his patriotic duty to fight if Indiana was
                    invaded, but since this was not so, he advocated letting the South go its way and putting an end to
                    the war.75 The Enterprise reported this meeting, and then Editor Archibald Beal
                    stated emphatically: 
                        Now we are as much in favor of the right kind of peace as any man, and of giving the South
                            all their Constitutional rights in the Union, but when out of the Union and in armed
                            rebellion, with the overthrow of the Government for their object, we are in favor of giving
                            them nothing but what rebels and traitom should have—a sufficient amount of lead
                            and steel to make them return to their allegiance. What would a peace be worth when
                            purchased at the sacrifice of the Union, liberty and all else dear to Americans. Peace men

                             are only so much aid and support to the rebels and
                            should not be countenanced. What is the use of sending men away to fight for the Union, and
                            allow some at home to aid the rebels in their cause and in taking the lives of those we send
                                away.76
                  
                    The editor also believed that the Home Guards, which had been disbanded, should be
                    reorganized. He noted that "if there are as many secessionists around here holding meetings
                    as there are said to be, the service of a Home Guard may be needed."77
            
            On September 7, this same partisan Republican editor stated that "our paper is neither
                    Republican nor Democratic but unconditionally Union." Yet in an editorial of that date he
                    offered a plan which was rather highhanded and perhaps confused politics with patriotism. The editor
                    proposed 
                        to enable [citizens] to protect themselves against Traitors, and Treason in all forms,
                            without military aid. The plan proposed is, in addition to the law, to use public opinion in
                            the case, by keeping a certified public record of all acts and expressions of an unloyal
                            character, to be used as history against the persons making them. Then woe to the candidate
                            who shall come up for office in after years not having a clear record.78
                  
                     Editor Beal went on to write that the Enterprise office had not yet been demolished, but
                    that two subscribers had stopped the paper because of his stand on the war and the rebellion.

                            claimed that his political position was not among the extreme radicals of that period. He

                    Furthermore, he commented that all who did not like his views could "haul off as soon as

                     citizens' fear of being labeled suspect by Beal's plan brought about
                    a public meeting at Town Hall on September 2. It was called by persons who had subscribed to buy a
                    map of the 
                        United States
                     compiled by Commodore Matthew Maury, formerly of the 
                        United States
                     Navy. Maury had become a rebel, and the subscribers wanted a public record of their
                    refusal to have anything to do with the map, with Maury, or with the rebel cause. The subscribers at
                    the meeting agreed to refuse to honor their subscriptions when the agent came to deliver the
                        maps.80
            
            The war continued to bring work and prosperity to the village. Additional contracts secured by
                    Milburn, Eberhart and Company brought to six hundred the number of wagons to be manufactured. A
                    government inspector stationed in 
                        Mishawaka
                     to supervise the construction of the wagons told the Enterprise that
                    "there is no one shop in the Union which has so extensive and perfect machinery and which
                    can make as many in a given time as this one can."81 Mishawakans were
                    justly proud of their local company, but a charge was made that the concern was guilty of collusion
                    and of making excess profits. Both the Enterprise and the 
                  St. Joseph Valley Register printed a letter written to them for
                    publication by George Milburn in which he stated that a Mr. J. A. Liston had made such a charge in a
                    letter postmarked 
                        South Bend
                     and addressed to the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Daily State Sentinel. Milburn wrote that Liston had claimed in his letter to the
                    Sentinel that Milburn, Eberhart and Company was paid from $145 to $155 for
                    army wagons which could be profitably manufactured for $95, and therefore the company
                    made an extra $50 per wagon in profit. In addition to the charge of profiteering, Liston
                    had asked why proposed contracts for 
                  
                     79

                     building wagons were not publicly advertised and let to the
                    lowest bidder.82
            
            Milburn's letter gives an interesting insight into the methods of contract letting and wagon
                    manufacturing of that period. Milburn wrote: 
                        On the first day of June, I contracted with Major Sivley, acting Quartermaster General, for
                            one hundred army wagons for the sum of $140 each—on the 25th of June,
                            with General Meigs for 200 at $150 (one quarter of this number was built by
                            Messers. C. & J. M. Studebaker of 
                                South Bend
                            ) on July 11th for 100 at $125 and on the 31st of July for 200 at
                            $120, making an aggregate of 600 at an average of $127.50. This is all
                            that need be said about the price we get, though it is proper to say that until I took the
                            first contract at $140, the Government had never bought them for less than
                            $141;. and we furnished in addition to what previous contractors had done, a
                            fifth chain with stretchers and whiffletrees attached, making our price at least six dollars
                            less than ever before purchased; further, as before stated, Studebaker built fifty of the
                            wagons on our contract at $130 and they had the offer of fifty on our last
                            contract at $120 which they declined, not considering the compensation sufficient
                            to justify them in doing so—which at once puts to rest the charge that those
                            wagons can be profitably manufactured for the sum of $95, as no one knowing that
                            enterprising firm would believe they would throw away an opportunity to make the snug sum of
                            either $2,000 or $3,000.
                    
                
            In reply to the charge of collusion in the bidding for the contracts, Milburn added 
                        that proposals were published in the papers of all the important points in the Union, and not
                            only so, but printed specifications were extensively distributed by the different
                            Quartermasters to wagon makers, soliciting bids, and in every instance our contracts were
                            taken as low or lower than they were offered by any other contractors in the 
                                United States

                            Indianapolis
                        
                        Sentinel, August 10, 1861, there is a letter from a J. A. Liston attacking the
                        Republican party and stressing the states' rights principles set forth in the 
                            United States
                         Constitution. The Sentinel was a partisian anti-administration
                        paper. There was at times such strong public feeling against it that the editor was threatened
                        with personal violence and the paper's plant with destruction. Governor Morton was
                        urged to place armed guards in the Sentinel building to protect if from attack. See Foulke, Oliver P. Morton, I, 115.

            Milburn retorted that since Liston's letter was written to discredit the government and the
                    war effort, he would prove that the cost of wagons purchased by the government under the Democratic
                    administration prior to the war was higher than the cost for the army wagons being manufactured by
                    his company under war contracts. 
                        In the year 1859 we built for Messers. Russel, Majors & Waddell, and in 1860 for
                            Irwin Jackson & Co., some iron axle transportation wagons, of about the same
                            capacity of regular army wagons with this difference in furnishing them The army wagons are
                            fitted for six mules or horses, and have all the necessary fixings, as doubletrees,
                            stretchers, fifth chains, stay chains, etc. The transportation wagons have simply an ox
                            tongue without any chain, the army wagon we supply with a frame bed and wagon cover, the
                            other has a plank bed without a cover, and it will cost at least $25 more to make
                            and furnish the army wagon with all it requires than the transportation wagon—yet
                            for our contract of 600 army wagons we get at the rate of $127.50 each, and we
                            get for the transportation wagons $145.
                     Milburn concluded his defense by accusing Liston of belonging to the political party that
                    was in rebellion against the Union and stealing arms and forts from it. The reason for
                    Liston's charges, Milburn contended, was to hamper the Union war effort and promote the
                    cause of the southern rebellion.84
            
            The women of 
                        Mishawaka
                     contributed to the war effort by organizing themselves for war relief work. On October
                    14, at a meeting held at the residence of George Milburn, the ladies formed a Soldiers' Aid
                    Society to gather supplies to be forwarded to the volunteer soldiers from 
                        Mishawaka
                    . It was agreed that meetings would be held each Monday evening. A committee was
                    appointed to meet on Monday afternoons to receive donations and plan the work for the regular
                    evening meeting. People in the township as well as the village were asked to participate in the
                    project. Contributions of dried fruit, yarn, socks, blankets—anything that could be made
                    useful for the soldiers—were solicited. All articles left at the Milburn, Eberhart
                    hardware store would be collected by the ladies, processed, and sent to the men in the army
                        camps.85 The Soldiers' Aid Society remained active through-

                     out the war, collecting food and clothing for the volunteers.
                    Articles collected were sent to the Sanitary Commission in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , which sent these supplies on to the hospitals and army camps. Such hard work by women
                    throughout the North did much to relieve the suffering of the soldiers. When Governor Morton called
                    upon the citizens of the state to donate to the relief of the troops, 
                        Mishawaka
                     had an active organization ready to function, and the editor of the Enterprise could write: 
                        The ladies of 
                                Mishawaka
                            , God bless them, are ever ready to do their share in any good work, and we know
                            they will in this, without any urging through the paper. All that is necessary is to let
                            them know the need of help and it is sure to come. We understand that one lady alone will
                            contribute sixty pairs of socks.86
                  
                    
                
            The women were not alone in their efforts to minister to 
                        Mishawaka
                     soldiers, for on November 6 a meeting was held at the Presbyterian church for everyone,
                    regardless of church affiliation. The gathering was for prayer, music, and talks, but the main
                    purpose was to take up a collection to purchase the "Soldier's Camp
                    Library" for the men of Company I. This library consisted of twenty-five volumes of
                    religious books and tracts considered worthy to be sent to the soldiers. It was resolved that while
                    "the ladies took care of the body comforts of the boys—by sending them things to
                    keep them warm and to keep them from getting hungry—the men should think of the spiritual
                    well-being of the boys." A committee was appointed to collect money, purchase the books,
                    and send them to Captain James Houghton with the suggestion that he or the regimental chaplain act
                    as company librarian. All persons having secondhand books were urged to give them to the committee
                    as soon as possible. After some discussion it was decided that the men would rather have 
                  
                     86
                            Ibid. On October 10, 1861, Governor Morton "issued an appeal
                            ‘to the patriotic women of Indiana,’ calling attention to the approach
                            of winter and to the sufferings which the troops must undergo. Many articles, he said,
                            which, to men with houses and warm fires, were hardly more than luxuries, to those with no
                            protection but a tent, no bed but the ground, were absolute necessaries and might save many
                            lives which would be lost without them. These things, it was hoped the patriotic women of
                            Indiana would supply." Foulke, Olivar P. Morton, I, 159. Governor
                            Morton's appeal "To the Patriotic Women of Indiana," was the
                            first official attempt made to bring popular effort to the aid of the government. Indiana,

                     the local newspapers than a large number of
                    "Tracts" sent to them. Enough money was collected at the meeting to purchase the
                    library and to pay for the newspapers. The meeting closed when the people raised their voices in a
                    "united prayer for the temporal and spiritual welfare of the men, for victory soon and the
                    safe return of the soldier to the open arms of their loved ones."87
            
            During the later months of 1861, the effects of the war were seen in many ways in the village.
                    Additional young men were leaving for military service or government work. For example, Schuyler
                    Colfax secured an appointment for Edward Towle, son of Samuel Towle, to the Naval Academy at
                            
                  Newport, Rhode
                        Island
               , and young Towle left during September. In November,
                        William Lake went to 
                        Washington
                     to begin his duties as a clerk in a government office. Elmore Smith and Willis Pettit
                    enlisted in Captain Bush's artillery company and joined that command in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .88
            
            Controversies aroused by the war heightened tempers, and on August 24 the Enterprise stated, "It is about time that something was done to put a stop to rows
                    and fights in our streets," adding that "these unpleasant occurances are all
                    traceable in the first place to a use of too much whiskey." The day the men of Company I
                    left for camp there were five fights in town and one almost resulted in a general riot. One man
                    accused another of being a secessionist, and, both being quite drunk, they fought out their
                    differences in the center of Main Street. One beat the other badly and bit off a large portion of
                    his ear; then, fearing the action of the law, the winner ran away, supposedly to 
                        Canada
                    .89
            
            The town board, recognizing that something would have to be done, passed on August 23 an ordinance
                    compelling all venders of intoxicating liquors to obtain a license from the board. The license would
                    cost fifty dollars, and anyone selling liquors without it would be subject to a fine of not less
                    than twenty-five nor more than fifty dollars.90 At the next meeting of the
                    board, following the near riot, the following ordinance was passed:

            Not everything touching the lives of the people of 
                        Mishawaka
                     pertained to business, crime, and war. November 28 was set aside for a day of
                    thanksgiving, and Governor Morton "urged all to gather in their churches or around family
                    altars to give thanks for the many blessings that we have, and to pray that the national troubles
                    will soon pass away."92 There was a lighter side to life too. In
                    November J. F. Breyer and his celebrated 
                        New York
                     troupe of actors stopped at Milburn Hall for a few evenings. One night the program was
                        Lady of Lyons, with Jealous Wife as an
                    "afterpiece," and on the last evening the play was John Paul Jones,
                        America's Naval Hero, with How to Raise the Wind as an encore.
                    The Enterprise reported that the hall was well filled each night and that the plays were very
                        entertaining.93 During the same week, Professor G. P. Sands, "the
                    celebrated Magician and Ventriloquist," was entertaining the citizens at the town hall with
                    many new and astonishing feats. The "Original General Tom Thumb" was scheduled to
                    be in town on Friday, December 6.94
            
            After the Ninth Regiment had left Camp Colfax in September, they arrived in 
                        Virginia
                     without incident. The men sent news home in letters, some of which the Enterprise published. On September 26, a letter dated the twentieth arrived from George F.
                    Niles, stating that the regiment had arrived at Webster, 
                        Virginia
                    , at 4:00 A.M. on the Monday after it had left 
                        Mishawaka
                    . In the next four days, the men had marched sixty-five miles from Webster to their
                    destination at Camp Elk Fork on Elkwater Creek.95 On October 5, the Enterprise published a letter written by Captain Houghton to Harris

                     Hurlbut, dated Huttonsville, 
                        Virginia
                    , September 26, in which the Captain wrote that the troops had orders to march on the
                    rebels, and that the "Bloody Ninth" was to commence the attack. The Captain stated
                    his determination to honor the sword presented to him by the citizens of the village by
                    "making his mark with it on the rebels." The Enterprise added,
                    "We have not the slightest doubt but what the enemy will feel the weight of a small
                    ‘Argument’ when Colonel Milroy and his brave officers and men make a charge on
                        them."96 The Ninth skirmished with the rebels at Green Brier on
                    October 3, and at Allegheny, December 13, 1861. After defeating the enemy at these two places, the
                    regiment then remained in winter quarters at Cheat Mountain, 
                        Virginia
                    , until January 9, 1862.97
            
            During the campaign and while the regiment was in winter quarters, letters home contained more
                    serious news than they had previously. They told of numerous hardships, of rain and cold during the
                    long, dreary scouting parties, of illness, and of homesickness. In November Clark B. Crook wrote of
                    being on a five-day scouting trip, during which it rained all the time—a cold rain that
                    at times froze his whiskers. He wanted to hear from home and was glad to receive the newspapers, but
                    would most appreciate a good warm pair of boots. Crook said there was much sickness in the company,
                    mostly because of exposure to the terrible weather, and that Robert Boyd was in the hospital but was
                    not seriously ill.98 On November 23, however, the Enterprise
                    carried the following notice:

                            the summit of Cheat Mountain by the Ninth Indiana, and that the men of
                            the Fourteenth were very happy to leave "Cheat Mountain, its
                            chilling winds and everlasting fogs far behind." Howard R. Burnett (contrib.),

                            on the eve of the Green Brier reconnaiscance. He died in the service of his country and his

            News of the Ninth's war experiences continued to arrive in 
                        Mishawaka
                     by letter. William Giles wrote in November describing a long and hard scouting
                    expedition and then continued, 
                        Some of the boys are sick but most of them are feeling first rate. We have plenty to eat and
                            you can bet plenty of mud too. A good pair of boots would come in handy and a pair of
                            mittens also, but I can stand it as well as the rest of the boys who have not got them. Let
                            me say a word for the Relief Society. (God bless the ladies). We mostly want gloves,
                            comforts for our necks, and the little needfuls, such as needles and thread.100
                  
                    
                
            In the middle of December William Merrifield, second lieutenant of Company I, came home on furlough.
                    He was well and looked every inch the soldier. He stated that the men of Company I and the Ninth
                    were all well except for a few cases of slight illness. He went on to say that the regiment had good
                    winter quarters, plenty to eat, and warm clothing to wear. Besides news, Merrifield brought a large
                    sum of money from the men of the company, along with many letters. Merrifield's report on
                    the conditions of the camp at Cheat Mountain eased the home folks'
                    worry about the suffering of the men in 
                        Virginia

            On January 9, 1862, the Ninth Regiment was ordered to 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               . They
                    marched from their winter quarters on Cheat Mountain to Philippi, 
                        Virginia
                    , where they received new orders to remain at Fetterman, 
                        Virginia
                    . While at Fetterman there was much sickness and discouragement. In one week over three
                    hundred men became ill with mumps,

                     measles, and smallpox, and thirteen deaths resulted; in
                    addition, there were rumors that the regiment would be ordered to remain "among these
                    miserable mountains."102 On February 19, however, the group was ordered
                    to 
                        Louisville
                     and placed in Brigadier General William Nelson's division of Major General Don

            While the men of the Ninth Regiment were campaigning in 
                        Virginia
                    , another company of volunteers left 
                        Mishawaka
                    . In October, Governor Morton authorized the formation of the Forty-eighth Regiment,
                    which was to be recruited in the northern part of the state. This regiment was organized at Camp
                    Ellis in 
                        Goshen
                    , and 
                        Norman
                     Eddy, a prominent Democrat, was appointed by the governor to be its colonel. The camp
                    was named Camp Ellis in honor of Dr. E. W. H. Ellis, a leading citizen of 
                        Goshen
                    . Ellis, George Milburn, of 
                        Mishawaka
                    , and Thomas S. Stanfield, of 
                        South Bend
                    , were called the fathers of the regiment.104 An announcement was
                    made on October 12, that a company would be recruited in 
                        Mishawaka
                     for the Forty-eighth Regiment and that Barnett Byrkit would be captain.105 Recruiting for this new company went well, especially after a large patriotic rally
                    was held at Town Hall on the evening of November 2, when George Merrifield, Harris Hurlbut, Theodore
                    Cowles, and Milburn made patriotic speeches to arouse enthusiasm.106 On November
                    23, Captain Byrkit announced that the recruits of his company were to meet at the town hall on
                    Tuesday morning at eight o'clock prepared to leave for Camp Ellis. He warned them to bring
                    along quilts or blankets for their own use in case the army blankets had not yet arrived at the
                        camp.107 On November 30, the following announcement appeared in the
                    Enterprise: 
                        Thirty-three of Captain Byrkit's Company left here on last Tuesday morning for Camp
                            Ellis at 
                                Goshen
                            . They were generally ablebodied and good looking fellows. Previous to leaving
                            they held an election for 1st Lieutenent, which resulted

            The village seemed einpty without the men, for after their departure there was hardly a family that
                    did not have a loved one in f a r off 
                        Virginia
                     or at 
                        Goshen
                    . Still, as the old year drew to a close, the citizens looked forward to the joyous
                    Christmas season. Santa Claus came with presents for the children, there were decorated Christmas
                    trees, and the people of the village followed traditional ways in celebrating the birthday of the
                    Savior with religious services. In its last issue of the old year the Enterprise stated: 
                        We have not seen as much stir, nor a Christmas pass off as merrily, in 
                                Mishawaka
                             for a long time as did last Wednes-day, The day and sleighing were beautiful
                            and the town fullof people, who seemed bent on having as much fun as possible.109
                  
                    
                
            And so as the year 1861 came to an end-a year filled with exciting events but also with heartache and
                    sorrow the citizens of 
                        Mishawaka
                     did not realize how much their lives and their futures had been changed by war. The
                    early months had been frustrating ones, filled with uncertainty about the nation and its future, and
                    the secession of the southern states had brought many changes. People who had not understood the
                    threat of secession, o r who could not believe that a civil war was close a t hand, were guided by

                    while at home citizens donated money and worked in various patriotic activities. Later in the year,
                    forces released by war became noticeable in the village. War hysteria and intolerance influenced
                    some people. Inflation increased the hardships of the poor and of the soldiers' families.
                    Gambling, drinking, and other forms of vice were more in evidence. Casualties on the battle fronts
                    had touched few from the village, but in many families there was constant fear that sickness,
                    permanent disability, or death would come to a loved one. To Mishawakans as the year ended, the
                    future was still dark and filled with the uncertainties of war, but now preservation of the Union
                    became a symbol which would sustain and help them continue the fight for what they believed to be
                    right.

            Political parties developed in Indiana during the second quarter of the nineteenth century. In this
                    period, party organization, platforms, speakers' committees, and party conventions evolved
                    and became established. Party conventions, then considered very democratic, made nominations,
                    adopted platforms, and selected party leaders. Although Jeffersonian Republicanism had been the
                    dominant political philosophy during the initial quarter of the nineteenth century, real political
                    parties did not emerge in Indiana until the schism within the Jeffersonian Republicans, which
                    resulted from the presidential election of 1824. Soon after this election, followers of Adams and 
                        Clay
                     became National Republicans and those of Jackson and his associates, Democratic
                    Republicans. In 1834 the former were succeeded by the Whigs; meanwhile, the latter became known as
                    Democrats. The rivalry between the National Republican- Whig element and the Democratic Republicans
                    or Democrats continued until the Whigs were succeeded by the Republicans in 1854. Thus the
                    development of political parties during the second quarter of the nineteenth century also included
                    the evolution of the two-party system which has persisted to the present.
            The document that follows, though fragmentary, offers interesting and valuable information about the
                    organization and operation of political parties in Indiana at the township and county level during
                    their formative period. According

                            secretary for a time, presented the minutes book to the

                            in Indiana during the first half of the nineteenth century, see John D. Barnhart and Donald
                            F. Carmony, Indiana: From Frontier to Industrial Commonwealth (4 vols., 
                                New York

                     to this document, Whigs of 
                        Shelby County
                    , and especially those of Addison Township, in which 
                        Shelbyville
                     was located, organized a Clay Club in December, 1843, which met approximately twice
                    each month through July, 1844, when the minutes lapse. Additional pages of the document offer
                    information about two Rough and Ready clubs that the Whigs organized during the presidential
                    campaigns of 1844 and 1848. Though not part of the minutes of the Clay Club, these pages also offer
                    useful information about the organization and operation of political parties at the local level.
            The Clay Club was doubtless founded principally to rally support for Henry Clay as the Whig nominee
                    for president in 1844. Its minutes indicate that its important objectives included: collecting
                    newspapers to read, procuring and listening to speakers, obtaining public documents for study,
                    encouraging attendance at party meetings, and stimulating attendance at a mass meeting to whip up
                    support and enthusiasm for the party. Newspapers, oratory, and public documents played major roles
                    in pioneer campaigns and elections. The quibbling with the Democrats about plans for a debate and
                    the appointment of a vigilante committee suggest that members of the Clay Club were eager to make
                    certain that the rival Democrats gained no unearned advantage over them. Moreover, the use of music,
                    the erection of an ash pole, and the proposed mass meeting with several speakers invited indicate an
                    effort to reach voters by appealing to their emotions as well as to their heads.
            Most members of the Clay Club apparently were residents of 
                        Shelbyville
                    . Some of them had been among the early settlers of the town, which had become the 
                        Shelby County
                     seat in 1822.2 The correspondence of members of the Clay Club with
                    persons such as Caleb B. Smith, Whig congressman, and Henry S. Lane, a disciple of 
                        Clay
                     who later became governor of Indiana, illustrates that club members had political
                    contacts on the state level.
            
               
                  2 Since so many names of local residents appear in the document which
                        follows, and also because its primary value is in the information which it offers about party
                        organization and practices, no effort has been made to identify the several dozen such names
                        which are mentioned. Sketches or comments about a number of these persons are available in Brant
                        & Fuller (pubs.), History of 
                                Shelby County
                            , Indiana (
                            Chicago
                        , 1887), and Edward H. Chadwick, Chadwick's History of 
                                Shelby County
                            , Indiana (
                            Indianapolis
                        , 1909). These volumes also offer information about the early history of 
                            Shelby County
                        , 
                            Shelbyville
                        , Addison Township, etc.
            
            
            Perhaps publication of this document will bring to light other documents for subsequent publication
                    which will offer further information about the organization and operation of political parties at
                    the township and county level. At any rate, the study of party organization and voting behavior at
                    the local level is essential to an adequate understanding of party organization and voting behavior
                    at state and national levels.

                        been retained except that commas have been added in series, and periods have been added after
                        common abbreviations and at the ends of sentences where these marks were lacking in the
                        manuscript. In various instances the writer's intention in capitalization and
                        punctuation was uncertain; hence, in such situations current usage has been followed as closely
                        as possible. Some changes in format or spacing have been necessary and a few indiscriminate
                        marks or blurs have been ignored. Otherwise, the original copy which is preserved in the library

                        in full except for the items noted in the final footnote and a few scattered items which,
                        because of their location, script, or content, were obviously not intended as part of the
                        document proper.

            The above committee were continued untill the next meeting of the club. The following Resolution was
                    then offered by by [sic] Mr. Teal Resolved, that the club reserve to themselves
                    the right of excluding all persons who are not friendly to the advancement of Whig principles from
                    attending their meetings. On motion of Dr. Day, that that [Sic] the committee of arrangements, be
                    requested to assertain the best terms that a room can be obtained, for the meetings of the club, and
                    also a reading room, and report next meeting, Messrs. Skelton, Browning, and Eliott, committee. On
                    Motion, The club passed an order, authorising the treashurer to pay for the printing of Bills,
                    & writing paper, &c. on motion the following persons were appointed a committee to
                    prepare

                     5 Presumably the newspapers listed here were all Whig papers, largely
                            from states other than Indiana. The Indiana Journal, 
                                Indianapolis
                            , was commonly regarded as the Whig organ for Indiana. The

                             Sun were also Indiana newspapers of the Whig persuasion. A number of references
                            to these four papers are included in the editor's research notes concerning the
                            pioneer press of Indiana. The names that follow the listing for these papers doubtless refer
                            to persons who supplied copies of particular papers, since the names are of local residents
                            rather than of editors or publiihers.

            Preamble.10
            
            Whereas, it is customary, upon the approach of a Presidential canvass, for both of the two great
                    political parties, into which the people of this union are divided, to form themselves into
                    political associations, and whereas in the opinion of the undersigned citizens of Addison Township
                    and 
                        Shelby County
                    , the time has arrived when they should form themselves into a rough and ready Club, for
                    the purpose of Communing with each other, and of advancing the interests of the Whig party in 
                        Shelby County
                    , and for the organization of the same, do hereby agree to be governed by the following
                    Constitution to wit:
            Constitution
            Article 1st This society shall be known by the name and style of the 
                        Shelbyville
                     Centeral rough and ready Club, of 
                        Shelby County
                    .
            Article 2d The officers of this club, shall consist of a President, a Vice
                    President, a Secretary, a Treasurer, and a standing Committee of three.
            Article 3d
            
            It shall be the duty of the President, or in his absence the vice President, to preside at all
                    meetings of the Club, to preserve order in all its transactions, to call extra meetings at any time
                    the interests of the party may require it, and to give the casting vote when the Club is equally
                    divided.
            Article 4th
            
            It shall be the duty of the Secretary, to keep a correct record of all the proceedings of the Club,
                    to sign orders on the 
                  
                     10 In the original document this preamble appears twice. Both copies
                            are almost exactly alike. In the text which follows, the second copy of the preamble is used
                            because it connects immediately with the text of the constitution. The material that follows
                            is not a part of the record of the Clay Club. It is included here, however, because it
                            offers relevant information about party organization and party practices in the
                            1840's. These pages offer information about the formation of Rough and Ready clubs
                            to encourage support of the Whigs in the presidential campaigns of 1844 and 1848. Some of
                            the people mentioned in the following material are the same as those already noted as
                            members of the Clay Club, but this is to be expected since Addison Township took the lead in
                            organizing all of these clubs, and also because Henry Clay was the Whig nominee for
                            president in 1844.
               
                     treasurer, to collect and pay over to the treasurer all moneys
                    due the club, and to give notice to the members of all extra meetings called by the president.
            Article 5th
            
            It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to receive all monies from the hands of the Secretary, and to
                    pay the same out on order of the Club, Signed by the President and Counter signed by the Secretary.
            Article 6th
            
            It shall be the duty of the standing Committee to make all the necessary arrangements for the
                    meetings of the club, to furnish the room with lights at the expence of the club, and to make all
                    other arrangements, that the convenience of the club may from time, to time require.
            Article 7th
            
            It shall be the duty of the club, at their first meeting after the addoption of this constitution, to
                    appoint a corresponding committee of three, whose duty it shall be to lay before the club, from
                    time, to time, all such matters as appertain to the interests of the Whig party.
            Article 8th
            
            By laws, not repugnant to this Constitution, may be addopted at any regular meeting of the Club.
            Saturday Evening July 15th 1848
            The Whigs of Addison Township, met at the Court house, for the purpose of forming a rough and ready

            Few Americans have been more venerated during their lifetimes than Benjamin Franklin. In his later
                    years he occupied a place in the hearts of his countrymen second only to that of George Washington.
                    Nor has the luster tarnished with time. No fewer than six editions of 
                        Franklin
                    's works, five published in the nineteenth century, testify to his enduring
                    popularity. During the half-century following his death in 1790, William Duane, William Temple
                    Franklin, and Jared Sparks published many of 
                        Franklin
                    's writings in six, three, and ten volumes respectively. In 1887-1888 John
                    Bigelow, discoverer of the original manuscript of 
                        Franklin
                    's autobiography, presented a new ten-volume collection. The most recent
                    edition of 
                        Franklin
                     papers is Albert Henry Smyth's ten volumes, the first of which was issued in
                    1906, the bicentennial of 
                        Franklin
                    's birth. All of these editions were necessarily selective, and a number of
                    excellent smaller volumes appearing over the last half-century did not begin to exhaust the vast
                    amount of 
                        Franklin
                     material scattered throughout American and European libraries and private collections.
                    Scholars will therefore welcome this first volume of the new and comprehensive edition of Benjamin
                    Franklin's papers.
            Edited by Leonard W. Labaree with the assistance of Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., Helen C. Boatfield, and
                    Helene H. Fineman and sponsored jointly by Yale University and the American Philosophical Society
                    with generous support from Life magazine, The Papers of Benjamin
                        Franklin will fill a projected forty volumes. The editors promise to present the full text
                    of every document written by Franklin alone or with others, including both preliminary and final
                    versions of important state papers in which he participated and those essays to the press for which
                    the weight of the evidence indicates his authorship. They will also edit "letters and other
                    communications, personal or official, addressed to 
                        Franklin
                     individually, or to an official body of which he was a member" (p. xxxv). In
                    addition, some third-party letters and copies of essays or treatises sent to 
                        Franklin
                     for his information or comment will be printed. Not to be included are large volumes of
                    records of his printing business and post office affairs; documents of such bodies as the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     assembly and the Library Company of 
                        Philadelphia
                     which he served as secretary or clerk; and routine official documents that he handled
                    as minister to 
                        France
                     or in another official capacity. But the editors will give a description and the
                    location of each document not printed.
            The first volume easily meek the high standards set by the editors. It contains all of the known 
                        Franklin
                     material from his birth on January 6, 1706, to December 31, 1734. Only five letters
                    from 
                    
                        Franklin
                     and one to him survive for these years, and his early published writings in newspapers,
                    pamphlets, and almanacs fill most of the volume. Materials on the first sixteen years of 
                        Franklin
                    's life are scanty, consisting only of records of birth and baptism, some of
                    his father's writings, and a few possible remains of his own early ballads. The record is
                    fuller beginning in 1722 with the Silence Dogood letters, published in the 
                  
                            New England
                         Courant. Thereafter, the amount of 
                        Franklin
                    's literary productions increased, and the volume contains a number of his
                    contributions to the American Weekly Mercury and the 
                  
                            Pennsylvania
                         Gazette; the first two years of Poor Richard's
                    Almunack; and his two earliest pamphlets, A Dissertation on Liberty and
                    Necessity, published in 
                        London
                     in 1725, and A Modest Enquiry into the Nature and Necessity of a
                        Paper-Currency, published in 
                        Philadelphia
                     in 1729. Many other miscellaneous documents throw much light on 
                        Franklin
                    's early business interests and his relationship with the Junto, the Library
                    Company, and the St. John's Lodge of Masons. Here too are 
                        Franklin
                    's fascinating "Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion" as
                    well as the epitaph he composed for himself at the age of twenty-two.
            A model of editorial accomplishment, the volume contains explanatory introductions to all documents
                    that require them and ample notes. The editors have further enhanced its value by providing a full
                    genealogy of the Franklin family, a thorough index, and a statement of editorial method that might
                    well serve as a guide to all editors of eighteenth century material.
            
               The Papers of Benjamin Franklin has made an auspicious beginning. Along with The Papers of Thomas Jefferson and projects now in progress to publish similar
                    editions of the papers of John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison, it will provide the
                    student of early American history with a wealth of published personal materials for the leading
                    statesmen of the period that is perhaps unparalleled for any other field of history.

            The publication of the Adams-Jefferson correspondence by the Institute of Early American History and
                    Culture is an event of major importance to all students of American history and to all scholars of
                    the Age of the Enlightenment. Not since the appearance of Zoltan Haraszti's John Adam and the Prophets of Progress in 1952 has so penetrating a light been shed upon
                    the intellectual world of Adams,  and the feast that is spread
                    before Jefferson enthusiasts in these two volumes should add zest to new labors. Perhaps the most
                    important thing to be said about these letters is that they are revelations of the most intimate
                    kind. While every public question that ever engaged the energies of these two great men is touched
                    upon, often in depth, it is with a profound sense of having been exposed to a great body of
                    literature that one reads this correspondence. If there is a subject that eighteenth-century men
                    were likely to have pondered or a problem in religion, history, government, or the practical arts
                    that men of the Revolutionary generation might be expected to have wrestled with, Jefferson and
                    Adams pondered or wrestled with it. Fortunately, their letters were written for one another out of a
                    friendship that grew deeper as a result of the problems they encountered in preserving it. It is not
                    difficult to hear the voices of men talking, oblivious to the use which listeners may make of their
                    words. They communicated in order to make themselves understand, not by posterity, but by one
                    another. The result is an unrivaled clarity of meaning and expression that would certainly have been
                    lost otherwise.
            All of the letters contained in these volumes are either already available or soon will be in
                    editions of the Adams and Jefferson papers. Great value is to be gained, nevertheless, in having the
                    exchange of thought between these two men in juxtaposition. Their differences of temperament and
                    background are the more apparent, and their wide areas of agreement the more surprising as a result.
                    Differences so bitterly felt during the period covered by their presidential administrations receded
                    into the background as they became increasingly aware of the importance of their Revolutionary
                    heritage, an awareness sharpened as contemporaries slipped away. A better explanation of what deism
                    implied to men who reached maturity in the latter half of the eighteenth century would be difficult
                    to find outside these letters. Adams and Jefferson's concurrence on religious questions and
                    their vital sense of the meaningfulness of life heightened their sense of dedication to the cause of
                    freedom as they grew older. Yet the skepticism of Adams and the sanguine expectations of Jefferson
                    remained constant.
            Lester J. Cappon's introductory passages to each of the chronological periods covered by the
                    letters of the friendship, his footnotes, and his editorial sense are admirable. Wisely, he chose to
                    include Abigail Adams' sprightly letters to Jefferson written during the middle period of
                    their lives. The impression remains that Jefferson found the 
                        New England
                     matron more congenial than her husband in this period, for there is a jocular quality
                    to his 
                        Paris
                     letters that is rare in the broad range of his writings. John Adams, who wrote more
                    profusely and more often than Jefferson, reveals all the strength and vitality that was in him in
                    these letters. We stand in debt to Mr. Cappon and the many others to whom he so generously pays
                    tribute in his introduction for making readily available the record of a great friendship and some
                    of the finest prose in the English language.

                     Press, 1959. Pp. XV, 1037. Frontispiece, index. $15.00.)
            This volume, inaugurating a projected ten-volume edition of the papers of Henry Clay, will delight
                    scholars concerned with the first sixty years of the Republic. That Clay's papers have
                    sufficient historical significance to merit this ambitious effort would appear obvious from the
                    public record of the noted Kentuckian. In quantity alone they are quite astonishing. The first
                    thousand pages span only the years from 1797 to the conclusion of the Ghent negotiations in
                    December, 1814. In large measure, they reveal 
                        Clay
                    's early activities in law, land speculation, and horse racing. Occasional
                    papers, usually signed "Scaevola" or "Regulus," suggest his
                    early interest in politics. But much of this material illustrates the sometimes tenuous relationship
                    between the importance of an individual and the general usefulness of his papers, for the value of
                    the latter is determined more by their intrinsic quality as historical documents than by the
                    prominence of the man or his correspondents. With the exception of several letters to 
                        Clay
                     from 
                        Louisiana
                    , for example, there is little of consequence in this volume on frontier development.
            As the young 
                        Clay
                     became increasingly concerned with national and international affairs, his papers
                    assume a broader meaning. 
                        Clay
                    's early nationalism was apparent when he wrote on the prospects of war in
                    1806: "Perhaps this is a fortunate moment to repress European Aggression; and to evince to
                    the world that Americans appreciate their rights in such a way as will induce them, when violated,
                    to engage in War with alacrity and effect" (p. 216). 
                        Clay
                    's Jeffersonian proclivities were made clear in a set of resolutions, rephrased
                    by him, which passed the 
                        Kentucky
                     House of Representatives in 1808 with one dissenting vote. These resolutions concluded
                    with the observation that "Thomas Jefferson is entitled to the thanks of his country, for
                    the ability, uprightness and intelligence which he has displayed in the management both of our
                    foreign relations and domestic concerns" (pp. 388-389). Similarly Clay voiced his early
                    philosophic allegiance to Jefferson in his vigorous argument against the recharter of the first 
                        United States
                     Bank in the federal House of Representatives in 1811. At the same time, 
                        Clay
                    , as a western expansionist, demanded action against Great Britain.
            For the diplomatic historian, the final 150 pages of this volume are of particular value, for they
                    relate 
                        Clay
                    's role as a member of the American peace delegation to Europe. Here are 
                        Clay
                    's observations on European politics, written at Gottenburg before the British
                    and American negotiators met at Ghent, as well as William H. Crawford's persistent warnings
                    from 
                        Paris
                     and the lengthy journals of the Ghent negotiations themselves. To fill some gaps in 
                        Clay
                    's record, the editors have cited pertinent diplomatic correspondence in the
                    appropriate volumes of the American State Papers, Foreign Relations.
            This volume reveals on every hand the painstaking effort of those who amassed this 
                        Clay
                     material. Each volume in the series will be  fully
                    indexed, although there will be a general index in the final volume. Any 
                        Clay
                     papers that are discovered too late for inclusion in the proper chronological volume
                    will be published in the last volume. The book-making and editing are superb, and the editors have
                    introduced their voluminous annotations at the end of each entry for easy reference. Historians will
                    anticipate with pleasure the appearance of future volumes in this impressive undertaking.

               The Congress Founds the Navy, 1787-1798. By Marshall Smelser. (Notre Dame, Ind.:
                    University of Notre Dame Press, 1959. Pp. ix, 229. Appendices, bibliographical note, index.
                    $5.00.)
            After reading Dr. Smelser's preliminary articles on the founding of the navy in the 
                  
                            United States
                         Naval Institute Proceedings and in Military Affairs, this
                    reviewer awaited publication of the full work with great anticipation. He was not disappointed, for
                        Congress Founds the Navy is the definitive study of the establishment of the 
                        United States
                     Navy during 1787 to 1798. It is, moreover, a carefully reasoned and well-researched
                    study written with touches of dry wit.
            The book is basically a study in the politics of the Federalist period. As such, it corrects several
                    common misconceptions. For instance, it demonstrates the inaccuracy of the frequently repeated claim
                    that Congress wished to do more than it did about the Algerine depredations before 1793, but was
                    frustrated by the country's weakness. As Dr. Smelser points out, the problem was generally
                    overlooked and its rival claimants for Congressional attention "had the advantage of being
                    in some congressional constituency" (p. 44).
            Dr. Smelser's thesis is not unique but seems to this reviewer to be both apt and accurate.
                    "In the Federalist Period," he says, "naval policy was made in
                    Congress…. Only the most technical details, such as the exact dimensions of ships and the
                    precise tables of organization, were left to the executive, The policy which was enacted was the
                    policy of congressional Federalists" (p. 200). Since these statements infer a lack of
                    direction by Federalist administrations, particularly that of George Washington, it would have been
                    worthwhile for Dr. Smelser to have pointed out the then current concept of the division of powers
                    between the executive and legislative branches. In this connection it is useful to remember the
                    words used by George Washington in his first inaugural address: "It will be …
                    far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation
                    of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism
                    which adorn the characters [of the congressmen] selected to devise and adopt them."
            It can be argued that the 
                        United States
                     Navy came into existence more from force of circumstances than from design. This
                    contention is amply supported by Congress Founds the Navy. In it Dr. Smelser
                    points out that during 
                        Washington
                    's first administration there was no attempt to create a navy because Congress
                    saw no immediate need for  one and assigned the task a low
                    priority. The first halting steps were taken because something had to be done to protect American
                    shipping heretofore shielded by Portuguese warships which kept the Algerians confined to the
                    Mediterranean. It remained for the depredations of French privateers during 1797 and 1798, combined
                    with national infuriation at the XYZ Affair, to force a reluctant Congress to send a navy to sea.
            This study was written by Dr. Smelser while he was a Forrestal Fellow in naval history at 
                        Annapolis
                    , It is the first study published under that grant. If other studies approach this one
                    in merit, it is to be hoped that they too will soon be published.

            In the annals of American biography, the 1950's may go down in history as the "be
                    kind to businessmen decade." John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford were favorably
                    reinterpreted in full-length studies by Allan Nevins. Even Jay Gould found an able apologist in
                    Julius Grodinsky. Finally at the close of the decade this revisionist trend reached a culmination in
                    the book under review, Thomas Payne Govan's adulatory biography of Nicholas Biddle.
            In his Preface Govan says: "I began the research upon which this book is based, with the
                    intention of writing an objective, impartial biography that would do justice to Biddle and his
                    opponents alike. This ambition has not been fulfilled. I have written an apologia, a defense
                    … but I could do nothing else and remain loyal to the evidence." Even this
                    candid statement hardly prepares the reader for what follows. In the first chapter, Govan states his
                    belief that as a boy Biddle did not inherit privilege or status. He then provides an account of
                    Biddle's distinguished ancestry, his father's career as a leading citizen of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , his boyhood home "in the fashionable section of the city," and his
                    education at both the University of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Princeton
                    .
            Throughout Biddle's struggle with Jackson over the rechartering of the second Bank of the 
                        United States
                     and his later attempt to play the role of central banker after his institution had been
                    chartered by the state of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , Govan defends his hero with unquestioning devotion. Neither omitting nor playing down
                    the aspects of Biddle's career which have been most criticized, Govan finds that
                    Biddle's course was uniformly wise, his purpose always to promote the national welfare, and
                    his interpretation of that welfare enlightened. Biddle's thoughts seem almost to become
                    those of the author. Even Biddle's megalomaniacal rationalizations during his last
                    desperate years are accepted without question. Thus, when Biddle (or is it Govan? One is seldom
                    quite sure.) contended that Jackson and Van Buren were really responsible for the near insolvency of
                    the state of 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , that he (Biddle) bribed  members of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     legislature for patriotic reasons, and that he speculated in cotton and objected to the
                    resumption of specie payments for the public good, Govan never raises any question as to the
                    soundness of Biddle's explanations.
            The book reflects the narrowness of the author's research, which consists chiefly of an
                    exhaustive examination of the Biddle papers. Much might have been gained had more attention been
                    devoted to other contemporary records, even to the secondary accounts of the period.
            In defense of this book, it can be said that the author threads his way with some skill through the
                    complicated political intrigues of the age and that he competently and lucidly describes
                    Biddle's involved banking and foreign exchange operations. Possibly this strongly partisan
                    and uncritical study provides an understanding of Nicholas Biddle, the man, which might not be
                    gained from a less friendly biography.

               The Philosophy of Abraham Lincoln: In his own Words. Compiled by William E.
                    Baringer. Keystone Series. Edited by C. A. Muses. (Indian
                    Hills, Colo.: Falcon's Wing Press, 1959. Pp. xxxii, 167. $3.50.)
            Almost twenty-five years ago Louis A. Warren, then editor of the 
                  
                            Larue County
                         Herald of Hodgenville, 
                        Kentucky
                    , published Lincoln's Parentage and Childhood. A product of
                    rigorous research and critical analysis, the book replaced many a flimsy legend with solid fact,
                    raised the status of the Lincoln family, and demonstrated that Lincoln's early years were
                    considerably less drab than they had previously been pictured.
            The book also led to 
                        Warren
                    's appointment as Director of the Lincoln National Life Foundation at 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , Indiana. Lincoln students hoped that he would soon do for the Indiana
                    years—also a murky period—what he had done for the 
                        Kentucky
                     years. The duties of his position, however, were too onerous, so it was not until his
                    retirement in 1956 that he could really devote himself to the Indiana book.
            The result, one regrets to say, is disappointing. The text is padded with long excerpts or summaries
                    of books which 
                        Warren
                    , sometimes on doubtful authority, credits Lincoln with having read, and with much
                    silly, unsupported tradition—which the author rejects, to be sure—that could
                    better have been omitted altogether. (Chapter XII, "Romance," is a case in point.)
                    In addition, there are far too many suppositious statements: "This book must have impressed
                    Abraham …" (p. 111), "As a boy Abe may have heard from his father the
                    tragic story of John Fitch …" (p. 148), "Apparently Abe had performed
                    his tasks  on the flatboat competently and after his return he
                    may have been employed in the store at intervals by Gentry" (p. 187).
            In treating two subjects long controversial Warren has abandoned all caution. Nancy Hanks, he says,
                    "was the only daughter of James and Lucy (Shipley) Hanks" (p. 6), and hence of
                    legitimate parentage. He may be right, but his case is not strong enough to justify a categorical
                    assertion. 
                        Warren
                     repeatedly credits Nancy Hanks Lincoln with the ability to read—with
                    teaching young Abraham his letters and reading the Bible to him—in spite of the fact that
                    the only contemporary document which bears her name is signed with her mark.
            While 
                        Warren
                     makes some corrections in the Indiana story, and has performed a useful service in
                    bringing together all that is known, the general picture established by William H. Herndon and
                    redrawn on better authority by Albert J. Beveridge remains unchanged. One must conclude that there
                    is simply no basis in existing historical sources for a different interpretation. If there were,
                    Louis A. Warren would have found it and used it well.
            Mr. Baringer's anthology needs only a few words. The Introduction—a polemic by
                    the general editor, C. A. Muses against the communistic dialectic-is completely irrelevant.
                    Baringer's definition of Lincoln's "philosophy" may be inferred
                    from his inclusion of items like the following: "Dr. Zacharie has operated on my feet with
                    great success, and considerable addition to my comfort" (p. 18); and "Today I
                    verbally told Colonel Worthington that I did not think him fit for a Colonel; and now, upon his urgent request, I put it in writing" (p. 21). The book lacks a subject
                    index, a fault which strips any compilation of this kind of most of its value.

            Professor Bell Irvin Wiley, author of the historical narrative for They Who Fought
                    Here, has produced an extremely interesting account of the life of the common soldier on both
                    sides during the Civil War. Emphasis is primarily upon the lot of infantrymen—and the
                    overwhelming preponderance of troops on both sides were in that group. The substantial similarity of
                    the life led by Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs is frequently indicated. Attention is given to important
                    topics such as enlistments, rations, clothing and shelter, weapons, diversions, crime and  punishment, morals and religion, sickness and casualties, and
                    getting the infantry to the front. Most of the account is concerned with the life of common soldiers
                        between battles. Extensive use of quotations from letters of soldiers adds
                    desirable flavor and atmosphere, but unfortunately these and other quotations are seldom traceable.
                    Numerous pictures, for which Hirst D. Milhollen was responsible, illustrate the narrative, and
                    fortunately they are generally closely related to the immediate text. A careful reading of this
                    volume and a thoughtful viewing of its pictures are likely to leave many readers with an increased
                    feeling that the Civil War was possibly the greatest tragedy in American history.
            
               From the Cannon's Mouth consists chiefly of Civil War letters which
                    General Alpheus S. Williams wrote to his daughters—but with discussions of family matters
                    largely deleted. General Williams, who settled in 
                        Detroit
                     in 1836, served as a brigadier general in the Union army, 1861-1865. The value of
                    General Williams' comments about the war is enhanced by the fact that he was at such
                    important places as Second Bull Run, 
                        Antietam
                    , Chancellorsville, 
                  Gettysburg,
                            Atlanta
               , Savannah, etc. Normally reflecting
                    no bitterness toward friend or foe, these letters describe battles, ups and downs of the war,
                    problem of preparing for battles, the boredom and sacrifice of soldiers, the destruction wrought
                    upon the South, and political aspects of the war. This volume makes clear that generals as well as
                    privates faced problems, especially when they saw less experienced and less well-qualified men
                    promoted ahead of or over them.
            Presumably this is the last of numerous books, articles, documents, and reviews from the pen of Milo
                    M. Quaife. Dr. Quaife's death during the fall of 1959 in an automobile accident ended his
                    distinguished career as editor, teacher, and scholar. His influence is writ large in the development
                    of historical knowledge and interest in the American Middle West among adults as well as among
                    students. A general idea of Dr. Quaife's amazing contributions is indicated in Forty-six Years: The Published Writings of Milo M. Quaife, 1910-1955, edited by Joe L.
                    Norris and published by the Algonquin Club of 
                        Detroit
                     in 1956.
            
               The Civil WUT Dictionary totals almost a thousand pages, and it includes
                    information about military and civilian leaders, battles, military terms, weapons, etc. regarding
                    both the North and South during the Civil War. A number of maps and diagrams are included. A wide
                    variety of persons, from Civil War buffs to editors and professional historians, will doubtless make
                    use of this volume. Lieutenant Colonel Boatner's Dictionary is certainly
                    timely, but the merits of such a volume are extremely difficult to evaluate. Very likely it will
                    prove most useful to those individuals who employ it as a guide or an aid regarding particular items
                    concerning the Civil War and somewhat disappointing to persons who endeavor to use it, or any other
                    single volume, to find the "answers" to questions about the Civil War.

            While the Civil War has long been of interest to the military writer and biographer in the 
                        United States
                     that struggle has also fired the attention of foreign military students and scholars.
                    In this superb work Mr. Luvaas traces the influence of the Civil War on European military literature
                    and thought from the reports of "on-the-spot" observers to post-World War I
                    writings. His general thesis is that although technological developments made during the Civil War
                    were noted by observers at the time of the conflict, and by military staffs and students in Europe
                    after the war, tactical and strategic lessons were disregarded because they conflicted with
                    prevailing military doctrine or more recent lessons derived from continental battlefields.
            In the case of the German General Staff, except for the idea of military use of railways, the Civil
                    War did not have an influence on official doctrine. In the years after the Franco-Prussian War the
                    Germans gave little official attention to the Civil War because the American experience did not give
                    the answer to the vital strategic problem of Moltke's successors: a two-front war and the
                    necessity for a quick victory. In the years before 1914, the French gave little serious study to the
                    epic struggle of the American Republic because of the pervasive Napoleonic influence and the
                    "cult of the offensive." In the case of Great Britain, we find more interest being
                    given to the study of the Civil War in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mainly
                    through the efforts of the famed biographer of Stonewall Jackson and noted British military mentor,
                    G. F. R. Henderson. Luvaas, who has edited a volume of Henderson's writings on the Civil
                    War, claims that the latter did not leave his mark on any specific tactical or other military reform
                    but emphasized through his study of the Civil War a flexible approach to military thought in
                    general. Paradoxically, Henderson's flexible and inquisitive attitude became the agent of a
                    dogmatic approach to the study of the Civil War, and in the years after Henderson's death
                    in 1903 British military writers saw only what they wanted to see from the Civil War to prove their
                    particular point, and little emphasis was placed on objectivity toward military problems.
            With the holocaust of 1914-1918 "new lenses" were provided with which to view the
                    Civil War, and in 
                        England
                     enthusiasm for the war was more intense than before 1914. This was the result of the
                    work of J. F. C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart. These two brilliant military scholars gave attention
                    to the Western theater, the campaigns of Grant and Sherman, and stressed the constant factors of
                    warfare such as command, strategy, and psychology of leadership.
            The author has performed a prodigious task in his study of French, German, and British military
                    literature covering the years since 1861, and his work reflects his excellent knowledge of European
                    military developments during these years. This volume is a distinct contribution to recent works on
                    military affairs; in particular, the discussion of Henderson and his legacy to British military
                    thought is instructive for  the student of military history.
                    Luvaas' work is also a singular addition to Civil War historiography in the respect that
                    the author relates or connects the war with contemporary and subsequent military affairs in Europe.
            An excellent presentation of footnotes at the bottom of each page partially offsets the glaring
                    omission of a bibliography or even a bibliographical note.

               Money, Class, and Party: An Economic Study of Civil War and Reconstruction. By
                    Robert P. Sharkey. Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political
                    Science, Series LXXVII (1959), Number 2. (
                        Baltimore

            In this iconoclastic study Professor Sharkey explores many aspects of the financial history of the
                    Civil War and Reconstruction. He deals with the origin of the greenbacks and with their importance
                    as an expedient of war finance. He analyzes the political struggle over currency contraction and
                    inquiries into the economic rationale of bankers, manufacturers, laborers, and farmers.
            At the outset Professor Sharkey argues that one must not magnify the importance of the greenbacks as
                    a factor in financing the war, since the total net issues of legal tender notes in the years
                    1861-1865 accounted for less than one-sixth of the total cost of the war. Yet the author maintains
                    that the country desperately needed an adequate medium of exchange at this time. Thus, he concludes,
                    one can make a strong case for the "necessity" of the greenbacks.
            Continuing his well-documented assault upon orthodox conceptions, Professor Sharkey contends that
                    farmers were not duly concerned with fiscal matters in the period under consideration. He cites
                    statistics indicating farm prosperity in the immediate postwar era and concludes that this
                    prosperity is the reason that there is little evidence of economic discontent among farmers during
                    that period. He says that farm prosperity contributed to the Democratic defeat in 1868-that farmers
                    generally ignored the money question and voted Republican.
            This reviewer's colleague, Professor R. C. Buley, has often asserted that on few questions
                    is there a common business viewpoint. Professor Sharkey substantiates this position by demonstrating
                    that business interests differed sharply on fiscal matters during the Civil War and Reconstruction
                    era. He shows that spokesmen for manufacturers, such as Thaddeus Stevens, "Pig
                    Iron" Kelley, and Peter Cooper strongly opposed any attempt to contract the greenbacks,
                    while commercial and financial interests generally favored contraction.
            In his conclusion the author devotes considerable space to a strong criticism of the analysis of the
                    fiscal history of the Civil War and Reconstruction period which the Beards forwarded in The Rise of American Civilization. He believes that many misconceptions on the  subject are Beardian in origin. The criticism is well grounded. Yet the
                    Beards were presenting a synthesis covering the gamut of American history and were almost certain to
                    repeat the errors of those who had made more detailed studies of the period. The Rise
                        of American Civilization is a sixteen-hundred-page work and only a half-dozen or so of
                    those pages touch upon the fiscal history of the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Obviously the
                    Beards could not explore in detail each facet of history dealt with in their study. Doubtless
                    Professor Sharkey recognizes this, but he should have made the point clear and mitigated the sting
                    of his criticism accordingly.
            Summing up, this is an important study of a much misunderstood period of American history. The book
                    is the product of painstaking research, and it should result in the revision of a number of
                    erroneous ideas about that period. Of especial value to many students of Civil War and
                    Reconstruction history will be Professor Sharkey's bibliographical essay.

               1877: Year of Violence. By Robert V. Bruce. (

            Times were hard in 1877. Railroad workers, already underpaid, were faced with new wage cuts. Summer
                    came, and with it a tragic episode in American labor history.
            In great detail, the author describes the strike of the Trainmen's Union against the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                    , the 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , the Reading, the Erie, the 
                        New York
                     Central, and closely allied lines. The contempt of management for labor leaders; its
                    disregard for the unemployed, the aged, the poorly paid; its stubborn insistence on big dividends
                    alongside pay cuts—these are discussed at length.
            Management techniques in handling union members—the black list, prompt dismissal of
                    workers after participation in union activities, employment of Pinkerton detectives, and refusal to
                    bargain—are all illustrated with vigor. Almost without exception, the executive heads of
                    American railroads in 1877 are portrayed as enemies of the working-man, as reactionaries, and as
                    patronizing, yet firm, masters of certain mayors, governors, congressmen, and, by inference, some
                    officials on still higher levels.
            Interestingly and effectively the author presents an hour-by-hour account of vicious attacks on
                    private property by maddened men, women, and youths. With especial care he describes the horrors of
                    mob action at 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , 
                        Altoona
                    , 
                        Philadelphia
                    , Reading, and 
                        Baltimore
                    . In each case, we are assured, the real damage was done by tramps and young hoodlums.
                    The author places little or no responsibility on bona fide railroad workers, but his argument is not
                    completely convincing.
            A major contribution of the book is its description of the pathetic efforts of third-party agitators,
                    especially those of the Workingmen's party, to unite the laboring class. Anyone whose
                    interpretation of  American labor movements has been influenced
                    by Selig Perlman's analysis is sure to see in the failure of the Workingmen's
                    party an excellent example of the tendency of workers to distrust any threat to freedom of
                    enterprise, even though the entrepreneurial group benefiting from working class disunity is at that
                    time opposed to any improvement in conditions, pay, or employee morale.
            A contribution of considerable significance is evidence indicating that the real reason for the
                    railway strike's failure was the clever use, by management, government officials, and the
                    conservative press, of charges that the whole uproar was inspired by Communists. This further
                    emphasizes the fact that public opinion in 1877 was characterized by fear of organized labor,
                    distrust of urban employees, and reverence for financial power.
            This reviewer has two complaints about Bruce's volume, the first of which is minor. The
                    author sets forth such a mass of detail that at times chronology becomes confused. Second, the
                    presentation of the notes is little short of useless. Notes are arranged at the end of the book by
                    page and by paragraph with no indication whatsoever as to which statement in the text the reference
                    supports. No footnote numbers are used in the text. Therefore, in a given paragraph there may be a
                    half-dozen facts worthy of footnotes, but there is no earthly way the reader can determine which facts are supported by which citations. The bibliography
                    gives ample evidence of the wide range of the author's studies.

            "No period in Southern history since the American Revolution is so poor in published
                    correspondence as this one," Vann Woodward (to whom these volumes are dedicated) has
                    written of the period from 1877 to 1900. Even more rare are published source materials on the
                    history of the Negro in America. Louis D. Rubin's work in editing that part of the
                    Rutherford B. Hayes Papers which deals with Hayes's work with the Slater Fund is a step in
                    filling both gaps.
            In setting up his million dollar fund in 1881, textile maker John F. Slater specified to the trustees
                    that he had in mind "the uplifting of the lately emancipated population of the Southern
                    States and their posterity, by conferring upon them the blessings of Christian education"
                    (p. xx). According to Professor Merton Coulter, he also had in mind equipping them mentally to evade
                    the clutches of a certain group of unscrupulous merchants. In any case, training Negroes as teachers
                    and giving financial encouragement to colleges which provided that training were suggested as the
                    best avenues for attaining the goal of the founder. The distinguished group of trustees were
                    empowered to dissolve the foundation at the end of thirty-three years and to use  the capital to establish subsidiary foundations at existing colleges.
                    But in fact the Slater Fund continued, at the election of its trustees, to operate until its
                    incorporation in 1937 in the Southern Educational Foundation.
            Editor Rubin has done a good job with his material. His introduction is comprehensive and gracefully
                    written; his notes are thorough and informative, but not obtrusive. Any faults of Teach
                        the Freeman should not be charged to his account. Criticism can, however, be directed
                    against the material with which he has worked. In 1951, the 
                        Louisiana
                     State University Press made a significant contribution to published source materials in
                    Southern history with William Johnson's Natchez: The Diary of a Free
                    Negro. It would be gratifying to report that Teach the Freeman is in the same
                    tradition, but it is not. Where William Johnson was vivid, humorous, observant, sometimes poignant,
                    writers of the letters in these volumes were too often pious, sententious, and dull. Though the work
                    is subtitled The Correspondence of Rutherford B. Hayes …," it
                    actually contains but forty-four letters from Hayes in his capacity as president of the
                    fund's board of trustees. Far better represented is the tireless and devoted Atticus B.
                    Haygood, from whom the editor has included 138 letters and reports written during his tenure as fund
                    agent.
            Haygood's reports give a fairly accurate picture of the extent of his work for the fund, but
                    there is no life in them. A good and thoroughly honest man, he was so filled with a deep sense of
                    mission that he apparently saw almost nothing of the post-Reconstruction South in which he lived and
                    traveled so widely. Nor are the letters of others- trustees, college presidents, importuners for
                    funds—much livelier. There is a tantalizing glimpse of the young W. E. B. Dubois writing
                    for financial aid to finish his doctoral studies in 
                        Germany
                    ; but Dubois obviously was not the norm in the educational scheme of Hayes and Haygood,
                    who preferred to encourage industrial education rather than the classical learning that would
                    prepare students for the seminars of Berlin.
            As Adrienne Koch noted in a recent discussion of other projects of the National Historical
                    Manuscripts Commission, which extended its "co-operation and good offices" to this
                    project, the aim in publication of collections such as this is not to reach the best-seller list.
                    Still, with book budgets and library shelf-space what they are today, one cannot help wondering,
                    "Is this really needed?" And in two volumes, boxed, at that.

            As the title of this volume suggests its purpose, so the subtitle indicates the nature of its
                    contents. In compiling this work the editor has  reached back
                    into thirteenth-century English history for the Magna Carta and the Confirmatio Cartarum of 1297.
                    All other documents are taken from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These include
                    well-known English constitutional documents of the Stuart Age, four colonial charters, several
                    proprietary "Concessions" or "Frames," and a few of the pacts
                    and agreements conceived by the colonists themselves. The final third of the book consists of
                    declarations—assertions of rights—and constitutions of the Revolutionary and
                    Confederation periods. Slightly over one-half of the volume is devoted to the editor's
                    introductory remarks to each document.
            The American Bar Association is to be commended for its attempt to bring together the most
                    significant documents relating to the "sources of our liberties." It is possible
                    that too much has been attempted, especially in the editor's remarks, although his comments
                    could be defended in terms of the purposes for which the volume was published.
            Historians may object to the free use of secondary sources in the introductory essays to each
                    document, and especially to such antiquated sources as George Bancroft. More certainly they will
                    take issue with several statements which seem to reflect popular misconceptions. Thus, without
                    documentation, it is asserted that "the Quartering Act of 1765 was passed … to
                    aid the enforcement of the Stamp Act and the Revenue Act of 1764" (p. 72). Similarly,
                    section ninety-five of the

                     Body of Liberties (1641) is interpreted to mean that "toleration in religious
                    worship was to be observed" (p. 146), when obviously all that was intended was to authorize
                    the formation of new congregations on the 
                        Puritan
                     model.
            In spite of such objections as those mentioned above, however, this work provides for the general
                    public and for the teacher of history a valuable manual for study of the growth of personal
                    liberties, containing not only the documents pertaining thereto, but also an account of the
                    historical forces which brought about their formulation.

               Pelts and Palisades: The Story of Fur and the Rivalry for Pelts in Early

            The fur trade is an exciting topic for writers to pursue, and Nathaniel C. Hale has presented Pelts and Palisades, a popularly written account of the fur trade and of the
                    rivalry for pelts in North America up to the French and Indian War. Presenting the story of the fur
                    trade in narrative form, Hale begins his account by telling of prehistoric man's quest for
                    fur. Quickly sketching the background of fur's economic value in the Dark Ages, he journeys
                    to North America with Leif Erickson and his followers, but returns quickly to 
                        Spain
                     for a trip across the Atlantic with 
                        Columbus
                    .
            Following the voyages of discovery financed by the leading royal houses of Europe, the fur trade
                    remained in the background, for gold to the south and fish to the north received the primary
                    attention of early  colonists. Fishing barques from France came
                    to America's northern coast every year, and the mariners developed an ever increasing trade
                    in pelts with the Indians.
            England came of age and, with a penchant for commerce, soon engaged in colonizing activities in the
                    New World. The fur trade in 
                        Virginia
                    , according to Hale, opened a new source of revenue after the ventures for gold failed.
                    The Dutch also entered America during this period.
            Hale examines the three-way rivalry among the French, English, and Dutch in America, and adds an
                    interesting chapter on the Swedes' 
                        Delaware
                     colony, which is the most outstanding in the book. With over half the volume devoted to
                    the period when the early colonies were established, events move at a rapid pace until the French
                    and Indian War. 
                        Maryland
                    , under the feudalistic Calverts, engaged in heated rivalry with 
                        Virginia
                     over the fur trade and emerged victorious; the fur frontier, however, quickly passed
                    beyond the colony. English encroachments, both from the north and south, spelled doom for the colony
                    of New Netherlands, which surrendered in 1664. The English colonies, now joined together from 
                        Georgia
                     to 
                        Maine
                    , were faced with a new problem. The French had established a series of posts from the
                    mouth of the St. Lawrence to 
                        New Orleans
                     and the gulf area; but 
                        England
                     emerged supreme in 1763.
            The author traverses the years 1664-1763 in a relatively short space as compared to the attention he
                    gives the earlier period. Furthermore, he could have added to the value of his work by including an
                    account of the actual mechanics of trapping. The absence of footnotes is to some extent
                    counterbalanced by a creditable bibliography.

                    note, index. $6.00.)
            
               Oil on Stream is a history of the Interstate Oil Pipe Line Company from 1909 to
                    1959. The author was engaged by Interstate's president to write the history but was to be
                    free to use information furnished by the firm in any way he thought "proper to produce a
                    balanced objective study." The author states in his Preface that he was given absolute
                    freedom and there is no reason to doubt his statement.
            The account is well written and interesting, but unfortunately it is primarily an entertaining series
                    of stories concerning various aspects of company affairs. No attempt is made to evaluate critically
                    company policies or to analyze the impact of the pipe line on the industry. Thus, the book would be
                    useful as background or color, but of little value to a serious student of development economics
                    seeking data on trends and relationships.
            The book has eleven maps showing the location of company lines at different periods of time. It 81~
                    contains sixty-three illustrations  of construction activities,
                    pipe line equipment, and individuals connected with the company. On the whole, the photography is
                    good and the reproduction excellent. There seems to be little direct relation, however, between the
                    illustrations and the text.
            The narrative begins on "a hot muggy Sunday afternoon in June, 1909…."
                    and plunges immediately into the reasons for the decision to build a pipe line from 
                        Oklahoma
                     to 
                        Baton Rouge
                    . The author describes in some detail the construction techniques of fifty years ago and
                    devotes a considerable amount of space to the technical development of the pipe line industry.
            He writes equally well, however, about other aspects of company activities and includes material on
                    corporate structure, expansion, corporate finance, personnel problems, labor-management relations,
                    government regulation, the effect of war and depression, the statistics of operation, and winds up
                    with a prediction for the future.
            In the discussion of labor-management relations the author in every case is scrupulously careful to
                    summarize the position of the workers or the union. He also gives management's position and
                    the final outcome of the disagreement or problem. In discussing early labor problems he suggests
                    that pipe line construction workers were at times abused (pp. 22-23), but in the later disputes
                    judgement is withheld.
            Considerable attention is given to a running fight between the company and the 
                        Louisiana
                     regulatory authorities. According to this account, the struggle reached a peak during
                    the 1920's under the Huey Long regime. The author clearly indicates his belief that the
                    company was in the right, although the state supreme court seems to have found both the state and
                    the company at fault. Since 1926, however, relations between the company and the 
                        Louisiana
                     Commission "have, virtually without exception, been entirely
                    amicable" (p. 99).
            The book ends with the following statement: "Regardless of the accuracy of these
                    prognostications, it can be predicted with complete assurance that, as long as Interstate continues
                    to provide its shippers good service at a reasonable cost without discrimination of any kind, and as
                    long as it meets the competition which is ever present in a free enterprise economy, it will not
                    only survive, but grow and prosper."

            The research for this book is based on manuscripts and personal papers, particularly those of Hiram
                    D. Frankel, in the 
                        Minnesota

                    primary sources, newspapers, and interviews with descendants of Jewish leaders. Rabbi
                    Plaut's patient and thorough research commands respect, and his work fills a gap in

                    described by means of biographical sketches of the early arrivals. The organization of Mount Zion

                        St. Paul
                     in 1856 introduces a pattern which is hard to avoid and at times awkward. The author,
                    who generally follows a chronological sequence, must alternate between communities and
                    personalities. The reader, however, is also made aware of the different pace and the different
                    stages of integration of the Jewish communities in the three cities with the communities at large.
                    The striking difference between the integration of Jews in the 
                        St. Paul
                     community, on the one side, and their isolation in 
                        Minneapolis
                    , where outright anti-Semitism developed during and after World War I, on the other, is
                    partly treated in a chapter titled "The Curious Twins." After initial German
                    Jewish immigration, most influential in 
                        St. Paul
                    , Eastern European immigration after the Civil War led to social, religious, and even
                    geographical stratification among Jewish groups and greatly increased welfare problems. These
                    problems have always been met magnificently by Jews in all three cities, and particularly in 
                        St. Paul
                    . The development of social stratification in Jewish congregations is again largely
                    portrayed through the work of leaders, particularly rabbis, such as Wechsler and Rypin, of Mount
                    Zion in 
                        St. Paul
                    , and Deinard, of Shaarai Tov in 
                        Minneapolis
                    . The emergence of Reform, Conservatism, and Zionism is thoroughly treated in
                    well-annotated chapters. The work of the lodges, the immediate and ultimate service of the 
                        Minnesota

                        Minneapolis
                    , with the University as "the only bright spot in the area of
                    prejudice" (p. 278), and comparative presentation of minority problems are treated in the
                    last chapters. Here the author can draw on general works such as Albert I. Gordon's Jews in Transition (
                        Minneapolis
                    , 1949).
            The few scattered references to Jews in 
                        Minnesota
                     outside the three large cities and the fact that this is the third in a series of
                    American Jewish communal histories raises an old question, namely, how far does the accident of
                    state boundaries justify the state as a frame of reference for the history of an immigrant group.
                    There are no maps of the shifting Jewish neighborhoods in the Twin Cities and no pictures. This
                    reviewer also regrets what appears to be a concession to that vague nonenity, the popular
                    reader—the colorful but un-informative chapter headings and the short chapters which give
                    the book at least in its first part a kaleidoscopic character. This labor is too serious and the
                    subject too deserving for this type of handling. It is hoped that Rabbi Plaut can find time to
                    complete the task by writing the history of Jewish life in the Twin Cities during the middle of the
                    twentieth century.

               Saints in Arms: Puritanism and Democracy in Cromwell's Army. By Leo F.

                    $4.00.)
            This excellent little book re-examines the interrelationships between Puritanism and democracy with
                    attention focused upon the chaplains of the New Model Army, "the Saints in Arms."
                    Professor Solt holds that "the relation of political thought to religious thought in the 
                        Puritan
                     Revolution turns on the question of why some groups were led to claim the privileges
                    and rule of the saints based upon God's Free Grace, whereas others preached the equality
                    and sovereignty of the people based upon natural law" (p. 4). Prevailing interpretations,
                    says the author, tend to play up "the first member of each of the following pairs of
                    politico-religious polarities: (1) liberty and authority, (2) unity and uniformity, (3) separatism
                    and millenarianism, (4) equality and sainthood, (5) covenant and grace, (6) elective polity and
                    anarchy, (7) fundamental law and power, (8) mixed government and policy, and (9) masses and
                    classes" (p. 4). Any play upon the second member of these polarities would be to establish
                    a case for "an authoritarian strain in Puritanism."
            The Introduction sets up the method which is, essentially, to establish the polarities. Six chapters
                    follow. Chapters I and II set forth the necessary historical and theological backgrounds, and
                    Chapters III-VI test the polarities as previously stated. A "Conclusion" reviews
                    the results. Of the nine pairs of politico-religious polarities Professor Solt finds that the
                    authoritarian tradition prevailed in six: "authority took precedence over liberty, power
                    over law, millenarianism over separatism, sainthood over equality, grace over covenant, and anarchy
                    over elective polity" (p. 99). Democratic sentiments prevailed in only three instances:
                    unity took precedence over uniformity, the masses over the classes, and mixed government over
                    policy. And by no means all of the "saints" were in complete agreement on all of
                    these items.
            Professor Solt has shown decisively that the Leveller precepts in the New Model Army must be
                    considered apart from the 
                        Puritan
                     chaplains' views on democracy. For many—though not for
                    all—this is a useful (and new) distinction. But one is led to question how far the views
                    of the New Model Army chaplains, which are as thoroughly reviewed in this volume as literary remains
                    will permit, can be accepted as representative of Puritanism in the large, even in its own time. AS
                    a whole, the army chaplains, as compared with the 
                        Puritan
                     spokesmen at large, were neither a sober nor a solid group of men. Some of them were,
                    in fact, on the "lunatic fringe." Moreover, they were caught up in the
                    supercharged atmosphere of civil war and a peculiar brand of Army-Parliament-King-Scots-Presbyterian
                    political issues. Can we safely accept the pronouncements of these men in these circumstances as
                    truly representative of 
                        
                            Puritan
                        
                     opinion? Or, did not the Army of Saints and its principal apologists (the chaplains) overreach
                    the Puritans as a whole both in politics and in theology? Was not this evident at the time, both in
                    Old 
                        England
                     and in New? To accept the pronouncements of the army chaplains as representative of
                    anything  more than a segment of opinion within the New Model
                    Army itself seems to this reviewer to be a highly doubtful extension; and it is difficult for this
                    reviewer to ascertain how far this extension is implied in the present work. As a study of the
                    politics and theology (and their interrelationships) of the chaplains of the New Model Army
                    Professor Solt's volume is a splendid and thorough job.

            In the opening chapters of this volume Professor Wallace discusses Raleigh's education and
                    early years. Then, in tracing Raleigh's meteoric rise to prominence, the author illustrates
                    that his subject was a political opportunist, a monarchist, and an expansionist. Yet this
                    Elizabethan courtier, with all his lust for power and prestige, had 
                        England
                    's interest at heart. To him, the founding of colonies would enhance the glory
                    of Old 
                        England
                     and would at the same time strike indirectly at 
                        England
                    's perennial enemy, 
                        Spain
                    .
            The chapter about 
                        Virginia
                     retells the pathetic story of Raleigh's "lost colony."
                    Raleigh learned from this tragic experience that an agrarian economy had to be emphasized if 
                        England
                     were to establish a colony in the New World. Raleigh also realized that some of the
                    causes for his failure were inextricably bound to the complexities of international power politics.
            The complicated struggle between Anglican 
                        England
                     and Catholic Spain is painted upon a broad canvas. Raleigh is pictured as one of the
                        Elizabethan Sea Dogs who preyed upon Spanish shipping, a practice which
                    combined patriotism and good business. The defeat of the Spanish Armada is brought into proper
                    focus.
            While 
                        England
                     was enjoying one of her finest hours in history, Sir Walter was likewise basking in the
                    brilliancy of the Queen's Court. It took skill to maintain one's position at the
                    Court where the Queen's whims could not be predicted and where political machinations
                    prevailed. Raleigh "stubbed his toe" politically when he married Elizabeth
                    Throg-morton. His preference for another Elizabeth instead of Elizabeth Tudor was a heinous offense.
                    The penalty: confinement in the Tower of 
                        London
                     and then total banishment from the Court for five years. But during the last six years
                    of Elizabeth's reign, he was near his Queen again. With the coming of the Stuart James I,
                    Raleigh was stripped of his power, charged with opposing the new monarch, and arraigned for treason.
            The last third of the book discusses Raleigh's trial, his years of imprisonment, and his
                    voyage to the Orinoco River. This old Elizabethan was an obstacle thwarting the
                    new Stuart policy toward 
                        Spain
                    ; he became a sacrificial lamb upon the international altar of expediency. The end came
                    quickly. As one curious bystander at the execution solemnly remarked: " ‘We have
                    not another such head to be cut off!’" (p. 317).
            
            Legal aspects of the trial, religious viewpoints, and psychological factors are scrutinized with deep
                    insight by Wallace. Not all readers will agree with the author's laudatory appraisal of
                    Raleigh's literary efforts. This reviewer wishes that more attention had been given to the
                    lesson 
                        England
                     learned from early attempts at colonization by Raleigh and others—namely,
                    that the resources of a joint-stock company rather than those of an individual would be necessary
                    for the successful planting of colonies in America.
            The author, using recent historical evidence, has produced a well-documented and much-needed
                    reappraisal of the composite man. The scholarship and craftmanship displayed in this volume makes it
                    an exceedingly valuable biography for historians working in the fields of English and American
                    colonial history.
