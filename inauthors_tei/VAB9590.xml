<p>L<hi rend="sc">IKE</hi> two night-birds who had strayed into the
wrong season, a pair of girls flopped about on the
snowy walk or huddled together outside of the
Hill house. The house was lighted. They could
see, through one uncovered window, which extended
to the veranda floor, the ruby gates, the
cut-glass candelabra, and the luxurious furniture.
The girls were on the west side of the house,
which was a large square structure with extensions
at the rear.</p>
<p>Below the hill an old turnpike town straggled
eastward, its lights barely twinkling through a winter
fog. The evergreens and old forest-trees all
around the grounds were weighted with soft snow,
and there were occasional slides from the roof
which dropped with a half-liquid splash.</p>
<p>The sound of a piano made the air delicious
to these girls outside. Light falling upon them


<pb id="VAB9590-006" n="6"/>

from the window showed that one wore an old
shawl over her head, and the other a dirty hood.
The dusk blurred their outlines, and they shrank
farther into it every time a pair of waltzers inside
whirled near the window.</p>
<p>The waltzing pair were also two girls, near one
age, beautifully draped, glowing, and handsome.
Another young lady, in an outline of pearl-gray,
could be seen at the piano. She threw her hands
about with abandon, and a ring or two flashed in
the firelight.</p>
<p>"I wish I knew how they done that," said the
taller of the girls outside anxiously. "Ketch hold
of me that way, Tillie, and le's see if we can't do
it."</p>
<p>Tillie obediently caught hold of her sister, but,
being much smaller, could only reach her elbows.
Placing their toes near together, they spun round
with the motion of a top.</p>
<p>"'Tisn't the way," pronounced the older girl
despondently. "I could do it, though, just as
good as they do, if I knew how they fixed their
feet."</p>
<p>The piano and the waltzers went on. Tillie was
not willing to stop : she spun ahead after her sister
released her, inventing steps and skips.</p>
<p>"Don't go so close to the window: they'll see
ye.</p>
<p>Tillie dropped back. The piano, as the waltzers


<pb id="VAB9590-007" n="7"/>
                                                    
flagged and began to promenade arm in arm,
leaped from the waltz to a quick, gay melody, and
Tillie's arms and feet responded.</p>
<p>"Can you knock that tune?" inquired her guide,
philosopher, and friend in the old shawl.</p>
<p>The child "knocked" it to a nicety. Her cowhide
shoes were dulled by the snow, but their
muffled pat was true to the music. The figure she
danced could not be called by any name. It was
not a jig or a clog,--she had never heard of such
things,-nor a double-shuffle such as plantation
darkies and the rustic foot everywhere delight in.
It was a skipping, patting dance of her own. She
put her hands on her hips: from them downward
she was electric motion and flopping scant skirt;
from them upward, immobility and gravity. Her
breathing became audible, but she knocked away.
Her older sister sat down in a chair they had with
them, and watched her. She knocked herself
into the bar of light and out again. She was in a
rapture of motion, when the other jumped up and
a gate clanged.</p>
<p>"There's Tom Mills comin' from down town.
Le's hurry in: he'll ketch us."</p>
<p>Tillie immediately took hold of her side of the
chair, and, carrying it between them, they hastened
toward the kitchen-door and knocked.</p>
<p>A colored man opened the door. Neal had
come to his present home a contraband, sent

North by Captain Mills at the close of the war.
From a shuffling boy he had grown into a colored
gentleman who conducted the gardening and the
stables at the Hill-house. He also moved the
heavy machinery of housekeeping: fires and errands
depended on him. He had grown to his
place, and ornamented it with a good-looking black
face and ceremonious airs. But there was one
thing in the world that Neal hated, that thing
being a poor white: he could see no use in such a
person. With all a negro's respect for what he
considers magnificent, and contempt for small resources,
Neal would rather have been kicked by
Captain Mills--though he never was--than fairly
spoken by any of the Chenoworths. The Chenoworths
were the "lowest-down lot" he knew.
When the two girls on the step faced him he was
stirred by an antagonism of race begun, perhaps,
generations back in Tennessee, before a Chenoworth
had come to Ohio.</p>
<p>"We brought home the chair Aunt Sally Teagarden
sent to daddy to get a bottom put in it,"
said the elder girl.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," said Neal, receiving it. "It's just
a kitchen chair. Didn't know she's <hi rend="i">your</hi> aunt
Sally."</p>
<p>"Folks always calls her so," returned the girl
curtly.</p>
<p>"Didn't know she was aunt to Chinnyworth's

<pb id="VAB9590-009" n="9"/>

Damsel," persisted Neal, putting the chair against
the wall as he chuckled sarcastically.</p>
<p>"My name ain't Chinnyworth's Damsel," said
the girl, letting the shawl drop from her head and
standing in the kitchen before her sister. There
was only a ruddy light of wood-coals in the stove,
beside which Neal had been basking. The cook
was down-cellar with the light.</p>
<p>"That's what folks always calls you," said Neal,
--"Chinnyworth's Damsel. Ain't got no other
name, have ye?"</p>
<p>"It's Tamsin," said the girl with a heavy intonation.
She was scowling, and the little one, taking
the cue from her, was scowling also. "You mind
your black business."</p>
<p>"Them is mighty ellygant words. Shows your
bringin' up."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked at him fiercely. She had a pair
of black eyes which suggested lancets. The
stove-light threw her head into relief against the
dark door. She was olive-colored, with flaxen
hair. All the Chenoworths were tow-headed, but
their type comprised almost invariably, in addition,
livid skins and weak blue eyes. The younger
sister showed the impress of her ancestry. She
was yellow, flaxen, and blue-eyed, but she had a
mouth and jaw which gave individuality to her
little face. Her lips were rosy, and she had rows
of small shining teeth which seemed to extend

from ear to ear. This gave her a gay, good-
natured look. She held to her sister's dress with
one claw-hand and looked at Neal with dislike.</p>
<p>"I'll tell Mis' Teagard' you brought the chair,"
said Neal more kindly. "I's just a-teasin' you
when I called you Chinnyworth's Damsel."</p>
<p>"I'm goin' in to see her myself."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't, now," argued Neal. "They's young
ladies--visitors--in there."</p>
<p>"S'pose I'm afraid o' seein' them? They ain't
no better than <hi rend="i">I</hi> am."</p>
<p>"Phu!" ejaculated Neal behind her back.</p>
<p>She made her way, without any announcement,
through the half-lighted dining-room, with Tillie
beside her, and presently appeared at the ruby
grate, where Aunt Sally Teagarden sat alternately
knitting and turning the leaves of a book on a
table.</p>
<p>This noble-looking, portly old lady, with hair as
white as puffs of thistle-down on her rounded temples,
looked up quickly from her treatise and gave
the two girls a pleasant "Good-evening." She had
a peculiar twitching of the corners of her mouth
when she spoke, not at all unbecoming to her, but
of which she was quite unconscious. "Come up
to the fire, Tamsin and Tillie," she said, with a
twist of benign expression.</p>
<p>"We brought home your cheer," said Tamsin,
spreading her fingers to the fire.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-011" n="11"/>

<p>"Oh, you brought home that chair?  Well,
Thomas is in the other room, and when he comes
out I'll get the money to send to your father. My
pocket-book is up-stairs."</p>
<p>A male voice and the voices of girls sounded
through the open archway of a parlor which
branched from the side of this. Tamsin wanted
to see the young-lady visitors, but in order to do
so she would have to walk boldly up the room.</p>
<p>"Take seats," said Captain Mills's aunt; and
Tamsin sat down on a haircloth cushion, but
Tillie stood by the mantel, resting one foot upon
the other.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally glanced through her glasses at the
new page of her treatise. "I am just reading a
little in Andrew Jackson Davis's great book while
I knit," she observed benignly, willing to share
her favorite <hi rend="i">ism</hi> with anybody. "It's a wonderful
book. Remarkable what a power of language he
has. Has your mother finished reading that <hi rend="i">Banner
of Light</hi> I sent her?"</p>
<p>"She pasted it up on the wall," said Tillie. Her
sister was listening to the other voices.</p>
<p>"Well," said Aunt Sally, pushing up her glasses,
"I didn't intend that. But perhaps," with energetic
twists of her mouth, "that is as good a way as
any to keep some of the remarkable seances in
her mind. There was a beautiful account in that
paper, given by Mrs. Cora L. V. Hatch, of communing

<pb id="VAB9590-012" n="12"/>

with a spirit from New Jersey." She went
on rapidly, pouring Spiritualistic lore into her
hearers.</p>
<p>Their eyes wandered up to the high ceiling and
down the tinted walls, over velvet carpet and
painted landscapes, bronze busts and a cabinet-
world of bric-à-brac. Tillie started when the
mantel-clock told the half-hour with a chime like
music.</p>
<p>"Now, aunt," said Captain Mills, sauntering
through the archway.--"Good-evening," in short
parenthesis to the girls.--"I hear the Spiritualist
drum beating a rally."</p>
<p>"Thomas," replied his aunt, "I never expect
you to be a believer. The construction of your
mind is such that you will not accept the most
positive proofs. And I never thrust my opinions
on anybody. The girls here are waiting. Have
you got some change about you to pay for reseating
a chair?"</p>
<p>The captain went into his pockets, and, having
ascertained what amount was wanted, paid it. While
he did so, Tamsin watched him with speculative
eyes. He was her single type of a gentleman.</p>
<p>He had come home from the army as hairy as a
monkey, the townpeople said, but at this date he
was a smooth-shaven, prematurely iron-gray man
of perhaps forty, with a thick black moustache and
smiling eyes. He bore a family resemblance to

<pb id="VAB9590-013" n="13"/>
                                                    
his aunt, having her smoothly-rounded temples
and high-arched head. The benignity displayed
in her face became graver in his.</p>
<p>"Are you busy at anything now, Tamsin?"
inquired Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>"No, ma'am," replied the girl, fingering the
money in the corner of her shawl.</p>
<p>"Then you might come here and help about
the house while we have company. There are a
good many things up-stairs and around that need
attention when the whole house is in use. I
thought about sending down to see if your mother
could let you come."</p>
<p>"She won't care. Have you got a good many
visitors?"</p>
<p>"Three young ladies,--the captain's cousin and
two of her friends. They came to spend the holidays
with us. Very well. In the morning, then."</p>
<p>"I can come back to-night, after I take Tillie
home."</p>
<p>Captain Mills was sauntering off through the
archway.</p>
<p>"If you are not afraid of the dark--" suggested
Aunt Sally.</p>
<p>Chenoworth's daughter smiled slowly. What
difference did it make to anybody whether <hi rend="i">she</hi> was
afraid of the dark or not? "I can run right quick."</p>
<p>"Well, you might come back to-night, then."</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">AMSIN</hi> and her sister ran down the hill, crossed
the pike, and walked along the middle of the
road which led toward their back-street residence.
Some dogs jumped out of the enclosures around
large houses and barked at them. Though there
was little traffic on the old canal at that time, Tillie
was moved to point at a light far off floating serenely
through the fog and say, "There goes a
boat."</p>
<p>"Tisn't!" observed Tamsin, hugging her shawl;
"must be a lantern around the tavern."</p>
<p>They came to their home, standing dejected, unpainted,
and humble in a wilderness of dried cornstalks
which rustled sadly in every breath of air,
their dull bleached outlines suggesting ranks of
diminutive ghosts.</p>
<p>Tamsin opened the door and looked in at a
scene she had never loved. The interior was bare
and coarse and smelled of onions. There was the
open fire, but its light was dull. Her mother sat
mending stockings by a tallow candle; her father
stooped over the hearth smoking. He was a decent

<pb id="VAB9590-015" n="15"/>

old man who seemed to have given his family
up as a hard problem. Sarah Jane sat there holding
her baby. Arthur had come in, and John and
George had for once forborne to go down town,
and were growling at each other. All, excepting
Sarah Jane, looked clay-colored and bleached, as
if the weather had held them at its mercy for generations.</p>
<p>Tamsin disliked her family. She had no filial
affection for her parents. Their apathy and general
thriftlessness roused unexpressed indignation
in her. She felt her existence as an indignity
which they had cast upon her. She compared
them with people whom she considered admirable,
and silently hated them. She hated the two lazy
boys who crowded her in the humble house. Her
scorn was of the high-bred sort which shows no
outward sign but indifference. When they ate
their food she despised their loud chewing, their
greedy dipping into dishes. When they lounged
down town with their hands in their pockets she
despised them for following the gypsy instincts of
their blood, and avoiding, or accomplishing nothing
by, labor. She was a magazine of silent rebellions
and hatreds. No empress ever had a mightier
pride or stronger will. The spirit which her people
had lacked for generations was perhaps concentrated
in her. She resented all her conditions
of life. Under its pressure she was old. In a less

<pb id="VAB9590-016" n="16"/>

aggressive way, she was as cynical as Timon. A
reticent and dignity-loving nature thus became secretive.
But, while silently denying the stock from
which she sprang, this girl had been known to
scratch her school-fellows for disrespect toward
the name of Chenoworth. It seemed to her secret
consciousness the last humiliation of all that folks
should ever know how she despised the Chenoworths
herself. There was vast endurance in her.
Natural girlish delicacy and sensitiveness, which in
her were extreme, had long since protected themselves
by a thick shell. At that time she had no
room for more than one strong affection : she loved
her youngest sister, and she loved nothing else.</p>
<p>Tillie pulled off her hood and approached the
fire, but Tamsin merely stood and announced that
she was going back.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't work for them proud things," said
Sarah Jane, who had an aquiline nose and lines
which made a triangle of her chin.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chenoworth had nothing to say: her
children always did as they pleased. She looked
up, and observing that her nephew Arthur was
about to leave the house also, suggested plaintively,
"Stay longer, Arter."</p>
<p>"I guess I'll walk along a piece with Tamsin,"
said Arthur.</p>
<p>"I guess you won't!" retorted Tamsin scornfully.
"I don't want you along of me."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-017" n="17"/>

<p>"You'll get over your spiteful ways, miss," remarked
Sarah Jane, " when you've seen the trouble
I've seen."</p>
<p>Tillie clasped the black-eyed alien round the
waist, and they looked most confidingly into each
other's eyes.</p>
<p>"Come up to-morrow," said Tamsin.</p>
<p>"I will," replied Tillie.</p>
<p>"Don't kick the kivver off to-night. You might
git a bad sore throat again."</p>
<p>"Then mammy'd make me poultice it," laughed
Tillie.</p>
<p>"I s'pose," remarked Arthur as he left the door
behind Tamsin', "you wouldn't have anything
against me walkin' on the other side of the road
from you if I's goin' the same way?"</p>
<p>She did not reply or wait to see which side he
chose. Her shawled head flitted away from him,
though he could hear heavy shoes beating the
snow till their rush died in the distance.</p>
<p>As Tamsin ran up the hill the oldest of the
young-lady guests was holding a skein of yarn for
Aunt Sally to wind, and saying, while Captain
Mills and the girls were occupied with themselves,
that she did wish Aunt Sally would tell her some
of her recollections or experiences. The girls had
said she knew charming Irish fairy-stories.</p>
<p>"The wee folk," said Aunt Sally, pulling off a
long thread.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-018" n="18"/>
                    
<p>Yes, but Miss Rhoda Jones preferred to hear
about real folks,--the people in this little town, for
instance. Mrs.: Teagarden must know all about
them,--their peculiarities and trials and unwritten
histories.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally knew that Miss Jones was what is
called a "writer," and that this was a hook thrown
out for a good catch of "material;" but she inclined
toward furnishing material. She was convinced
that if she had not lived a busy practical
life she would have been literary herself. Andrew
Jackson Davis and Mrs. Cora L. V. Hatch were
dearer to her because they "wrote." There had
been one lovely school-girl niece in the family,
Captain Tom's sister, who died at her blossoming,
but whose poems were turning yellow in Aunt
Sally's treasure-box. How could she look otherwise
than affectionately on an author, when her
namesake-girl had been prevented only by death
from taking the lead in letters?</p>
<p>"Well," said Aunt Sally, with an energetic preliminary
twist of the mouth, "most of the trials
of the people about here are caused, as they
usually are, I have observed, by their own thriftlessness
or carelessness. The Chenoworth girls
came in here awhile ago, and I was reading
Andrew Jackson Davis's book: someway, I got
to thinking of the strength of hereditary tendencies."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-019" n="19"/>
                    
<p>"Chenoworth?" questioned Miss Jones as she
turned her head for the passage of the yarn.
"That's rather a pretty name,--much higher-
sounding than Jones."</p>
<p>"The people who know them wouldn't say so,"
continued Aunt Sally, always with the beneficent
twitching. "It's a name that means around here
everything base and good-for-nothing. I have
known the Chenoworths from my childhood, and
I never saw one of them amount to anything, except
one that died in Tom's company during the
war, and he was a notorious thief before he 'listed.
But it's a shame to bring up charges against the
country's dead," Aunt Sally admonished herself
solemnly. "He was sent home in his box after
Lookout Mountain: Tom saw that he was sent
home."</p>
<p>"There are girls in the family, you said?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes: there is a large connection of them,
-all about alike, except that the younger ones
seem to grow worse than the old ones. I heard it
said there was a solid county of them in Tennessee
before they moved to Ohio. Always living
from hand to mouth, the men usually with no
trades or business of any kind, and the women
struggling to support prolific families."</p>
<p>"Poor things!"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed! Such people are always multiplying
their helpless offspring. I have thought

<pb id="VAB9590-020" n="20"/>

sometimes Tamsin might turn out a little different
from the rest, and I do what I can for her and encourage
her; but," the old lady paused in her
winding to say impressively, "hereditary tendencies
are stronger than life itself. Her history was
all written down before she was born."</p>
<p>"Tamsin?" murmured Miss Jones.</p>
<p>"Yes. She was here with her little sister awhile
ago. I feel sorry for that girl. Nobody knows
any harm of her, but what good can she ever
come to?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"The name of the family will drag her down.
Good blood," said Aunt Sally, who saw it coursing
gently through the thin veins on her very round
and handsome wrist, "is the best inheritance a
child can have. But where a stock has sunk below
respectability as far back as you can trace it,
what can you expect of it?"</p>
<p>"How old is this Tamsin?"</p>
<p>"About fifteen or sixteen, I should think."</p>
<p>"Pretty?"</p>
<p>"Not to my notion. She had a sister who was
called rather pretty,-Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane
went up to the capital to learn millinery, and she's
just home with a child in her arms, trying to give
it away to somebody to raise, I hear. There was
poor Mary. She was the oldest girl of the set,
and she did real well for a while. One of our rich

<pb id="VAB9590-021" n="21"/>

farmers' wives took her and made a daughter of
her; and I have always thought it was fate against
the poor child, and not her fault, that she didn't do
better. The family she lived with made everything
of her. Mary was good-looking,--that is,
as near good-looking as I ever saw a Chenoworth.
She had a beau, and I think he disappointed her.
It would have been a fine match for her, and she
certainly loved him. But he went off, and she
turned and married one of her trifling cousins:
the Chenoworths intermarry to that degree it
seems as if they can't mate with anybody outside
of their own stock. So there the poor thing is,
tied down for life, with half a dozen miserable
little ones to follow her around and no living provided
for them. The farmer's family were so indignant
at her throwing herself away that they
would have nothing to do with her."</p>
<p>"Poor thing!"</p>
<p>"Yes. And there was the oldest,--Sam. He
married Mary Mann. He was a poor half-witted
thing, and she lived a jade's life; and finally she
took poison one night, and he lay there drunk beside
her, and she told him what she had done and
begged him to help her. While she groaned and
cried, 'Well,' said he, 'you oughtn't to took it!'
and went to sleep. When he waked in the morning
she was cold."</p>
<p>Miss Jones hid her face on her arm. She saw

<pb id="VAB9590-022" n="22"/>

the dying and helpless woman, and felt the tragedy
through every nerve.</p>
<p>"The second boy is in the county jail for stealing,
and the two young ones are common loafers.
Old Mr. Chenoworth is a harmless creature, so far
as I know, and his wife doesn't seem to be a lazy
woman, but probably in the generation before him
are to be found the seeds which ripened in this."
The chronicler ended with a meditative twitch of
her mouth.</p>
<p>"That poor girl!" mused the other.</p>
<p>"Tamsin? Sometimes I think there is something
in Tamsin."</p>
<p>"Why couldn't she study? Why couldn't she
make a woman of herself?" </p>
<p>Aunt Sally shook her wisehead: "It isn't in
the stock to take to education: they are all ignorant.
Once in a while I send a copy of the
<hi rend="i">Banner of Light</hi> there, but I doubt if any of them
read it."</p>
<p>"Or if she had some talent that would lift her
up?"</p>
<p>"Tamsin hasn't any gifts out of the common,
that I ever heard of. She's just a good ordinary
girl."</p>
<p>Rhoda Jones shook her head slowly, having this
melancholy figure in her mind: "It is like living
under some crushing weight, or in swamps where
the live-oak moss would make one want to commit

<pb id="VAB9590-023" n="23"/>
                    
suicide,--worse than being a homeless and
kinless orphan. If she were an orphan without
relatives, somebody would take pity on her, but,
as she has too many relatives, they despise her."</p>
<p>"She'll probably marry her cousin Arthur, a
hulk of a fellow; but he hasn't much harm in him
--or anything else. Some one told me he was
hanging after her. And she'll go the way of the
rest of them."</p>
<p>The dining-room door, which had stood ajar,
moved silently back, and Tamsin came in with her
shawl around her shoulders.</p>
                    
</div2>

<p>B<hi rend="sc">OTH</hi> speakers looked at her with a start, but
Tamsin's face gave no sign of what she had heard.
She did not meet their eyes, but went and sat down
some distance from them in the unconscious dignity
of loneliness. Rather than have them know
that she had heard and was tormented by this
formulated statement from other tongues of her
own nebulous convictions, she would have hugged
her blistering shame in secrecy if it killed her.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally felt disturbed, and the fountain of
her kindness flowed: " Come nearer to the fire,
Tamsin. Ain't you cold?"</p>
<p>"No, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Is it thawing out-doors?" inquired Miss Rhoda,
wishing to open communication between this
girl and herself.</p>
<p>"Toler'ble soft." She sat as immovable as an
Indian, her eyelids lowered.</p>
<p>Rhoda scanned her with two or three keen
looks, and, finding this scrutiny apparently unnoticed,
studied her with a silent gaze, turning her
skein-supporting hands now to this side, now to

<pb id="VAB9590-025" n="25"/>

that. "There is great force in her," thought Miss
Jones,--"an individuality which is going to assert
itself. She looks good: the oval of her cheeks is
splendid. How do people who rarely have enough
to eat get up that curve and rich olive color? Black
eyebrows and eyelashes and light hair! A reticent
expression, but one, also, that seems to be absorbing
everything around."</p>
<p>Aunt Sally wound the last end of yarn upon her
ball. "Now, Tamsin," said she, rising, "you come
with me up-stairs, and I'll show you what to do
there."</p>
<p>Captain Mills and the girls were very merry in
the other parlor, and after gazing at the fire awhile
Miss Rhoda joined them. At eleven o'clock he
bade them good-night.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally always retired at nine, after ordering
breakfast and seeing to the fastening of all the
doors. She left Tamsin the choice of going to
bed at that time or sitting up until the young ladies
had gone, to see that the fires were well down
and read Andrew Jackson Davis. Tamsin took
her place with no light but that of the grate, and
without Andrew Jackson Davis, on a small sofa
beside the arch connecting the parlors, where the
group of young ladies could not see her. Her object
was to look at them as much as she pleased.
As to their talk, she did not think of overhearing
it, yet when she began to notice it she listened

<pb id="VAB9590-026" n="26"/>

keenly. Jennie Mills, who was really a beautiful
brown girl, pleased her eye. Louise Latta, a very
sweet-natured blonde, was pronounced by Tamsin
the image of pride, because she had pretty airs and
turns of the head and a fine clock-stockinged and
slippered foot resting on the fender. The Chenoworth
doubted not they all three considered her as
the dirt under their soles. She put out her own
foot and looked furtively at it. The leather was
heavy around its shape, and that looked big compared
to the one on the fender. Jennie Mills threw
up her hands to exclaim, "Oh, girls!" and Tamsin
looked at her own hands,--not white and sparkling
with ornaments, but chapped and red. More attractive
to her than the others was Rhoda Jones,
the wearer of the pearl-gray dress, who had played
the piano. How wonderful it must be to play the
piano! She seemed to be a person who could do
anything she wished.</p>
<p>Tamsin tried to detect how the other two "did"
their hair. There they all three sat toasting themselves
by the deeply-red fire, saying they must go
to bed, but lingering to tell a story or a joke.
What good times rich folks' girls had!</p>
<p>"If we go up-stairs," said Jennie, "there are
only the registers, and of course the furnace-fire
must be low: so let's bask as long as we can. Oh,
how I should love to spend <hi rend="i">every</hi> winter in Florida!
Cold weather kills me."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-027" n="27"/>

<p>"You ought to marry a Southerner, Jen," suggested
Louise.</p>
<p>"And have the yellow fever every summer?
You horrid thing!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you could spend the summers with us."</p>
<p>"How silly you girls would be to think of
marrying at your age!". exclaimed Rhoda.</p>
<p>"We don't think of it: it's the farthest possible
thing from our thoughts. But look here, Rhoda
Jones: we're twenty-two,--that is, I am, and Lou
is going to be soon. Gracious! we're pretty near
old maids!"</p>
<p>"Old maids," said Rhoda scornfully, "are things
of the past."</p>
<p>"I know they are," said Louise: "they feel it
themselves."</p>
<p>"No, they don't. Come to that, <hi rend="i">I'm</hi> one."</p>
<p>"You don't look a day older than we do,
Rhode."</p>
<p>"Why, certainly I do! I've years of experience
and thought that you don't know anything about.
But I tell you the scarecrow old maid is a thing of
the past: it was set up to frighten silly women
away from the fields of independence. The woman
of to-day, when she gets ready to marry, marries, and
it doesn't make any difference to her whether she's
twenty-five or a hundred. We don't live in the
hard conditions that our grandmothers lived in.
We aren't old at forty any more; our bodies ripen

<pb id="VAB9590-028" n="28"/>

on instead of withering. We learn how to take
care of them and how to bring ourselves in happy
relations to society, and we get a few dabs of art-
knowledge; and literature is a mighty preservative
of the tissues. When I was fifteen I was a skinny
little thing; but look here." She held up one
half-revealed plump arm, and her face seemed to
sparkle. "I just learned how to live, and I'm
<hi rend="i">going to live</hi>--all over, every faculty of me--as
many days as are granted."</p>
<p>"Now, come, Rhode," coaxed Jennie, catching
the uplifted hand: " <hi rend="i">do</hi> tell us if there's anything
in this splendid turquoise ring."</p>
<p>"My finger, as you see."</p>
<p>"If <hi rend="i">I</hi> were engaged," remarked Louise in an
injured tone,--"and, mind, I don't say I ain't, but--
I should tell my friends about it some time, especially
my real old friends."</p>
<p>"Well, you two ancient goddesses--"</p>
<p>"Ah, Rhoda, you are!"</p>
<p>"Of course I am. Because I expect to be married
before very long."</p>
<p>The other girls uttered little squalls and crowded
closer to her: "Oh, tell us all about it. Is he light
or dark? Is he real fascinating? Oh, what <hi rend="i">is</hi> his
name? Is it Smith ? Is it some gentleman where
you are living now? Oh, Rhoda Jones, to think
we have known you all our lives and don't know
who you are going to marry!"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-029" n="29"/>

<p>"I meant to tell you when I got around to it.
Why, what's the use of making such a fuss about
it? Marriage is only an incident in men's lives,
--an important one, of course,--and why should it
be more in ours?"</p>
<p>"Mercy, Rhode! you're getting to be strong-
minded. But, oh, do tell us his name!"</p>
<p>"His name is Mr. Burns."</p>
<p>"Burns? That sounds nice."</p>
<p>"Of course it does: it <hi rend="i">is</hi> nice. I shan't be
Burne-Jones, but Jones-Burns. He is a most
agreeable old gentleman."</p>
<p>"Old!" Both girls emitted a low shriek.</p>
<p>"Why, certainly! You don't think I would
marry a boy, do you? Don't you know I'm
thirty? but I think I shall stay twenty-nine until
after the wedding,--not that I am afraid of thirty,
but twenty-nine seems a more interesting age to
be married at. Yes, and the top of his head is
bald."</p>
<p>"Bald!" Both girls emitted another choral
shriek.</p>
<p>"Oh, you needn't make a fuss. He has a very
nice fringe above his ears and around the back of
his head."</p>
<p>"And is he rich?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course he is rich. Do you think I
have been poor and deserving all my life to bestow
myself on a poverty-stricken husband at last?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-030" n="30"/>

<p>Tamsin was listening intently to these revelations
from a higher sphere. She leaned farther forward
to ponder on the speaker. Was that proud, commanding,
well-dressed girl poor ? Here she was,
a guest in a rich man's house and going to marry
another rich man. The Chenoworth division of
all society was simply into rich and poor. The
rich were favored in every way; the poor were
necessarily down-trodden. How, then, was that
girl different from Tamsin Chenoworth, being poor,
according to her own testimony? In a dim way
Tamsin comprehended that there was a strong individual
spirit in that pearl-colored figure, and that
education was a species of riches. Her mental receptiveness
was roused to the fullest action. Rhoda
loomed before her suddenly a vast example. What
Rhoda said became seed, which she strewed plenteously
without knowing it.</p>
<p>"I used to think," exclaimed Jennie, "that you
and Cousin Tom might make a match some
time."</p>
<p>"Captain Tom? I don't see how you could
think that, when we've always been such excellent
friends."</p>
<p>Louise looked up from the grate with a pensive
expression: "Are you very much in love?"</p>
<p>"With my future prospects? Yes, I am. I'm
going to have everything I ever wanted, and a
comfortable husband who knows my untamed


<pb id="VAB9590-031" n="31"/>
                    
ways and won't thwart me." Rhoda took out a
great many hair-pins and let her mass of hair come
down to her waist while she declaimed to the two
fair faces near her. "If there is anything on earth
I am sick and tired of, it is all this nonsense about
sentiment. Now, there you sit, both of you,
stuffed full of love-stories without a grain of practical
sense in one of them, expecting a knight, if
only in the shape of dear, simple Davy Crockett,
to ride up and carry you off. When you see that
very excellent backwoods play--it has literary
mrerits-don't your heart-strings ring to Davy's
rough rendering of 'Young Lochinvar'? 'I want
my bride,' says the knight.--'Git out!' says thl
dad.--'Whoop!' says the knight; and he disappears
from the scene with the willing Voung
lady. That's all very entertaining, but <hi rend="i">I</hi> like civilization.
Not to put too fine a point on it, I like
luxury."</p>
<p>So did Tamsin, though she had never defined her
delight in beautiful and sumptuous surroundings.</p>
<p>"And I can't do without it," continued Rhoda.
"I like the things money will buy, and I've never
had enough to buy them. In the Middle Ages,
when everybody was fighting against everybody
else, the strongest baron was the safest man to
have for a husband. Money is the feudal power
to-day; the strongest baron now is the man who
can make the most money."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-032" n="32"/>

<p>"I should be afraid to marry for money," sighed
Jennie. Her thoughts flew to a very handsome
youth in her father's law-office.</p>
<p>"You'd a great deal better be afraid to marry
without it."</p>
<p>"But is it quite right?" murmured Louise.</p>
<p>"You've been reading Miss Mulock's novels,"
puffed Rhoda scornfully. "I haven't a bit of
patience with that woman. She harps on the
same old silly string year after year, and you girls
listen and weep and long for an impecunious young
man on the altar of whose fortunes you can make
a sacrifice of your youth and comfort. Don't you
know that the key-note of the times is not sentiment,
but practical sense?  Just after the war,
when the country was wrought to a high pitch of
nerves, current literature overflowed with self-sacrifice.
According to that showing,-and current
literature ought to be a good reflection of the
times,-everybody was running around trying to
outdo his neighbor in the broken-heart and self-
renunciation business. One heroine gave up her
lover to a friend who fancied him; another sacrificed
her future prospects to nurse somebody. All
that sort of thing was 'noble.' I think it was
mawkish. It isn't natural and human. I am a
healthy, selfish girl,--not mean or unjust,--but I
have had some sharp, and even cruel, experiences.
I know to my own satisfaction that poverty causes


<pb id="VAB9590-033" n="33"/>" 
                    
more evil than perhaps anything else in the world,
and that easy circumstances are a great nourisher
of the virtues. Why should I let myr own observations
go for nothing and take the dictum of
sentimentalists who have no gauge for my individual
life? Ah! dear Charles Lamb!" mused Rhoda,
leaning forward and resting her elbow on her knee.
"He told the truth, for he had felt the pinch:
'Goodly legs and shoulders of mutton, exhilarating
cordials, books, pictures, the opportunities
of seeing foreign countries, independence, heart's
ease, a man's own time to himself, are not muck,
however we may be pleased to scandalize with that
appellation the faithful metal that provides them
for us."</p>
<p>"Oh, my! I should hate to be real poor and
nobody at all, and have no parties or dresses or
good times," exclaimed Jennie.</p>
<p>"So should I," murmured Louise. " But then
I should hate to marry a man I didn't like at all."</p>
<p>"The man I am going to marry," said Rhoda,
tossing her head back and winding her hair in a
knot, "I do decidedly like. As to being in love
with him, I am not a bit so; that would be very
disagreeable and give him an advantage over me.
Besides, love is a fleeting quality, while you can
put your hand on abundant means and always find
them there. I have been desperately in love--"</p>
<p>"Oh, Rhoda!"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-034" n="34"/>

<p>"And desperately disgusted with it; while I
find that comfort never disgusts me. I like power
and a good position."</p>
<p>("I'd like such things too," thought Tamsin.)</p>
<p>"And I like travel and culture. It is very kind
of this excellent man to lift the burden of life from
me and give me the delicious sensation of not
having to slave for an actual living,--though, of
course, I've always tried to get a full life. I expect
him to have faults, and acknowledge it is not
agreeable to hear him drinking as if his œsophagus
was outside instead of inside his throat, and smacking
his mouth at table. Still, I can forgive him
that. A man whom I doted on might let me carry
my own packages or pierce me with unmerited
reproaches. My observation is that men can be
very tyrannical and abusive toward the women
of their families."</p>
<p>("Oh, can't they, though!" muttered Tamsin,
breathing through closed teeth.)</p>
<p>"Therefore I want to protect myself as much as
possible from the miseries of matrimony. A girl
of my acquaintance married for love, pure and
simple and plenty of it. She expected too much.
She took a very fair young man and spoiled him
with flattery and free service, and exacted no courtesy,
no respect, no delicate consideration, in return,
--nothing but his protested love. The last time I
saw her she was a faded, jaded creature, effervescing


<pb id="VAB9590-035" n="35"/>

sourly at the world, pinched by a paltry income,
while her dear lord rode high and free, enjoying
life in his own way, though doubtless loving her
still. You see, love-matches are just as apt to
turn out badly as any other kind."</p>                  
<p>"I shall be afraid ever to marry anybody if you
don't quit saying such dreadful things," exclaimed
the brunette.</p>
<p>"That won't hurt you," said Rhoda sagely as
she rose. And, laughing, she added, "What a
gallop I have been taking on one of my hobbies!"
"And you haven't told us a <hi rend="i">word</hi> about your
wedding-trip or what things you are going to
have!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am promised the foreign tour. As to
my wardrobe, I shall have to do as well as I can:
in my case, you know, there is no rich relation to
insist on decorating the sacrifice. I rather like
the situation: it would gall me to owe a trosseau
to parties not responsible for me. When we arrive
at Paris, I think I shall have been married long
enough to warrant my accepting a dress or two
from my husband if he insists. He is very generous,
and would load me with gorgeous presents
now if I would allow it."</p>
<p>"I should allow it," exclaimed Jennie. "You
make me perfectly green with envy."</p>
<p>"Me too," chimed Louise as heartily. "Oh,
Rhoda, can't you find each of us a nice old gentleman

<pb id="VAB9590-036" n="36"/>

with that pretty fringe above his ears and
plenty of money?"</p>
<p>"This is what I will do, girls: when we come
back and are settled down, I'll have you to spend
several months with me. It's a very gay little
city; you can have germans and rides and parties
to your hearts' content."</p>
<p>Both girls clapped their hands lightly with
quick enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"We must go to bed now," declared Jennie.
"It's getting near the witching hour, and I am
such a coward! There isn't a soul up in the house
except ourselves."</p>
<p>They gathered up as many of their belongings
as they had scattered about, and Jennie blew out
all the candles except one, which she transferred
to a china candlestick to light the way. In its
rather feeble company, and encircled by an outer
rim of darkness which it could not pierce, the girls
tiptoed through the hall and up-stairs, seeing long
distorted spectres of themselves stretching up the
walls.</p>
<p>When the noise of their closing doors came to
Tamsin's ears through the deep stillness, she
slipped into the front parlor and stooped down
before the remaining coals. Like an automaton
she took the shovel and heaped ashes upon their
trembling light. Fire has the color and the motion
of a living thing. Tansin hung over it with

<pb id="VAB9590-037" n="37"/>

a sensuous pleasure in its beauty. Every point
where a violet flame reared suddenly from the red-
hot bed received a benediction of ashes. Her
hand forgot its mechanical business. "You
needn't think you are going to be slighted," said
Tamsin, talking to a little coal gazing reproachfully
at her through a hole in the ashes. "Here's
a good lot for you,-enough to wrap yourself up in
all night. Every feller will be served alike. Now,
you're winter wheat that's sowed in the fall and
comes up in the spring. The grain's all buried
deep; dirt's over top of it. Folks couldn't tell
the's so much seed kivvered here ready to sprout."</p>

<head rend="center sc">PREPARATION.</head>
                    
<p>Two or three busy days passed rapidly by.
The whole village of Barnet knew there was to be
a party given in honor of the young-lady guests at
the Ilill-house. There could be no loftier pinnacle
of festivity. Like every country town over fifty
years old, Barnet had its solid people who formed
its society,-pcole whose goods increased with
every generation, who lived in time-tinted, hospitable-
looking homesteads, sent their sons to college,
their daughters to seminaries, and loved to prove
to all strangers that they were not a whit behind
the age. In such mature villages you find, in-
steald of the provincial manners you have a right
to look for, a jealous con'rrmity to what these villages
consider city life. But while the citizen is a
free agent, with his own set, perhaps his club or
several clubs, and his amusements, aside from the
serious business of life, the villager is hampered
by a heavy etiquette and a servile imitation of what
he considers standard models.</p>
<p>The Barnet girls were preparing for the party
with delight; the young gentlemen were also 

<pb id="VAB9590-039" n="39"/>

anticipating, according to their several temperaments,
the pleasure or terror of a white-glove assembly in
a community averse to dancing and card-playing
It is true that the very flower of Barnet society
patronized the great yearly ball at the tavern
which celebrated Washington's birthday; but generally
sentiment was against such frivolity, and
ministers about that time waxed very warm in denouncing
the pleasures of sin which are for a
season, and indulgent parents felt compunction
that their pretty girls or spirited boys succeeded
in gaining permission to partake of this exhilarating
wickedness.</p>
<p>Barnet was not intellectual, but it had long
since discarded the plays and marching chants
which belong to primitive society. At its fashionable
assemblies it stood up straight and conversed
with miserable effort, or promenaded, or listened
with hypocritical enjoyment to piano-playing.</p>
<p>But very cheerful preparations were going forward
at the dwelling which had been locally
known as "the Hill-house" ever since the Mills's
grandfather built it there to be away from the
fumes of his distillery, which, half a mile distant,
had discharged slops into the canal at its side and
vast clouds of blackness from  its monumental
chimney into the sky. The silent distillery at this
date leaned as if it meditated making a noise in
the world yet by coming down with all its bulk

<pb id="VAB9590-040" n="40"/>
                    
into the canal; the street leading toward it, which
in earlier days had creaked with loads of grain,
was still called the "cinder-road," and owed its
hardness to ancient ashes from the distillery; the
chimney stood as inflexible as the shaft of Bunker
Hill. But the Mills barely deigned to own it now,
and perhaps felt no gratitude toward the venerable
edifice for the fortune it had given them.</p>
<p>Wax candles, multiplying themselves thousands
of times in pendants and looking-glasses, shone all
over the Hill-house. They were a light peculiar
to that homestead, whose venerable mistress disliked
modern lamps and the smell of oil. The
Mills had always afforded wax candles. Aunt
Sally moulded dozens of them after the best recipe
known to man, which could be found only in her
recipe-book on the page with spring beer and
mince-pies. The faces of her neighbors and neighbors'
children never appeared so pleasing as when
swimming in the mild radiance which wax lights
alone can shed. If the candles ran down or sputtered--
though hers seldom did--or pointed length-
ening spires of wick knobbed with "letters" for
the young people to take off on their fingers, that
was the nature of candles. One branch of Neal's
business on company-nights was to tiptoe around
at least once with the silver snuffers and tray and
snuff all the candles.</p>
<p>A house prepared for guests seems to sit smiling


<pb id="VAB9590-041" n="41"/>

expectantly while it listens for the first arrival.
The piano is open; doors or curtains are drawn
back that parlors and library may meet hospitably
together; the dressing-rooms are warm and
light; the fires are banks of burning color; the
flowers are as fresh as the first girl in white who
bends her neck to smell them. Our familiar haunts
are not ours for the time; they belong to the
genius of Hospitality, and we are merely its purveyors.</p>
<p>Precisely at half-past seven o'clock Aunt Sally
left her last order with Neal and turned toward her
own room to put on the black brocade and lace
bosom-piece which all Barnet honored. She was
a most capable hostess, and her face shone in the
glory of its white hair and benevolence. It was
never a weariness to her to have guests in the
house; and guests were there constantly. Jennie
Mills or any other cousin felt privileged to bring
troops of friends at all times, and the captain had
constant satellites,-old comrades, new and odd
acquaintances, sporting gentlemen who came to
hunt with him in the season.</p>
<p>"Tamsin," said Aunt Sally, looking at the girl
and remembering how rapidly and willingly she
had worked, "I should have let you run home to
change your dress before it got dark. But Tillie
is here; you can take her for company."</p>
<p>Tamsin stood still, looking at the long and 

<pb id="VAB9590-042" n="42"/>

glittering table in the dining-room. "They won't
mind me," she muttered.</p>
<p>"Remember not to stay long," admonished Aunt
Sally.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked up in real anguish: "Do I have
to?"</p>
<p>"Have to what, child?"</p>
<p>"Put on something else."</p>
<p>"Why, that dress is dirty."</p>
<p>"I know't," fingering the threadbare cotton
folds with a trembling touch and speaking in a
whisper. "I thought I'd git time to run home
and wash and iron it; but I didn't." Her fingers
tightened and twitched the faded thing.</p>
<p>"Haven't you any other dress?"</p>
<p>"No, 'm," fiercely, as if the confession were torn
from her.</p>
<p>"I wish I had known it," said Aunt Sally, pushing
up her glasses." I wanted you to help pass
the supper. Why, that's too bad, Tamsin! You
ought to have bought yourself a dress with the
last money I paid you. Let me see : when was
that?"</p>
<p>"Father wanted it," Chenoworth's daughter
deigned to add, with her eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>" Well, I'm sorry," said the fair old lady kindly,
and she went up-stairs with the benevolent intention
of speaking to one of the girls in behalf of
her humble Cinderella.</p>


<pb  id="VAB9590-043" n="43"/>

<p>Tamsin stood still, fingering the old dress, hcr
olive face heated and her mouth curved down in
scorn. "It's always going to be so, it's always
going to be so!" that strong spirit which ground
her down mocked in her ear; upon which her own
spirit defiantly  retorted, "It isn't! it shan't."</p>
<p>Nobody would ever learn from her own lips that
her father was in the habit of borrowing whatever
she could earn and charging up her board and
lodging to her as repayment. If the old man suspected
himself of meanness, he silenced that suspicion
by pointing to the fact that he had a large
family to support and somebody must support it.
One or two small producers fare badly among half
a dozen non-producers.</p>
<p>"I wanted to git Tillie a dress, daddy," Tamsin
had petitioned on the last occasion.</p>
<p>"Dresses is all vanity," said the old man.</p>
<p>"And I'm nearly naked myself."</p>
<p>"Well, where's corn-meal and side-meat to come
from, and all the sugar that you eat up, if so much
money has to be spent on clothes?"</p>
<p>"Why don't the boys work? Why don't you
<hi rend="i">make</hi> 'em work at something?" she cried fiercely;
at which the old man had growled helplessly and
put her earnings in his pocket.</p>
<p>"I might 'a lied and hid it," whispered Tamsin,
winking back a glare of tears which made the few
lights in the dining-room each put a nimbus over

<pb id="VAB9590-044" n="44"/>
                    
its white length. "Then me and Tillie needn't be
shamed as bad as we are. But somehow I never
do: I always give it to him. And folks believe I
don't care how I look. Folks don't know what
you're thinking about." To keep folks from even
suspecting, she changed the expression of her face
the instant the kitchen-door opened, and looked to
see Neal enter in his best black coat and air of
politest superiority. "I hate niggers!" she hissed
under her breath. "They feel so smart when
they've got plenty to eat and to wear and a nice
house to live in."</p>
<p>But it was Tillie who came in and ran up to put
her arms around her elder's waist. Every curve
in Tamsin's face became maternal and tender.
She smoothed the flaxen poll. "I hain't seen
ye for so long," said Tillie.</p>
<p>"Did you miss me, honey?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I don't like to git shut of ye."</p>
<p>"What they doin' down there?"</p>
<p>"Nothin' Sary Jane's baby ain't very well."</p>
<p>"You might 'a come up and stayed with me
awhile yesterday."</p>
<p>"I hate to stan' round in the way. When Aunt
Sally Teagard' saw me comin' in awhile ago,
'peared like she'd think my room was better than
my comp'ny."</p>
<p>Tamsin laughed and rocked the wide-mouthed
little creature to and fro in her arms as they stood:


<pb id="VAB9590-045" n="45"/>

"'Most anybody'd think that of such rag-bags as
you and me. Oh, honey, how I wish I was rich!
If I was, I'd give you everything heart could
wish."</p>
<p>"We're poor," said Tillie lightly, but with conviction.
"We won't never be rich."</p>
<p>" Sometimes I b'lieve I <hi rend="i">will</hi>," stated Tamsin with
fierce energy. " There'll be some chance.  I'd
take you off, honey, to see everything in the world.
You wouldn't have to stick in the mud here. Fine
dresses! A 'cordion to play on !"</p>
<p>"Oh, Tam, <hi rend="i">would</hi> you git me a 'cordion?"</p>
<p>"The finest kind of a one."</p>
<p>"I'd play it and knock the tunes while I's
a-playin'." Tillie began to shuffle her feet and
spread her hands with an imaginary accordion between
them.</p>
<p>"And decenter shoes than you ever had on
your feet yit," added Tamsin savagely. "What
would you like to have the best of anything
now?"</p>
<p>"All the good cake I could eat, iced thick," replied
Tillie, gazing on the glittering table.</p>
<p>Tamsin rocked her to and fro:  "Oh! And
we've got to go into my bedroom and stay hid."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"Because I ain't fit to be seen. You don't look
so bad, but I do."</p>
<p>Tillie looked grave. Her guardian cast about

<pb id="VAB9590-046" n="47"/>
                    
mentally for cheerful entertainment with which te
pass those hours that the guests would spend in
gayety.</p>
<p>"And Mis' Teagard' needs me to help pass the
supper, too! But you can say all your hymlns
out of your little pink book to me settin' there in
the dark together."</p>
<p>Tillie assented dubiously and suggested as a
specimen, "I thank the goodness and the grace."
She moreover plunged at once into the recitation,
knocking the time with her head instead of her
feet: "I've said 'I thank the goodness and the
grace' more times 'n I've got hairs in my head,
Tamsin:

<q rend="blockquote">

<p>("You was born pretty nigh as bad off, though,"

<p>"Tamsin!" It was Miss Jones looking out
from  the parlor.  She was in a loose cashmere
dressing-gown, but her hair was elaborately finished.
"Will you come up to my room--and
bring your little sister if you want to--to help me
a minute?"</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> was Rhoda Jones's device for playing a
brief part as godmother. Aunt Sally had gone to
the girls to have her lace bosom-piece set straight
and mention Tamsin's predicament. "If I had
known it in time," she said with a sympathetic
twist of her mouth, "I could have provided something
for her to put on. There are several good
calicoes of mine she could have, but they would
need a considerable amount of taking in."</p>
<p>"Haven't I got something?" cried Jennie Mills
through a mouthful of dangerous pins and a
checked laugh as she manipulated the lace on the
old lady's noble shoulders.</p>
<p>"You leave it to me," called Rhoda from across
the hall. " Your girl down-stairs, Mrs. Teagarden,
is one of the royal personages in disguise who are
sensitive to all approach. She will have to be surprised
into raiment not her own, or she will not
put it on."</p>
<p>"Tamsin is a good, quiet girl," said Aunt Sally;
" but you don't know the Chenoworths."</p>
<p>"She is the revolt of the Chenoworths," 

<pb id="VAB9590-049" n="49"/>
                    
expounded Rhoda, appearing at the door. "I
haven't had my eyes on her nearly a week for
nothing."</p>
<p>"You have such queer ideas, Rhoda!" laughed
Louise, looking back from her dressing-glass, in
which a glorious blond head was being constructed.
"Give Rhoda a stump and an old woman
with a blackberry basket, with a little patch of sky
overhead and a bit of woods at the back, and she'll
get a story out of it, when I couldn't put it into a
decent pencil-sketch.--Oh, where is that powder-
puff?"</p>
<p>"That's because you draw so abominably," ex-
claimed Jennie.</p>
<p>"I'll draw a ribbon out of my box for Tamsin,
at any rate. Here's one."</p>
<p>"Gracious ! she can't dress herself in one ribbon.
--I might give her my black cashmere, Aunt Sally.
She's larger than Louise, but she's about my
height."</p>
<p>"Janet," said Aunt Sally, "don't say another
word about it. Your black cashmere is nearly
new, and your father and mother would have a
fine opinion of me if I encouraged you in such extravagant
generosity."</p>
<p>"But you will need her."</p>
<p>"I think I can manage with Neal. And the
young gentlemen are always very forward to
assist."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-050"  n="50"/>

<p>"There goes Rhoda down-stairs," said Louise,
setting a knot of ribbon in her hair where it would
do most damage to beholders.</p>
<p>And very shortly Rhoda returned up the back
stairway with two other pairs of feet following her.
She shut her door, murmuring, "This must be a
close séance. Other mediums--even the most
noble--might spoil the communication."</p>
<p>Tamsin waited, erect and folding her arms, without
betraying that she tingled in her raiment beside
this wealthier poor girl's fine half-toilet. Tillie
sat down on a cane-chair by the corner of the
open fire and curled her rough-shod feet out of
sight.</p>
<p>"The others are over there together," said Miss
Jones, unfastening her wrapper, "having no end
of fun while they dress. So I thought of you,
Tamsin, and wondered if you <hi rend="i">would</hi> sew that
white frill under the edge of my velvet train for
me. There are needle and thread and thimble.
Just baste it,--pretty strongly, though: I haven't
any doubt some masculine hoof will be set through
it. The girls are going to look like angels. Have
you seen their dresses?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Tamsin, bending her head over
the sewing.</p>
<p>"I keep pretty steadily to black and rich, heavy
things. They are less expensive in the long run.
Louise is going to be a fluff of lavender-color with

<pb id="VAB9590-051" n="51"/>

a fashionable name, further neutralized by lots of
lace. Jennie is going to be a blaze in the landscape:
she has a scarlet satin that makes her look
like a dream of Egypt."</p>
<p>Tamsin actually felt no sting in these things,
told to her as to any young girl. She glanced up
at Rhoda Jones, and half smiled with interest.</p>
<p>Rhoda paused in the occupation of pencilling
her eyebrows to laugh back. "They were always
so pale," she explained. "Not black and straight,
like yours."</p>
<p>Tamsin brushed the back of her hand across
one eyebrow with a hasty gesture. She rose up
with her little task completed.</p>
<p>"Ever so many thanks. Now I wish you'd put
on this black skirt and red basque and little red
cap, will you. I have a great fancy to see how
you'd look in them."</p>
<p>She brought the garments out of a wardrobe.
The skirt was cashmere; the jacket and tasselled
cap were velveteen. They were full of sandalwood
odor.</p>
<p>"Now, don't refuse," begged Rhoda. "I don't
mind telling you I made these things over for you
myself since I first saw you."</p>
<p>"Made 'em for me?"</p>
<p>"Yes; you're picturesque, and they'll make you
look more so. You can afford to put on odd
things: all girls of your style can. The cap and

<pb id="VAB9590-052" n="52"/>

jacket I had for some private theatricals. I believe
they will fit you to a dot."</p>                 
<p>"Oh, dress up in them, Tamsie!" put in Tillie.</p>
<p>"Do!" said Rhoda, turning from her dressing
to extend her large beautiful arms in argument.
" Why shouldn't you make yourself fair to look
upon, as well as any other girl?  And those
things are yours; I fixed them for you."</p>
<p>Tamsin took up one piece after the other. Tillie
came to look around her elbow.</p>
<p>"And you'd better hurry, my dear," said Rhoda.
"Oh, I nearly forgot: here are a pair of low shoes
and scarlet stockings which go with that dress."</p>
<p>"I'm very much obleeged." Tamsin spoke the
words slowly, as if she were struggling against the
gifts.</p>
<p>"Not a bit. I'm obliged to you for helping
me."</p>
<p>"I don't see how you come to fix 'em--for
me?" with a slight upward inflection of her
voice.</p>
<p>Rhoda came forward laughing, but as if she did
not observe the hesitation and trembling of this
chrysalis woman. To Tamsin her manner seemed
completely charming. It was neither too reserved
nor too familiar. It conferred kindness as a matter
of course, and started an exhilaration like joy
through veins accustomed to torpor.</p>
<p>Without a word of warning Rhcda powdered

<pb id="VAB9590-053" n="53"/>

the flaxen hair and olive face, and Tamsin submitted,
laughing with her.</p>
<p>About ten minutes thereafter there was the noise
of a vehicle in front of the house, and in due season
the door-bell rang.</p>
<p>"Now, there are the Balls," exclaimed Aunt
Sally, bustling out of the chamber where Louise
and Jennie had impressed her willing hands in
their service: "they always drive in early.  I
wonder if Tom is down-stairs?  Make haste,
girls, and tell Miss Rhoda to hurry down." She
looked over the stairway. "Where's Neal? Why
doesn't he answer the door?"</p>
<p>"I'll answer it," said a figure hurrying forward
from the back stairs. "Shall I?"</p>
<p>"Why, Tamsin Chenoworth!" exclaimed Aunt
Sally, bringing her glasses to bear. "Who on
earth did fix you up in that kind of a way?"</p>
<p>"Don't I look right?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, you do. You look real well, considering,"
said Aunt Sally with discretion. She
followed the figure down-stairs with her eyes before
turning to descend by the back way.</p>
<p>The bell rang again. Tamsin opened the door
wide and looked out at night. The hall-lights
were behind her. She saw nobody, and heard
only the soughing of the wind in the evergreens.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed at her feet, a voice spoke,
and she saw a man's head on the top step as if it

<pb id="VAB9590-054" n="54"/>

had just emerged from the shadow where the bell-
handle was. There seemed to be a very little excepting
the head, and it was all muffled up. But
the face was raised to this picture of a black-eyed,
light-haired girl in scarlet and black and black-
lace frills, slim in figure, beautifully oval in face.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked down at the head without uttering
a sound. She was terrified, but with instinctive
compassion betrayed no terror.</p>
<p>"This is Captain Mills's residence?" The head's
voice was pleasing and mellow rather than heavy
and masculine.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Is he at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Will you come in?"</p>
<p>He did not see the pallor around her mouth as
he grasped the side of the door and swung himself
up into the hall. Whatever his length of
limb may have been, it was concealed by a tiny
ulster. The top of his head was not on a level
with Tamsin's waist when he pulled his cap off.
He drew a card from some inner pocket and
handed it up to Tamsin. It bore the name of
"Isaac Sutton." She closed the door, and was
directing him toward the open parlor, when Captain
Mills came into the hall, exclaiming, "Why,
Craque-o'-Doom, how are you? Come in, old fellow,
come in!"</p>

<head rend="center sc">"ISN'T HE HORRIBLE?"</head>
                    
<p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> looked very grotesque to see Captain Mills
and the mite to whom he was obliged to stoop,
shaking hands. They went into the front parlor.</p>                    
<p>"I made use of your general invitation to drop
down on you for what they call the holidays," said
the mellow voice near the floor. "I wanted to get
away from the people, and from the hubbub they
make at this time of the year."</p>
<p>Captain Mills seemed to feel his height an encumbrance
as he pushed a chair near the hearth.
But he took another himself, and this brought his
head nearer to a level with that of his visitor, who
climbed dexterously into place and stuck a pair of
small shoe-soles toward the fire.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad you're here," said Captain Tom
heartily. "But I'm afraid you've dropped down
right upon a hubbub. There's going to be a party
in the house to-night."</p>
<p>"A party?" The tone expressed unmistakable
disgust.</p>
<p>"Yes. Given for some young ladies,--a cousin
of mine and her friends."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-056" n="56"/>

<p>"Young ladies?" Distress was added to the
disgust. " Come, Tom, I must get out of this. I
don't see how I got the idea that you lived like a
Crusoe because you were a bachelor, but that seems
to be the impression I labored under."</p>
<p>"You shall not stir a step," exclaimed Captain
Mills, putting his hand on the figure. "A few
neighbors shan't frighten a man's choice spirits
out of his house. If you don't want to partake of
the festivities--"</p>
<p>"Your pardon, Tom. Look at me!"</p>
<p>Captain Mills did so almost affectionately, and
without removing his hand.</p>
<p>"If you don't want to be tormented with people,"
he continued, "you can adjourn to your room, and
as soon as I can disappear we will hold a session
of our own with closed doors."</p>
<p>"That will do very well. There are the young
ladies though," reflectively. "I wish--I always
wish-I had Gyges's ring."</p>
<p>"Pooh! Three first-rate, comfortable girls. And
here's my aunt, Mrs. Teagarden. Allow me.--My
friend Mr. Sutton, Aunt Sally."</p>
<p>Captain Mills half arose; the dwarf bent his
large head with beautiful deference. Aunt Sally
made the old-time courtesy and came forward to
receive Thomas's friend. Her mouth twitched
spasmodically as she brought her glasses to bear
upon him, but she was charming, and took his

<pb id="VAB9590-057" n="57"/>

hand, giving it a stately shake : "We are very glad
to see you, Mr. Sutton. I have heard Thomas
speak about you. Did you find it cold driving
from the railroad?"</p>
<p>"That reminds me," interrupted the captain:
"have you got your own rig with you?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I usually take it," replied the other half
dejectedly.--" It's my trap," he explained to Aunt
Sally. "I ship the whole thing when I travel, because
there is less risk about it than in trusting
myself to chance."</p>
<p>"Your trap?" said Aunt Sally."Yes, Thomas
sometimes hunts, but he uses guns; though the
very sight of a musket makes me feel sad since the
war.</p>
<p>A smile appeared on the strange face, now
flushed with fire-heat: "I mean my carriage. It
is a snug one, built on purpose for me, and with it
I bring a horse and a coachman."</p>
<p>"Neal will show them the way to the stable,"
said Captain Mills.</p>
<p>"They have gone to your hotel. I saw by the
light that you were at home: so I gave my man
directions before coming in."</p>
<p>"Where is Neal, aunt ? He must go after them.
--Lots of empty stalls here, Craque-o'-Doom, and
room in the carriage-house. It wasn't kind of you
to doubt it."</p>
<p>"Well, when a man has to carry his house on

<pb id="VAB9590-058" n="58"/>
                    
his back, he ought to hesitate about encumbering
his friends with it. My valises were put inside the
gate."</p>
<p>"Here is Neal," exclaimed Aunt Sally, perceiving
him in the vista.--"Neal!" She moved
toward him with a crackle and swish of the rich
brocade. " Go out and bring the valises that were
left by the gate, and then you must hurry down to
the tavern and tell this gentleman's man that he is
to put up here with the horse and buggy. Tamsin
can mind the door until you get back."</p>
<p>"And, aunt," called Captain Mills, as Neal's unwilling
feet went through the hall, "let us have a
room right away." He rose, for Neal's exit was
forestalled by a ring at the door-bell, the first
arrival.</p>
<p>The dwarf got down from his seat and sauntered
behind a large chair, while the people who entered
were ushered to dressing-rooms.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally then led the way up the cleared
stairs, while Captain Mills stayed below to receive
the guests. She was flurried, and conscious of a
spider-like creature climbing rapidly behind her,
and positive she could not have borne to see him
climb ahead of her; so she did not see a beautiful
dark head stretching out above to peep down, or a
timorous blond one appearing behind that.</p>
<p>"Isn't he horrible?" whispered Jennie.</p>
<p>"Oh! oh!" whispered Louise.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-059" n="59"/>
                    
<p>In turning a bend of the stairs, the dwarf gave
them a swift look. His face, seen dimly, expressed
neither pain nor resentment. He was accustomed
to such words.</p>
<p>Rhoda Jones's hand, put out of her room, pulled
them both into it.</p>
<p>"Oh, I hope he didn't hear me!" exclaimed
Jennie when the door was shut; "but he makes
my flesh creep."</p>
<p>"Of course he heard you," said Rhoda. "And
what a mass of nerves and anguish such a creature
must be!"</p>
<p>"Well, I can't help it. I never saw anything so
horrible in my life!"</p>

<head rend="center sc">A NABOB.</head>
                    
<p>W<hi rend="sc">ITHIN</hi> an hour the latest guests had arrived,
and the three girls were in various parts of the
buzzing parlors, making themselves agreeable to
the flower of Barnet society. Louise promenaded
on the arm of an elderly gentleman, while half the
matrons dissected her dress; Jennie had drawn
around herself a court of airy young ladies and admiring
young gentlemen; and Rhoda Jones was
trying to make life less excruciating to a youth of
twenty, with a large Adam's apple and a blushing
countenance, who had the reputation in Barnet of
being "smart."</p>
<p>Everybody talked with strained gayety,--as poor
human nature, gentle as well as simple, always will
do on festive occasions,--excepting some quiet
women who got behind tables and buried them-
selves in photograph-albums or stereoscopic views
until they were marshalled out by Aunt Sally and
catechised about the health of all their distant
relatives and the best method of making blackberry-
balsam.</p>
<p>There were two or three young girls who would


<pb id="VAB9590-061" n="61"/>

evermore remember this event as their first party,
and who hung protectingly to each other, tittering
and squeezing each other's fingers at unspoken
jokes and mutual understandings. They were
afraid to cross the room without their arms interlaced,
and were so desperately anxious to behave
correctly that they stumbled and overturned things
with their elbows, and very much desired to take
off their hands and feet and float. The "town
girls" were constantly watched by them. They
admired Louise and Jennie with all their souls, but
Rhoda Jones, so approachable that she considered
herself quite Bohemian, was an awful mystery to
them. They told each other in thrilling whispers
that she "wrote," and they both envied and ridiculed
the temerity of the young man with the
Adam's apple, who stood up grasping the lapels of
his coat and talked his intelligent talk to her. If
she looked toward them, they were desperately
afraid she saw something about them to impale and
hold up before the public. They promenaded the
halls, and were after a while overwhelmed to find
themselves on the arms of their elder sisters' cavaliers,
who took them up in a patronizing, paternal
way wholly delightful. When Tamsin Chenoworth
was helping to pass refreshments, these young
girls, her contemporaries, pitied her because she
could not sit on the stairs with an elderly beau to
fan her and hold her plate,--or they would have

<pb id="VAB9590-062" n="62"/>

pitied her if they had considered her worth the
trouble.</p>
<p>Before supper was served, however, Captain
Mills made his way slowly, past groups with whom
he stopped to chat, to Rhoda, and offered her his
arm, saying, "I'd like to consult with you a
minute, if you can excuse yourself."</p>
<p>"About what?" she inquired, moving away
with him.</p>
<p>"I hope I didn't break in on anything very interesting?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, you did. You took me away from
an altar where clouds of incense have been rising
to my delighted nose. Don't you call it interesting
to be gazed upon as a goddess, when you know
that hard work and plenty of it is the law of your
life."</p>
<p>"Very interesting," laughed the captain. "You're
quite a lion down here, you know."</p>
<p>"And what a comfort that is, when I consider
that I am a mere lamb in Park Row and Madison
Square! The gentleman from whom you took
me was discoursing the sweetest flattery, without a
suspicion that I have had a book published for
which I never got a cent of royalty." They both
laughed as they entered the dining-room.</p>
<p>Tillie Chenoworth was sitting there, with her
feet curled under her, by the fire, listening to the
buzz of society. Tamsin stood beside her, with

<pb id="VAB9590-063" n="63"/>

one hand on her shoulder. They were quite at
the other end of the room.</p>
<p>"What has been done to that girl?" said Captain
Tom, looking at her shapely back, as he
paused beside the table.</p>
<p>"Oh, she has merely put on a bright kerchief
and washed her face, as Fanchon did," said Rhoda.
"Men will always notice a woman's new gear
either in effect or detail. Did you ever feel interest
enough in that girl to draw her out and see
whether she has a thinking, sensitive nature?"</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," returned Captain Tom
drolly. They were speaking in a low tone, so that
their voices reached Tamsin as a heavy murmur.
" Your speaking of Fanchon reminds me that I
gave her that book to read once,-the English version
of it. She was dusting the books and looking
into them. I picked up 'The Cricket,' and
said I,' Here, Tamsin, here's something you will
like. It's about a smart little girl who made a
woman of herself.' She took the book, and I went
on elaborating: 'It's been made into a play and
put on the stage, and it's quite popular. People
like to see a poor girl come out at the top of the
heap.'"</p>
<p>"And what did she say?" inquired Rhoda, smiling
slowly.</p>
<p>"Well, she read it when she got time, and when
I thought of it I asked her how she liked it. The


<pb id="VAB9590-064" n="64"/>

girl has brilliant eyes, you know. She looked
down and answered, 'Very well;' then she looked
up with a sort of flash, and said,' I don't think that
Cricket had much spunk, or she wouldn't let 'em
see when she felt bad."</p>
<p>Rhoda nodded her head several times. The
scarlet bodice stood in relief against the black
mantel. Tillie stirred restlessly, and said in an
undertone, feeling for the hand on her shoulder,
"Tamsie, when we goin' to have some cake?"</p>
<p>"Soon's they have supper."</p>
<p>"Will you gimme a piece of that one all over
flowers?" the wide mouth showing its pink gums.</p>
<p>"Yes, honey, if Mis' Teagard' lets me."</p>
<p>"They're goin' to begin now, ain't they?"</p>
<p>"Not till about 'leven."</p>
<p>"But <hi rend="i">them</hi> ones is goin' to begin."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked over her shoulder at the host
and his companion.</p>
<p>"I brought you on purpose," said Captain Tom
to Rhoda, "to have a tray of something he would
like fixed up for him. I thought you'd be the
most likely person to hit off his fancy."</p>
<p>"Much obliged for the compliment. Do you
know what he ordinarily prefers?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think I do. Somehow, I can't recall
him eating. But he's a hearty fellow, too.
He was up on the Canadian rivers last summer
with several of us."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-065" n="65"/>

<p>"What! that little creature?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tom. "I suppose I got used to his
being little. He is as swift and active as a bird."</p>
<p>"The girls were peeping at him when he went
up-stairs." As she talked, Rhoda selected a bit
here and a bit there and covered one of the ready
salvers. "Jennie said he was horrible."</p>
<p>"Craque-o'-Doom isn't horrible: I don't find
him so. He seemed queer at first. But men
aren't so particular as women. The camping-
party I met him with all voted him first-class."</p>
<p>"Craque-o'-Doom ! That isn't his name?"</p>
<p>"His name's Sutton. I don't know how he got
the other, but that's what he's called. I do hope
you'll be good to him while he's here: he'll be apt
to take to you. And he's a rare gentleman:
there's something delicate and fine about his nature.
It is like a woman's; and yet, deformed as
he is, I never thought him effeminate."</p>
<p>"I am anxious to meet him : I always like new
experiences and unusual people. Won't he be
visible this evening at all?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," exclaimed Tom. "Come up-stairs
now. He and I have been having a good
talk ever since I got away from the crowd."</p>
<p>"So I will. Tamsin, is the coffee made?"</p>
<p>Tamsin came up the room to Rhoda and paused
beside the tray. "I don't think it is yit," she
replied. "Do you want it right away?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-066" n="66"/>

<p>"We're going to carry some supper to the gentleman
up-stairs. Yes, he will want coffee, of
course.--Captain Tom, have you got a little preserved
ginger? This tray looks rather tempting.
We'll take it ourselves."</p>
<p>"I know what you want," said Tamsin, stopping
on her way to the kitchen: "as soon as I
tell Ann Maria you want the coffee made, I'll
get it."</p>
<p>Rhoda looked after her approvingly: "That girl
has great adaptability. She has improved within
two or three days. Do you know I'm interested
in her ? She silently attracts me."</p>
<p>"Does she?" said Tom, smiling. "She's an
odd creature. Aunt Sally's had her about the
house a great deal, and I've tried to encourage
her, but I never could make her out."</p>
<p>"She'll surprise you some time if the sun ever
shines upon her. That girl's frozen by her circumstances.
She feels nothing but the pinch, and
thinks nothing but rebellion. Let her be thawed
and fostered, and she will reveal herself in a way
you will be far from despising."</p>
<p>"I hope I'm far from despising any woman."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-067" n="67"/>

<p>Rhoda looked up with an admiring expression:
"You're such a man as women cannot help approving
of. Certainly you are far from despising
any woman. You're a universal Wing over them!
We're waiting for that ginger, aren't we? I wonder
if your friend likes it?"</p>
<p>"He probably does. In his camp-stores he had
all manner of odd foreign stuff. He has queer
tastes, and gratifies them to the utmost."</p>
<p>"He must be a nabob.-This is it. Thanks."
Rhoda received the ginger-pot from Tamsin's
hand. Tamsin hesitated for further directions on
the edge of the conference.</p>
<p>"He?" replied Tom. "Craque-o'-Doom  is
worth his hundred thousands. He has a lovely
place down at Swampscott, they told me,--summer-place,
--and a rich old den up the North River.
He's rich as a lord, and it's a good thing for him."</p>
<p>"Of course it is."</p>
<p>"He has bonds and stocks, and I don't know
what all. His family was a first-rate one, too,
but I believe they are all dead except himself.
He's desperately fond of music. <hi rend="i">I</hi> think he's a
sort of a genius. Oh, you'll find him out by
degrees.  I don't know how he gets on with
ladies: he doesn't like to show himself. But I
have seen him endure staring and remarks in
perfect silence."</p>
<p>"Take the salver now," said Rhoda, "and we


<pb id="VAB9590-068" n="68"/>
                    
will go up the back stairway.-Tamsin, as soon as
the coffee is done, bring a hot cup of it, with cream
and sugar, on another salver, please."</p>

<p>A<hi rend="sc">FTER</hi> the captain and Miss Rhoda had gone
up-stairs, Tamsin stood beside her sister, looking
into the fire. Tillie's face was scorched by the
pleasant heat. She leaned sleepily on the back
of her chair, untroubled by her elder's train of
thought.</p>
<p>Tamsin lifted one of the claw-like fists from her
sister's lap and looked at it.</p>
<p>"They're clean," pleaded Tillie thickly.</p>
<p>"I know it," said Tamsin. Her palm wandered
over the sharp protuberances of Tillie's little
shoulder-blades.  "You're made straight, ain't
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Tillie. "So're you."</p>
<p>"Do I look tall? Do I look like other folks?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and you look pretty," added Tillie.</p>
<p>"Did you see the little man that Mis' Teagarden
took up-stairs?"</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-069" n="69"/>

<p>"Uh-huh!" grunted Tillie affirmatively. "I
was in the hall, lookin' for you to come back. It
scar't me so I run to your room and jumped under
the bed."</p>
<p>"Did he look ugly?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he looked orful! He walked along this
way." The supple child dropped from her chair,
doubled herself up, and danced across the floor
with her legs half abbreviated. Tamsin watched
her without comment. The effort was exhausting:
so Tillie returned in the natural manner to
her chair.</p>
<p>"Would you like me," said Tamsin, "if I was
that way?"</p>
<p>"No," returned the little one with frank decision;
"I'd run from ye like a white-head. Everybody would."</p>
<p>"But if I had lots of money and could give
you everything you wanted, and was that way,
wouldn't you like me at all?"</p>
<p>"No; that wouldn't make no difference," explained
Tillie. "I'd run from ye all the same."</p>
<p>Tamsin's eyes filled with anguish. She stooped
over her sister and looked into the light, laughing
eyes.</p>
<p>Tillie gave her a bony little hug: "You ain't all
hunched up, Tammie."</p>
<p>"But I might 'a been!"</p>
<p>Tillie drew her lips together over her gums,


<pb id="VAB9590-070" n="70"/>

and was settling against Tamsin to meditate com-
fortably on such a possibility, when the elder put
her by : "I must take that coffee up-stairs." She
put the necessary things on a salver, went into
the kitchen, and returned past Tillie with fragrant
steam issuing from a cup of Dresden china. She
had daringly taken one of Aunt Sally's treasures
for the service of the dwarf. If that heavy Dresden
cup and saucer got broken, Tanimsin Chenoworth
dared not think of the consequences.</p>
<p>"I thought it over," announced Tillie. "If
twas <hi rend="i">you</hi>, Tam, I don't believe I'd run from ye.
But"--Tillie shook her forefinger impressively--
"I don't want to see that chap up-stairs <hi rend="i">no more</hi>."</p>
<p>The captain and Rhoda had been hurriedly demanded
down-stairs. When Tamsin turned the
knob of the chamber-door after knocking, she was
surprised to find only the occupant. He sat comfortably
before the fire, buried in an easy-chair, a
table at his side holding the salver Tom had
brought. The room, like all the other rooms in
house, was spacious and high, yet he, a mote of
humanity, remained its principal point. A Persian
rug worn silky smooth trailed across his lap, concealing
the lower part of his body: it was a constant
habit of his to drape himself thus.  His
blond head had a square massive look, and his
neck was strong and cleanly smooth as tinted
ivory.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-071" n="71"/>

<p>Tamsin saw his entire face for the first time. It
was not weazen and shrunken, but ample, delicately
featured, with a lutmiinous expression. lie
wore a close-trimmed moustache; the head tilted
back against the stuffed chair had an actual manly
beauty of its own, which was multiplied when he
turned his glance toward the girl. His eyes were
very gray, with a velvet quality hard to describe.
They were large and set wide apart under brows
so full of expression that their slightest motion
changed the whole face.  He looked at Tamsin,
and she paused inside the door with the coffee-
tray.</p>
<p>Their steady gazing on each other was first realized
by the dwarf. lie smiled, parting his lips
over teeth as fine and clear as polished shells.</p>
<p>"Well?" said he with an interrogative accent.
Tamsin approached and set down his coffee, rearranging
the other salver afterward, so that everything
was within his reach. Having done so, she
again met his eyes, resting one hand on the table
and placing the other behind her. Iier whole appearance
was innocent and fascinating. She felt
herself in an atmosphere which gave her peculiar
case, as if she had mental lungs inhaling and exhaling
an air full of scents and hints and influences
of some higher world.  The same feeling had
struck her on early summer mornings when a
branch of wild roses shook dew in lher face, or on


<pb id="VAB9590-072" n="72"/>

winter evenings when the sun left a warm red bar
above snow-fields and skeleton woods. Of this sensation
Tamsin would probably never speak to any
other palpitating soul. It was her glimpse of immortality,
her recognition of the fact, "I have lived
heretofore in other conditions than this, and I shall
live again in glory now unknown to me." Her
face had no self-consciousness: she was for the
time without personality.</p>
<p>The deformed man said suddenly, the words
sounding strange to his own ears and as if spoken
by some one else, "You don't shudder at sight of
me. I believe most women do; but you do not.
Why don't you?"</p>
<p>"I don't see no reason to," said Tamsin slowly,
as if weighing her convictions. Taking her hand
from the table, she turned and went out of the
room, but put back her head to inquire, "Is there
anything else, sir?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you. This is abundance,--more
than I could have asked."</p>

<p>B<hi rend="sc">EFORE</hi> the young ladies came down to their
late breakfast next morning the captain and his
friend had breakfasted and started for a short
drive in the latter's carriage. This snug vehicle
was of the coupe pattern, with steps particularly
adapted to a gentleman whose legs were only a
couple of spans long. The padded interior had a
smell of wild flowers.</p>
<p>"Drive us up the pike," said Tom to the stolid
coachman.--" On the ridge you can get a good
view of our village, Craque-o'-Doom. It isn't
what it once was. The bisection of the National
Road and Ohio Canal made this place, and the increase
of railway-traffic everywhere else killed it.
We have warehouses, flour-mills, and distilleries
standing empty and idle. That pile yonder belongs
to our family. My father let the business
die out, and I don't think that I should ever care
to revive it, if circumstances were ever so favorable."</p>
<p>"What occupation do you claim for yourself?"
said Craque-o'-Doom, lowering the window to get
at the pleasant winter air.</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-074" n="74"/>
    
<p>"Well, I'm that lazy dog a gentleman farmer.
When I came home from college I was full of
enthusiasm about law. I began to read; but
about that time the war broke out, and after my
four years' service I found the old estate running
to seed, and settled down to improve it. In various
ways I've been improving it ever since,--
experiments here and fertilizers there, study of
crops and soils, and all that coquetting with labor
which the out-and-out farmer despises. If I had
nothing, I should be considered half a loafer; but,
as I'm tolerably well-to-do, my neighbors think
I can afford to loiter."</p>
<p>They heard the spat of boot-soles on the flinty
pike behind them, for that hard-grained thoroughfare
clove through snow when all the by-roads
were covered.</p>
<p>"If I had been allowed to choose a career," said
the dwarf, "I should have chosen something that
would bring oratory into play. I can't imagine
anything greater than standing before an assembly
and shaping its opinions."</p>
<p>The spat of boot-soles now overtook the carriage,
and a crew of five or six small boys ran
along on each side of it. "That's him!" panted
one. "Here he is, on this side! He aint no bigger'n
a baby!"</p>
<p>"Lem<hi rend="i">me</hi> see," struggled another, with curiosity
as callous as if the dwarf had been beyond sight


<pb id="VAB9590-075" n="75"/>

and hearing. "lie's got arms, 'cause I see his
hand. What show does he travel with?"</p>
<p>"Look out!" panted the others in warning to
this bold youth, who seemed about to climb upon
the step: "he might shy somethin' at ye. Them
kind is bad when they get their tempers up."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom laughed, but Tom, in high displeasure,
opened the window beside him. "Boys,"
cried he severely, "get away from this carriage, or
I'll have you all locked in the calaboose. I'll take
down the names of every one of you. Don't you
know any better than to annoy a gentleman in this
way?"</p>
<p>They fell back, somewhat abashed, but one said,
"Then you orter take down Billy Mac's name too.
He's up behind, peepin' through the curtain."</p>
<p>Captain Mills struck back at the curtain, but at
the same instant heard a thud of some one dropping
on the pike. "The little scoundrels!" he
exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Don't mind it," said Craque-o'-Doom. "I
have had time enough to grow accustomed to my
notoriety."</p>
<p>Captain Mills put his head out of the window
and directed the driver to turn into a by-street:
"They will find it isn't so easy to follow us along
the soft roads." He looked back, and saw the
boys reluctantly giving up their chase. They
seemed aggrieved and disconcerted, and from

<pb id="VAB9590-076" n="76"/>

among them came a well-aimed snow-ball, out
of the arc of whose descent Captain Tom dodged
into the carriage.</p>
<p>The winter landscape looked desolate. They
crossed from one street to another. Detached
from other houses and standing among the skeletons
of last year's cornstalks was one house which
Craque-o'-Doom pointed out as embodying his idea
of all that was dismal. "Though, with appropriate
hollyhocks and sunflowers and climbing plants, it
might look better in summer," said he. "But
the sodden door-yard and bleak background are
enough to give a mere passer the blue devils.
How do people support life in such places, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="i">that</hi> place!" replied Captain Mills. "That's
where Tamsin lives,--Tamsin Chenoworth, the girl
my aunt has with her up at our house."</p>
<p>"She opened the door when I arrived?"</p>
<p>"Maybe she did."</p>
<p>"And brought up my coffee last evening?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So she lives there? Your aunt has her engaged
as a servant?"</p>
<p>"Well, no. We are afraid of that word around
here, Craque-o'-Doom. I can call my black man
my servant, but we have to be careful how we
apply the term to whites in a rural community."</p>
<p>"Domestic, then?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-077" n="77"/>

<p>"Not exactly. Aunt Sally has her about the
house frequently, and takes some interest in her.
She belongs to a miserable family, and seems to
have rather more to her than the rest of them.
Miss Jones has taken a fancy to her, too."</p>
<p>They had passed the house, when they saw an
old man picking his way along fence-corners, carrying
a chair on his shoulder. He looked up with
a dull eye.</p>
<p>"How d' do, Mr. Chenoworth?" saluted Captain
Mills good-naturedly. "That's the girl's father,"
he explained to Craque-o'-Doom. "The old fellow
mends chairs, when he can get them to mend.
He has a prodigious family, and a family connection
that ramifies through our lowest population.
When I was younger I used to have romantic ideas
about digging up and fertilizing this lower stratum,
but I've come to the conclusion that the best thing
you can do with such people is to let them alone."</p>
<p>"Entirely?"</p>
<p>"No. I throw jobs in their way when I have
any, but I don't intrude my advice or expect them
to have the political intelligence they ought to
have, considering they are in numbers sufficient
to control the vote of the township."</p>
<p>"The women of any kind of barbarians always
have to suffer. Did you ever think of that when
y(;u let such old patriarchs of misery as that one
we just passed gang their ain gait?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-078" n="78"/>

<p>"Well, what can I do for their women? I tell
you, Craque-o'-Doom, these poor devils whom we
pity have a strong aristocratic tang. There's that
girl Tamsin Chenoworth, for instance: she's as
proud as a queen in her way. She looks at you
furtively and suspiciously; her dignity is not to be
jarred by any fatherly encouragement or advice.
I'm as free with my old neighbors as any man can
be, yet I couldn't say to her, 'Tamsin, you had
better take this course, or that.' If she goes to the
dogs, as one of her sisters has been doing, or breaks
out with the family weakness for stealing, it isn't my
fault; I can't help it. But at present she's a very
good girl, and my aunt takes an interest in her."</p>
<p>They returned home long before the mid-day dinner.
The young ladies were lounging in the back
parlor, in Watteau gowns and easy slippers. Jennie
lay on a sofa, with yards of garnet cashmere trailing
over her feet; Louise had an easy-chair and a
hassock, a novel and an amethyst-colored shawl;
but Rhoda Jones rocked vigorously, stopping at
intervals to scribble with a pencil on paper held
by a reporter's clip which lay in her lap. "I'm
just taking down some impressions," she had condescended
to explain to the girls, who regarded
her performance with a mixture of amusement and
dread: they were afraid the remorseless spider in
her head might at any time rush out to seize upon
and make meat of them. They had seen her

<pb id="VAB9590-079" n="79"/>

demonstrate that material is material, even if you find
it in your blood-relations.</p>
<p>"If you take down impressions of me," requested
Louise, "make me immensely stylish. I've always
wanted so much more style than I have. You
might pile up my blond tresses and leave out the
switches and top friz. I want a good many lovers,
because they're rather scarce in real life."</p>
<p>"I don't," murmured Jennie; "I want just one,
--as handsome as he can be, with blue eyes, and
golden hair, and a moustache the same color, that
droops down to his chin, and long white hands.
And lie must dance just elegantly, and be three
or four years older than myself. He'd always
have to wear nice boots, and those lovely round
coats without any tails to 'em."</p>
<p>"And probably he could make the money to
buy them just about as well as you could," said
Rhoda.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course he'd be wealthy and polished."</p>
<p>"The gold-locked men out West, three or four
years your seniors, usually have the polish which
grinding for a living gives them, and the wealth of
hope. They have their fortunes to make, and if they
dance themselves into fashionable society, usually
dance into debt too. 'Swing low, sweet chariot.'
Men are strong, plodding fellows. Women don't
marry angels any more. It made a great fuss
before the Flood."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-080" n="80"/>

<p>Tom Mills's voice and one much mellower than
his were heard in the front hall, together with a
tramping and lighter patting of feet. The captain
and his friend were taking off their wraps.</p>
<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed Louise, starting up.
Jennie kicked her train off her feet to make a dart
for the dining-room.</p>
<p>"Sit down!" said Rhoda Jones menacingly.
"You shan't run away. I could shake you both!"</p>
<p>"I shall die if I have to look at him," pleaded
Jennie. "He turns me positively faint."</p>
<p>"I don't care if he does," said Rhoda: "he's
your cousin's guest, and you are bound to receive
him."</p>
<p>"He isn't <hi rend="i">my</hi> cousin's guest," began Louise,--
when a door opened, and Tom entered with the
dwarf.</p>
<p>He made his good-morning bow to Rhoda, and
was presented to the younger girls. They sat in
embarrassment, looking down at the toes of their
slippers.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom found a ready place on a low
hassock at one side of the fire: it spared him the
confusion of having to scale a chair. His body
tapered abruptly from shoulders to feet; his arms
were rather long. In a gentleman's business-or
morning-suit he appeared a masquerading child,
while sitting still or until he turned his mature
face towards the beholder. When he walked,

<pb id="VAB9590-081" n="81"/>
                    
however, his short legs and small feet seemed
hardly capable of carrying his upper bulk. He
did not in the least expect any attention, and his
manner was modest but self-respecting.</p>                  
<p>Rhoda noticed how fresh a tinge the ride had
given his face. She put the reporter's clip aside,
and cast a warning look at the two girls, who in
their turn cast pleading looks at Tom.</p>
<p>Tom felt complacent about his own inches, but
he could see no reason why any woman should
not find Craque-o'-Doom agreeable society. He
stood by the mantel and warmed his feet.</p>
<p>"Did you have a nice ride?" inquired Rhoda.</p>
<p>"We had a royal progress," laughed Craque-o'-
Doom: "the populace followed us."</p>
<p>"A lot of the town boys," explained Captain
Mills, with a lingering shade of annoyance. "They
tagged the carriage as if we'd a live boa-constrictor
or an ape inside."</p>
<p>Louise telegraphed by a look to Jennie her concurrence
with the boys' opinion. But Jennie was
scanning the little man's face with astonishment
that she could do so without screaming. It was
rather a pleasant sight than otherwise.</p>
<p>"You couldn't put any heroism in the hero of
such a scene, could you, Miss Jones?" said he.
"I understand you are one of those fortunate people
who go about making mental photographs for
reproduction in letters."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-082" n="82"/>

<p>"Do you call that fortunate? Why, I have often
thought my lot a miserable one. If you would
only be kind enough to say you envy me, now!"</p>
<p>"Certainly I envy you such resources."</p>
<p>"Good! I always wanted to be envied. It has
been my dream to stalk about the world so fortunate
and immaculate that everybody who saw me
should turn fairly green. To that end, I am always
magnifying my good luck and concealing my
crosses. But don't ask me to have any opinions
about heroism: I don't think I like it. It's a
strained, uncomfortable effect; it's stagey. Heroic
people seem to stand under colored or calcium
lights in a tableau with the curtain just going
down."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom laughed.</p>
<p>"Ah, I <hi rend="i">like</hi> such things!" exclaimed Jennie
spontaneously.</p>
<p>The dwarf half turned his face toward her with
respectful attention. But Louise, with nervous
precipitation, sprang up and begged Captain Mills
to come into the other parlor and try a duet with
her.</p>
<p>"Craque-o'-Doom plays capitally," exclaimed
Tom, moved by the obtuse zeal of his sex.--
"Come on, old man, and give the girls some
music."</p>
<p>"If they will remain seated here and not watch
my contortions at the piano," he replied, with a

<pb id="VAB9590-083" n="83"/>

delicacy which touched Louise, "perhaps I can
entertain them."</p>
<p>"Please do," murmured the young ladies.</p>
<p>"But we may applaud?" said Rhoda.</p>
<p>"I am not accustomed to applause," replied the
dwarf, smiling, as he rose.</p>
<p>Tom and he went in to the piano, and they
heard him rolling a hassock to the piano-stool
and saying, "I have to mount these revolving
light-houses carefully, you know." Then the keys
responded to such a touch as had never before visited
them. He began playing a movement from
Liszt's "Tarantella."</p>
<p>"I don't know what that is," murmured Jennie.
But Rhoda Jones sat rapt. His execution was
wonderfully brilliant, yet of so sympathetic a quality
that a listener was always strangely moved
by it.</p>
<p>Tom stood, with one hand on his hip, at the end
of the piano, and watched the dwarf's lithe, float-
ing fingers with interest. He would have preferred
a good tune to which he could pat his toe
in accompaniment, but it gratified him to see a
little monstrosity like Craque-o'-Doom so well up
in a higher kind of gymnastics. It escaped his
observation that Tamsin Chenoworth's younger
sister was at the long veranda-window flattening
her cheek against the glass in a vain effort to see
who could be creating such sounds within.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-084" n="84"/>
                    
<p>When the selection was finished, a feverish
hand-clapping in the back parlor succeeded.</p>
<p>"I shall not touch that piano again while I am
here," said Rhoda decidedly.</p>
<p>"Isn't it queer he can play so?" whispered
Louise.</p>
<p>As Tom moved out of the way, Tillie, on the
veranda, got a look at the dwarf wriggling off the
piano-stool. She gave a jump which landed her
in the path, took to her heels, and banged the
gate behind her in a mad flight toward home.</p>

<p>A <hi rend="sc">WINTER</hi> thaw made Barnet the most dismal
place on earth. The pike stood up like a causeway
between sluggish streams of water. A landscape
of mud and fog, through which the canal
crept like a yellow snake, cheered the looker-out.
A smell of stables, of fat burnt half a mile away,
and an all-prevailing odor of old clothes, invaded
the most unlikely places. Drip, drip, drip, all day
and all night long, the rain splashed from the
eaves. And there was no pleasure in a heaped-up
fire, for it suffocated. The homesteads looked
draggled, and smoke trailed along the ground,
leaving a sediment of soot on fence and despondent
tree. Every umbrella perambulating the
streets as if under protest said to every other umbrella
it met, propelled by a pair of high boots
with pantaloons stuck in them, "Well, what do
you think of this weather?" Trains three miles
away could be plainly heard breathing, and their
whistles seemed shrieking in people's front yards.</p>
<p>The young ladies at the Hill-house tried to
return their calls before the date of their departure,



<pb id="VAB9590-086" n="86"/>

but after one or two attempts came driving
home with flecks of mud on their faces. Barnet
streets were bottomless. Tom could not take his
deformed friend out to see his barns, or his vineyard
on the side-hill, without the risk of swamping
him in mud. The most reliable spots of soil
had grown strangely spongy, and pools stood on
flat surfaces.</p>
<p>The first day of this weather the inmates of the
house laudably attempted to amuse each other, but
after that there was a natural falling away into
groups of one or two. The girls lounged in
Rhoda's room, where there was an open fire, declaring
that the register in their own apartment
was more than they could endure. Rhoda shut
herself in the small library, which was little more
than an alcove off the back parlor, and entered
upon inky mysteries which she called blocking
out a short sketch. Captain Mills and his friend
had each other for constant company.</p>
<p>Tom was obliged to ride away late on an afternoon
to attend to some urgent business. "If we
could take any kind of a vehicle, I would ask you
to go along," he said ruefully: "the drive might
be better than moping in the house, though I don't
relish the prospect. You'll have to try and amuse
yourself. I guess the girls have all taken to
novels."</p>
<p>"Don't be disturbed about me," said Craque-o'-Doom.


<pb id="VAB9590-087" n="87"/>

"Though I like your society, as you
know, I'm accustomed to having a great deal of
my own. A fellow of my sort studies his resources.
Do you think I shall disturb anybody if
I thump the piano softly?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit: they enjoy your playing."</p>
<p>"I don't mean to play, but to see what you have
in your collection of music."</p>
<p>"You won't find anything to your taste," exclaimed
Captain Tom. "The fact is, we ain't
musical down here. The girls may have brought
some new pieces, but that old yellow pile all belonged
to my sister. I used to like her playing,
but I didn't know anything about it. Well, I have
to be off."</p>
<p>"I hope you'll have a pleasant ride."</p>
<p>Tom twisted his face: "That can't be done
along the bank of a yellow ditch oozing with
slush."</p>
<p>"Tamsin," said Aunt Sally to her young handmaid,
"here's a new calico dress-pattern I've had
around the house since last summer, but never
made up. That's Merrimac print, and will wash
and wear well. This sack and skirt you've got on
is too good to wear about your work in the mornings.
You ought to have a calico; and now, while
there's nothing doing, we'll cut this out and begin
to make it up for you."</p>
<p>Tamsin's face, richer in its tones and softer in its


<pb id="VAB9590-088" n="88"/>
lines than it had been a week before, grew warm
with a flush singularly veiled by its transparent
olive skin. She said slowly, " I'm much obliged.
If you will let it go on my wages--"</p>
<p>"Now, nonsense!" exclaimed Aunt Sally. "I
shan't do anything of the kind. It's stuff I've had
about the house, and it'll make you a good dress:
so say no more about it, but let us get to work."</p>
<p>The capable old lady got out her lap board and
shears: she had a poor opinion of anything not
cut on her lap-board. She cut out a yoke for the
calico dress. It was to be gathered full into a belt,
hang straight without an overskirt, and have a
ruffle around the bottom.' That was the way they
cut calico dresses just after the war, and Aunt Sally
saw no occasion for changing such an excellent
fashion, if the girls in town did rig themselves out
and cut good cloth to silly waste. Tamsin, on her
part, accustomed to the more ancient cutting of
her mother, who made even Tillie look like a
small but unrevised edition of our pioneer grandmothers,
found the fashion of her new calico pleas-
ing to her sight. She dimly foresaw the effect on
a pliant figure, and stitched awkwardly at the
gathers while Aunt Sally sewed the long seams
on her old Wheeler &amp; Wilson,--the first machine
which had ever come into Barnet.</p>
<p>Over its clatter, minor and major chords, swelling
and receding, came through the dining-room

<pb id="VAB9590-089" n="89"/>

door with the regular lap of the tide. This music
stirred queer sensations in Tamsin; she half resented
being so moved. Time and circumstances
melted from around her; she was in a great city,
in a musky atmosphere, living with intense eagerness
and delight. Or some dormant unknown
power within herself half awoke and muttered
inaudible promises about her future.</p>
<p>The sewing-machine clattered on until, all the
long seams being done, Aunt Sally took off her
spectacles. "You can go right ahead with your
work, Tamsin," said she. "I must have my nap 
before tea-time. There was a remarkable piece in
my <hi rend="i">Banner of Light</hi> I wanted to glance at, too."
She added afterward, from the back parlor, "Tamsin,
come in here with your work, and see that
this fire doesn't go down. I told Neal to let the
furnace die out; but we must have some heat in
the rooms this damp weather."</p>
<p>Tamsin brought her sewing to the grate. She
sat there alone. The eaves dripped, and the woods
tore rags of cloud which scudded over them.
Craque-o'-Doom played softly, as if he were whispering
to the piano. The thread knotted as if it
knew it was in a Chenoworth's fingers, and as fast
as she conquered one knot another harder one
challenged her. She forgot the sound of the
piano, and was not conscious of any changes in
the room, until, looking up vaguely disturbed, she

<pb id="VAB9590-090" n="90"/>

saw the dwarf sitting down on a hassock at the
opposite side of the fire.</p>
<p>Neither party gave any sign of having noticed
the other. Craque-o'-D)oom warmed his delicate
hands at the blaze: he loved fire, and huddled
toward it as toward a companion. The coals murmured
faintly in their self-communing way, and
occasionally a bit of slate cracked in the heat and
popped over the bars, as if entirely dissenting from
what it heard around it.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom looked at the girl's bowed face
and motionless eyelids. Her hand went to and
fro, drawing a long thread: it was a red hand.
Her posture was one of reticence and repose.</p>
<p>"I saw your father this morning," said Craque-
o'-Doom.</p>
<p>Tamsin raised her head, her black eyes seeming
to shoot out in her face. She did not speak, but
looked thoroughly on the defensive.</p>
<p>The dwarf rested his gaze on her: "He is an
old man, and appears as if life had not used him
kindly." This mellow voice seemed to be making
tender excuses for the old Cbenoworth's thriftlessness.
"There is a large family of you?"</p>
<p>Tamsin replied, under constraint, "Yes."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" Ilere again he
touched her bruises with a delicate hand. He
assumed that she meant to do something in the
world.</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-091" n="91"/>

<p>"I don't know," said Tamsin slowly and gropingly.
They still looked straight at each other.
She added," Something for Tillie,--my little sister."</p>
<p>"You love Tillie?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tamsin. But the change in her
face made him pore over it.</p>
<p>"Don't you love your father and all your
family?"</p>
<p>Her face became opaque again, just as cloud
grows dense over a breaking through of light.
"No: I hate 'em," she said deliberately, as if
having made up her mind to this confidence.</p>
<p>He appeared to weigh the statement. "I have
no family," he said wistfully. "If I had a father,
I think I could love him."</p>
<p>"Yes," assented Tamsin, "because he wouldn't
be good-for-nothing."  She rose up suddenly,
startled by the loss of her self-control and life-long
reticence. The calico and scissors fell from her
lap. "What makes me talk this way to <hi rend="i">you</hi>?" she
said under her breath.</p>
<p>"Sit down," said Craque-o'-Doom. His eyes
were lambent; his face worked. Tamsin sat down,
and reached to gather her materials again. He
sprang and picked them up for her. "How like a
frog I move!" he muttered, looking up at the
woman's perplexing face, and, turning, he walked
across the room, then came back and stood before
her. "Did you ever see anything more ridiculous


<pb id="VAB9590-092" n="92"/>

than the figure I cut?" he asked. The girl did not
reply. She looked at him. He put his hand out
and seized hers with a grip: " There! Does your
flesh creep, child?"</p>
<p>She certainly recoiled, with that glow under the
skin which was her habit in blushing. Still, the
recoil was not of a quality which expressed utter
aversion. He locked his nervous fingers about
the hand. "I am going to do so strange a thing!
Child, you are miserable; I can do so much for
you. Give me this hand,-marry me! I can see
great possibilities in you. You shall have a full
life. Why need you live like a slave, when I can
open such advantages to you?" He dropped her
hand: there was the sound of running feet coming
down the front stairway. Tamsin moved quickly
toward the dining-room door. "If you can consent
to what I have asked," said Craque-o'-Doom
distinctly but guardedly, as she turned her cheek
over her shoulder, taking one more frightened
glance at him, "reach out your hand toward me."</p>
<p>She disappeared through the door. The supple
red hand lingered on the knob, was thrust suddenly
toward him, and withdrawn just as one of
the young ladies came into the parlor.</p>

<head rend="center sc">THEIR PLANS.</head>
                    
<p>R<hi rend="sc">HODA</hi> J<hi rend="sc">ONES</hi> was the first of the household to
draw with appreciation toward the hearth-flame as
dusk set in. Neal had remembered the fire which
Tamsin had deserted; it glowed up to the chimney,
and its glimmering cheered Captain Tom
when he rode by to the stables.</p>
<p>When he entered the room, Rhoda was basking
there,--alone, as she supposed; but while Tom
was turning himself and putting a boot-heel on
the fender, Craque-o'-Doom let himself down from
a sofa at the other end of the parlor and approached them.</p>
<p>"I didn't know anybody was about," said Rhoda
with a start. "It's so dusky back there!"</p>
<p>"And I start out of the dusk like a spider out of
a web and sling myself off on an invisible thread."
He leaned against the mantel, opposite Captain
Mills, who immediately felt gigantic, and said so.</p>
<p>"I feel myself turn into a sort of Gulliver when
he is by," said Rhoda. "It seems as if he were
the proper size, and all the rest of us monstrous
growths."</p>
<p>"You are very kind people," said Craque-o'-Doom:


<pb id="VAB9590-094" n="94"/>
                    
"I'm sure you do your best to consider
me human." He laughed. " But I am about to
tell you something which will shake your faith in
me as a model pigmy." He braced himself against
the mantel and looked up at Tom, as if dreading
that veteran's hard sense and practical force.</p>
<p>"If I am <hi rend="i">de trop</hi>--"said Rhoda, half rising.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom motioned her back into her
seat: "Not at all, Miss Jones. I really think I
want the support of your presence.--Tom, when
we were roughing it up in Canada, did you ever
think I was soft-headed?"</p>
<p>"Why, no! What do you mean by 'soft-
headed'?"</p>
<p>"I mean liable to turn fool. I've expected to
have a lonesome life of it, and prepared myself.
I give you my word of honor, I never thought of
marrying till I came here. Richard isn't the shape
to attract, and, in face of this truth, I never have
done any woman the dishonor to think that my
money might buy her; but not two hours ago I
asked a woman to marry me."</p>
<p>"The dickens you did!" exclaimed Captain
Mills, aghast. " Well, that was better than slumping
along a dirty canal-bank in the rain. What
did she say?"</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom folded his arms: "She didn't
refuse.--Miss Jones, I want you to tell me candidly
if I am taking unfair advantage of that girl."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-095" n="95"/>

<p>"What girl?" interposed Tom. "You're taking
unfair advantage of me. I don't get hold of the
thing at all. You say you've proposed seriously
to marry somebody?"</p>
<p>"She has a struggle before her for the bare
means of life," continued the dwarf, still addressing
Rhoda, and keeping a check on himself
"Every circumstance is against her. I could give
her education, travel, refining surroundings. I
feel certain she could be developed into a remarkable
woman."</p>
<p>"So do I," coincided Rhoda.--"It's Tamsin,"
she said, nodding her head toward Captain Mills.
He put his hands in his pockets and walked
across the room whistling.</p>
<p>"Now, do you think it would be an unnatural
and horrible thing to--to--I've been puzzling.
Perhaps I took an unfair advantage of the lonely
child. She touches me so," pleaded the dwarf.
"Miss Jones, I can't tell how she moves me. She
is a mere unformed child: I have thought I might
educate her and leave her free. But that wouldn't
do,--that wouldn't do. Besides--" He paused,
and broke out with a half-fierce exclamation: "I
<hi rend="i">want</hi> her! Do you see me? She has no horror
of my shape. Isn't it wonderful there should be a
woman who can look at me without shuddering?
Come back, Tom: I'm not going to be sentimental
any further than this." Captain Mills approached


<pb id="VAB9590-096" n="96"/>

the fire with his face awry. "So, you see, I'm
afraid my selfishness is going to take undue advantage
of her. But now tell me honestly, both of
you: if I make her my wife only in name, and
give her the opportunities she ought to have, and
when she is a woman let her choose-- A great
many things might happen,--my death, you know,
--in case she elected not to--" He looked down
at his hands, as though he held his ravelled sentences
hopelessly there.</p>
<p>"Craque-o'-Doom," said Tom, resting one palm
on the wall above the mantel, like a man bracing
the established order of things, "I'm afraid you're
going to make a confounded fool of yourself.--
Excuse me, Miss Rhoda.--Now, what under the
heavens can you want of that girl?"</p>
<p>"Captain Mills," put in Rhoda decidedly, "I
think the whole thing's splendid. I never should
have thought of it; but it's like a fairy-story for
Tamsin."</p>
<p>"For Tamsin? Oh, yes! But see here, now.
Here's a man, he has money, education, and
talents enough to balance his deformity, and he's
going to pick up one of our Chenoworths! Why,
Craque-o'-Doom, they're low: they couldn't appreciate
the barest idea of yours, and they'd all
prey on you like rats. I don't say but the girl's a
good girl--"</p>
<p>"She is," pronounced the dwarf, frowning.</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-097" n="97"/>

<p>"But she's not your equal, and never will be."</p>
<p>"You don't know that," said Rhoda.</p>
<p>"Pshaw!" growled the captain. "Why, I'm
thunderstruck! Marry, man, if you want to, of
course: you don't have to ask my advice; but I
do hate to see you stoop down to the gutter. Oh,
yes, she'd take you: I don't doubt it for a minute.
Why shouldn't she ? But after you'd mismatched
yourself, what then?  Good Lord, boy! you
ought to see the whole tribe of Chenoworths!
A pretty connection they will be. Because you
are unfortunate in one single particular, there's no
use in throwing yourself away entirely."</p>
<p>"Tom, I don't expect you to see the thing as I
do, and a man of my sort must necessarily suffer
more crosses than anybody else." The dwarf's
nostrils flared, and the clear white of his face became
more apparent. "I simply beg of you to
forbear with me. I cannot explain to you how I
am impelled to this thing, nor how I regard this
young lady, with all her drawbacks."</p>
<p>"This young <hi rend="i">lady</hi>." Rhoda patted her palms
together.</p>
<p>Tom stooped over the hearth and offered his
hand to his friend. They exchanged a hearty
grasp. " You must pardon me, Craque-o'-Doom.
I don't mean to offend you: I was sort of taken
back. They say folks always will meddle with
other folks' marriages. I won't say another word."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-098" n="98"/>

<p>"But what are your plans?" inquired Rhoda
with energetic interest.</p>
<p>The dwarf replied to her inquiry with a puzzled
face: "I haven't any. Must I make plans?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. I am going to be married, and I
have lots of plans. Are you going to take charge
of the child soon, or let her be as she is awhile?"</p>
<p>"Soon, I should think, if she is willing."</p>
<p>Tom groaned. Both looked up at him. "I
didn't say anything," said he.</p>
<p>"You didn't make half so much fuss over my
prospective taking off," said Rhoda, shaking her
head at him.</p>
<p>"The whole thing is so new to me," pleaded the
dwarf. "I don't know what i-s best for her. I
never had much experience with women."</p>
<p>"You'll have to ask her father, you know,"
mentioned Captain Mills, pulling down the ends
of his moustache.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Craque-o'-Doom with childlike
simplicity. But his eyes still turned to Rhoda
for counsel. "If that odd preliminary which you
call getting married were over," he continued, "I
think I should like to put her to some good schoo'
of your choosing,--right away."</p>
<p>Miss Jones inwardly ejaculated over the weakness
and helplessness which men are constantly
revealing between the joints of their noble armor.
Craque-o'-Doom had impressed her as a condensed


<pb id="VAB9590-099" n="99"/>
                    
man of fine quality: he ought to come out a bold
cavalier under circumstances which belittled his
brethren. " Well, but that 'odd preliminary' requires
consideration. You have to prepare for
it; you have to set a day, and get the legal
papers and a minister; the friends of the contracting
parties must be consulted,--unless you steal
your bride away, as the Romans despoiled the
Sabines."</p>
<p>The dwarf pressed his handkerchief to his forehead:
"I wouldn't do that, of course. I should
want to take her honorably and deliberately into
my care."</p>
<p>"Now you're talking sense," exclaimed the captain.
"Give yourself time; deliberate over it.
Tamsin's not much more than a child, as you say.
Six months from now, if you insist on making a
match of it, will do well enough."</p>
<p>"But meantime she ought to be improving herself."</p>
<p>"Oh, she won't do any worse than she's been
doing."</p>
<p>"You would counsel me to let her lose six
months of her best time?"</p>
<p>"I'm not saying anything, mind. Why, man,
you act as if she were a suddenly discovered gem
whom nobody could properly set but yourself!"</p>
<p>"You never thought of setting her or bringing
out her brilliancy, did you?"</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-100" n="100"/>

<p>"No, I never did: the Chenoworths are too
many for me. If I began that sort of thing, I'd
never get to the end of it."</p>
<p>"What you have to do," exclaimed Rhoda with
a slight tinge of impatience, "is to consult Tamsin
and see what she wishes."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom folded and unfolded his arms
and braced himself more firmly against the mantel:
"Miss Jones, you are very kind, and you know a
young girl better than I do. Perhaps, after all, I
have presumed in taking a mere motion of hers
for a consent which I very much desired. If <hi rend="i">you</hi>
would see her--"</p>
<p>"Tamsin never has much to say for herself,"
corroborated Tom in a relieved tone.--" If you
had a downright talk with her, Miss Rhoda--"
"I'd try to make her appreciate the position,"
said Rhoda.</p>
<p>A tinkle at the farther end of the room, followed
by the mild outblooming of a wax light, another
and another, called their attention to Tamsin lighting
the three-branched candlestick on a table.
Aunt Sally had sent her down by way of the front
stairway to supply Neal's place while he went on
an errand. The group remained silent while she
wheeled the table forward. She then carried a
taper to the candlestick at each end of the mantel.</p>
<p>Both men looked at her as she stood on the rug
extending her arm.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-101" n="101"/>

<p>"We were just talking about you, Tamsin,"
said Captain Mills. "You'd better leave the lighting
up to somebody else: these two want to say
something to you."</p>
<p>"Now, if that isn't just like a man!" thought
Rhoda. "He puts things in a jumble and expects
somebody else to get them out."</p>
<p>Having touched the candles, Tamsin threw her
burnt taper into the grate. She stood with her
eyes down, visibly quivering.</p>
<p>"Sit down," said Miss Jones, drawing her to a
convenient chair. " Don't be alarmed by this solemn
fuss: it's in the masculine nature to be pompous
and cumbersome.   Captain Mills merely
wanted to congratulate you. Mr. Sutton has been
telling us, you see. I congratulate you with all
my heart: I think it's wonderful and delightful.
You're quite the heroine of a fairy-story. While
I consider fairies things of the imagination, and
sentiment quite out of place in this present world,
there's some sentiment or witchery in this which
I appreciate." While Rhoda rattled ahead, the
younger girl was gazing at her with piteous appeal,
as if in a torment she could not express, and the
dwarf in some pliant and bewildered mood strange
to his experience, waiting to be placed or guided.
--" Captain Mills, you haven't taken Tamsin by
the hand and congratulated her formally, however
you may have done with Mr. Sutton."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-102" n="102"/>
                    
<p>The captain took Tamsin's motionless hand and
congratulaIted her, with helpless grooves in his
cheeks. She made no response.</p>
<p>"And now," said Rhoda, seizing her wrist in a
confidential way, " Mr. Sutton says he will see
your family at once."</p>
<p>Tamsin winced. Rhoda felt it, and patted her
hand caressingly.</p>
<p>"If you wish it," said Craque-o'-Doom, gazing
on her averted face, "if you wzish to-to come into
my care. If you do not, my child, I will think
nothing of the little sign you were so kind as to
give me. It would be my desire to take you away
with me immediately and place you where you
could be educated under the oversight of a lady
like Miss Jones. But if you would rather take six
months to think about it, I will leave at once and
wait. Or I will go and never come back again, if
vou say so.</p>
<p>Tamsin sat like a stone figure.</p>
<p>"Well, Tamsin?" said Captain Mills interrogatively.
He felt strained and annoyed.</p>
<p>It was a surprise to see Tamsin turn toward
him. She looked up his length and dwelt on his
face; then she looked at her wooer. He was
turning whiter every moment. "I could go now,"
she said "But there's Tillie."</p>
<p>"You can have her with you," said Craque-o'-
Doom.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-103" n="103"/>
                    
<p>Rhoda noticed a tremor pass through the wrist
she held.</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>"I thank <hi rend="i">you</hi>," said the dwarf. He shaded his
face with his hand. "You can have your sister
with you in everything," he continued, "and give
her whatever you wish."</p>
<p>"Thank you," whispered Tamsin, again.</p>
<p>"You see, I don't want to make you unhappy
in any way," explained Craque-o'-Doom.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked into the fire.</p>
<p>"Now, Tamsin--" said Aunt Sally, entering
from the dining-room.--" Why, here you all are
around the fire.--Tamsin?" She put on her glasses
and looked at then with a puzzled face.</p>
<p>"We're going to part with Tamsin, aunt," said
Tom, wheeling slowly. "My friend here proposes
to marry her and send her to school."</p>
<p>Aunt Sally stared at every one in turn: "Who?
--Mr. Sutton? Going to marry Tamsin?" The
unnaturalness of such a match rendered her speechless.
She said no more, but went to the table, and,
taking up Andrew Jackson Davis, began to turn
the leaves with an air of intense preoccupation
and interest.</p>
<p>The clock ticked very loud. But Rhoda kept
on patting and stroking that poor hand which was
being given away under general disapproval.</p>

<head rend="center sc">TILLIE.</head>
                    
<p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> was the very next forenoon that old Mr.
Chenoworth was surprised by a call from the
dwarf. He was hammering at a chair-bottom.
The naked floor showed a stain or two of grease,
trodden into it by careless feet around the breakfast-
table; his wife sat mending variegated trousers;
Sarah Jane, with her sickly baby on her hip,
trailed disconsolately about at some domestic task;
ridges of dry mud stood on the rough boards; a
sobbing stick of wood on the rusty fire-irons sent
out puffs of smoke at the old man, as if to further
cure his dry, shrivelled skin.</p>
<p>Tillie leaned against the unpainted strip which
served as window-sill, in one of her rare quiet
moods. Her eyes looked deep, and her lips
moved occasionally as she told some story to herself
or repeated odd scraps and words which the
outside world suggested to her. "I see a horse
and buggy comin'," droned Tillie. "It's Tamsin,
comin' to take me to a picnic 'way up in the clouds.
We'll wear dresses that hang out behind us ever
so, like them girls up at Mills's. We'll have turkey

<pb id="VAB9590-105" n="105"/>
                    
and cake and ice-cream. Here's the carriage.
Stop, carriage, and let me git in.--It <hi rend="i">is</hi> a-stoppin'!"
concluded the child in astonishment.--" Daddy,
the's somebody come."</p>
<p>"It's just Arter," said Sarah Jane: "I saw him
crossin' the common."</p>
<p>"'Tain't, either. Oh, my! let me git under the
bed!--It's that little bit of a man, mammy! He's
comin' into our house!"</p>
<p>Out of the mud-splashed coupe Craque-o'-
Doom descended to the gate, and made his way
with difficulty on chips and bits of board to the
door-step.</p>
<p>"You open the door, Sary Jane," said Mrs.
Chenoworth when his rap was heard.--"Come
out from behind my cheer, Tillie. Nobody ain't
goin' to hurt you. How simple you are!"</p>
<p>The old man suspended his chair-mending as
Sarah Jane opened the door and stood with her
baby on her hip. The dwarf lifted his hat: "Is
Mr. Chenoworth at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes; he's here. Will you come in?" He
came in, and Tillie disappeared behind her mother.</p>
<p>To a suitor of his organization, the place was
most trying. These untutored people looked at
him as if he had been a strange, harmless reptile.
Sarah Jane's baby began to cry, and she felt warranted
to assure it audibly, " Hush, you little cross-
patch! 'Twon't hurt ye!"</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-106" n="106"/>

<p>Tom had offered to come with his friend, but
Craque-o'-Doom spared him.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Chenoworth?" said the dwarf, addressing
the old man. "Yes, I remember your face:
I saw you passing along the road a few days ago."</p>
<p>The chair-maker dropped his under jaw and
peered round-eyed through his spectacles. To
hear of a dwarf is one thing; to see him striding
on span-long legs before you is another.</p>
<p>"Set a cheer, Sary Jane," said Mrs. Chenoworth
in a doubtful tone; but their visitor scaled it
dexterously.</p>
<p>"It's very muddy weather," volunteered Sarah
Jane in addition. She wanted people to know she
had been away from Barnet and knew how to act
in company, if she was unfortunate.</p>
<p>"Yes, the road is bad," said Craque-o'-Doom.
He saw the smoke-grimed walls, the dull, poverty-
tried faces. Tillie peeped cautiously around the
legs of her mother's chair, and he saw her.</p>
<p>"That's my baby," said Mrs. Chenoworth, with
a diffident cough and toothless smile. "She's
afeard."</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid of me, Tillie," begged Craque-
o'-Doom with a thread of pain in his voice. But
Tillie quite disappeared and stuffed herself under
the chair-seat. His actually knowing her name
was so uncanny! "Come out and talk to me.
I've brought you a message from Tamsin."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-107" n="107"/>
                    
<p>Tillie ruminated before she looked cautiously at
him again. He sat quite still and harmless; his
legs hung down a very little distance, but his face,
though it wore an anxious look, rather won on
her favor.</p>
<p>"Tillie," said Sarah Jane, "if you don't come
out o' there, I'll pull ye out, or git Arter to.
Folks 'll think you ain't learnt no manners."</p>
<p>The hulking cousin had just entered through
the back door. He was a domestic loafer, who
preferred a kindred fireside to the down-town
store-counters. After a prolonged gaze at Craque-
o'-Doom, he took a seat by the chimney, and sat
evidently congratulating himself on being there
for the occasion.</p>
<p>"What word did she send?" inquired Tillie,
popping her head wearily around the chair.
"She would like to have you come and take
hold of my hand."</p>
<p>"I can't do that, ary time."</p>
<p>"You mustn't mind what she says," observed
Mrs. Chenoworth, with an apologetic glimmer on
her face. "We've humored Tillie so much she's
spilet."</p>
<p>Mr. Chenoworth had been wondering what this
visit meant. He now made a motion as if he intended
to resume his chair-mending, but checked
himself and hospitably requested Arter to give that
'ere stick of wood a kick and make it burn better.

<pb id="VAB9590-108" n="108"/>

Arter kicked it with a boot very much out of repair,
and upset one of the andirons, righted it with his
calloused hand, and jumped at the burn, grinning
around on the other inmates as he rubbed and
nursed his hand on his knee.</p>
<p>How cloddish and unsavory poor Tamsin's
people were! They seemed to have neither the
instinctive method of brutes nor the reasoning fore-
thought of man.</p>
<p>"I came to speak to you about your daughter
Tamsin, Mr. Chenoworth," said the dwarf.</p>
<p>The old man made a grimace by twisting up one
side of his cheek, which he scratched with dirty
nails. "What's <hi rend="i">she</hi> been doin'?" he inquired disconsolately.</p>
<p>"Nothing,--except making friends who esteem
her." Craque-o'-Doom's refined face put on an appealing
expression. He felt more distressed and
at a greater disadvantage than ever before in his
life. "I want to marry her and take her away
with me, if you consent to it."</p>
<p>Mr. Chenoworth bent forward, puckering his
tufted gray brows. He gave a half-humorous
chuckle: "Sho, now! <hi rend="i">You</hi> don't want to git
<hi rend="i">morried?</hi> What do <hi rend="i">you</hi> want to git morried for?"</p>
<p>"I am wealthy," the dwarf continued, his steel-
gray eyes glowing with white heat: "I can give
her every luxury and advantage, with the only
drawback that you see,--a deformed husband. She

<pb id="VAB9590-109" n="109"/>
                    
has signified her willingness to take me, but of
course I want the sanction of her parents."</p>
<p>For the first time in his existence, Craque-o'-
Doom felt the arrogant power of money. "I am
wealthy" swept over his listeners like a wave which
returned to him bearing a full freight of deference.</p>
<p>"Tamsin's a good girl," murmured Mrs. Chenoworth.</p>
<p>"She is, madam. And I will do everything in
my power to make such a woman of her as you
will be proud of."</p>
<p>Sarah Jane's face puckered with a spasm of envy.
She shook the whimpering baby. Arter, with
the mouth and eyes of a fish, sat devouring this
astounding scene.</p>
<p>"How much might you be worth, Mister---?"
inquired the old man, affecting a cautious tone.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," said Craque-o'-Doom,
taking a card-case from an inner pocket. "Here
is my name and address: in my confusion at first
I forgot to introduce myself. You can make inquiries
about me of Captain Mills, one of your most
reliable neighbors."</p>
<p>"Yes," replied the old man, nervously doubling
the pasteboard with his fingers, while his mind
staggered beneath this new weight of courtesy, "I
knowed who you was, and that you b'longed up
at the Hill-house. The boys they seed you; Tillie
she seed you, too. I s'pose it's all right."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-110" n="110"/>

<p>"As to the question you asked," continued
Craque-o'-Doom, "I have property amounting to
several hundred thousand dollars, and I have a
good head for managing it."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chenoworth had dropped her sewing and
leaned her head to one side. The old man gave a
gasp and swallowed: "Sho! Did you make all
that in the show-business?"</p>
<p>"I never was in any show-business. I inherited
it from my father."</p>
<p>Mr. Chenoworth stared in a trance of astonishment
that so much wealth should be not only
within hearing distance, but on the border of his
family.</p>
<p>"Well, what is your answer?" said the dwarf,
anxious to bring this conference to a close.</p>
<p>"Oh, I s'pose it's all right.--Ain't it, mammy?"
responded the old man with an affected indifference
not to be found outside of the poor-white type.</p>
<p>"I hain't no objections," said Mrs. Chenoworth
in a quavering, deferential tone. "The children
gener'ly does as they want to."</p>
<p>"Thanks! Then I may marry your daughter
from your house? I prefer, on all accounts, to
take her directly from her own home." All eyes
roamed about the place and came back to Craque-
o'-Doom. Queer as his figure was, he looked so
daintily foreign to such surroundings that an embarrassed
silence followed. "I think it only

<pb id="VAB9590-111" n="111"/>
                    
proper," he added, "that her own parents and
home should give her to me."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chenoworth was touched, and wiped one
eye with the back of her finger: " You and her
can git married here if you want to. But you're
used to so much better things than poor folks
has!"</p>
<p>"That will make no difference whatever."
Craque-o'-Doom  moved to descend from his
chair, when Tillie advanced and stood within a
few feet of him. She had gradually crept out of
her concealment and stretched her thin neck after
every item of the conversation. He waited, and
smiled kindly into her pale-blue eyes: "Will you
shake hands with me when I am your brother?"</p>
<p>"You ain't a-goin' to be my brother," resisted
Tillie. "You're too little."  She puckered her
face and drew a sob.</p>
<p>"Tut-tut !" said the old father sharply.</p>
<p>"But you may go with Tamsin, and she will
give you everything in the world you want. Look
at me, Tillie: am I so frightful to you?"</p>
<p>"You don't look as bad as ye did at first. But
I don't want you to git married to Tamsin. Her
and me is such friends! She could marry her
sister." The Chenoworth idea of intermarriage
appeared to have no limit in Tillie's view.</p>
<p>"But wouldn't you like to have Tamsin go to
school and learn everything?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-112" n="112"/>

<p>"To play music?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And to dance like them girls up there?"</p>
<p>"Yes. And grow so beautiful and know so
much that you would be proud of her?" He
drew his pictures for the child with a wistful,
patient tenderness to which she insensibly re-
sponded, and which touched the others in diffcrc'nt
ways. Arter sulked forward with forearms on his
knees; poor Sarah Jane settled into piteous longing;
the father and mother listened in dazed and
stolid silence. " Wouldn't you like to see her in
pretty dresses riding behind fine horses, or in her
own house, which is very much prettier than Captain
Mills's?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I wouldn't mind that," relented Tillie.
"But I don't want her to git married."</p>
<p>"And wouldn't you like to go with her to the
sea-side, and have a little bathing-suit, and take
baths, and watch all the great people from the
cities in gorgeous dresses, and have a pony and
carriage of your own-a wee pony so little you
could climb on him from the ground?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I wouldn't mind that," admitted Tillie,
with a deep breath. "But she won't like me any
more."</p>
<p>"She will love you more dearly than ever; she
will have more time to be with you. You may go
with her through her school course; and whenever

<pb id="VAB9590-113" n="113"/>

I send Tamsin a gift there will be one for her
little sister with it."</p>
<p>"He's a rich man," said the old father, nodding
to Tillie with emphasis.</p>
<p>The child kindled with anticipations: "And
will you git mammy a new coffee-pot? The old
one leaks all over the stove."</p>
<p>"Sh!" hissed Sarah Jane, while the mother
wiped her eyes and laughed weakly.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Craque-o'-Doom. "Ask her
to accept this as a present from Tamsin." He took
from his breast-pocket a large sealed envelope, in
which, before starting, he had placed a pile of
bank-bills with a confused desire to do something
for Tamsin's relatives and a fear that he could not
do it delicately.</p>
<p>Tillie approached a step nearer and took hold
of the envelope: "What's this here?"</p>
<p>"Something which Tamsin sends your mother."</p>
<p>Tillie felt of it.</p>
<p>"Give it over to me," said old Mr. Chenoworth,
extending his hand. The child obeyed him. His
tone and his greedy motion repelled the dwarf.
Craque-o'-Doom descended from his chair with
his hat in his hand. He did not want to see the
old man pry into the envelope. A sudden shudder
ran through him. They were all so indifferent; it
was like barter and sale.  "Tamsin will return
home," he said; "I will send her down in my

<pb id="VAB9590-114" n="114"/>

vehicle. I would like to have the--the ceremony
take place two days from this time. She can make
any arrangements she pleases."</p>
<p>"I s'pose it's all right," repeated Mr. Chenoworth
monotonously, rubbing and gripping the
envelope. He was embarrassed, but quite unconscious
of behaving in a singular manner. The
deformed man magnetized and overpowered him.</p>
<p>"She ought to be thankful the longest day she
lives for such a chance!" burst from Sarah Jane's
fountain of general injuries. " But Tamsin never
will: she's too big-feelin'!"</p>
<p>The dwarf had already reached the door. He
bowed himself out, apparently not hearing this
remark. Tillie followed.</p>
<p>"I don't call it much of a chance," growled
Arter, lifting himself after the door closed,--"her
gittin' married to a little bit of a critter all shut up
together like that."</p>
<p>"She wouldn't have you, Arter, nohow," said
the old man with a hard-featured smile as he ran
his forefinger under the flap of the envelope.</p>
<p>"How much is it, daddy ?" inquired Sarah Jane.
She brought the baby and stood by him. Arter
looked on with dogged interest; the mother left
her mending and approached. They counted the
rustling notes.</p>
<p>"As much as three hundred dollars!" said Sarah
Jane. "Tam can have everything heart can wish.

<pb id="VAB9590-115" n="115"/>

an' me a-slavin' around, and this cross young-one
--Shut up, or I'll slap ye good!"</p>
<p>"'Tisn't the poor baby's fault that it's here,
Sary Jane," remonstrated her mother with plaintive
resentment.</p>
<p>"I don't care," said Sarah Jane, crying; "it's
somebody's fault that I have things so hard and
Tam has 'em so easy!"</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom had just leaned back in his
carriage, conscious that heads were staring from all
the little houses around, feeling an odd sickness
at heart, and convinced that Tamsin Chenoworth
could scarcely fall into poorer hands than those
from which he was taking her, when a voice called
to him. He looked out of the coupe-window and
saw Tillie sitting on the gate-post. The driver
started. "Wait a minute," said Craque-o'-Doom.</p>
<p>"I said I'd thought it over," repeated Tillie,
"and I don't want none o' them things. I just
want Tamsin. I think more o' her ner anything
else. Ye can't have her."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom  laughed, feeling his breath
come more freely. Hle threw a kiss at the tallow-
colored child as his vehicle started.</p>
<p>"Ph!" blew Tillie, dabbing her hand at him in
a resentful fashion. " You quit throwin' your old
kisses at me: I won't have 'em. Tamsin's <hi rend="i">my</hi>
sister; she ain't yours. And you can't git her
for kisses, neither: so you stop your old self."</p>

<head rend="center sc">THE ODD PRELIMINARY.</head>
                    
<p>P<hi rend="sc">ERHAPS</hi> there never was a more wretched day
than the one appointed for solemnizing the tie
which Craque-o'-Doom had called "that odd preliminary.
"Mud and sky seemed longing to meet,
and a driving rain did its best to create such a
union. Smoke and draggling cloud could not be
distinguished. Farmers coming to the village on
loaded wagons were obliged to turn out of the
impassable roads and open ways through sodden
fields. The Hill-house party, having prolonged
their stay from a sympathetic curiosity in the
dwarf's wedding, were to be carried with him to
the railroad-station that day,--a nearly impossible
journey had not the railroad intersected the
pike.</p>
<p>Of course Tamsin's preparations were small.</p>
<p>"If you will be so kind," said Craque-o'-Doom
to Rhoda, "as to take her in charge and buy her
a full outfit when we reach the city, I shall be
under further obligations."</p>
<p>"Don't feel distressed about any obligations,"
urged Miss Jones: "there's nothing I delight in

<pb id="VAB9590-117" n="117"/>

more than spending money. I never had much
of my own to spend, and I take a savage joy in
getting hold of other people's and disbursing it.
I know just what Tamsin wants,--she wants pretty
nearly everything, poor child!--and you may rely
on me to choose it for her."</p>
<p>Jennie and Louise convened in Rhoda's room,
and were anxious to do something for the bride.</p>
<p>"I never heard of such a match," declared Jennie;
"but of course it's a great thing for her. Aunt
Sally says her sisters turned out badly: I hope
nothing'll happen to disappoint the poor girl. Do
you suppose she likes him?"</p>
<p>Louise shook her head very positively: "He
isn't bad-looking in the face, but oh, my, Jen! just
think of walking into church with a man whose
head wouldn't reach the top of the pews, and
everybody staring at you! Would any amount
of money make you do it? He can't dance.
She'll have to pay some attention to him. If I had
to sit at home alone with him and look at him a
whole evening, I should go out of my senses."</p>
<p>"So should I. But Cousin Tom is so mad
about it! He seems to think Mr. Craque-o'-
Doom, or whatever his name is, could marry a
princess if he wanted to. I wonder if he'll get
her diamonds? Oh, wouldn't she be in luck if
he'd die and leave her a rich widow while she's at
school! It must be splendid to be a young widow

<pb id="VAB9590-118" n="118"/>

with lots of money! Widows are so much more
independent than girls."</p>
<p>"Well, there's nothing sentimental in that," remarked
Rhoda: "still, I don't quite approve of it.
But you needn't go to overhauling your wardrobes.
We're not to sew for Tamsin or bestow anything
upon her: she's to wear a long cloak over her red-
and-black dress, a felt hat, and some gloves. They're
my things; and I have to take them back when she
gets her outfit."</p>
<p>"Won't she make a funny-looking bride?"
mused Jennie.</p>
<p>"Poor child! She's going into the care of a
good guardian, rather than getting married. I
don't think of her as a bride, but as an adopted
orphan starting to boarding-school."</p>
<p>"It's funny to watch Aunt Sally since this business
came on the carpet," laughed Jennie: "she's
so puzzled, and so kind. She doesn't know how
to treat Tamsin, and she looks at that little man
as if he were a frog going to lap in a fly and she
ought to drive him off."</p>
<p>Tamsin had gone home the day before her wedding.
About dusk Craque-o'-Doom drove to her
father's gate, but before he could alight she came
running out wrapped in her old faded shawl.
"Don't come in," she said at the carriage-door,
without assigning any reason for the request. Her
eyelids looked dark and swollen</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-119" n="119"/>

<p>"Get in the carriage, then," said he. "You
must not stand with the rain drizzling on you."</p>
<p>"I can't," said Tamsin; "I must go straight
back."</p>
<p>With some authority he turned down the step
and drew her to a seat. She leaned back opposite
him. "I merely came to see if there was anything
else for me to attend to," said Craque-o'-Doom. "Is
there?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Tatnsin. Her throat
swelled, and the exclamation seemed to burst
from it: "Tillie can't go!"</p>
<p>"Can't go with you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"They won't let her. They say she mustn't
leave home." She hid her face under a corner
of her shawl.</p>
<p>The dwarf's hands trembled; but he locked
them together: "Poor child! that is a bitter disappointment
to you."</p>
<p>"I've never been away from Tillie."</p>
<p>He meditated in deep disquiet: "But they will
let her come to you often?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"At any rate, you can come to see her as much
as you wish." Aft6r an instant he added, "Will
this make any difference about <hi rend="i">your</hi> going, my
child ? It is not too late to draw back yet; a

<pb id="VAB9590-120" n="120"/>

young girl may change her mind at the last minute
in such an important step. Speak out."</p>
<p>Tamsin put down her shawl. "No, it won't
make any difference," she said.</p>
<p>The dwarf gripped his hands together.</p>
<p>She descended the step to go into the house, he
helping her. The old shawl caught on a projection,
and while he was loosening it he broke a bit
of the fringe off: this he clutched under his nails
into his palm. "I shall come for you at ten in the
morning," said he.</p>
<p>At ten on that dark, ugly wedding-day, therefore,
the coupé stood at Chenoworth's gate, and
Tom and Rhoda dismounted with Craque-o'-
Doom. The neighborhood was agog.</p>
<p>Within, the preacher then stationed with Barnet
Methodist Church waited the bridegroom's party.
The room had been cleaned; a pleasant odor of
coffee came from the kitchen. Sarah Jane conducted
the party into the single other apartment to
lay off their wrappings on a bed where her baby
was asleep. Tamsin sat here, away from the fire,
holding Tillie on her lap. The child's face was
hid in Tamsin's neck. When Craque-o'-Doom
approached them the little one looked up and
kicked backward viciously at him.</p>
<p>Captain Mills made an uneasy attempt to be
pleasant with old Mr. Chenoworth, who had shaved
and looked more cured about the skin than ever.

<pb id="VAB9590-121" n="121"/>
                    
in spite of some bleeding cuts. The mother had
a clean white cloth folded kerchief-wise about
her shoulders; Mary and her half-dozen squalid
children were there, sitting in a sallow row, all
alike excepting in size; Arter peeped in from the
kitchen, scowling at everything he saw. The domicile
had taken on a very perceptible air of importance:
everybody in the street knew that Tamsin
was marrying a man rolling in wealth. Some
neighbors reprehended the match: they would not
on any account see their daughters tied to such a
sight as that dwarf. Others hoped Tamsin might
never come to grief for jumping at money that
way: Mary and Sarah Jane had both had their
come-downs: Tamsin wasn't the first Chenoworth
that left the family to do better and had to come
back to it.</p>
<p>There was a gang of her kindred in the kitchen,
collected to eat at the wedding-feast, but not on
any account would they show themselves to the
fine people, though their noses and eyes lined the
door-crack to get a glimpse of the dwarf.</p>
<p>"They're waitin' on ye, Tamsin," said Mrs.
Chenoworth, looking into the bedroom.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom stood at a front window, but
on hearing this he approached. The girl put her
sister down. Tillie turned her face to the wall,
and refused to look.</p>
<p>The two went into the general room, where the

<pb id="VAB9590-122" n="122"/>

minister stood, and Tom and Rhoda were nervously
trying to converse, while Mary jerked her
sharp, haggard face at her whispering offspring
and motioned the yellow cousin she had married
back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Tom turned his face away from the pair when
they were seated side by side: this unusual position
was an accident. Tamsin sank into a chair,
and Craque-o'-Doom took his place near her.
When the ceremony was finished, Rhoda intervened
between the bride and a rather pompous
parade of congratulations from her friends. Coffee
and some other refreshments came in, served in a
glaring new set of stone-ware china, interspersed
among which was a cracked plate or two of the
old stock.</p>
<p>Then Tamsin had her wraps on. She was not
troubled with luggage. She shook hands with all
her people, the women kissing her and Mrs.
Chenoworth wiping her own eyes with a plaintive
gesture. None of them approached Craque-o'-
Doom. Tillie made a plunge, and was held to the
poor bride's breast until her wailings were somewhat
quieted. She took refuge with her mother,
and the party drove away.</p>
<p>Tom Mills had insisted on giving them a second
breakfast at his house, but there was only time to
reach the station in good season for the train.
Jennic and Louise, who were waiting at home, saw

<pb id="VAB9590-123" n="123"/>

the carriage wallow out of the by-road and turn
east on the turnpike, and, somewhat disappointed,
hastened their own preparations for departure.
Neal drove the Mills carriage on the sweep, and
they embraced Aunt Sally in farewell. The old
lady looked sadly through her glasses at such a
wedding-day, but she did not neglect, at the last
moment, to tuck two or three <hi rend="i">Banners of Light</hi>
into the girls' lunch-basket.</p>
<p>Both carriages arrived at the station in a pour
from the trailing skies. There was no awkward
waiting about, for the train came just as the party
got their tickets and checks ready.</p>
<p>Tom stood on the platform under an umbrella
after he had helped the girls embark and taken
charge of Craque-o'-Doom's horse and carriage,
which the driver was to bring with him in a car
chartered for that purpose, attached to a train
which followed this one.</p>
<p>They were all seated in the parlor-car. The
dwarf waved his hand as he glided past, and Tom
stood looking after him, saying aloud, "Poor,
poor, poor fellow!"</p>
                    
</div2>

<p>I<hi rend="i">T</hi> was ten o'clock on the next night but one
when Rhoda Jones led her charge to their joint
sleeping-room in a hotel. They had been travelling
a day and a night. Louise Latta and Jennie
Mills left the party at a certain junction to take
their own road homeward, which was very short.
They escaped the all-night smothering in poorly-
ventilated berths, though they breathed a couple
of sighs in losing sight of Rhoda and Tamsin and
the dwarf and the parlor-car.</p>
<p>Tamsin paused in front of the open fire,--a very
special apartment had been prepared for them,--
but Rhoda moved briskly around, taking off her
wraps and opening her travelling-bags. She got
out two dressing-sacks covered with little tabs of
ribbon and lace, and, having made herself as cosey
as possible, took the silent girl in hand. "You're
fearfully tired," said Rhoda.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked dazed.</p>
<p>"Now shake yourself a little, and come here to
this wash-stand and get a few of the cinders out of
your ears, and put on this sack. You don't know

<pb id="VAB9590-125" n="125"/>

how it will freshen you up. The private supper
Mr. Sutton ordered will be served in our parlor
pretty soon."</p>
<p>"I ain't hungry," murmured Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Aren't you?  I am,--ferociously."  Rhoda
was unwrapping and doing her up in the dressing-
sack while she talked. It was a cream-colored
fabric, and instantly improved on the effect produced
by the poor bride's scarlet waist.</p>
<p>"Tamsin," said Miss Jones positively, "you're
going to make a striking woman. I never saw
any one change with clothes as you do. Oh,
shan't we have you looking delightful! You can
have things a little bit nicer than most school-
girls, on account of your position, and in a little
while you will learn to demand this or that as your
irreversible right. How adaptable human beings
are! Does this roar and tumult confuse you?"</p>
<p>"I think it does, some."</p>
<p>"Well, you'll get over that, and love a city as
much as I do."</p>
<p>"I think I should like it."</p>
<p>"Certainly. We'll take a carriage and shop for
dear life for you all this week."</p>
<p>The private supper was served up very soon.
Craque-o'-Doom was so good a traveller that his
short bridal trip had produced little effect on him.
He was merry with Rhoda. Tamsin sat straight
and frightened in her chair, picking up bits of

<pb id="VAB9590-126" n="126"/>

strange sumptuous food as if she could not hazard
swallowing. The dwarf watched her with quick
sweeping looks.</p>
<p>"She is very tired," said Rhoda. "All this experience
is so strange to her."</p>
<p>"You must both sleep late in the morning," he
replied. " My man will arrive with the carriage
some time to-night: he had a telegram ready for
me here. The carriage will be at your disposal
as soon as you want it."</p>
<p>"Oh," exclaimed Miss Jones in ecstasy, "I aum
more than compensated for having to be content
with a slim outfit when <hi rend="i">I</hi> get married.--Tamsin,
the next time you do your spring shopping you
will snub my memory, for I am going to be such
a despot!"</p>
<p>The dwarf bade them good-night when they
rose to go back to their room. lie got down
from his chair and bowed to Rhoda. Then he
took Tamsin's hand and kissed it. She stood like
a statue. Rhoda saw the wistful, dog-like loyalty
of his eyes as he lifted them to the slim-figured
girl, but she did not observe any tremor run
through that figure. "Is there anything--" he
inquired, hesitating to finish the sentence. "Are
you feeling well, my child?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," replied the low voice.</p>
<p>"Tell me what it is," he persisted.</p>
<p>Rhoda withdrew and closed the door after her.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-127" n="127"/>

<p>The dwarf drew his wife toward a chair. She
sat down trembling, with one hand locked tight
over the other. Her eyes were fixed on the floor;
a full tear slid from each and coursed over her
face.</p>
<p>"My little one," said the man, with the anguish
of a mother in his voice, " are you wretched? Oh,
I cannot bear that! I will go out of the hotel to
some other place. You regret it, don't you?" He
spoke this with a downward affirmative accent.</p>
<p>"No," said Tamsin, hurriedly. She managed
to raise her swimming eyes and encounter his.
"It's Tillie."</p>
<p>With a cautious and delicate gesture he took up
her right hand and began to smooth and pat it:
"Are you afraid she is ill ? You want your sister,
poor child!"</p>
<p>"It's strange being so far from Tillie," she murmured,
making her muscles tense in her efforts to
regain composure.</p>
<p>"If I could bring her to you this instant you
should have her. Don't hate me for making you
so lonely, will you?"</p>
<p>Tamsin looked down at the light-expanded face.
Then her eyes sought the floor, and the flush
under her skin appeared for an instant. She became
quiet, and Craque-o'-Doom scarcely noticed
that she made no reply to his appeal. "I'll send
a telegram to Captain Mills," he proposed, "before

<pb id="VAB9590-128" n="128"/>

I go to bed, and early to-morrow you can
have news direct from Tillie. You go to bed and
sleep soundly. Trust me to look after your happi-
ness a little."</p>
<p>He led her to her room-door, and put her inside
with another "good-night." It was she who was
protected and led, though she towered above him so.</p>
<p>Rhoda had already sat down to toast her slippers:
she motioned Tamsin to draw to the hearth.
Tamsin sat down. So wide was the gap between
her present and past life that it did not seem
strange to be sitting on terms of perfect equality
with a woman who but a short time ago had
seemed so far above her.</p>
<p>"That man is a gentleman, if there ever was one
on this earth!" exclaimed  Rhoda. "Tamsin,
you're the luckiest girl I ever saw; and the world
has been perused by me considerably, my dear. I
know it has hard, hideous, inhuman aspects which
no amount of philosophy can gloss over. It very
seldom turns out that Fortune is so kind to those
thrown completely on her mercy. Mr. Sutton
knows more than you or I can ever grasp; yet see
how modest he is. I do hope you'll make him
happy."</p>
<p>Tamsin sat with her hands locked.</p>
<p>"Of course your first duty is to make the very
most and best of your school advantages; which
I know you'll do. And I want to give you a hint.

<pb id="VAB9590-129" n="129"/>

You're so very quiet there'll be plenty of girls who
will try to run over you: don't you allow it first
or last. Assert yourself. With so many blessings,
all you have to do is to hold your own. But at
the same time, Tamsin, if you would try to make
yourself popular, you know,--friendly among the
girls,--you'll get along much better, and it will be
pleasanter for you than if you are too reserved.
Well, I didn't intend to give you a lecture. The
position of duenna seems naturally to fit me."
Rhoda laughed and, shifted her feet. "When <hi rend="i">I</hi>
started to boarding-school I was a skinny, shabby
orphan; my dresses were calico or cheap delaine;
these abundant locks were shingled close to my
skull. I must have looked like a resolute death's-
head or a knowledge-smitten scarecrow. I taught
some of the primary fry and let it go on my own
tuition: this contributed to age me. When spring
and commencement fever came, my agony was
dreadful. Ah! the poor little short stories I wrote
at dead of night by a smoky lamp while my roommate
snored, the heart-beats with which I sent
them off in hopes of raising cash for a cheap
spring outfit, the despair with which I received
half or two-thirds of them back and saw my outfit
dwindle to a pair of shoes and a hat!" Rhoda
unloosened her hair and pulled it down around
her half exultantly. "Slowly, slowly I had to
conquer all these things. Even youth and passable

<pb id="VAB9590-130" n="130"/>

good looks never came to me until I was more
than twenty-five. Who was there except myself
to have a vital interest in my success or failure?
Nobody. That skinny waif might have died and
only a few kind strangers would have moistened
her with a tear. I think it has made me very practical:
I used to be no end of sentimental. But my
Will has grown so it has to be spelled with a capital
W, and I have a confidence in myself which
must seem dreadful to you. The world is all before
me now. At an age when most women
are buried in family cares I shall go sailing into
broader life a princess; the way will expand,--expand,
--expand. But you, Tamsin,--see how much
happier is your lot. In the dawn of your girlhood,
just as you have begun to feel the edge of circumstance
and necessity, here comes a kind and pow-
erful guardian, who will lift you over everything
which hurt and hardened me, who will be sunshine
and rain, earth and air, to bring you into blossom;
and he asks nothing but the privilege of taking
care of you."</p>
<p>Tamsin got up and walked across the room.
Rhoda turned to look after her: "Am I worry
ing you, my dear? We must go to bed."</p>
<p>"I heard you talking," said Tarnsin, wheeling
and coming back, "the first evening at Mills's."
She stretched her arms straight down before her
with the fingers locked. Her face had an unusual

<pb id="VAB9590-131" n="131"/>
                    
pallor which seemed the culmination of a paleness
of several days' growth.</p>
<p>"The first evening?" repeated Rhoda, puzzled.
"What was I saying?  Some nonsense to the
girls, probably."</p>
<p>"It was to them,--about getting married."</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Rhoda, with a sensation like a sting,
though that puzzled her also. "Did I say anything
which stayed in your mind afterward, Tamsin?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, it wasn't very silly, whatever it was. I
will uphold my own tenets."</p>
<p>"I thought at first--" pursued Tamsin, hesitating.
Then she took another tack: "It was about
money."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; I remember. Where were you?"</p>
<p>"In the other room. And I sort of made up
my mind. But afterward--"She broke off there,
as if there were no open communication between
herself and Rhoda or what she had begun to say
would not bear telling.</p>
<p>"Well, what afterward? Upon my word! is
that you sobbing?" Rhoda sprang up and ran to
her as she turned her back. "Tamsin, this will
never do. You must get into bed this moment.
Poor girl! you are worn out with excitement and
travel. In the morning it will be very different
with you."</p>

<head rend="center sc">"ARE YOU HAPPIER NOW?"</head>
                    
<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the morning it <hi rend="i">was</hi> very different with her.
The wondrous advantages of her position began to
unfold themselves to Tamsin. In the first place,
with the very late breakfast came in a telegram
from Captain Mills, stating that Tillie was evidently
in better health than usual: she was at the
Hill-house, while Tom telegraphed, showing with
satisfaction a fine large doll Tamsin had left to
console her.</p>
<p>"Why, I didn't leave her any doll!" murmured
Tamsin to Rhoda. She was beaming with a new
sense of power and conquest over time and space.
"Don't you see <hi rend="i">he</hi> did it?" exclaimed Rhoda
between her sips of coffee. "He got the biggest
wax baby Barnet afforded, and had me send it to
your mother in your name. I do adore consideration
in little things: it's much likelier to produce
happiness than this everlasting silly cooing, 'Do
you love me better than anybody else?' Give me
the man who will look after my comfort and heart's
ease. Instead of talking vapor, people about to
marry ought to attend to substance, and ask sensibly,

<pb id="VAB9590-133" n="133"/>

'Are you certain you can always support me
in comfort?' and, 'Do you require as much society
as I do?'--'What are your views about a wife's
regular allowance?'--'Is your temper surly or
quick?'--'What do you like to eat?' and, 'How
many poor relations have you that will expect
assistance?' A fair understanding on all such
points will give the firmest of foundations for
mutual good will."</p>
<p>Tamsin heard with a slight tinge under the skin,
and Rhoda ceased suddenly, reflecting that the
clause about poor relations was rather ill-timed.
She was surprised that she did not get on to
greater intimacy with Tamsin. Docile as the girl
appeared, she was insulated behind a barrier which
Rhoda could not pierce.</p>
<p>When they dressed for their shopping-tour,
Tamsin seemed passively grateful for the little extra
touches Rhoda bestowed upon her, but her reticence
never quite disappeared. Before the day
was over, however, an unusual exhilaration grew
in her.</p>
<p>"Now, this is New York," said Rhoda, as their
coupe turned away from the hotel. "Isn't it immense?
The roar and glory always raise me to
the seventh heaven. You'll have to find it all
out by degrees. As you're to go to school and
have your future home in and about the city, I
shan't waste my breath describing things to you

<pb id="VAB9590-134" n="134"/>

that you'll soon know as well as I do. At present
our interests lie in the direction of shopping;
and we can get anything under the sun in New
York, and have I dare not say how many hundred
dollars in this pocket to do it with. Oh,
shan't we be bowed to and worshipped to-day?
Won't the clerks run out with bundles to our
carriage and hold the door open?--the very
wretches who have lorded it over me when I
meekly purchased of them a few scant yards of
cashmere."</p>
<p>As Rhoda had to buy material for her own outfit
as well as Tamsin's, the task occupied them full
a week. I)uring this time, at the dwart's urgent
request, Miss Jones stayed at the hotel as one of
his party, to be Taminsin's companion, instead of
returning to her boarding-house. Tamsin was
gloved, booted, slippered; women were constantly
bringing her things to try on ; she was driving out
to be fitted; and presently, as if by magic, she
found herself in a dull bronze suit of silk so rich
and soft the mere touch of it delighted her, with
nothing to relieve the shade in hat, gloves, or wrap
except a bunch of red roses close by her neck.
She saw herself in one of the many mirrors with
which the hotel increased and reflected its magnificence.
Her black eyes scintillated in a face
which was slowly to lose the dulness of its pallor
and grow transparent. Hot baths, abundant food,

<pb id="VAB9590-135" n="135"/>

and exhilaration were changing her, and she recognized
it when she saw herself dressed.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom drove with the girls, after the
first fury of their shopping was over, and showed
Tamsin wonders which she had never dreamed of
in her previous life. Sometimes her mind reeled
dizzily,--had she ever been that miserable girl in
Barnet?--and again, in the midst of a keen delight,
a pang struck through her breast that she
should enjoy so much while Tillie lived like a clod.
She saw one play: this was a few evenings before
she entered school and began the serious business
of improvement. It was the dwarf's good fortune
to be able to present first to her imagination Neilson's
matchless Juliet. They took a box. Craque-
o'-Doom had never been able to meet the gaze of
a large assembly of people in the body of the theatre.
He sat behind the two girls, smiling to himself
at Tamsin's quiet excitement. She had already
a well-bred air. Rhoda had initiated her into some
style of hair-dressing which made her head a
pretty study. She looked back occasionally at
Craque-o'-Doom, parting her lips with a smile at
once timid and grateful.</p>
<p>"Are you a little happier now?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Tamsin. She turned immedi-
ately to watch the great curtain which h still shut
away from her an unknown world. The house
was crowded; the gas-lights wcre multiplied by

<pb id="VAB9590-136" n="136"/>

mirrors and prisms; the perfume from her own
drapery filled her with dreamy delight. How
many beautiful and grand people there were in the
world! Rhoda saw acquaintances to whom she
bowed. A little bell rang; the orchestra, almost
at her feet, startled her with a blare of music.
What it was, and why they played it, she did not
know, but it stormed her heart: she trembled with
positive rapture. Then the great curtain began to
rise. She watched that miracle until voices recalled
her eyes, and, behold! on the stage there
were two women,--a lady and her servant,--
dressed in some queer fashion which made both
stately. And in a short time there came running
in one of the loveliest women this earth has ever
borne, whose crimson mouth seemed strangely
made of ripples or scallops. The people made
thunder with their hands, for this was Neilson.
Tamsin now seemed to live in the body of this
fair woman. She loved with her, despaired with
her, hung over the morning balcony after her departing
husband with her, and died and was laid in
the Capulets' tomb. She did not know it was over,
and believed there must be a better ending, when
Craque-o'-Doom was reaching to fold her wraps
around her. She turned her swimming eyes to his.</p>
<p>"My dear!" he whispered. The crowd in the
theatre was surging out, and one or two lights
were shut off. " We will read the play together

<pb id="VAB9590-137" n="137"/>
                    
some time," he added more quietly. "Has it
made you feel unhappy?"</p>
<p>No," said Tamsin, "not that. I'm glad I saw
it." She was not excited to chatter as they drove
back to the hotel; she did not say it was splendid
or perfectly gorgeous: Tamsin always had more
thoughts than words.</p>
<p>Rhoda was heartily enthusiastic over the Juliet,
but she had a great many absurd things to say
about Capulet's ball and the red-and-green ladies
who danced the minuet in back ranks: "The poor
wretches always get themselves up in segments
of glaring colors; at the very best they look like
figures heaped out of strawberry, pistache, and
lemon ice-creams. Their trains don't train right;
and how insolent the star's perfection seems, throwing
their poor defects into such prominence! A
real poor stock actress or actor must have the saddest
life on earth,--I mean one without any talent
for rising. Imagine that tawdry flock going off
the stage into the wings: they pick up their sorry
trains; no maid waits for them; that thunder of
applause is for the star. The public must seem a
many-headed monster; and the wind is so cold in
the wings, the tackle and pulleys overhead so
ghastly!"</p>
<p>"But, on the other hand, look at the triumph
of such a Juliet," said Craque-o'-Doom: "she <hi rend="i">is</hi>
the actual moist flame that Shakespeare presents


<pb id="VAB9590-138" n="138"/>

to our imagination. We do not want to see her
in any other shape."</p>
<p>"That's just it: her one triumph is the defeat
of a thousand others. And the world doesn't care
a straw for people who fail or make a sorry fight
of it, in any place. Come to that, we're all downright
savages at heart: whoever can get ahead of
us becomes our idol and chief; whoever happens
to fall underfoot we do not scruple to tramp on.
If he doesn't like it, he hasn't any business to
stay there."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, you are not as fierce as your
philosophy, Miss Rhoda."</p>
<p>"It isn't my philosophy; it's my observation.
facts are facts."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked out of the window as their carriage
moved between two rows of gigantic buildings.
She was in a luxurious position : what
Rhoda Jones said sounded like a painful truth
which she had known in some former world.</p>

<p>During all this time that Tamsin was being prepared
for school, the school was being selected
and prepared for her. To the lady-principal Tamsin's
position and characteristics were explained.
It was considered best by all parties that she
should enter school as Tamsin Sutton, a young
girl under the care of a guardian, since she was
nothing more, and it was neither necessary nor

<pb id="VAB9590-139" n="139"/>

advisable to explain her true relation to Mr. Sutton
to a couple of hundred young ladies from all parts
of the country. Tamsin herself was not likely to
make confidences.</p>
<p>"Unless she falls desperately in love with some
class-mate," said Rhoda to Craque-o'-Doom, "her
reserve will be pierced by nobody. I think she
likes me very much; still, she has never poured
any confidences into my ear."</p>
<p>The dwarf paled a very little: "But there is no
danger of that sort of thing. The pupils are all
young ladies."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, that's what I mean, of course. Girls
sometimes have desperate sentiments for each
other, and bill and coo, and die of jealousy, and
go through all the nonsense. I fell in love with
the gymnastic teacher when I was at boarding-
school. She was the homeliest and leanest French-
woman you ever saw, and, as I was very miserable
anyhow, I contrived to howl myself into quite a
frenzy whenever I fell the least under her displeasure.
It's in many young girls to take such
morbid fancies; and there's really no great harm
about it. It's only their modest, roundabout way
of worshipping man; they are reprehended for
thinking about him while at school, so they adore
his reflected and refined image."</p>
<p>"I don't think I should like it in this child's
case," said Craque-o'-Doom.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-140" n="140"/>

<p>"She mayn't be of the doting sort at all. Sometimes
I think she is a person who will have only
one or two strong affections in her life. But she's
so young yet: you can't tell what she will be."</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> day before Tamsin entered school, Craque-
o'-Doom drove her out in the afternoon with no
companion besides himself. He sat opposite to
her in the coupe, glancing over her figure occasionally.
She was his study. His expressive
eyes brightened or gloomed when he fixed them
on her. Wherever he was seated now, the Persian
drapery trailed from his lap: once he had seen
her look at his feet.</p>
<p>Tamsin did not know where they were going.
Each day of her life was now a new pleasure.
She was about to enjoy something, and leaned
back in quiet anticipation.</p>
<p>"Would you like to pick up a few little things
for Tillie?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"For Tillie?" Radiance appeared to stream
from her face and fall across his eyes. "I wrote

<pb id="VAB9590-141" n="141"/>
                    
her a letter," she continued in a tremulous, eager
way which was so confiding that the dwarf's heart
swelled within him; "I told her how I was getting
along. She would like it so much."</p>
<p>"I wish she could be with you. But the next
best thing is to send her something.--Here!"
Craque-o'-Doom signalled to his man to stop.--
"I believe this is a place where you can get madeup
knick-knacks for little girls. Are you afraid to
go in alone and buy?" He took a porte-monnaie
from his breast-pocket and transferred it to her
hand.</p>
<p>No; Tamsin had grown bold during her shopping
experience. She had been treated obse-
quiously: what was there to be afraid of? Craque-
o'-Doom waited for her in the carriage. She
appreciated silently his kindness in letting her
shop unassisted for Tillie. She knew what to
buy. Presently the packages came pouring out,
large and small, round and square. In due time
came Tamsin herself, in a still, white transport
of joy.</p>
<p>"Have you got everything you want here?" inquired
Craque-o'-Doom.</p>
<p>"Yes." As they drove on she looked up at him
and broke the paper at the corner of one package.
"It's a blue wool sack: it ties with a ribbon under
her chin. I used to want one for her: she takes
cold so easy."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-142" n="142"/>

<p>Craque-o'-Doom admired the sack, and she went
on unfolding every purchase, until the merchandise
was piled all around them. There were dresses
of various kinds, undergarments, hosiery, handkerchiefs,
and even collarettes.</p>
<p>"Tillie would look nice," she continued, in an
eager maternal tone, "if she was dressed like the
little girls at the hotel."</p>
<p>"Of course she would," said Craque-o'-Doom.
"She looks nice anyhow."</p>
<p>Tamsin threw her eyes up at him with an absolute
sparkling; her lips trembled. "You are good
to me," she said in a sort of explosive burst.</p>
<p>"Am I good to you? I want to be,--God
knows I do! Tamsin, will you promise me one
thing? Always tell me what is in your mind.
Don't keep any secret from me, will you, my
child?"</p>
<p>She started, the color appearing under her skin,
but it died away, and she replied steadily, "No,
sir; I will tell you everything."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom drew a long free breath. IHe
looked over the confusion of dry-goods and paper.
"People may think we are peddling," said he;
"but no matter. Now, don't you want shoes, and
gloves, and millinery, and such things ? And then
a fancy toy or two ?"</p>
<p>"I told her once," pursued Tamsin in a confidential
strain which made his heart yearn over her, as

<pb id="VAB9590-143" n="143"/>

she smiled and refolded the blue sack, " that when
I got rich I'd give her fine shoes and everything
that heart could wish ; but I never thought then--
And a 'cordion! I told her I'd get her a 'cordion."</p>
<p>The dwarf leaned against his cushion as if suddenly
tired. Still, not one whit of interest departed
from his smile. "She must have them," he
said. "But we shall have to take a much longer
drive to find the accordion. We can have a box
packed and started by express to Tillie this very
evening."</p>
<p>Again the carriage was stopped, and again Tamsin
ran across the sidewalk to make purchases.
There was a girlish alertness and spring in her
gait which Craque-o'-Doom did not fail to mark,
yet he put one hand over his eyes and crouched
back as if he were hurt. "'I told her when I got
rich,'" he repeated. "What's going to become of
me if she doesn't grow to like me? I expect too
much."</p>
<p>Tamsin came out, followed by some delightful
shoes. There was a high-laced pair for every day,
and kid button boots for Sunday; also some soft
slippers,-" for when she don't feel like going outdoors,"
said Tamsin,-and substantial rubber boots:
"I never saw such things before; but the man said
they would keep her from all damp, and she <hi rend="i">will</hi>
run out in wet weather."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-144" n="144"/>

<p>"Would you like to get something for your
mother and father?" inquired the dwarf. "While
we are about it, we can pick up something for
them."</p>
<p>Tamsin considered; her face grew heated. She
cast a piteous look at him, and said, as if constrained
to speak so by her promise of confiding
everything to him, " Maybe we better, or they
might take Tillie's things from her."</p>
<p>"They wouldn't do that?"</p>
<p>Tamsin turned her head impressively from side
to side. " But you've give me so much," she
said.</p>
<p>"Very little, my dear. And, come to think of
it, there is something I have neglected to give you,
and which we must drive to Tiffany's for this very
afternoon. Miss Rhoda says a school-girl should
not have a great deal of jewelry; but you were
married without a ring, and I have not given you
one yet."</p>
<p>He alighted from the carriage when they reached
the gorgeous shop, and made his way with Tamsin
between passers-by. When people turned to
stare at him and direct each other's attention as to
a rare spider or a painted savage who could not
understand their language, he looked at Tamsin
with a quick, jealous sweep of the eye: the effect
on her was not discernible.</p>
<p>She stood beside Craque-o'-Doom when he was

<pb id="VAB9590-145" n="145"/>

mounted upon a chair, and pored over the array
of precious stones spread before them with a sen-
suous delight which he keenly noted: for the first
time in her life the diamond threw its glamour over
her eyes. She took her glove off, and he put a
blazing stone on her finger; the red hand which
recently was fit only for plunging into any rough
use already showed a fairer surface.</p>
<p>They drove home about dusk. Tamsin was in a
gale of delighted excitement. She could not eat
her dinner until all her purchases were fondled
over again, the accordion especially commended
to Rhoda's notice, and the whole boxed and
started on the road to Tillie.</p>
<p>"I never saw Tamsin in such rapture," said
Rhoda.</p>
<p>"She does seem happy," said Craque-o'-Doom.
He was sitting in a large chair, leaning his head
upon his hand. His eyes were of a paler gray
than usual, and looked bleached like ashes.</p>
<p>"Now you be careful of that magnificent solitaire,"
impressed Rhoda, shaking a finger at Tamsin.
"Two or three dozen girls will want to try
it on or wear it a little while, or borrow it to
receive a call in. I never lost any solitaires while
I was at school, but I can foresee the danger of
it. It's something remarkable for a girl of your
age to possess."</p>
<p>Tamsin held one hand in the other and looked

<pb id="VAB9590-146" n="146"/>
                    
at it; her glance then moved to the turquoise on
Rhoda's finger. Little as she knew of precious
stones, the difference was apparent to her. Her
face filled with a triumph which was really arrogant.
"A little while ago," she said, punctuating
her sentences with the pauses peculiar to herself,
"I hadn't but one old dress."</p>
<p>"Don't!" exclaimed the dwarf, turning his head
aside.</p>
<p>Tamsin started. She turned her eyes upon him
with a glance which Rhoda saw, but he did not.</p>

<p>W<hi rend="i">HEN</hi> Tamsin disappeared within the walls of
her boarding-school, Rhoda went over to Brook-
lyn, and was so busy that she called only once or
twice before her marriage. The first time she
called, Tamsin looked depressed and tired. On
the next occasion, however, she was found in good
spirits, eagerly interested in her studies. She had
been promoted in her classes: she was learning
music and French. "Isn't it strange the French
people talk that all the time?" said Tamsin.
" Mademoiselle got very mad at me because I
thought it was funny they had the Testament
printed in French." She was girlish and communicative.
A shell comb was tipped in her hair
behind one ear, giving her a coquettish look. The
airs and blandishments of admiring school-mates
had evidently been added to her own manner.</p>
<p>"Your position is perfectly pleasant and easy,
isn't it?" demanded Miss Jones, twining a lock of
hair on the girl's forehead with matronly touch.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! I am beginning algebra, and I can't
get it straight yet. Everything is nice: I feel like
I had always been here."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-148" n="148"/>

<p>"You are improving, I can see. How often
does Mr. Sutton come?"</p>
<p>"Twice a week, regular."</p>
<p>"Regularly," amended Rhoda.</p>
<p>"Regularly," accepted Tamsin without change
or shade. "And then other times he takes me
to ride. We go all through the Park on nice
days."</p>
<p>"Oh, you lucky girl, to have such life drop into
your hands, when I had to slave for so many
toughening years before my deliverer appeared!
But, Tamsin, we expect to sail next week."
"Do you? And are you going to have a big
wedding?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, the ceremony will be very
quietly performed at the house of a distant relative
of mine in Buffalo. Mr. Burns lives in Buffalo; he
has only time to run up for me before the day set,
or I would let you see him. I sent an invitation
to Mr. Sutton, but he declined, for you and himself
both: he didn't think it best to take you out
of school."</p>
<p>Tamsin had looked half frightened. With a reassured
countenance she said, "I  don't want to
see strange people yet."</p>
<p>Rhoda laughed: "I don't know what ordeal
could be more trying than the strange people of a
boarding-school. But you are used to the girls
now."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-149" n="149"/>

<p>"Yes, now I am. At first-" she paused--"at
first they whispered about me."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing. Did you snub a few of
them, as I recommended?"</p>
<p>"I said something," asserted Tamsin. She examined
Rhoda as if in doubt whether to lay the
communication at her mercy or not.</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>"There were some girls," ventured Tamsin,
"that always watched out of the windows when
he came to take me riding, and they would cough
and laugh."</p>
<p>"Green with envy," said Rhoda.</p>
<p>"And when he came to call they would go
through the reception-room with their music-
books, when they didn't practise there at all."
"I know the breed," remarked Rhoda.</p>
<p>"They put <hi rend="i">pictures</hi> in my books,--pictures
without-- Pictures that hadn't any legs."</p>
<p>Rhoda curled her lip.</p>
<p>"They couldn't find out if he was any relation:
so one day before chapel services they sat just
back of me and sang under their breath,--

<q rend="blockquote">
                    
<lg>
<l>"'Here sits Miss Tamsin Sutton,</l>
<l>Who goes to ride with a button!"</l>
</lg>

</q>

And I just turned around," said Tamsin sonorously,
scowling as in past life she had scowled at Captain
Mills's high-minded negro, "and looked square in

<pb id="VAB9590-150" n="150"/>

their faces. I said, '<hi rend="i">You</hi> are the buttons. He's
tall; he's tall as the hills.'"</p>
<p>Rhoda applauded with her palms. She drew in
a quick breath and looked keenly at Craque-o'-
Doom's champion. The young girl's face was
filled with color, but she adjusted her hair with a
nervous motion and changed the subject. During
the rest of the interview she had an uneasy air, as
if this confidential burst had surprised and disconcerted
herself.</p>
<p>When Rhoda parted from her at the door she
kissed the ripening olive cheek: "This is the first
time I ever kissed you, Tamsin."</p>
<p>"I know it."</p>
<p>"And the last time I bestow a maiden lady's
caress on you: on the next occasion it will be a
matron's. Do you like to be kissed?"</p>
<p>"I used to like to have Tillie."</p>
<p>"Didn't you ever kiss Mr. Sutton?"</p>
<p>The girl colored up to the soft rings of hair
which she was learning to train over her forehead.
Rhoda felt as if she had outraged the delicacy of
a child, and went away provoked with herself.</p>
<p>On the day Rhoda sailed, Craque-o'-Doom took
Tamsin to the wharf to see her off. She told them
a great deal about her wedding in a few minutes,
and introduced Mr. Burns, a portly, cheerful,
rather elderly gentleman, who was easily put out
of breath and planted his hand on his hip to pant.

<pb id="VAB9590-151" n="151"/>
                    
He seemed prepared for Craque-o'-Doom, but
eyed him with covert curiosity. Several friends
accompanied them, and a number of Rhoda's city
acquaintances were there.</p>
<p>The mighty steamship was ready to part from
her moorings; Tamsin sat in her carriage shaken
with admiring awe of it. She got down at the
last minute to run to Rhoda again, where that
animated young lady was divided between her
clinging friends and her hastening spouse. She
gave her hand for another last squeeze to Tamsin.</p>
<p>"I never thanked you," said Tamsin without
preface or explanation. "I thank you now."</p>
<p>Mrs. Burns had this pleasant assurance to carry
with her when she was wiping some moist emotion
from her eyes as they steamed down the bay.</p>
<p>Her husband stood at the rail beside her.
"Come, Rhoda," said he, swelling his chest consolingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I ain't doing anything but enjoying the
luxurious sensation of having friends. There isn't
anything more delightful in this world than parting
with your friends when you start on a long
journey : it brings out all their good points; they
open their hearts more in a brief minute than they
have done before in years, and, no matter how
stupid you may have thought them, their interest
in you endears them to that degree that you are
ready to fall upon their bosoms, but are caught

<pb id="VAB9590-152" n="152"/>

away just in time to preserve the situation,--to
sort of crystallize it, you know."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mr. Burns, smiling applause, as he
always did at her sayings.</p>
<p>"Even little Tamsin expressed herself unusually.
Don't you think she's rather pretty?--the girl
with black eyes and light hair who spoke to me
last."</p>
<p>"Yes. The one you said was married to the
dwarf. Oh, yes! He's a dreadful figure, though."</p>
<p>"But he's wonderful. If I hadn't seen him I
shouldn't believe there was such a person alive.
He seems so knightly and upright: he is as gentle
as a well-bred woman; yet I haven't any doubt
there's tremendous passionate force in him."</p>
<p>"Yes; that's what you told me about him
before. It's a pity he's such an unfortunate
shape."</p>
<p>"Now, see here," said Rhoda, making the wind
an excuse for hooking her forefinger through one
of Mr. Burns's button-holes: "that man, and that
girl he married to educate, have exercised me
a great deal. I keep observing them, and sometimes
I actually believe they are in love with each
other in ways wholly peculiar to themselves."</p>
<p>Mr. Burns humored the idea with a laugh.
"She can't think much of that little dwarf," he
said. "A woman wants a man of good appearance,
--portly physique. Especially a pretty young

<pb id="VAB9590-153" n="153"/>

woman." He looked at Rhoda, and she looked at
him.</p>
<p>"If you are going to talk and look that way,
everybody on board will know we are just mar-
ried. Scowl a little bit, do! I've thought it was
foolish for brides to object to appear as brides, but
it does make one feel silly."</p>
<p>While Navesink was disappearing from their
eyes, the dwarf, who had left Tamsin at her school,
was curled up behind his paper in an alcove of his
hotel. He pulled down his moustache and gnawed
at it. Some men near him, unconscious of his
presence, were talking about him, and he had no
choice but to hear what they said:</p>
<p>"That queer object you saw come into the vestibule
a while ago? Why, that's Sutton, the
dwarf. He has a pile of money. He always
stops here, and he's been in town quite a while.
Seems to have picked up a pretty young girl
somewhere and married her, and he's got her at
school up town, and stays here to hang around
her."</p>
<p>"Dotes on her, does he?"</p>
<p>"I s'pose so."</p>
<p>"She can't dote on him particularly."</p>
<p>"I don't know about that: he's very wealthy."</p>
<p>Both men laughed as they moved away.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom kept pulling down his moustache.
"I am  making a fool of myself," he


<pb id="VAB9590-154" n="154"/>

whispered.  "If I persecute her by 'hanging
around,' she'll grow to despise me.  I'd better
go up river to-morrow and see how things are
getting on at home." Ile decided to take the
afternoon train,--the river was not yet open to
navigation,--but he had time to see Tamsin in
the morning.</p>
<p>She came to the reception-room from a recitation.
The dwarf was huddled on a sofa, his rug
trailing to the floor. He had not slept very well,
but if Tamsin noticed that he was pale she did
not speak of it. After she gave him her hand,
which he kissed, she sat down on a chair some
distance away. Her eyes were sparkling. She
fixed them on the floor, and then said steadily,
"Comment vous portez-vous, monsieur?"</p>
<p>"Eh bien! Good! And are you getting on
to the 'carpenter' and the 'bread' business, and
'the sister-in-law of my brother,' and the rest of
it?"</p>
<p>Tamsin passed over his sarcasm. "I got a
letter from Tillie," she remarked. "That's five.
She makes Mary write them."</p>
<p>"And how is Tillie?"</p>
<p>"She's well. She sent you her very best respects,
too."</p>
<p>"Much obliged."</p>
<p>"She did. And she likes the things so much!
She's written two letters about the things."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-155" n="155"/>
                    
<p>"Never mind the things.  Do you think so
much of things, Tamsin?"</p>
<p>She looked at him and showed a distinct dimple
at one corner of her mouth. She had been learning
to laugh. "Yes, I do love nice things. WVhy
don't you notice my apron? I made it myself.
All of them are getting to wear lace aprons in the
morning. I made it out of some lace Miss Rhoda
bought for me."</p>
<p>"Do you want any pin-money now,--any money
to spend for little necessaries, I mean?"</p>
<p>"I have a great lot yet that you gave me when
I first came here."</p>
<p>"You're not an extravagant child at all. Well,
when you want anything you must write me."</p>
<p>"What for? Can't I tell you when I see you?"</p>
<p>"I am going home, up the North River, this
afternoon, and may not see you again for some
time."</p>
<p>Tamsin twisted meshes in her lace apron. She
had certainly thawed from her former Indian-like
stoicism. "I thought you would live here," she
observed.</p>
<p>"No; I have only stayed to see you well accustomed
to your new life. You are comfortable here,
aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"And you will write to me, and tell me how you
get on, and about your daily life, won't you?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-156" n="156"/>

<p>"I can't write--a real pretty letter."</p>
<p>"Any letter will be pretty to me. How often
shall I write to you?"</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes and dropped them again
shyly: "I don't know."</p>
<p>"My child," with a sting of pain in his tone,
"don't you care to hear from me?"</p>
<p>Tamsin started and turned her face aside.
When she did look at him, it was with reproachful eyes.</p>
<p>"Forgive me!" exclaimed the dwarf. "You
don't know how I hate to leave you."</p>
<p>"What makes you go, then?"</p>
<p>"Because I ought to. Tamsin, come here to
me, will you?"</p>
<p>She rose and walked slowly to his side.</p>
<p>"Will you stoop down where I can look in your
eyes?"</p>
<p>She settled slowly on one knee. Her whole
body was in a tremor. He put out his hand and
tilted her head up.</p>
<p>"Don't look down at the deformed part of me:
look in my face. My little one, how lovely you
are growing! How old are you now?"</p>
<p>"Seventeen next month."</p>
<p>"And I am in my thirties!"</p>
<p>An unaccountable silence fell between them.
He had taken his hand away from her head. He
now put it reverently back, drew her a little nearer,

<pb id="VAB9590-157" n="157"/>

and kissed her forehead. With a strong recoil
Tamsin sprung up and flew from the room.</p>
<p>The dwarf whitened even across his lips: "My
God! And I have grown to love her with all my
strength and life!"</p>
<p>The clock could scarcely have marked three
minutes' interval when Tamsin came back cautiously,
guilty-looking and flushed. But Craque-
o'-Doom had already gone. She could do nothing
but lock her hands and stare at the corner of the
sofa where he had sat.</p>

you just as I came away. I am not very well
accustomed to women: they have always seemed
divine beings literally above my level, except the
excellent Dutchwoman who, with her son, daughter,
and husband, keeps the machinery of my house
going.</p>
<p>You notice I do not call it home, though it is
the dearest spot in the world, and one made by
Nature so picturesque thae it seems new and wonderful
every day in the year. There is no use telling
you about the Highlands: you must see them for
yourself. The whole length of this river is dear to
me. The homestead is a very old place; part of
it is built of stone and dates from the early days of
New Amsterdam, which was the ancient name for
New York. This is an inconvenient part, with
queer windows, and doors that open at the top
while they remain closed at the bottom, because
they are sliced in two across the middle. Additions

<pb id="VAB9590-159" n="159"/>

have been built at various times: my father
built the last. Altogether, they make an irregular,
towered, ivy-eaten, bay-windowed, pillared pile of
house so big I feel lost like a mite in it.</p>
<p>Pretty soon it will be fine enough to boat on the
river. I have always rowed and yachted a great
deal. The "Drew" and "Powell"--two fine
steamers--will begin to make regular trips near
your vacation-time. If you like to come up and
bring some of your chums, the house may seem
more like home. Any changes you would like to
have made in the furniture I will attend to in good
time. Enclosed is a diagram of the principal
rooms, with a short description of their contents.</p>
<p>Don't, however, let me be selfish and rule your
wishes. If you would like to go back to Ohio for
the summer, tell me frankly. But perhaps they
will let Tillie come and spend the summer with
you.</p>

kind to me that I lie awake to think about it.
After you were gone I cried till I was nearly sick.
Of course that was foolish, for you put me here to
improve myself, and I am improving all the time.
You must excuse me for not being able to write a

<pb id="VAB9590-160" n="160"/>

beautiful letter. I practise a great deal writing my
exercises, but my hand trembles when I go to
write to you, and will not let me do my very best.
Some of my letters to Tillie look a good deal
nicer.</p>
<p>One of the girls and I have been reading Tennyson's
"Idyls of the King."  I like Enid best. She
is a Boston girl (the one I am reading with, I
mean), and knows a great deal. She says every
minute of our time ought to be spent in progressing;
but we eat chocolate caramels when it isn't
our turn to read. We are taking a course in the
poets as a rest from study. She says she adores
Schiller (I think that's the way to spell it), and we
are going to read something by a man named
Goaty or Gaiety,--I can't remember which. There
is a great deal to learn. I used to love to read at
Captain Mills's house, but I had no idea how many
books there are in the world.</p>
<p>I got some new gloves for Easter; they are the
color of very pale flag-lilies. The people in Barnet
didn't do anything but color eggs on Easter.
I used to color them with calico rags for Tillie.
This Easter Sunday we went to church, and they
had very beautiful music and flowers. Life seems
very different to me from what it used to.</p>
<p>Your house must be very nice. I don't see how
anything could be nicer. If Tillie could come too,
I should love to see it. This girl that I go with

<pb id="VAB9590-161" n="161"/>

(Sarah Davidge) might like to come too. A good

manners.</p>

did me a world of good. Why should you make
excuses for a graceful hand and an original way
of expressing yourself? I have it in my breast-
pocket, with some English violets from the greenhouse
shut in it. The very first letter you ever
wrote me! It was only too short. I wanted to
hear more of your reading, and your young friend,
the Easter eggs you used to color for Tillie, and
the pale Easter gloves you chose to feel the warmth
of your innocent hands in devotion.</p>
<p>My little one, I hated myself when I read that
you had cried,--" cried till you were nearly sick."
I must have shocked you. I forgot myself,--or
rather I thought only of myself. But let us not
talk of it any more. In time I shall learn how best
to make you understand what your happiness is to
me. I send by express some books from the library

you may like to read. The Keats I read and marked
long ago when I was a lonesome boy, before I knew
you were in the world or would ever come to me.
But I leave it as it was. Perhaps you had better
not share this book with the Boston young lady.</p>
<p>The hills are beginning to put on such an exquisite
green! Your vacation begins the first week
in June; it is now nearly May. There is more than
a month to wait. I have considerable business to
attend to: perhaps it will be necessary for me to
run down to the city by the end of this week. As
I have a regular arrangement with the Hudson
River road in winter and the steamer-men in summer
to ship my carriage with myself every time I
go down, I might call and take you to ride, unless
something interferes.</p>
<p>We have a good boat-house and several skiffs.
I will have them overhauled at once, painted, and
a pair of oars made especially for a lady to handle.</p>
<p>Write to me so I can get your answer by the
day after to-morrow. My business in New York
is very pressing.</p>

P.S.--Do you think that is a funny name? I
gave it to myself when a boy-, because it seemed
appropriate that a little monster should have a
little monstrous name. Would you mind calling

<salute>D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> C<hi rend="sc">RAQUE-O'</hi>-D<hi rend="sc">OOM</hi>,</salute><p>--It is a funny name,
but funny names are the nicest. I meant to write
last evening, but it was reception-night, and of
course I could not be let alone. Sarah Davidge
had some friends coming to see her, and she would
have me go with her. They always dance on
reception-nights, because Madame says we must
learn how to appear in society. I fixed Sarah
Davidge's hair like mine. She is a little near-
sighted, but looks very smart. I like to see people
hang eye-glasses around their necks. We
wore our long black silk trains. Ever so many
girls have wanted to try my ring on, but I never
would let one of them touch it, It always looks

<pb id="VAB9590-164" n="164"/>
                    
beautiful. I love beautiful things so much I have
a <hi rend="i">perfect passion</hi> for them. Sarah's friends were
nice; I danced with her cousin three times. Did
you know I had learned how to waltz? It is so
easy! I am in raptures when I waltz. Madame
would not let me dance any more with Sarah's
cousin: she was very smooth and nice, but gave
me a look, and I had to talk with some old ladies.
I would love to get a chance some time to dance
all I want to. I was crazy to learn: nobody ever
knew how bad I've wanted to dance; and the waltz
is the cream of it all. In Barnet they had balls,
but of course I never saw them. I saw Captain
Mills's cousin and Miss Latta waltz, and it seemed
as if I <hi rend="i">must</hi> know how.</p>
<p>You will think I am very frivolous. It is different
with me from what it used to be, I feel so light
and happy; but I am trying to get on in all my
studies. They seem to think I am smart here. It
is not like Barnet.</p>
<p>I will try to get this letter to you in time.
Please call: we can have such a nice ride. I want
to see you.</p>

<p>Oh, what <hi rend="i">do</hi> you think of me! I supposed I
had mailed this letter, and here it lies among my
writing-paper ! And this afternoon I was out for
the tiniest little bit with Sarah Davidge and the
French teacher, because it was such a lovely day,
and Saturday, and you came and went away while
I was gone. I thought you would send me word
just when you would be here. Why didn't you?
I watched for you all day Friday. Shall I always
be doing things that look ungrateful and mean?
Now you won't have time to come down again for
ever so long, I know. I would like to put something
on the corner of the paper, but you might
think it very silly. Besides, you must be very
mad at me.</p>

<salute>M<hi rend="sc">Y</hi> D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> C<hi rend="sc">HILD</hi>,</salute><p>--Never mind: it was my
fault; I should have telegraphed. No, I do not
think I can come down again immediately: some
time next month, perhaps. Besides making some
spring repairs and improvements on the estate and
keeping various business interests well in hand, I

<pb id="VAB9590-166" n="166"/>

have just been mapping out a course of hard reading
for myself. You see, your industry has had
its effect on me.</p>
<p>But let me beg one thing of you, little one
never again, by word or look or deed, signify that
you feel "gratitude" toward me. It causes me exquisite
torture. Consider my possessions yours
by right,--as they are.</p>
<p>It must indeed be delightful to waltz. I can
understand the feeling you describe: I have it in
my wrists, and my floor is the piano key-board.
Since coming home, I have written a little piece
of music for you: I tried to put in the song of a
bird down in our orchard. The birds are nearly
all here. Enclosed find a rough draft of it. I
have had headache, which may account for my
making a poorer-looking musical score than I
usually pride myself on doing. Have you heard
yet from Mrs. Burns?</p>
<p>Put that something "on the corner of the paper,"
my child. Why should I think anything you do
silly ? Did you not leave your beloved little
sister and come bravely away with me, an almost
entire stranger, submit yourself to my guidance,
and enter a school of other strangers having no
one but me, a queer, perhaps unwholesome, sort
of man, to whom you could appeal for sympathy
and home affection? I am very glad you have
made appreciative friends. Miss Davidge's cousin

<pb id="VAB9590-167" n="167"/>

has my thanks--yes, my warm thanks--for giving
you pleasure. If you would like to include your
new acquaintances in the party for this summer,
do so.</p>
<p>But write me another little letter as soon as you
can. No matter how busy I may be, they are so
welcome.</p>

<salute>D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> T<hi rend="sc">OM</hi>,</salute><p>--With the awful example before me
of many unhappy wretches who have written confidential
letters and afterward had them exposed
to an amused public by death of the confidant or
unforeseen circumstances, I am about to unload
my soul upon you, and get in return the consolation
that you "told me so."</p>
<p>But it's not going to turn out as you told me.
You ought to see her now, Tom: there isn't her
match in the world. You would hardly believe
two or three months could make such a difference.
She's all sorts of ways,--bewitching, grave, childish,
womanly. It is delightful torture to watch
her unfold. But she will never care for me. I
went down to the city a few days ago to see her


<pb id="VAB9590-168" n="168"/>

--the errand was purely a pilgrimage to her,--and
she was out. They told me in what direction she
had gone, and I made my man drive miles on the
chance of catching one glimpse of her face. You
don't know anything about it, Tom.</p>
<p>And of course the young fellows will admire
her. I think she regards me as if I were her
father. God knows, no father ever carried a baby
in his heart as I carry her.</p>
<p>I've been trying to study hard and master this
fever. Nothing of the sort ever happened to me
before. I never gave rein to it. And I didn't consider
the danger of giving way to this.</p>
<p>Tom, I'm going to send her out to Barnet for
the summer. I had intended to bring her home
with a lot of young friends to amuse her; but I
cannot stand it. My heart's pretty nearly starved;
I should make a fool of myself. She's too young
to understand that I want her all to myself. I
didn't know what the effect would be on me; but
if I had known, it would have been just the same.
What I have to do, though, is to act merely as her
kind guardian and keep my own feelings down.
Tom, I want your aunt to take her in as a boarder
while she's in Barnet. I know the favor I ask, but
she can't stop down at that place where her people
live. You don't know how necessary beautiful
surroundings are to her. She is devoted to her
little sister. Do me the favor, Tom, and demand

<pb id="VAB9590-169" n="169"/>

anything of me you please. And, while she is
there, guard her like the apple of your eye. My
God! what should I do if she were to be taken
from me? It will be torment to have her trusted
to a railway-train. But she will get tired of me if
I follow her around. I'm off for another strengthening
summer among the lakes. I've got to be a
man. The principal of the school has strict orders
to telegraph me if she has the slightest indisposition
of any kind. I have one of the maid-servants
down there in my pay to wait on her with
extra pains.</p>
<p>You ought to see the pretty little letters she
writes, Tom. No man ever will see them, but it
might be a pleasure to any one to do so. I believe
I loved her the first minute her black eyes
met mine. It ought to be enough for me if I can
make up to her for the privations she suffered before
I found her.</p>
<p>You were all wrong in your predictions. Whatever
the tribe from which she sprung may be, she
is delicate, sparkling, upright, beauty-loving. In
fibre she is a lady; in mind, a swift-moving, powerful
essence. But what is the use of going on like
this to <hi rend="i">you</hi>?</p>
<p>I hope you won't forget, when that brother of
hers comes out of his confinement, to do as I
asked you to do for him. As he is young, and it
was only <hi rend="i">petit</hi>--misdemeanor, a good start and a

<pb id="VAB9590-170" n="170"/>

little encouragement may bring him up. He certainly
showed enterprise by getting into such a
scrape.</p>
<p>Please present my compliments to Mrs. Teagarden,
and, if you can, ease my bosom with an
early reply.</p>

<salute>D<hi rend="sc">EAR</hi> T<hi rend="sc">OM</hi>,</salute><p>--I want to ask a great favor of you.
Will you receive my wife into your house as a
boarder during the summer? I find I must have
another Canadian bout, and, besides, it does not
seem advisable to bring her home yet; and she
wants to see her little sister. I know it is asking
a great favor of your aunt and yourself: in return
you may demand anything you wish of me. I
shall feel so comfortable and safe about her if I
know she is in the companionship of your excellent
aunt. And it will be impossible for her
to stop with her people; I couldn't allow that.
She is abundantly fulfilling the promise I saw in
her.</p>
<p>By the way, whenever that unfortunate fellow I

<head rend="center sc">RETURN OF A NATIVE.</head>
                    
<p>T<hi rend="sc">AMSIN</hi> came to Barnet early in June. Her trip
was easy and delightful. Craque-o'-Doom himself
saw her put in a palace-car, from which she
did not have to stir until she reached the junction
of the Barnet road with the trunk line on which
she travelled. The railway-people were feed to
make her safety and comfort their particular study.
Craque-o'-Doom had thought seriously of sending
a maid with her; but the difficulty of finding a
suitable person, and the disinclination of Tamsin
herself to appear before her townspeople so attended,
had caused him to give up the idea.</p>
<p>"They'd make fun of me," said Tamsin. "They
all remember how I used to look. And then there
are father's folks--" It was not necessary for
her to explain the incongruity.</p>
<p>"I see," said Craque-o'-Doom. He had delayed
his own trip until she was safely started. Tom
Mills was to meet her at the station and telegraph
her arrival.</p>
<p>She parted from him in the gayest spirits. She
had come away from Barnet in storm and misery,

<pb id="VAB9590-173" n="173"/>

like a prisoner, pitied in a way that galled her
more than her proud nature would ever own; she
was going back like a princess, guarded and
tended, covered with splendor, and having the
prestige of a great reserve power. The sensitive
deformed man told this to himself very minutely.
He added that she was young and rebounding
from the former heavy pressure on her life. And
she was just out of school: there must be something
unwholesome and abnormal in any girl who
would not be merry when just out of school.</p>
<p>Still, her gay nods to him from the open car-
window jarred him. He sat in the carriage some
distance away: he dared not risk boarding the
train or crossing the many tracks. Now he saw
her, and now a thousand objects crowded between.
He wished she had not looked so exhilarated, and
was in torment lest some accident should happen
before she reached even Philadelphia. She started
just before sunset. He thought of the run across
the mountains. When the train was actually gone,
he drove away, his head sunk on his breast and
his face drawn. Oh, to tower up among other
men! "If I had been a big animal and tyrannized
over her a little, maybe she wouldn't have lost
sight of me so gayly. How easy it was to persuade
her to go away instead of coming to Cold
Springs with me! Yet I didn't give her any
choice, either. I wrote that she might go to

<pb id="VAB9590-174" n="174"/>

Barnet, for I felt obliged to take another rough
Northern trip this summer. Miss Rhoda said she
was likely to form but two or three strong attachments
in her life."</p>
<p>He looked at the seat opposite him,--the carriage,
although of the coupe pattern, had been
built to carry four,--and thought of her shopping
for Tillie and her remarks about Sarah Davidge
when driving to the train.</p>
<p>"Are you disappointed at not bringing your
chum to Cold Springs this June?" Craque-o'-
Doom had inquired.</p>
<p>"What chum?" said Tamsin.</p>
<p>"This Miss Davidge you write to me about."
He knew every name her pen had traced.</p>
<p>"No. I don't like her so <hi rend="i">very</hi> well."</p>
<p>"Why, I thought you two were banded for
mutual improvement?"</p>
<p>Tamsin studied the toe of her boot. "Sarah
Davidge is a nice girl," she conceded, "but I don't
like to hear people always talking about belonging
to a good family."</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom smiled under his moustache.</p>
<p>Tamsin, still studying the toe of her boot, continued:
"And it makes me mad to hear any one
say folks out West are all heathens."</p>
<p>"I am to understand, then, that you have had
some slight disagreements with Miss Davidge?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no: we're good enough friends. I like

<pb id="VAB9590-175" n="175"/>
                    
her the best of any of the girls. She can't help
her airs."</p>
<p>It appeared that no strong attachment had been
formed for Miss Davidge.</p>
<p>"But this summer," muttered the lonely dwarf,
"will be a blooming season for her,--an impressionable
May-time. Still, in Barnet she will not
be thrown with anybody likely to attract her, unless
the Millses have extraordinary guests. But
she is by nature a high and mighty aristocrat: I
really think few people could please her. Torn
must make faithful reports to me: I shan't be able
to stand it if he doesn't."</p>
                    
<p>Very different was the expression of Tamsin's
face when she arrived late in the pleasant afternoon
at Barnet station; she was the only passenger for
that place. Captain Mills was on the platform;
at a little distance the Mills carriage waited, and
by the captain's side stood a gawky child craning
her eager neck at all the car-windows.</p>
<p>With a start of delight this child felt herself
seized; she recognized the soft touch before she
could turn and see that a pretty young lady had
descended from the last car instead of from the
baggage-van, which Tillie thought as desirable a
vehicle as any. The object which did come down
from the baggage-van was a huge Saratoga trunk.</p>
<p>Captain Mills touched his hat and took the

<pb id="VAB9590-176" n="176"/>

hand which Tamsin gave him for an instant across
Tillie's shoulder. She gave him barely a glance;
there was such gladness in her face as she rocked
the little sister to and fro in their old way! The
train glided off, and Neal, on his driver's seat, rolled
a white eye at the pair; but Tamsin did not know
it, or that Captain Mills wanted the check for her
baggage.</p>
<p>"My! ain't you some!" exclaimed Tillie when
they had kissed.</p>
<p>"Why, you've grown taller!" said Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Course I have. Daddy says I grow like an
evil weed." Her coral expanse of lips and rows
of little teeth glistened.</p>
<p>"You've been well all the time, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Had a tech of aygur once,--that's all. Oh,
Tam, you do look so pretty!"</p>
<p>"Do I?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you do."</p>
<p>"I didn't think <hi rend="i">you'd</hi> be here to meet me."</p>
<p>"I'd 'a come," said Tillie, "if I'd had to foot it;
but Tom Mills he told me I might git in and ride
with him."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked up toward Captain Mills with an
expression of gratitude, and he took the opportunity
of asking for her check. She groped in her
porte-monnaie for it, and reached it toward him
with one arm while she held Tillie to her with the
other. Ile went into the station. "Are they all

<pb id="VAB9590-177" n="177"/>
                    
well down at father's?" inquired the new-corner
with sudden recollection.</p>
<p>"Toler'ble. You knowed Sarah Jane and
Arter'd got married, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Sarah Jane and Arter!" Tamsin's eyes dilated.
The corners of her mouth drew down with
a scornful spasm. This facial comment.was the
only one she ever made upon this typical Chenoworth
match. Tillie understood, but it was all a
matter of indifference to her. She took no care
about the doings of her relatives, excepting this
sister. "When did they get married?" inquired
Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Well, it was a couple of weeks ago. I thought
I wrote you about it; but I guess Mary took
that letter down to her house and stuck it in
the winder, and I forgot to put it in the post-
office."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked somewhat graver: the scent of
the old atmosphere had come to her nostrils. She
shuddered as if it had been an odor of death.</p>
<p>"Ain't ye glad to git back?" said Tillie.</p>
<p>"I'm glad to have hold of you again, honey.
But I don't like Barnet."</p>
<p>"Them's better places where you've been?"</p>
<p>"Oh, lovely places! You've got on one of the
dresses I sent. And the shoes: let me see your
shoes."</p>
<p>Tillie exhibited her boot and a lank length of

<pb id="VAB9590-178" n="178"/>

ankle: "Yes, these is some of the things. Oh,
but the 'cordion !-that was the nicest!"</p>
<p>"Did you like it?"</p>
<p>"I guess I did! Tam, I can play 'Mary to the
Saviour's Tomb,' and 'Greenville,' and ' Father in
a Promised Land,' and' Pop goes the Weasel,' and
a whole lot o' tunes, on it a'ready." The eager
quiver of the child's body was checked as if by a
galvanic jerk. She looked up at her senior, reminded
of what was proper to the occasion, and
inquired agedly, " How's that man o' yourn, anyhow?"</p>
<p>Tamsin shook with laughter.</p>
<p>"There ain't nothin' funny in that, is there?"
urged Tillie.</p>
<p>"Not very. He's well, and sent his love to
you."</p>
<p>"I don't believe," observed Tillie, weighing the
matter, " that he's half as mean as I thought he
was at first. He's a real good kind of a feller."</p>
<p>Captain Mills, having seen Tamsin's trunk put
into the daily baggage-wagon which ran to Barnet,
now came up to help her into the carriage. She
nodded slightly to Neal as she ascended the step.
He made a most obsequious bow to her, but as he
drove he did not fail to roll the whites of his eyes
back at her occasionally. She had risen to the
plane of grandeur which his race reveres, and was
no longer a Chenoworth. Still, he could not reconcile

<pb id="VAB9590-179" n="179"/>
                    
himself to the change; and Tillie Chenoworth
sat beside this new lady: he disapproved of
Tillie as strongly as ever.</p>
<p>Captain Mills, who occupied the front seat with
Neal, turned round and chatted with Tamsin.
He was under some constraint, but that wore off.
She looked ripe and girlish in her close-fitting
travelling suit, and her former awe of him as a
great man was gone: both these circumstances
placed her at an advantage. He inquired about
Craque-o'-Doom, and noticed the smoother modulations
of her voice. He told her of some changes
in Barnet, and meanwhile was carrying on a separate
train of thought based on his observations of
her. She did not appear the same person he had
once identified as Tamsin Chenoworth. That a
few months could make such changes was miraculous.
Either he had never known the girl, or
girls were capable of being rapidly made over.
He had expected her to put on exuberant airs in
dress and manner and talk of nothing but "our
school" and "the girls," higher mathematics, and
her most intimate friends among the "seniors."
Boarding-school young ladies always did so: no
creatures on earth are more stuffed with a sense
of their own importance. But she was not raw
and rasping: the change had struck through her
entire nature. It might not be a disagreeable job
to watch over her welfare, as he had promised

<pb id="VAB9590-180" n="180"/>

Craque-o'-Doom he would do, feeling at the time
he was the best-natured victim that insinuating
fellow ever took in.</p>
<p>They drove along the pike, meeting the sunset
face to face. Tamsin held up one gloved hand
to shield her eyes. When they entered Barnet,
how small the canal-bridge looked, how shabby
the warehouses rising from the water-edge, how
mean the stores, how pitiful the one or two blocks
of brick pavement! She noticed these things silently,
bending her head with a mere smile when
Captain Mills inquired if Barnet did not appear insignificant
after New York.</p>
<p>"But as natives we ought to feel an attachment
for Barnet," said he.</p>
<p>"It looks best in summer," she observed. The
woods on its northwest quarter were glorious in foliage.
"We'll go to the woods to-morrow, Tillie."</p>
<p>"Me and Mary's young uns has been all over
them woods since the hossy-boys was in blossom,"
exclaimed Tillie. " Oh, it's pretty up the slope a
ways! Do you mind when you and me used to
go elderberry-pickin', Tam?"</p>
<p>"Yes, certainly I do,--along the canal."</p>
<p>"And we was 'fraid and hid ourselves in the
bushes when boats went past,--'fraid the boatmen
'ud sass us. You wouldn't be afraid now: would
you?" This was affirmed rather than asked.</p>
<p>Captain Mills smiled.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-181" n="181"/>

<p>"Why wouldn't I?" asked Tamsin. She held
one of Tillie's claws on her lap.</p>
<p>The child, somewhat at a loss, looked deferentially
at her and tried to explain: "Oh, 'cause
You ain't the same like you was then."</p>
<p>"What is there different about me?"</p>
<p>"Well, you ain't 'fraid."</p>
<p>"You think I'm very bold now?"</p>
<p>"You've been away," proceeded Tillie, clearing
the matter up entirely, "and <hi rend="i">learnt proper</hi>." Tamsin
and the captain laughed: even Neal grinned as he
turned his horses toward the Hill-house.</p>
<p>"But I thought you's comin' <hi rend="i">home!</hi>" exclaimed
the child, gripping both hands around her
sister's arm, as she saw the carriage thus turn its
back on the Chenoworth quarter.</p>
<p>Tamsin took the arm away and put it around her.</p>
<p>"You are to stay up here with me," she said, "because
there is more room than at father's. I shall
be with you just as much. I will go there too.
Mr. Sutton arranged it with Captain Mills.--Didn't
he, Captain Mills?"</p>
<p>"That's the understanding," replied the host.</p>
<p>"And I told you in my letter."</p>
<p>Tillie readjusted facts in her mind. While thus
occupied, it occurred to her, "You don't call him
Tom Mills no more."</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Tamsin, reddening.</p>
<p>"You used to."</p>


<pb id="VAB9590-182" n="182"/>

<p>"I have learned not to take such liberties."</p>
<p>"Don't mention it," said Tom Mills, smiling.
He looked up toward the house.  Tamsin was
quite rosy.</p>
<p>"You says 'father,' too, instead o' 'daddy,'" ruminated
Tillie. "Ain't you goin' to say 'mammy'
and 'daddy' any more?"</p>
<p>"I hope not."</p>
<p>"Is it 'cause you're too proud?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I'm any prouder than I always
was."</p>
<p>"They said you'd git reel stuck-up.  I don't
think you are, though. You've just learnt proper.
My!" meditated Tillie, shaking her head, "how
proper you have learnt!"</p>
<p>When they paused on the drive beside the Hill-
house, Aunt Sally Teagarden, with a white kerchief
tied hastily over her head, came out, a little flurried
and unsettled in her manner. She did not know
just how to receive her former handmaid, of whose
new connection she disapproved while having the
girl's welfare at heart. The humdrum life at Barnet
had produced few changes: she was astounded
to see coming out of the carriage such a refined,
pretty creature.</p>
<p>"Why, Mrs--!" exclaimed Aunt Sally. "Why,
Miss--! Why--!" There she checked herself,
to stand in fine dignity and put forth the good old
formula, "How do you do?"</p>

<p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> a day's time Aunt Sally had fallen into very
pleasant relations with Tamsin, and existence at
the Hill-house moved in its usual comfortable
groove. Tillie sat at the tea-table, and slept with
her sister in one of the spacious front guest-rooms.
She accepted all changes with the heedless adaptability
of childhood.</p>                                  
<p>The next morning, when they started down hill,
she skipped beside Tamsin, delighted only to have
her near, and certain that the neighbors and towns-
people gazed because they were delighted too. In
the back street there was a long gauntlet of humble
doors framing stolid women. Some nodded
distantly in reply to Tamsin's greeting and noted
the style of her dress and extravagance of her
parasol and low shoes; others disappeared just
as she came by, and took refuge behind window-
blinds, as if they could not stand such refulgent
prosperity; while a few came out to their gates
and shook hands stiffly, talking up to her in a
way to make her feel they were just as good as
she was, and that she had not been "well off"

<pb id="VAB9590-184" n="184"/>

such a very long time herself. These shades of
social sentiment were lost on Tillie: she was parading
her sister. It occurred to her several times
to call attention to the trappings Tamsin carried,
but they were merely incidental in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ain't this a pretty dress she's got on, Mis'
Flowers!" exclaimed Tillie to a dishevelled
woman who stood with her hands on her hips
and several of her dirty buds around her. Tamsin,
while talking a moment to the mother, was
recognizing for the first time the piggish comeliness
there is about children who wallow.</p>
<p>Tillie's exuberance amused her, but it had a
chilling effect on Mrs. Flowers. "Balls's girls
has all got dresses somethin' like that," she observed.
"What fer goods is it?"</p>
<p>"Silk," replied Tillie, rubbing the fabric between
her finger and thumb.--" Ain't it silk, Tamsie?"</p>
<p>"Never mind," said Tamsin.</p>
<p>"But ain't it silk?"</p>
<p>"I thought 'twas callyco," said Mrs. Flowers:
"the figger's like it."</p>
<p>At the Chenoworth gate a curious neighbor was
talking with Sarah Jane beside a pail of water which
seemed destined to no further use in the world than
reflecting stalks of flowering currant by the fence.
The doors stood open: the premises were alert
with a summer look. The front windows were
heavy with vines, the dry walk bordered by 

<pb id="VAB9590-185" n="185"/>

primroses and four-o'clocks and all that old-fashioned
treasury of flowers.</p>
<p>Tamsin saw her mother hoeing in the garden;
the ancient cornstalks were gone, and lines of tender
ones appeared in their places.</p>
<p>"I s'posed you'd be above comin' <hi rend="i">here</hi>," said
Sarah Jane as the neighbor stood aside to let
Tamsin enter the gate. It was a new neighbor,--
one of the many floaters of the back street,--and
Tamsin did not know her.</p>
<p>The sisters took each other's hands. It was a
singular greeting, kindly indifference appearing on
one side and suppressed resentment on the other.</p>
<p>"Is father in the garden, too?" inquired Tamsin.</p>
<p>"No; he's down town. One of Mary's young
uns can run and tell him you're here."</p>
<p>"Never mind. I can see him soon, anyhow.
Where is Mary?"</p>
<p>"She's washin' fer Mis' Ewing to-day." The
neighbor took up her water-pail and moved away,
while Sarah Jane walked beside her sister to the
garden.</p>
<p>It was Tillie who caught the old mother around
the waist and turned her remonstrating sun-bonnet
toward Tamsin.</p>
<p>"My sakes alive!" complained Mrs. Chenoworth;
"if you don't quit a-scarin' me that way,
Tillie, I'll fetch you such a rap-- Why, is that
Tamsin? No, 'tain't."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-186" n="186"/>

<p>"Yes, it is, mother." The daughter put her
arms up and kissed the old mouth; yet, in doing
so, she was conscious of a blank and aching feeling
in her bosom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chenoworth was not especially glad to see
her. They seemed to be a race without emotions.
"Don't step on that tater-hill," she said, and set
her sun-bonnet straight on her head. "Well, we
heard you got here last night. Come into the
house." They all wended their way thither.</p>
<p>"Everybody is well?" inquired Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Middlin'. How's your man?"</p>
<p>"Well, thank you."</p>
<p>They entered the low door, and when Mrs.
Chenoworth had selected the particular split-
bottomed chair she wished Tamsin to sit in, it
occurred to her to remark, " Sary Jane and Arter
they've made a match."</p>
<p>"So Tillie told me."</p>
<p>Sarah Jane put her apron to her eyes; her face
reddened violently.</p>
<p>"I hope you'll be happy," said Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll bet you do!--with a great big lazy
hulk like him on my hands! You could always
have things your own way, and I may take up
with your leavin's."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked at her with mild compassion;
"You needn't have married him."</p>
<p>"I thought mebby he'd fetch in somethin',"

<pb id="VAB9590-187" n="187"/>
                    
explained Sarah Jane, crying; "but he ain't done a
lick o' work since; and when he has a job he
won't stick to it. And there's that baby."</p>
<p>"Where is it?"</p>
<p>"It's asleep," snapped Sarah Jane. "I couldn't
git nobody to take it, and it a-hinderin' me from
doin' any good for myself. Arter he talked around
and talked around till I went and had him; and
now what have I come to!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Chenoworth drew a deep sigh. Every new
complication in her family brought her greater
resignation: it was the natural lot of woman to
suffer.  But she turned toward Tamsin with a
strange look. Tamsin scarcely belonged to her.
"Things is different with you," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, they are different."</p>
<p>Tamsin felt a sudden thrill through her bosom
as she spoke. She saw a bland, gray-eyed head
standing out on the air with no appendage of deformed
body. He had saved her from this misery
of race, before which she could still only sit helpless.
The fine aroma of his spirit came to her in
his absence: he would have made the world different
to her even had he been poor.</p>
<p>A tramping on the step and a shadow darkening
the door caused her to look up and see her father
The old man was grayer and more hairy; he wore
goggles over his eyes to protect them from sun-
glare, and a coat so tattered and patched it was

<pb id="VAB9590-188" n="188"/>

hard to tell what color it had faded and degenerated
from. Tamsin knew of old her father's tastes
in raiment: no matter how many whole garments
he had, he wore most and enjoyed himself best in
tatters. He made rather a loud demonstration
over her, and smacked her cheek with a kiss.
John and George appeared also, and shook her
glove with clumsy hands.</p>
<p>While she talked with her family she kept looking
round with the old astonishment at their ways
and habits of thought, and that aversion toward
them which had been born in her was only tempered
by pity. She did not like them; formerly
she had loathed them. The feeling was lessened,
--not because they had gained upon her affections,
but because she had a scope and a world no longer
bound by them.</p>
<p>With Tillie all to herself in the woods it was
different. The summer was young with them.
Every smell was pungent: the earth and grass
still had an odor that one sucked in with all one's
lungs. Both girls knew a hollow in the woody
hill which rose west of Barnet. Tillie carried her
instrument, and they went there and sat on a log
so crusted with moss and reduced from fibre by
Nature's alchemy that it was scarcely stronger
than a heap of dust and gave way in places to the
treading foot or leaning hand. It was a bank of
many tiny moss-cups. Tamsin and Tillie had sat

<pb id="VAB9590-189" n="189"/>

on that log every summer for years. The woods
dimmed the daylight all around them. Far off
they could hear the rumble of vehicles on the
pike.</p>
<p>When Tamsin settled herself, the little one
kicked a space clear of last year's leaves, and,
patting the turf with her feet, played all her tunes.
The tree-trunks echoed the music. When she
finally placed the accordion on the log and climbed
up between it and Tamsin, her face was damp
with exertion, and she lifted the bottom of her
dress to wipe her neck.</p>
<p>"What a smart little girl I've got!" said the
elder, putting her arms around the child.</p>
<p>"I learnt 'em nearly all myself. Just ketched
'em by ear."</p>
<p>"When you come to stay with me you can have
a piano to play on."</p>
<p>"That'd be pretty nice," conceded Tillie; "but I
don't see how a feller can help likin' the 'cordion
best. It's so little: you can carry it round and
hug it. Gne of Mary's young uns come nigh
pickin' a hole in it. My! what'd I done with that
young un if it had!"</p>
<p>"Honey--" began Tamsin.</p>
<p>"I like to hear that!" exclaimed the child;
"sounds like you used to talk. I expect my talk
does seem awful to you, Tam."</p>
<p>"I never found any fault with you, dear"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-190" n="190"/>

<p>"I know you don't; but you've learnt proper
and I ain't. I'm goin' to begin to, though."</p>
<p>Tamsin laughed and rocked the flaxen head.
"We're sisters," she said,--"real sisters."</p>
<p>Tillie admitted it as they rocked. "Mary and
Sary Jane's sisters, too," she added. "I like Mary
better'n I do Sary Jane; but I don't like <hi rend="i">nobody</hi>
half as well as I do you, Tam,-daddy nor mammy,
nor nobody." ("Father nor mother," she tried
under her breath.) "Not father, nor mother, nor
nobody. I did miss you so. Now, don't you
laugh if I tell you somethin', will ye?" She tilted
her head and challenged Tamsin with her light-
blue eyes: the iris was very clear and pure.</p>
<p>"Of course not," promised Tamsin.</p>
<p>"I did feel that bad, and I'd wake up in the
night and couldn't go to sleep, when you first
went away. The only thing that done me any
good was, I'd pat my piller, this way, like it was
your face, and say, 'Place hands, place hands!'"
This was Tillie's individual and peculiar caress.
She meant by it blessing and benediction.</p>
<p>Tamsin suddenly put her handkerchief to her face.</p>
<p>"You ain't laughin', are you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no."</p>
<p>"Are ye cryin'? Don't cry, Tam."</p>
<p>"Oh, honey," said Tamsin, devouring this merry
little face with eyes which dilated while she gazed,
"what shall I ever do without you?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-191" n="191"/>

<p>"There's your man," suggested Tillie. "You
think a heap of him, don't you?"</p>
<p>The warmth deepened under Tamsin's skin.
She looked wistfully'at the child, but made no
reply.</p>
<p>"I don't think much o' men. I don't never intend
to git married. Mary and Sary Jane has got
their come-uppance gittin' married. And you've
got such a funny-lookin' man, Tam."</p>
<p>"You don't know him, dear. If you saw how
kind and fine he is--"</p>
<p>"Yes, he is a reel clever feller. I think consider'ble
of that 'cordion."</p>
<p>"And didn't you like the dresses and all the
rest?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I was very well pleased. And I like the
new things you brought me when you come.
But I <hi rend="i">was</hi> spited about that blue sack."</p>
<p>"Why, I thought you were pleased with it."</p>
<p>"I was, I tell ye. But Mary she had to borry
it for one of her young uns, and she kep' a-borryin'
it till they had it there all the time. I didn't min'
her havin' whatever else she wanted; but that blue
sack,--it was a spite for <hi rend="i">it</hi> to be took."</p>
<p>"I'll get you another,-a prettier one."</p>
<p>"If you do," advised Tillie sagely, "git one
apiece for all the connections first."</p>
<p>Coming home, they passed Mary's house. She
lived in what was known as the "nigger quarters,"


<pb id="VAB9590-192" n="192"/>

several colored families holding sway thereabouts.
The voices of their noisy progeny could always be
heard, singing, crying, or quarrelling,--but their
gardens were marvellous, even in pastoral Barnet.</p>
<p>Tamsin and Tillie stopped at Mary's fence. She
was weeding her onion-bed, but came forward,
pulling down her sleeves. IIer hands had that
shrunken look which parboiling in soap-suds
gives; her dress hung lank about her, and half
the slats were out of the limpest sun-bonnet that
ever hung over a dejectec woman's face. Still,
and in spite of her humiliations and incapacities,
there was always a remnant of dignity about
Mary. Tamsin took her hands and reached over
the fence to kiss her, touched by this sister as she
had never been before.</p>
<p>"How are you?"</p>
<p>"Tol'able, thank you. You look <hi rend="i">real</hi> well."</p>
<p>"I am well. Where are the children?"</p>
<p>"Some's along where he's a-ditchin', and I don't
know where the boys are. That's Jinnie hidin'
behind the ker'n'-bushes.--Come here, Jinnie, and
see Aunt Tamsin."</p>
<p>"Yes, come," called Tamsin. But the white-
headed child merely peeped, and refused to appear.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked over her sister's drawn and
pinched face, still keeping a hand on her arm
as both of them leaned on the fence. "You're
tired, aren't you, Mary?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-193" n="193"/>

<p>"Yes: I' been washin' for Mis' Ewin'. I just
got done a little while ago, and thought I could
weed some before he wanted his supper." She
avoided Tamsin's eyes, and gazed rather on her
hands or dress or Tillie's clothing, with that nervous
attempt at self-possession which is so painful
to see in a woman who carries her broken pride
through her misfortunes.</p>
<p>"I am coming to see you some afternoon," said
Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Do," said Mary stiffly. "You're goin' to stay
up at Mills's, ain't you? We heard you was."</p>
<p>"Yes: Mr. Sutton got them to board me."</p>
<p>"I thought 'twasn't likely he'd want you to stay
at daddy's, where they're so crowded."</p>
<p>Tamsin decided that Mary had some sense, and
in this respect differed from Sarah Jane.</p>
<p>"If you want to talk proper, Mary," expostulated
Tillie, "don't say 'daddy': it's 'father.' Tam says
'father.'"</p>
<p>Mary's face grew hot, but she replied, "My
proper days is past, Tillie. I ain't tryin' no more.
Tamsin'll have to learn for the whole family."</p>
<p>"Tillie will make everybody laugh at me," expostulated
Tamsin. "She asked Mrs. Flowers to
look at my dress, and she acts as if I came out for
a show. <hi rend="i">That</hi> isn't proper, honey."</p>
<p>"Well," said Tillie, twisting herself, "you can't
expect me to learn everything proper right off."</p>

<p>The very first ripe currants were on the tea-table
at the Hill-house. Neal stood by the sideboard,
in his old place, ready to start at a motion from
his mistress; but, before it was time to change
plates in the simple country tea, he had an opportunity
to ruminate long and deeply on the promotion
of Chenoworth's Damsel. He saw her sitting
up there as fresh as a rose, acting the lady; a few
months before she was an odd-job girl, whose position
he considered far less dignified than that of
a regular servant. His master looked at her, too,
seeing with constant surprise her many small
stylish ways. Her flesh had a warm under-tint
which it had lacked in her days of precarious
side-meat.</p>
<p>When Tamsin had been home a few days, old
Mr. Chenoworth came slouching up to the Hill-
house one morning, looking about him in every
direction, with his lips drooping apart. The cook
happened to be in the garden with Aunt Sally,
and Neal busy on the vineyard slope, so there
was nobody about the great drowsing house except
Tamsin and Captain Mills. The latter had
just come in and thrown himself on a sofa in the
back parlor. Tamsin was in the library, writing a
letter.</p>
<p>The old man went cautiously around the house,
and, returning to the side-porch on the east side,
stepped up and knocked. Tamsin saw him through

<pb id="VAB9590-195" n="195"/>

a window. The door was open, and she reached
it before Captain Mills had lifted his drowsy
length.</p>
<p>"Won't you come in, father?"</p>
<p>"I hain't got time. I wanted to speak to ye a
minute."</p>
<p>"Is Tillie sick?"</p>
<p>"No. She ain't been from here more'n half an
hour. I've got to go over to Norwalk to-morrow,
--there's some things for me to settle over there.
I want you to lend me five or ten dollars."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tamsin.</p>
<p>He had spoken low, and Captain Mills's indifferent
ear did not make out the request. Tamsin
went to her room and brought him what he asked
for. It was money given to her to spend as she
pleased. She smiled as she came down-stairs:
history was repeating itself,-- he still wanted her
wages.</p>
<p>"I'll give it back as soon as I git it," he promised.</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind, father."</p>
<p>At least four times during the summer he made
excursions to Norwalk, and each time borrowed a
similar sum. Since he could no longer charge up
board and lodging against her, he had no resource
but to borrow. When the season was quite over,
it may be mentioned here, old Mr. Chenoworth
fully cancelled these loans. He saw Tamsin, and

<pb id="VAB9590-196" n="196"/>
                    
said to her, "Tam, that money that I got of
you--"</p>
<p>"Never mind it, father. It's all Mr. Sutton's,
and he would want you to keep it."</p>
<p>"But I borrowed it. I'll let it go against your
weddin'-expenses. That was some expense, but I
didn't charge it up agin you at the time."</p>
<p>When she came in from the veranda on this first
occasion, Captain Mills, lounging against the sofa-
pillow, inquired, "Was that your father?"</p>
<p>"Yes: he's gone now."</p>
<p>Tom had guessed her errand up-stairs. "Did
you know that your husband pays him a regular
allowance?"</p>
<p>"No," said Tamsin with a start.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> ladies of Barnct, especially the young and
recently-married ladies, all called on Tamsin.
They had considered the matter well. It was a
concession not so much to her altered prospects as
to the Mills family, with whom she was staying.
The Millses had been respectable ever since Barnet
was a town: they had been looked up to, and
would probably be looked up to while time endured.
Tamsin had made a queer though ad-
vantageous match. She might prosper, or her
new-found glories might melt: Barnet knew
nothing about that, but as long as the Millses
countenanced her advancement it was bound to
(do so.</p>                   
<p>The young ladies compared their impressions of
her: they had known absolutely nothing of her in
her former state except an old shawl and a pair
of cowhide shoes plodding across the commons.
Their opinions of her were various: one was
charmed with her, but another despised a girl who
would live in comfort and even luxury while her
family struggled in poverty. How Tamsin was to

<pb id="VAB9590-198" n="198"/>

renovate the whole Chenoworth tribe this right-
minded critic did not suggest. Some thought she
made herself ridiculous, coming back where her
miserable origin was known; and a few said she
was a Chenoworth, and, generally speaking, that
was enough for them to know. Still, outward
deference of manner was not wanting, and Aunt
Sally many times during the summer put on her
cream-colored poplin, which gave her the stately
expansiveness of a beautiful white elephant, and
went with Tamsin hither and thither to tea at
houses the outside of which had formerly been
as awful as temples to Chenoworth's daughter.
Sarah Jane stood at the gate to watch her favored
sister's progress, or had spies out along the pike
to report where Tamsin had been most recently
honored, and Sarah Jane's sun-bonnet made frequent
journeys across the dog-pound to buzz at
Mary's tired ear the inequality of fortune. Mary
expected no more good in the world: she had
long ago received her final surprise. But Sarah
Jane was of opinion that if Tamsin Chenoworth
was even the ghost of a sister she would divide
the dwarf up in some way among the family, or
make him at least demand that invitations should
be extended to all the younger branches.</p>
<p>In return for all this entertainment Aunt Sally
gave a mighty and solemn tea, to which all of female
Barnet drew nigh who were considered within

<pb id="VAB9590-199" n="199"/>
                    
the pale of society. And here was crowning cause
for complaint. Sarah Jane went up and sat in the
Mills's kitchen and complained to the cook. Her
feelings were so outraged she wished a variety of
calamities upon her sister. That Tamsin had not
the inviting of the guests was a fact which in no
vwise mollified her; that Tamsin might be wearied
by their society was what Sarah Jane could not
conceive of. There sat that girl, reared like a goddess
above her own kin: either she had no business
in her position or the Chenoworths had no
business in theirs. Sarah Jane was in the liveliest
sense a communist.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom's letters were very odd and delightful.
He wrote about nothing but his adventures.
He enclosed some epistles from Rhoda
Burns, written to Tamsin and himself both: she
had a great many clever things to say about things
abroad; and these two remote streams flowed
through Tamsin's mind, clearing it of a great deal
of perplexity. Considering herself only a simple
girl, she sometimes pored over her husband's letters
with awe.</p>
<p>Jennie Mills and Louise Latta, with a following
of young gentlemen and young ladies, came down
and took the house by storm. These were days
of immense activity, although the July heats were
come. There was a lawn-party, and endless games
of croquet, rides, a little languid dancing, and a

<pb id="VAB9590-200" n="200"/>

picnic, in which Barnet turned out all its muslin
and best cake and came home soaked with the
usual thunder-shower. It was about this time that
Captain Mills began to devote himself to Tamsin.
He had been very kind to her all summer, in a
guardian-like way; but, with so many young men
around, he felt it his duty, as the elderly, non-
marrying man of the flock, to escort Craque-o'-
Doom's young wife. The young men in round
coats and straw hats were not inclined to neglect
her; they had heard her story from Jennie and
Louise; they saw her and approved of her. But
on every occasion when a straw hat threw itself
down to fan a pleasant heated face by Tamsin's
side, Tom Mills's cooler, smooth-shaven countenance
appeared as a balance of power.</p>
<p>Jennie and Louise met Tamsin upon their own
plane. They were delighted with her, and borrowed
half her things, freely bestowing their own
upon her in return. This house-stirring had a
beneficent influence on her. All her girlish spirits
were aroused. She talked, and waltzed, and played
croquet. Tom Mills frequently stood and looked
at her. Her very flesh quivered with life: she
was lovely and dangerous,-far more so than the
lighter girls: they could charm, but she had an individuality
which could entangle itself in the minutest
fibres of a man's nature. Captain Tom
thought this dumbly, feeling a sample of the tingle

<pb id="VAB9590-201" n="201"/>

himself. It caused him to mutter again, "Poor
Craque-o'-Doom !" and thereafter lose himself in
astonishment at the change which had come over
his compassion for his friend. On the occasion of
the dwarf's marriage he had pitied the poor fellow
for having taken a wife immeasurably beneath him:
he pitied the same man now for the disadvantages
which must hold him forever beneath this beauti-
ful wife.</p>
<p>It troubled Tom after the boys and girls were
gone. He smoked a great many cigars. He was
a hardened old bachelor himself, but could foresee
how it would end. By the time she was through
school she would be ready for gay society, and
gay society she would have. No dwarf could
deny her anything. How she would sail and
sparkle, while Craque-o'-Doom ambled slowly
along underneath, watching her flight! Just when
she was at her best, somebody,-Tom dreaded to
think there were such scoundrels,--but some fellow
would sever the last thread that bound her to
Craque-o'-Doom; then these new-fangled notions
about divorce, and all that sort of thing; darkness,
trouble, Craque-o'-Doom desolated.</p>
<p>But she seemed very happy at receiving the
dwarf's letters; she read bits of them to Tillie,
who hung around her constantly, and to Captain
Tom. She devoted certain days to writing, and
sent out large packets.</p>

<pb  id="VAB9590-202" n="202"/>

<p>"Distance lends enchantment," thought the
captain.</p>
<p>Her brother came home from jail, and made the
round of the family to greet everybody. He had
not a prepossessing countenance, and was much
soured against society. The poor boy knew that
things had gone against him, and, conscious of
guilt, he was ready for new mischief. Tamsin had
seen Sam: she had exchanged salutations with all
her cousins, including Arter, who shambled out
of her way as quickly as he possibly could, expressing
injury in every line of his slouch. She
had sought them more than they had sought her,
though she felt an indifference toward them which
was tinctured with no feeling but pain. But Jess
came defiantly to see her. He slammed Mills's
front gate. Sarah Jane was with him,--and the
least liberal guardian of Barnet society was just
leaving the house. It was a sultry sunset. Tamsin
was languid with the heat of the day. Aunt
Sally stood in the shade, talking with her neighbor,
and Captain Mills had just sauntered up with
his cigar. He had on a dressing-gown, and looked
effeminate in the eyes of Jess Chenoworth.</p>
<p>"Here's your brother come to see you," said
Sarah Jane aggressively to Tamsin. "He's just
as good as them that's so big-feelin', if he has been
in jail."</p>
<p>The neighbor looked upon this family group

<pb id="VAB9590-203" n="203"/>
                    
with extreme disfavor. She confined her remaining
remarks to Aunt Sally, and, after listening incidentally
to what the group said, went away and
told how disgraceful it was.</p>
<p>Tamsin took Jess's hand and said, "How do
you do?" She looked pained. Tom Mills ached
at the sight of her face.</p>
<p>"I didn't suppose you'd come to see me, so I
thought I'd come to see you," said Jess, with a
hard laugh and an air of braving it out. Yet she
had a certain effect upon him which no female
relative had produced before.</p>
<p>"You ought to come," said Tamsin. "I ought
to see you."</p>
<p>"He's your own brother," repeated Sarah Jane,
as if she were thrusting the fact down Tamsin's
throat.</p>
<p>"Yes, he is," said Tamsin. "Poor boy!" she
added, with a choke in her voice.</p>
<p>"I don't want no water-works turned on," said
Jess, with an airy wave of his head. "The women,"
he remarked to Captain Mills, "al'ays takes every
excuse they can for cryin'."</p>
<p>"I want to talk with you, Jess," said Tom Mills,
turning to saunter around the house and indicating
that he wished to be followed, "about your prospects."</p>
<p>Jess went with the captain. "I hain't got any
prospecks," said he in a jocose tone. "The'

<pb id="VAB9590-204" n="204"/>

hain't any millionaire been runnin' after me since
I come out."</p>
<p>"There's a man, not exactly a millionaire, but
still with some means," said Tom, as they mounted
the east veranda by themselves, "who offers to
give you a handsome start, for the sake of your
sister, if you will try to make a man of yourself."</p>
<p>Tamsin sat on the door-step in silence. Aunt
Sally had gone to oversee the milking. The sun
was down, but the burning was not yet drawn out
of the day. Sarah Jane sat on the lowest step:
her sun-bonnet was in her lap, but her aquiline
face was overhung with shreds of hair. Tamsin
never said much to her, but seemed to overwhelm
her with silence. Sarah Jane had broken out for
a minute or two with hysterical complaints, but
the black-eyed sphinx upon the top step was apparently
stone-cold and deaf to them. "You don't
seem to think nothin' of your own folks," said
Sarah Jane; "everybody else is more account to
you than them that's kin,--only Tillie. You don't
act with no natural feelin's."</p>
<p>The upbraiding might have passed Tamsin's
cheeks like the evening wind. Her hands were
folded in her lap, and she looked steadily down
the hill.</p>
<p>Sarah Jane dug her shoe into the gravel at the
foot of the step. Dusk sifted thicker and thicker
through the air, and finally Jess came round the

<pb id="VAB9590-205" n="205"/>
                    
house, and the sister who had come with him got
up and joined him. "Good-evenin', Tam," said
Sarah Jane with asperity.</p>
<p>"Good-evening," responded Tamsin.</p>
<p>Jess paused, with his hat pulled forward and his
hands in his pockets. " That was toler'ble clever
of your man," he said to Tamsin.</p>
<p>"What was?"</p>
<p>"He's goin' to stake me up for a new deal at
somethin'. Tom Mills says he thought I'd turn
out first-rate if he gave me a start. You tell him
thanky, will ye?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tamsin. She added spontaneously,
"He is good."</p>
<p>"Consider'ble better'n some whole men I've
knowed," pronounced Jess.</p>
<p>"I bet <hi rend="i">you</hi> never put him up to it," said Sarah
Jane to Tamsin.</p>
<p>They went away talking in an eager, sad duet:
the eager tones were Jess's, the plaintive ones
Sarah Jane's.</p>
<p>There was a whippoorwill singing in one of the
large trees beside the drive. The gurgle in his
throat which precedes his cry could be distinctly
heard. The barn-yard calves were complaining
of their evening banishment from their mothers,
with that lonesome, November-like cadence which
always suggests thinning trees and a sharp wind
around corners. But the summer night was delicious;

<pb id="VAB9590-206" n="206"/>

it did not even lack a full moon. Far down
the pike, the Barnet brass-band was blaring at
great Apollo to strike the lyre; the one ice-cream
saloon was doing a rushing business, for a great
many promenading couples made the evening festive.</p>
<p>Aunt Sally saw the mantel-clock point to nine,
and took her bed-room candle. "Is Tamsin up-
stairs, Thomas?" she inquired as she passed the
small library-door, within which her nephew was
smoking in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Probably she is."</p>
<p>"Be sure to fasten the front door when you go."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Tom.</p>
<p>With Andrew Jackson Davis under her arm and
her candle paling in the moonlight, Aunt Sally
went up-stairs.</p>
<p>When Captain Tom had smoked his cigar out,
he got up and sauntered through the parlors, giving
no sign of what was in his mind or how he
meant to occupy the rest of the evening. In the
middle of the front parlor he stood still. "Tamsin,"
he said, with an indefinite sting of pain in the
word. He saw her lying face downward on a sofa,
her white dress rising and falling in long breaths
around the shoulders. She stirred, keeping the
back of one hand over her eyes. "What's the
matter?" begged Captain Tom, seating himself on
a chair by her head. He rested his arm on the

<pb id="VAB9590-207" n="207"/>
                    
back and leaned toward her with what he thought
a very paternal air. "What are you crying about
here alone?"</p>
<p>For answer she broke into a fresh sob.</p>
<p>"My heavens!" said Tom, with a pang in his
breast. "Who has hurt you?"  lie reassuringly
took the hand from her eyes and held and patted
it. It was warm and soft, and while he held it he
began to tremble. " Can't you tell me?" he murmured,
modulating his voice so that it sounded
strange to himself. "Do you feel badly about
your brother ?" He raised her to a sitting posture
and saw her rested comfortably against the back
of the sofa. With fatherly care he put a footstool
to her feet, and then resumed his chair, reaching
for her hands with an unaccountable impulse to
draw her close to him.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked into his kind eyes and revealed
a new phase of herself. The silent stoic and the
budding young lady were gone. She was a spirit
struggling with the problems of her own being,--
but a very pretty, warm, distracting spirit, conscious
or unconscious of her power. "I never did
like them," she confessed. "I can't do it. Tillie
is the only one who seems related to me. It is
horrible to feel so. When I looked at him, I
thought of the brothers who came to see the girls
at school. I should like to have a brother of that
kind. He makes my flesh creep. I do not love


<pb id="VAB9590-208" n="208"/>

my father and mother. If they were dead I could
not cry one true tear. If Sam and Sarah Jane and
all the rest--except Tillie--were to die, I should
not miss them at all."</p>
<p>Tom kept patting and soothing her hand.</p>
<p>"You never heard of anybody that way, did
you?" inquired Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes: very few brothers and sisters are so
closely united as Tillie and you are."</p>
<p>"But why don't I care for the rest of them?"</p>
<p>"Natural antagonism," explained Captain Tom.
"There are no points of sympathy between you.
You are as different as if you came of other blood.
It is useless to make yourself unhappy about it."</p>
<p>Tamsin rested against the back of the sofa and
thought. "I wish," she said sincerely, "that I
had only had one sister, and that Tillie, and only
one brother, and that you."</p>
<p>Tom Mills started up and walked to the other
side of the room.</p>
<p>Tamsin looked after him: "Have I made you
mad?"</p>
<p>"No," said Tom, returning. His eyes had a
singular glow. "All my life I have missed my
sister."</p>
<p>"It would have been <hi rend="i">so</hi> nice," continued Tamsin.
"Before Mr. Sutton came I used to want to
be related to you, and after he came I wanted it
more than ever. What makes your hand so cold?"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-209" n="209"/>
                    
<p>"Is it cold?" murmured the captain, looking at
it stupidly. "That must be because it has always
missed a little hand like this."</p>
<p>"I used to watch you, and be afraid of you."</p>
<p>"Afraid of me! Why?"</p>
<p>"You seemed my idea of a gentleman; and I--
What was I?"</p>
<p>"Always a rare girl, if I had had the wit to notice
it," said Tom with some bitterness.</p>
<p>"I always loved to be here," still ruminated
Tamsin. "Why can't people pick their relations?
I would have picked you from the very start. I
hope you ain't provoked because I feel so?"</p>
<p>"No--no--heaven knows!"</p>
<p>"Home!" her eyes wandered around the moon-
lit walls. "And I never could help calling <hi rend="i">her</hi>
Aunt Sally; and you--" She turned her eyes
back laughing to his face.</p>
<p>He was as white as a statue; his jet moustache
added ghastliness to his face. He gripped her
hand in palm and fingers which were jetting with
blood hot from his heart.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" asked Tamsin, startled,
as he drew himself away from her and rose up,
turning his back.</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied Captain Mills, huskily.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he had spoken, there were
feet on the door-steps and feet in the hall, a swish
of clothes, the cough of a man, the sound of a

<pb id="VAB9590-210" n="210"/>

mellow voice which made Tom Mills want to stab
himself, and of Rhoda Burns, exclaiming, "Who
is in here having such a remarkably cosey little
<hi rend="i">tête-à-tête</hi> that carriages rolling up and people
arriving fail to disturb it?"</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">AMSIN</hi> rose and met the party with agitation.
She kissed Rhoda, took Mr. Burns's hand, and, last,
stood like a young giantess with her hands in
Craque-o'-Doom's.</p>
<p>Tom made a great stir about getting lights. But
Neal and the cook were out making calls, and the
matches eluded him. "I had some in the library
a little while ago, but don't know where I put
them," said he. And he shook hands all around
the group with a manner very different from his
usual beneficent one.</p>
<p>"Never mind candles," said Rhoda: "they just
draw bugs to bang against the screens or sail in at
the door and land down your back. You seemed
to be getting on charmingly without illumination
when we came in."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tamsin. "I hate lights in summer.

<pb id="VAB9590-211" n="211"/>

I sat on the step till long after the moon came
up."</p>
<p>Thought Mrs. Burns to herself, "I wonder how
long this philandering has been going on? And
Tom Mills, of all men! I never saw him look so
agitated. Hasn't she a particle of sense? I could
shake her!"</p>
<p>They were grouped in seats, in and out of the
moonshine. Rhoda unfastened her hat and scarf;
the two gentlemen sat with their hats in their
hands.</p>
<p>"Did you send your carriage to the stables?"
inquired Tom.</p>
<p>"I didn't bring mine this time," said Craque-o'-
Doom. "We came in a conveyance from the station.
Mr. and Mrs. Burns whirled me out here
without any warning."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Rhoda; " we stumbled on him roasting
in New York City, just by accident, at his
favorite hotel."</p>
<p>"It's very hot in town," remarked Mr. Burns.
He fanned his face with his handkerchief, as if the
recollection overpowered him.</p>
<p>"But I thought you were in Canada for the summer,
Craque-o'-Doom ?" said Tom.</p>
<p>"I got tired of it sooner than I did last
year."</p>
<p>"You didn't say a word about leaving in your
last letter," said Tamsin. She had resumed her

<pb id="VAB9590-212" n="212"/>

seat on the sofa, and Rhoda was sitting in the chair
Tom had occupied.</p>
<p>"No; I took a sudden fancy to run out here.
Then I changed my mind and sent the carriage
back. Then I met Mr. and Mrs. Burns, and we
concluded to make a flying visit to Barnet and
take you back with us to the sea-shore for the rest
of the summer."</p>
<p>"I had a little matter of business West," murmured
Mr. Burns, to explain his concurrence in
such eccentric proceedings. " I have to go on to
Chicago."</p>
<p>"Don't say flying visit," urged Tom in a nerveless
voice.</p>
<p>"Come with us to Swampscott, Tom," said
Craque-o'-Doom. And Rhoda turned sharply
round and looked at him. " Mr. Burns has promised
us as much time as he can spare during the
rest of the summer. We can make a comfortable
party."</p>
<p>"Fifth wheel to a coach," said Tom. "Bachelors
are always in the way. Louise and Jennie
have just made us a visit," he continued, addressing
Rhoda.</p>
<p>"I wish they had extended it; only we might
tax your aunt's housekeeping pretty heavily. You
haven't told me how she is, or even noticed that I
am just back from the grand tour."</p>
<p>"Oh, Aunt Sally is always well," said Tom.

<pb id="VAB9590-213" n="213"/>

"And you must remember I am just a provincial
farmer, blind to the splendors of travel. Provincial
is the word, isn't it, Mr. Burns?"</p>
<p>Mr. Burns laughed and rubbed his hands. "Yes,
that's the word. Pretty good sort of word; but I
don't like it myself. I don't like New York airs."</p>
<p>"I do," said Rhoda. "I like everything that
suggests magnificence. If you will own to being
provincial, I will glory in being cosmopolitan.
We have had sumptuous times, haven't we, Mr.
Burns ?"</p>
<p>"Very," he responded.</p>
<p>"My head is stuffed full. I am richer by a
grand division and many hundred years. Is that
your aunt Sally coming down-stairs?"</p>
<p>It was Aunt Sally, in an immense wrapper.
Her light sleep had been broken. She welcomed
everybody, and had lights burning all over the
house, and June-bugs bumping against them, and
a hearty supper set out, and all the travellers'
wants attended to, before the minute-hand on the
French clock had passed three characters.</p>
<p>"Tamsin," said Mrs. Burns, coming into her
young friend's virgin chamber when every inmate
was supposed to be retiring, "have you said a word
to Mr. Sutton this evening?"</p>
<p>"Of course I have."  Tamsin had a downcast
expression. She had her light hair around the
shoulders of a very pretty tinted <hi rend="i">peignoir</hi>, and was

<pb id="VAB9590-214" n="214"/>

brushing industriously. Rhoda also had her hair
down and plied a vigorous brush. " Do you think
we shall really go to-morrow ?"</p>
<p>"Of course. It's time, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Then I wish Tillie had stayed here to-night.
She has slept with me every night but this since I
came back. She took a freak to stay at home tonight."</p>
<p>"Have you had a pleasant summer?"</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="i">such</hi> a pleasant one! I have had her with
me so much. The other day we went out to the
grave-yard, and sat in the grass and talked as we
used to do when we were children."</p>
<p>"Children! what are you now?" sniffed Mrs.
Burns. "That must have been very cheerful."</p>
<p>"It was.--I wish she was here."</p>
<p>"Tamsin," said Rhoda boldly, "what were
you and Captain Mills doing when we came
in?"</p>
<p>"Doing?" The girl raised her black eyes as if
with a sudden effort at recollection. "Why, talking,
of course."</p>
<p>"What tender subject occupied you?"</p>
<p>"I shan't tell you," replied Tamsin, after turning
the matter over in her mind. "I don't have to
tell everybody how I feel."</p>
<p>Rhoda sat down by her and put a hand on her
lap. The girl's eyes met hers with great wistfulness:
the oval face looked so innocent. "She is

<pb id="VAB9590-215" n="215"/>

the slyest flirt I ever saw," thought Rhoda, "or
else the most guileless of women."</p>
<p>"You delicious young fiend!" she exclaimed,
"I am equally divided whether to shake you or
fall upon you and devour you with kisses. Have
you been making fools of any men this summer?
Not to mince matters, have you transfixed this
silly old Tom Mills, with his white poll and black
moustache and years of what ought to be discretion?"</p>
<p>Tamsin pushed back her hair and flashed a
glance at Rhoda which was actually haughty.
"I'm married !" she said, as if this were a sufficient
reminder.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know you are; but how are you to
realize it, living as you do? And plenty of mar-
ried women flirt, you will find as you go on."</p>
<p>"If you think that," said Tamsin, retiring an
inch from Rhoda, evidently smarting with a new
sting which neutralized the old, "I don't care what
you know. My brother got out of--jail. You
don't know how I feel."</p>
<p>"My dear!" exclaimed Rhoda affectionately.</p>
<p>"I wished I had had a brother like Captain
Mills. He has always been a nice man. I want,"
she burst out passionately, "do want nice relations!"
And, turning her back on Rhoda, she hid
her head in a pillow.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burns was about to begin a dissertation on

<pb id="VAB9590-216" n="216"/>

the ridiculous folly of that platonism between the
sexes known as "brothering" and "sistering"
each other, but the door opened without warning,
and Tillie came in. She had reached the front
door just as Aunt Sally was herself locking it for
the night. Her hair was damp with dew: the
odors of hay-fields and sweet sod were suggested
by her untrammelled presence.</p>
<p>"I couldn't stay away, Tam," said the child.
She gave a " How do you do?" to the new lady,
and huddled on the bed by her sister.</p>
<p>"They are a couple of Phoebe-birds," thought
Rhoda as she retired. "I'm not half as brilliant
in the management of human nature as I thought
I was."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Captain Tom was crouching against
the mantel in Craque-o'-Doom's room. The dwarf
was half lying on the bed, with a pillow under his
elbow. "Is that all?" said he.</p>
<p>"I think it's enough," said Tom. "I give you
my word I behaved like a man and a gentleman
till to-night. I'm growing daft in my mature years.
When I came in and found her crying, you can't
picture my sensations."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I can."</p>
<p>"I had an affair once that I thought would keep
me from ever thinking of a woman again."</p>
<p>The dwarf looked up with interest.</p>
<p>"She died. I expected to live a bachelor, and

<pb id="VAB9590-217" n="217"/>
                    
have never since thought of myself as a marrying
man. It sounds odd: I don't speak of it, for people
would consider it ridiculous. I can see how I came
to make such an ass of myself to-night. All summer
this one has been thrown on my care; I
watched her, and studied her, and grew to her, as
you might say."</p>
<p>"Yes; that's where I was wrong. It was my
fault," said the dwarf.</p>
<p>"How did you know I had such a weak spot?"
continued Tom. "Throw the blame on me, where
it belongs. All at once I came upon her sobbing
as if her heart would break,--I know all her drawbacks--
Oh, heavens! how a man's heart will
yearn!"</p>
<p>"Yes, how it will yearn!" breathed the dwarf,
covering his face with hands which had grown
almost gaunt.</p>
<p>"So I said, and did what I told you, and half
compromised her in your eyes and the eyes of the
other two."</p>
<p>When the dwarf had been silent a minute he
seemed to have collected his forces, and said,
"Tom, I hope you won't mind my saying I think
of her and not of you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly not.  What consideration do I
merit?"</p>
<p>"You are a good fellow, and I have liked you
well, and taxed your friendship more than I ought


<pb id="VAB9590-218" n="218"/>

to have done. But, Tom, I could willingly strangle
you where her happiness is involved. The
great question with me is, Does she love you?"</p>
<p>"No, she doesn't. Of course not."</p>
<p>"Tom, she has known you all her life. You
were, as she said, her idea of a gentleman. Besides,
you are a man to match with a beautiful,
perfectly-made woman. What am I? A twist of
nature, a man-monkey, whose most dignified gesture
is ridiculous. I have been struggling against
the tide. I have believed it possible for her to care
for me : I don't believe it any more. Why, her repugnance
overcame her so she ran from me, once!
Her affections-and they are strong in proportion
to the narrow scope they take--are bound around
this place and you. You must take her; and, by
God ! if you ever make her unhappy I will shoot
you with my own hands!"</p>
<p>"Old fellow, you can shoot me and welcome. I
couldn't feel much worse than I do. But exercise
a little common sense. One man doesn't marry
another man's wife in this country, no matter
how much he may have courted her," the captain
sneered down at himself.</p>
<p>"She isn't any more my wife than she is yours.
I gave her the protection of my name and guardianship,
and she's nothing but my ward. In these
days it won't be hard to cut the slim legal tie which
binds us together. You may remember I mentioned

<pb id="VAB9590-219" n="219"/>

some such possible emergency when I first spoke
about taking her. You can marry her and make
her happy. If any odium attaches to her, it will
be, like the rest of her drawbacks, her misfortune
and not her fault. Confound you! why didn't you
think of giving her a chance?"</p>
<p>"Why didn't I? I'm a pretty kind of a fellow
for a man to resign in favor of, ain't I? Now, you
listen to me:" Tom approached and sat on the
bed. "You're working yourself to a high pitch for
nothing."</p>
<p>"Are you going to say you wouldn't have her?"
Craque-o'-Doom's eyes narrowed themselves to
fierce gray slits.</p>
<p>"Have her? you don't want to make a fool of
yourself, asking me that? I tell you, she crept in
on me unawares. You ought to slap my face for
it, but I love her. A man can't say more than
that, if he's a man with red blood in his body.
What does a man generally want to do when such
a thing happens to him ? But she wouldn't have
me, even if all was fair and open. She was as cool
as a mermaid. She thinks I'm a good old fellow-
trustworthy in the main-and would make a creditable
relation ; and that's all she thinks about me."</p>
<p>"You held her hands ?" said Craque-o'-Doom.</p>
<p>"Yes, and she wondered that mine were cold
and trembling, and was as much moved as if I
had been my aunt Sally."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-220" n="220"/>

<p>"But she didn't run from you; she confided in
you."</p>
<p>"Yes, I happened to be handy when she was in
a troubled mood. Now, don't take this matter
with so much confounded seriousness: I have
been a fool, and have got to smart many a day
for my folly. She is an innocent child who has
been drawn into an absurd situation without realizing
it. That's all there is about it."</p>
<p>"Tom," said Craque-o'-Doom, still pursuing his
own train of thought, "come down to Swampscott
with us."</p>
<p>Captain Tom laughed, but looked at him sadly:
"I'm going to start for the Pacific coast as soon
as you folks are gone."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"For medicine. I've meant to go a long time,
and this furnishes the occasion."</p>
<p>"Will your aunt go?"</p>
<p>"If I can persuade her. I think she has some
relations in San Francisco,--a brother-in-law's
family. We've often talked of the trip, and there's
no time like the present."</p>
<p>"Tom, bless you, old fellow!" said Craque-o'-
Doom. After a space he added, "I owe you this
much, anyhow. If there's a turn in my favor
within six months, I'll let you know by telegraph;
if there isn't by the end of that time, we'll meet
somewhere and settle the thing."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-221" n="221"/>
                    
<p>"That's all nonsense!" said Tom. "Don't talk
so crazy, boy. You've changed since last year."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have. I can't stand this much longer.
It has been a hard mill. A lifetime of preparation
for a lonely middle and old age has been destroyed
in a few months. I had no idea this sort
of feeling could work on a man so."</p>
<p>"I'd better say good-night," said Captain Tom.</p>
<p>"Well, good-night."</p>
<p>The two men did an unpremeditated thing.
Opening their arms, they hugged one another for
one silent instant, and then parted, half shame-
faced.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="sc">HE</hi> party started next afternoon, and again
Tillie stood on the platform beside Captain Mills.
Her father had refused, with the stubbornness of
an unreasonable old man, to let her go with Tamsin
for even a month's stay beside the water.
Tillie took occasion this time to very scantily
commend the dwarf. "You're a pretty nice kind
of a feller," she said, looking into his face with un-
terrified eyes. They stood quite on a level when
he had his hat on.</p>
<p>"I thank my little sister for that," he replied,
with a bow,--which caused Tillie to put her hand
before her mouth and laugh and take some unseen
confidante into the joke: "Ho! he called me his
little sister!"</p>
<p>Tamsin stood on the back platform and exchanged
signals with the lank light child until
what had been Tillie became a mere speck beside
a toadstool station and then went out in the dazzle
of the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>The dwarf's party found but an uncanny coast
when they arrived at his summer cottage. There

<pb id="VAB9590-223" n="223"/>
                    
was no storm, but a sullen fit of rainy weather set
in, stinging the sea with perpetual javelins, the
handles of which barred distant views. The east
wind prevailed, and they had two dismal August
weeks, soaked with fog, very salt, wherein the
roar of the sea only tempted man to suicide. It
was too chilly to bathe; there were no chances to
make excursions; fires could not drive out the
dampness. A great many nice people in cottages
round about rolled themselves up in rugs and hibernated,
while others prepared to go back to town
a full month earlier than usual.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom tried a piano he had in the
house, but the strings were all rusted; it was
horribly out of tune.  Instead of seeking the
society of the ladies, he stayed a great deal by
himself, pressing and classifying sea-weeds which
his man brought him from the sand,--a tall servant,
who went and came under an umbrella and
looked as if life were not worth living when the
umbrella occasionally turned wrong side out.</p>
<p>Rhoda wrote letters to her husband in Chicago,
and was in a craze over house-furnishing. Tamsin
sat with her before the fire, holding a book, and
they had long woman-talks, which began and
ended nowhere and were like the foam left by the
out-crawling tide,--they only marked the hours.
"I never saw such weather," said Rhoda, "or
knew the fall to threaten so early. The papers

<pb id="VAB9590-224" n="224"/>

say it is just as bad inland, and clear out West.
We had better pick up and leave. Mr. Sutton is
moping himself to death. Don't you see he is?"</p>
<p>"He looks paler than he did last spring," said
Tamsin. She fixed her black eyes seriously on
the fire. " He studies a great deal. All the time
he is learning something new."</p>
<p>"His health may be failing," said Rhoda.</p>
<p>"Why, how can that be?" exclaimed Tamsin.
"He never has a doctor. He is not sick."</p>
<p>"He is not particularly well," said Rhoda sagely.
"Men have the instincts of wild creatures when
anything ails them: they mope by themselves and
'act injured.'"</p>
<p>There came a day on which the sun showed a
watery eye and the sea looked a shade lighter.</p>
<p>"Maybe we can go somewhere to-day without
getting soaked," exclaimed Tamsin.</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom handed her a letter from the
package the tall servant brought in: "And here's
a letter from Tillie, too."</p>
<p>It was Mary's hand, of course. Mary was
Tillie's amanuensis. Craque-o'-Doom examined
his mail, and Rhoda was tearing the wrappers
from hers. Neither of them observed her eyes
dilate or her free hand lift and clinch itself.
"Oh!" she cried, "oh!-oh!-oh!" each scream
becoming more piercing. "She is dead-- They
have buried her in the ground!" So, tottering

<pb id="VAB9590-225" n="225"/>
                    
toward the dwarf, Tamsin fell down with her arm
across his knees. She had not fainted. They got
her up, and she sat ghastly and shaking in a large
chair. Craque-o'-Doom rubbed her hands, while
Rhoda bathed her face. Her screams still rang
through the house, though they told her it could
not be true, and the man whose heart she pierced
talked wildly to her.</p>
<p>Tamsin was like a giantess in her grief. She
pushed her comforters aside and writhed about the
room, supported by Rhoda against her will, with
her hair streaming around her face. Craque-o'-
Doom huddled at the chimney-side, straightening
the letter out and trying to read it. He felt numb,
and so widely separated from her now that he
dared not offer her one word. Rhoda got her to
her own room, and was busy over her for a long
time. Finally, Craque-o'-Doom looked up, aware
that Rhoda stood on the hearth-rug, pale and
troubled in expression. "It must be true," said
he, indicating the paper he held. "What can I
do? I feel dazed."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's true. From what she has been repeating
over and over I know the contents of the
letter. It's come upon her in the cruellest way."</p>
<p>"Is she any better?"</p>
<p>"She's unconscious, and will be better. I have
her under the influence of chloral."</p>
<p>"I'd better telegraph to some responsible person

<pb id="VAB9590-226" n="226"/>

son in Barnet," said the dwarf. "Tom and his
aunt are gone. If they had been there it wouldn't
have come to her in this way."</p>
<p>"No, indeed," affirmed Rhoda.</p>
<p>"You see I can't shield her from a single
trouble."  His head dropped on his breast.
"She'll hate me. Sometimes I think it was for
Tillie--"</p>
<p>"Don't say it," entreated Rhoda, putting a hand
on his shoulder. " After you send this telegram,
I think you had better have treatment similar to
Tamsin's and go to bed."</p>
<p>"If you will take care of her," he said with
quick resolution, "I will go to Barnet myself, and
if they won't let me bring the body away, I may
pick up some kind of consolation for her."</p>
<p>"Don't you do it. Was there ever such a man! I
wish Mr. Burns were here, to make you be quiet."</p>
<p>"I don't want to be quiet. You'll let me know
if she falls ill, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but she won't be seriously sick: she's
strong. It's the effect of the shock."</p>
<p>"If I could have seen the letter first, and prepared her."</p>
<p>"Yes, if you could surround her by a medium
through which no pain could pass,--if you could
make an out-and-out goddess of her. Mr. Sutton,
Claude Melnottes are charming on the stage, but
in real life they are painful."</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-227" n="227"/>

<p>"Grotesque, you mean, in my shape. Well,
good friend, don't mind me."</p>
<p>He left the room, and Rhoda in her turn
picked up Mary Chenoworth's letter. It was
brief enough, written in a delicate, half-formed
hand, and frequently misspelled:</p>

<p>Tamsin woke in the night and sobbed with her
first conscious breath. A night-lamp was shaded
near her head. She heard the boom of the sea,
and her imagination threw up--like a mirage over
her trouble--a vision of schooners poised on the
water as if it were a wall hemming in the land.</p>
<p>Rhoda appeared beside her as soon as she made
a sound, changed the cloths on her head, and said,
"My dear, you must take another spoonful of this
liquid."</p>
<p>Tamsin took it and looked all about the room
with her heavy eyes.</p>
<p>"He's gone," said Rhoda.</p>
<p>The patient seemed to drag her eyes to her
nurse's face. "Where?"</p>
<p>"To Ohio. To do anything he can that will be

strong sleeping-mixture, "I wanted--"</p>

<p>I<hi>T</hi> was full two weeks afterward that the dwarf
sat at home before a library-table covered with
books and papers. IIe did indeed seem lost in
the square, stately room. There was hardly a stir
of life about the premises. From his windows he
could see the hills standing as companions to him
in that dear fellowship hills always extend toward
us, and a blue corner of the North River across
which a long tow of barges and flats was moving
up-stream.  The afternoon was nearly gone:
Craque-o'-Doom worked as if bent on accomplishing
a certain task in a limited time. His temples
were sunken: the luminous quality of his complexion
had never been so apparent. His feet
rested on a very high hassock under the table,
and perhaps, with his mind absorbed by the problems
which occupy higher grades of intellect, he
forgot during half an hour that he was not as
other men.</p>
<p>He had come directly home from Barnet instead
of going back to Tamsin, and asked no explanation
of himself for doing so. She was to enter

<pb id="VAB9590-230" n="230"/>

school the first week in September. Mrs. Burns
stayed on with her, and reported frequently to him,
encouraging him to think that time would rapidly
heal the grief of such a young creature.</p>
<p>From Tamsin he got no message at all. But he
had written her a long letter full of the minutest
items concerning Tillie. Old Mr. Chenoworth had
not allowed him to remove the body: lie had
therefore ornamented that plot in Barnet graveyard
with everything he could devise. He had
ordered a small monument, and drawn the design
himself,--the child's accordion, with a branch of
wild-brier thrown across it,--and he enclosed a
draft of it to Tamsin. He had even been womanish
enough to pick some clay from Tillie's hillock
before it was sodded and send that. All the kind
things the neighbors had to say about the child's
last days were retailed by him, and her mother's
account was minutely repeated, lie had nothing
to say, however, of the inconveniences and painful
curiosity he had had to encounter in that small
place, without a friend or acquaintance, while gathering
these consolations for her, or of the cruel
stupidity of her family, and the general opinion
that they had let the child die from ignorant neglect.
He did not tell her that her father had comfortably
reckoned "he hadn't no money to waste
in such tomfoolery," when asked why he did not
telegraph for Tamsin. Neither did he mention

<pb id="VAB9590-231" n="231"/>
                    
Sarah Jane's criticism of the accordion and brier
branch and her loud preference for a little lamb on
the monument, such as most well-to-do Barnet
families displayed on their children's mortuary tablets.
He spared her the news that Jess, perhaps
overcome by the family bereavement, had broken
bounds again and was out of prison on the dwarf's
bail, determined to go West when he got through
with his last difficulty, and find more scope or
something worse. But, on the other hand, he did
not forget Mary's tearful recital, and he beautified
her in her humble state. He had talked with
Mary in her own house, while her tow-headed
children peeped round the door-post at him and
dared one another to approach nearer. Never in
her life had she felt herself so appreciated or
touched the edge of a human soul that could so
widen the world for her.</p>
<p>The dwarf had agreed with Mrs. Burns that
Tamsin must go back to school as soon as possible:
her mind ought to be occupied.</p>
<p>But, if any of these things rose to the surface
of his thoughts, he pushed them under. Some
wagons rattled along the road, and he heard the
five-o'clock train from New York roaring at the
base of the hills. Through open windows came
in that sun-soaked smell of grass and shrubs which
seems to be their grateful offering for a fine day.
This was a very handsome, comfortable, dull old


<pb id="VAB9590-232" n="232"/>

place. Now a shutter cracked sharply,--it is
strange how many sympathetic noises there are in
wood,--as if uttering an exclamation of relief that
the sun no longer blistered it; and now the double
gates at the end of the avenue clicked, and the
gardener probably moved away through the grass
to his tool-house.</p>
<p>There were a great many neighbors bound to
the dwarf by old family ties, but, living by himself,
he had few visitors. It was with some amazement,
therefore, after being startled by these various
hints of outside life, that he looked up and saw a
woman coming into the room from the outer hall.
But, when the face became Tamsin's, the air thickened
before his eyes, and he did not speak a
word.</p>
<p>Tamsin approached the table. She was in black
clothes: her eyes looked sunken, yet the livid
spaces around them brought out their power the
more. She halted, then came on, resting her hand
on the table as she had done the night they first
met. And the dwarf looked at her without having
a word, until it seemed to him an eternity passed
between them. "I've come," said Tamsin. And
she still looked at him with that in her eyes
which made his pulses all seem beating in his
head.</p>
<p>"Yes," he finally uttered. "Sit down, my child.
You may take this chair." He pushed it back

<pb id="VAB9590-233" n="233"/>

from the table and held to the arms. "I'm dizzy,"
said the dwarf. "These papers have bothered
me." So he remained seated, and Tamsin stood
still, folding corners of his manuscript over and
over.</p>
<p>"Did you come alone?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Yes: Mrs. Burns has gone home. She left me
at school."</p>
<p>"And how did you get here from the station?"</p>
<p>"I asked the way and walked."</p>
<p>"Sit down; sit down here." The dwarf drew
out the hassock, and Tamsin sat down, literally at
his feet.</p>
<p>He unfastened her hat and wrap and laid them
on the table and began taking off her gloves:
"Crape from head to foot. How unhappy my
little one is! So many times I have thought what
your coming to this house would be; and you
come alone, without any glad welcome, to the
man who has failed to make you happy! You got
the letter and the little box?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else on earth that I can do?"</p>
<p>"Yes," burst passionately from her lips: "yes,
there is."</p>
<p>"Tell me what."</p>
<p>The young creature bent her head forward and
rested it on the arm of his chair. She looked very
young and dependent. "I can't," she said.</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-234" n="234"/>

<p>Craque-o'-Doom  lifted her face up, saying
sternly, "You must!"</p>
<p>Tamsin began to cry. She was so weak that
her sobs became hysterical cries, and the dwarf
was in a frenzy. He reached for his table-bell:
"You must have something. They ought to bring
you some food."</p>
<p>"I don't want it. I can't--can't--can't stand
this!" With a shaking hand he smoothed her
hair back from her be rning forehead and rested
her against his arm until she grew quieter. Gradually
her head dropped backward and she fixed her
eyes on his: "Before Tillie died I could stand it.
She loved me so much, and I had so many things
to learn. Now I can't stand it. You have been
better than an angel to me. You have done everything
kind."</p>
<p>"Speak out," said Craque-o'-Doom, his ears
ringing with strange noises.</p>
<p>"I can't! I never could talk. But--" She
pressed her palms together in supplication.</p>
<p>"Do you mean," said the dwarf slowly, seeming
to expand while he spoke, "that you want to stay
here with me?"</p>
<p>Her face steeped itself in color.</p>
<p>"Oh, Tamsin! What makes you tremble, little
one?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," she whispered piteously, reach-
ing her hands toward his shoulders; "<hi rend="i">do you?</hi>"</p>

<pb id="VAB9590-235" n="235"/>

<p>For the first time in his life he held his wife
against his face and breast. The throbbing of her
pulses talked to him. They told him she was
young and proud and full of virgin timidity; but
they also told him another secret, which never let
him doubt his possession of her again. "Is it
possible," he said, breaking the silence of the room,
"that henceforward this lonesome house will be
full of you? Is it possible that in spite of my
deformity you love me?"</p>
<p>"You ought to know," said Tamsin. "Didn't
I marry you? It was from the very first. I never
cared for anybody but Tillie before.  But you
wanted me just to improve myself. And I acted
so foolish about things." She dropped brief sentence
after sentence, sometimes catching her voice
in her throat. A listener two yards away could
not have distinguished the words. "When I carried
that coffee into your room, you seemed different
from all the people I ever dreamed of. Sometimes
I have been very mad and very hurt. You
would go off other places where you could not see
me. Then I would act as if I did not care. What
was I, compared to a man like you ? I was a poor
miserable girl. If I had been related to the Millses
I shouldn't have felt so badly. You were better
to father's than I ever was. You aren't like I am.
I'll try to be better. I'll try for Tillie's sake. Tillie
knew. I told her in her ear one night when I was

<pb id="VAB9590-236" n="236"/>
                    
crying. The little dear hugged me. Once Mrs.
Burns was saying it was such a good match for
me. She made me feel sick. I began to tell her
--but I couldn't."</p>
<p>The dwarf kept smoothing her head with a
gloating leonine touch. He scarcely noticed that
he was doing so. His eyes brooded over her with
that expression of blessing which we see in the
eyes of pictured saints. " But isn't my deformity
ever repulsive to you, my darling?"</p>
<p>"No; I don't think about that."</p>
<p>"Such excuses for legs, that lower me in the
world almost among creeping things."</p>
<p>Tamsin looked indignant. "You seem real
tall," she said.</p>
<p>"Do I seem tall to you ? Haven't you felt like
laughing at me when I waddled about, looking
as if my body had been telescoped in a railroad
accident, for instance? You can't enjoy gazing
down a couple of feet or so on your husband and
overhearing remarks which may be made at any
time."</p>
<p>"I don't care what they say," his wife exclaimed
in a candid gush of words. "It's because they want
you themselves and can't get you, or don't know
how to appreciate a man. I think you're beautiful!"</p>
<p>Craque-o'-Doom laughed so heartily and so
long that the house echoed in astonishment.

<pb id="VAB9590-237" n="237"/>

"Poor deluded child!" said he, but immediately
afterward hid his face in her hair and shook with
a heart-quaking sob. Having got the better of
that, he raised his head and laughed again. "Before
we ring the bell and order a great dinner and
make an occasion of my wife's coming home, I
must send the news to Tom."</p>
<p>"What for?" inquired Tamsin.</p>
<p>"Because I agreed to telegraph the event to
him. And I didn't think it would be so soon."
His eye searched the littered table for a despatch-
blank. Tamsin handed him the required slip, pen
and ink, and his tablets. With his hand poised
to write, he exclaimed, looking down the oval
of her cheek, "Your school! I had forgotten
that."</p>
<p>"Can't I go on here?"</p>
<p>"Certainly you can. Under my own eye."</p>
<p>The despatch said,--</p>

<p>"'There are some things in the narrative which will sure to
appear strange, or perhaps entirely incomprehensible to the reader;
but they cannot appear more so to him than they did to the author at

'Omoo.' While it is justly said of 'Typee' that the book is as valuable
ethnologically as it is interesting to the lover of the strange and

'Omoo.' The typography, the illustrations, the paper, and the

<p><hi rend="b">"T</hi><hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> is the first issue in paper covers of this valuable book.
'White Jacket; Or, Life in a Man-Of-War' is by many considered
to be Herman Melville's best book. In 1843 this delightfully
interesting author shipped as ordinary seaman on board a
United States frigate, then lying in a harbor of the Pacific Ocean.
After remaining in this frigate for more than a year, he was discharged
frcm the service upon the vessel arriving home. His
man-ot-war experiences and observations are incorporated in the
present volume. His pictures of life in the forecastle, and his
description of what takes place in the various sections of a man-of-war
are not only instructive, but are as captivating as they are true.
As one would expect, withal the discipline and essential routine of
the service, the book teems with startling incidents and accidents,
boils over with fun, and presents, in its 374 beautifully printed
pages facts for philosophers, 'pointers' for ethologists, and fascinating
reading for everybody."</p>

<p>"The habits, life history, and sensational death of the great white
whale, whose skeleton was found to measure seventy.two feet, are
told in an absorbing manner in this excellent volume, whose literary
merits are of the highest order. One of the many interesting features
of the book is the faithful representation it affords of seafaring
men of different nationalities. In one instance we find, working
together in the same night watch, sailors from France, Spain, Denmark,
England, China, Iceland--and Long Island. Their sea chants
and ship parlance are given in English and afford the reader a study
in rhetoric.</p>
<p>"The book is printed in large type, on excellent paper, and is
enjoyable, with equal relish, by both old and young readers. Its
interest is increased by its excellent full page illustrations. At the
close of the book are several pages of extracts from the writings of

<p><hi rend="b">"T</hi><hi rend="sc">HIS</hi> new, paper-covered edition of 'Christine' will be
appreciated everywhere by the many readers of Adeline Sergeant's
books. Let the reader follow (in the book) the romance
of the volume, and he will be rewarded. Let us point the way--the
quoted phrases are titles of some of the consecutive chapters:
'Uncle Tom' will introduce him to 'Christine,' next the reader will
pass through 'the shadow of a dream' and arrive at 'Col. Lingard's
house' listen to 'the Colonel's plans,' and discover that some one is
being 'spied upon.' Next he will meet 'Miss Daisy Touchwood,'
one of the prominent characters of the book. 'Mr. Hoskins remonstrates,'
but 'a strange welcome' is afforded. 'New friends' next
appear, and a 'proposal of marriage' is made 'in the moonlight.'
Near by, 'only next door' 'a revelation' 'at midnight,' is made.
After 'missing a train,' the reader is startled by a 'great surprise,'
and begins to contemplate 'the return journey.' Just then 'an
accusation' leads to 'a great temptation,' but 'a loyal heart,' distinguishes
between 'light and darkness.' 'Mr. Hoskins to the
rescue' precedes the exacting of a 'promise me,' and 'deliver us
from evil' is the prayer that breaks in upon 'the memory of the
just' at the end. It will repay the reader to fill in between the
lines by reading the novel."</p>

advocated by the author, who deals somre trenchant blows in various
directions among the 'upper ten.' Society girls, as such, also come
in for their share of attention by way of sundry lessons reflecting
on their behavior. The story unfolds ino little romance, and must
leave its impression on the reader. The book is beautifully printed
in large clear type and contains twelve full-page half-tone engravings."</p>

<p><hi rend="b">"T</hi><hi rend="sc">HOSE</hi> who have not read Grant Allen's 'Duchess of
Powysland,' of which a paper covered edition is now issued,

the curious case of the Duchess affords a remarkably strong illustration
of the possibilities and probabilities as regards the real
facts in the case of Mrs. Florence Maybrick, who remains imprisoned
there; while many thousands of Americans believe her
positively innocent of the charge of murder for which she suffers.
Nor does the story reflect favorably upon the continued refusal of
the English officials either to make or receive further reports
upon, or, in any way, or upon any grounds whatever, entertain
new evidence in the case. The trials of the American heiress who
marries the English Duke for his title, affords both warning to the
adventuresome, and encouragement to the more prudent and
patriotic among our daughters. The phase of hereditary insanity
which manifests itself in every member of a family, and that in
only one characteristic strait, namely, suicide, is strange and
affords an incentive to profitable thought and study.</p>

heiress--ward though only in name--to two old titled guardians, one of
whom is a source of worry to the young lady. This guardian resorts to
all sorts of manœuvres to keep the heroine in check and above all to
prevent her from marrying, as he fears she will do, beneath her. But the
young lady has a will of her own, and when she meets her fate, sets everyone
at defiance in gratifying her own taste and predilection in a lover.
The lover is an artist, but presumably of no family, and the heroine has
herself a rooted dislike of a mésalliance, which causes her to play fast
and loose with her own feelings. The latter, however, happily assert themselves,
and in the proper direction, and the story closes delightfully, the
artist turning out to be of good birth, and the equal socially of the
heroine he marries."</p>
