                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent(1)" for one tab stop, "indent(2)" for two tab stops, etc.
                    All split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f"
                    for the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
