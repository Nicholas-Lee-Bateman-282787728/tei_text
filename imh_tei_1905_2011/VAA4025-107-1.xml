                              they found a way to affirm their separateness and sense of piety even
                              as they began utilizing new mechanisms of political and legal power

                              Mennonites embraced such iconoclastic beliefs as believer&apos;s
                              baptism, the separation of church and state, personal nonviolence, a
                              rejection of church hierarchy, and the refusal to take an oath.<hi

                              expressions of their faith made Mennonites social outsiders throughout
                              much of Europe. Without a formal church hierarchy, lay leaders usually
                              determined individual congregations&apos; relationships to the state.
                              They based these decisions upon a mixture of motivations ranging from
                              pragmatism to strict religious devotion. Some chose death,
                              persecution, or banishment when confronted with official intolerance
                              and unsympathetic neighbors; others chose voluntary migration,
                              adaptation of their beliefs, or a complete acceptance of the social

                        <p>Threatened by those in power during the sixteenth and seventeenth
                              centuries, European Mennonites sought to be &quot;Die Stillen im
                              Lande&quot; (the quiet in the land) throughout the eighteenth and
                              nineteenth centuries. They tended to their own communities and stayed
                              away from urban power centers. This self-imposed and externally
                              enforced separation aided in the development of a &quot;dual
                              kingdom&quot; or &quot;two kingdom&quot; theology which specifies that
                              the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; (the church) is called out from the
                              &quot;kingdom of earth&quot; (society). Mennonite historian James
                              Juhnke notes that Mennonite communities exhibited &quot;a decisive
                              dualism of church and world, reluctance or refusal to become involved
                              in public life, and a rejection of worldly pride accompanied by a

                              <item><hi rend="sup">4</hi>Throughout much of post-Reformation Europe,
                                    Anabaptists were viewed as socially disruptive, if not
                                    seditious. The refusal of baptism within the state church was a
                                    rejection of the entire social order. At a time when membership
                                    in the church meant membership in society, remaining unbaptized
                                    was tantamount to anarchy. Although Mennonites accepted the
                                    government as being ordained by God to maintain authority in a
                                    &quot;fallen&quot; world, they also believed that they were not
                                    of this world and that their first allegiance was to God rather
                                    than the state. Furthermore, Mennonites rejected a formal church
                                    hierarchy due to its association with state-sponsored churches
                                    and because they felt it placed an artificial barrier between
                                    God and the believer. Concerning oath taking, Mennonites
                                    believed in a literal interpretation of the New Testament

                              immigrants chose to leave Europe for many reasons, among them the
                              turmoil caused by the Napoleonic wars, a series of poor harvests, and
                              the threat of mandatory military service. Like other German-speaking
                              immigrants, especially those with strong church affiliations,
                              Mennonites often came by way of chain migration. After establishing

                        <p>German-speaking immigrants often arrived with only marginal assets, and
                              their new circumstances compelled them to develop original techniques

                              other settlers on the American frontier, they struggled to recreate

                              improve it. This struggle often led to new forms of sociability and a
                              blending of heritages and inventions as they walked the path between
                              the known and the unknown. Mennonites who came to the United States
                              adopted new social and religious practices, such as public education

                              and suggested that the track run through their properties. With the

                        <p>During the late nineteenth century, the temperance movement took hold as

                              the 1830s to the 1930s no debate at the local level agitated this
                              country more, year in and year out, than the question of controlling
                                    alcohol.&quot;<hi rend="sup">26</hi> The issue divided society
                              along many lines, including those between Protestants and Catholics,

                              rural dwellers. As a result, the temperance movement inspired the
                              creation of many religious and secular organizations that linked
                              alcohol consumption to moral and economic problems and the harmful

                              relationship with alcohol started to change as the result of larger
                              trends in nineteenth-century religious life that connected temperance
                              to Christian virtue. To a people who prided themselves on their piety,
                              self-restraint, and thrift, abstinence from alcohol became a
                              functional as well as a moral commitment. Writing about the Russian

                              temperancene had special appeal as a religious and moral crusade which
                              involved the Mennonite conception of their own social status.
                              Mennonites were not afraid to differ from society, but to reject the
                              temperance movement would have been to contradict their belief in
                              their own moral superiority.&quot;<hi rend="sup">33</hi></p>
                        <p>Mennonites expressed their feelings on temperance through church
                              publications that were distributed at the conference level. In the
                              late nineteenth century, the two largest conferences in North America
                              were the General Conference Mennonites (GC) and the (old) Mennonite
                              Church (MC). GC Mennonites emphasized the autonomy of the local
                              congregation and, as a result, some of their churches tended to be
                              more progressive on social and political issues. MC churches were more
                              hierarchical in their organization and more conservative in their
                                    practices.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Two of the largest

                              respectively. Both stressed the importance of temperance for personal
                              morality and social improvement, yet they often proved inconclusive in
                              their assessment of the role that Mennonites should play in the

                        <p>Most of these articles were sentimental warnings about the potential
                              evils of alcohol consumption and did not necessarily call on readers
                              to take legal or political action against the liquor interest.
                              Political activism remained a contentious issue for Mennonites into
                              the twentieth century, and <hi rend="i">The Mennonite</hi> was
                              probably unwilling to take a strong position due to the GC emphasis on
                              congregational autonomy. In 1903, the publication ran a story on a
                              symposium of Mennonite leaders titled &quot;The Proper Attitude of
                              Mennonites Toward Government.&quot; Two members of the five-man panel
                              agreed that voting was the &quot;bounded duty&quot; of all Mennonites;
                              one considered it right when &quot;corruption in politics can thereby
                              be removed&quot;; while the remaining two advised against voting since
                              it might violate precepts of swearing oaths and nonresistance. The
                              editor, for his part, judiciously staked out a middle path, writing
                              that &quot;[t]hose who do not believe in voting are, to say the least,
                              just as scriptural as those who vote.&quot;<hi rend="sup">37</hi></p>

                              Many did not agree with Coffman&apos;s line of reasoning, as evidenced
                              by letters published in the <hi rend="i">Herald</hi>. For some,
                              temperance was either a personal or communal choice and had few
                              political implications.</p>
                        <p>Articles and letters in both <hi rend="i">The Mennonite</hi> and the <hi
                                    rend="i">Herald of Truth</hi> indicated a consensus that
                              personal abstinence was the Christian ideal, while opinions were split
                              on the issue of political participation in the temperance movement.
                              While Coffman&apos;s editorializing resonated with many of his
                              readers, they did not necessarily apply their convictions toward
                              political activism. For some Mennonite farmers, their rural locations
                              may have acted as a natural barrier to civic participation; other
                              congregants may not have perceived saloons as a threat to their moral
                              universe. Those who were politically minded had a host of acceptable
                              choices available to them as to how they might engage the issue. Since
                              the GC emphasized local autonomy, town congregations had the latitude
                              to participate in social and political initiatives drawing them closer

                              Mennonites were on the leading edge of a twentieth-century development
                              that witnessed the denomination linking personal abstinence to
                              political participation.</p>
                        <p>At its core, the Mennonite decision to embrace temperance entailed
                              questions about which kingdom they should try to improve, and whether
                              or not it was possible to improve both. As we shall see, the

                              saw temperance as a question not only of personal morality, but also
                              of the propriety of working to improve society through secular means.
                              The attitudes of this community represent a crystallization of how
                              some people of this faith tried to rectify their dual kingdom theology
                              with political participation.</p>

                        <p>Once in office, the Mennonite civic leaders quickly addressed the matter
                              of &quot;intoxicating liquors&quot; with a three-page ordinance
                              covering the legal age at which one could sell &quot;spirituous,
                              vinous, and malt liquors&quot; and the quantities in which alcohol
                              could be sold. The ordinance also implemented a steep yearly fee of
                              $100 per license.<hi rend="sup">60</hi> Unfortunately for the CTSB,
                              gaining power was easier than maintaining it. In the following
                              election, pro-temperance Mennonites took the third district, but lost
                              the first by a single vote and the second by three.<hi rend="sup"
                                    >61</hi></p>
                        <p>Two years later, the town trustees once again passed a liquor ordinance.
                              This new law was perhaps a compromise between pro-alcohol and
                              temperance forces, in that it maintained the $100-per-year license fee
                              for selling liquor and a $50 fee for selling wine and beer, but also
                              allowed for the immediate issue of liquor licenses.<hi rend="sup"
                                    >62</hi> (Previous applicants had had to pay the fee one year
                              before they were issued a license.) Although the buy-in cost was
                              maintained, the law was a win for applicants seeking to begin making
                              money from their new ventures.</p>
                        <p>Compounding the setback of having to negotiate with the town&apos;s
                              liquor interest instead of passing ordinances by fiat, CTSB members
                              shared a growing suspicion that the county government was ambivalent
                              about their temperance crusade. &quot;No matter how often we filed
                              complaints against the liquor sellers,&quot; Rohrer noted, &quot;and
                              no matter how overwhelming and conclusive the evidence would be, it
                              was an utter impossibility at that time to get a conviction in any

                              movement.</p>
                        <p>Rohrer stated that the CTSB continued to work throughout the 1890s
                              &quot;as a leaven in the community and gradually changed the public
                              sentiment in favor of temperance and against saloons, so that by ten
                              years later the number of saloons decreased to three while the
                              population more than doubled.&quot;<hi rend="sup">66</hi> However, the
                              decade also saw a decline in the number of CTSB members running for
                              trustee positions in the town. Unable to create or maintain harsh laws

                              second-generation Mennonite immigrants, who had prospered in
                              construction, banking, and commerce, believed themselves to be a part
                              of an established middle class. It is reasonable to assume that many

                              of their parents, many of whom had kept wine or hard cider in their
                              homes. In this regard, the CTSB mirrored the class aspects of the
                              national temperance movement, which was largely composed of
                              Protestant, middle-class, and native-born individuals who were
                              generally distrustful of immigrants and the poor.</p>

                              pro-temperance Republican James Franklin Hanly for state governor,
                              municipal and county governments increasingly found their authority

                                          signatures was also important, since many Mennonites lived

                              was given a key to a building where a large supply of liquor was kept.
                              Dues were collected on a regular basis in order to buy more liquor.

                              began biking the ten miles to Decatur on a daily basis to confront the
                              commissioners with a remonstrance even before a new license could be

                              at the court house, and as the Decatur papers by that time began to
                              make fun of me and ridiculed me and roasted me, I felt somewhat

                              a much more serious concern. On the night after his third trip to
                              Decatur, someone cut a hole in one of his home&apos;s downstairs
                              window screens and slipped a stick of dynamite through it. The
                              explosion tore open the floor and ceiling, causing his wife Margret to
                              be thrown &quot;from the bed to the middle of the room.&quot; Minutes
                              later, a second stick of dynamite blew up the front porch. It was

                              to investigate the first explosion. Although the attack resulted in no

                              a central component of their religious identity. To end the fight or
                              compromise their position in any way would have constituted a betrayal
                              of their sense of piety and moral certitude. Thus, the dynamiting of

                              or as a reminder of their fundamental separation from worldly society,
                              but rather as a test of their religious convictions. Responding to the

                              nothing came of the investigation, Rohrer&apos;s decision to bring in
                              Pinkerton—an agency known for its vigilante law enforcement—shows just
                              how far the CTSB was willing to take the law into its own hands for
                              the purposes of moral victory, and raises important questions about
                              the group&apos;s commitment to nonviolence. Using every method of
                              influence at their command, Rohrer and the CTSB heightened their
                              offensive tactics against their opponents and maintained a strict

                        <p>Shortly after the dynamiting episode, Rohrer met with the three saloon
                              owners in what he referred to as &quot;a council of war.&quot;<hi
                                    rend="sup">91</hi> Accompanied by the county sheriff, Rohrer
                              once again demanded that the saloons close their doors. Brandishing
                              accounts of thirty-three violations of the remonstrance compiled over
                              the summer months of 1903, Rohrer threatened to haul them in front of
                              a grand jury if they did not immediately capitulate. In an attempt to
                              strike a compromise, the saloon owners suggested that the CTSB buy
                              them out. The society convened a special meeting at the Mennonite
                              Church to deliberate on the saloon owners&apos; proposal.
                              Understanding that their decision was of much larger than local
                              concern and could potentially have national implications, the CTSB
                              reasoned that to compromise would set a negative precedent for the
                              temperance movement; respect for the law was more important than
                              reconciliation. Accordingly, the CTSB decided that the most principled
                              course of action was to take the saloons to court.<hi rend="sup"
                                    >92</hi> Chastising the group for its decision, <hi rend="i">The
                                    Democrat</hi> recommended that they use their $10,500 war chest
                              to pay saloon owners to shut down their operations: &quot;The church
                              and the christian spirit is supposed to be behind this reform
                              enterprise, and they should now demonstrate a fraternalism, and show
                              the solidity of their christianity.&quot;<hi rend="sup">93</hi></p>
                        <p>The lawsuit&apos;s outcome was distressing for the CTSB. Of the thirty-
                              three reported violations, the grand jury handed down only six
                              indictments and a minimum fine was imposed on each saloonkeeper.
                              Despite this setback, the group&apos;s legal struggle continued and
                              finally resulted in the subpoena of over sixty suspected patrons of
                              the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2031071" reg="Berne"

                              several of these men visited Rohrer in his office to verbally assault
                              him. Louis Sprunger took this abuse a step further and accosted Rohrer
                              in the post office, knocking him to the floor. <hi rend="i">The

                              might,&quot; while Salome Luginbill &quot;rushed up in front of him

                              Rohrer&apos;s office. According to Rohrer, Bagley &quot;grabbed me
                              around the waist, jerked me off my stool and knocked me on the
                              floor.&quot; Along with Bagley, a mob of other saloon patrons
                              assembled outside the door with plans to beat him up and drive him out
                              of town. Fortunately for Rohrer, the town marshal appeared and ordered
                              the men out. After dispersing the crowd, the marshal advised Rohrer to

                              in the highest elected position in state government and solidified the
                              temperance movement&apos;s influence at that level. Furthermore, the
                              passage of the Moore Amendment widened the power of the Nicholson Law
                              to include the option of filing blanket (rather than individual)
                              remonstrances in a given city or township. Heartened by these
                              developments, Rohrer and the CTSB attempted to repeat the actions of
                              twenty years ago and install pro-temperance men on the town council.
                              At the state level, the Mennonites of <placeName><settlement

                                          >Berne</settlement></placeName> had a choice between two
                              different anti-alcohol platforms: the Republican Party or the
                              Prohibition Party. While the latter might appear to have been the
                              obvious choice for a community interested in combating saloons, the
                              Prohibitionists also supported women&apos;s suffrage, which was
                              unacceptable for the <placeName><settlement type="city"

                                          reasons: 1) While it is clear that Mennonites were
                                          involving in local elections, is not clear to what degree
                                          they voted in county or state elections. 2) Since the CTSB
                                          was affiliated with the bipartisan Anti-Saloon League,
                                          which supported any candidate who supported temperance, it
                                          is possible pro-temperance individuals could vote a split
                                          ticket. 3) It is possible that all of

                                          position on temperance. Nevertheless, I employed the
                                          voting records for the 1904 election because the Hanly-led
                                          Republican ticket was so strongly in favor of prohibition

                              directly to Governor Hanly. The owners were once again called into
                              court and advised to plead guilty to two cases of operating without a
                              license. If they consented to these charges, the court guaranteed that
                              all remaining charges would be dropped. After the owners pleaded
                              guilty, the judge required each to pay $100 and serve thirty days in

                              of political organizations and parties. From this time on, it would be
                              difficult to make the claim that one could not have both a Mennonite

                              toward embracing temperance as both a moral and political issue across

                        <p>Mennonite political involvement was also aided by the democratic process
                              itself. No longer subjects of a prince or king, congregants joined a
                              process which encouraged popular involvement in politics and
                              grassroots reform. Like other pietistic groups that used their faith
                              to facilitate political participation, the Mennonites of

                              enemies, allowed them to feel a sense of continuity between their Old

                              These Mennonites were longer passive martyrs dying for their faith at

                        <p>In 1907, Hoosier cartoonist John T. McCutcheon created his famous
                              &quot;Injun Summer&quot; fable for the <hi rend="i">Chicago
                                    Tribune</hi>. The <hi rend="i">Tribune</hi> continued to reprint
                              the popular piece every fall until 1992, when the paper withdrew it
                              because of readers&apos; growing discomfort with its portrayal of
                              Native Americans. The two-panel cartoon, with accompanying text,
                              depicts an old man and a little boy sitting in front of a cornfield,
                              filled with harvested shocks, as darkness falls. The old man spins a
                              yarn in which the field turns into a dancing ground for the
                              &quot;sperrits&quot; of long-departed Indians. According to the old
                              man, the Indians &quot;all went away and died, so they ain&apos;t no
                              more left.&quot;<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                        <p>The Indians had not died out and not all of them went away. They were,
                              however, largely absent from the land, with those who remained
                              marginalized and apparently out of sight to McCutcheon. The cartoonist

                                          mostly in deerskins. Marie was the Ottawa wife of a French

                              desired this land, the new federal government looked to it as a source
                              of revenue. A Native confederacy fought tenaciously in defense of the
                              land, inflicting a humiliating defeat on Arthur St. Clair&apos;s army
                              on the western edge of the Ohio Territory in 1791. The first military
                              buildup in U.S. history, Anthony Wayne&apos;s 1794 victory at Fallen
                              Timbers, and waning British support for their native allies led to the
                              signing of the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. Twelve Indian tribes,
                              including the Potawatomi and Miami, ceded the majority of the present
                              state of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio"

                              created the original nucleus of the public domain in the Old
                              Northwest. The federal government obtained additional cessions in the
                              first decade of the nineteenth century as the administrations of
                              Thomas Jefferson and James Madison committed to obtaining more land
                              for settlement. <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                              Governor William Henry Harrison oversaw most of these cessions. His
                              transactions, intended to extend the Greenville boundary, culminated
                              in the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, which added 2.8 million acres in

                              considerable support from tribes in northern <placeName><region

                        <p>With the acquisition of Indian land came the question of what to do with
                              the Indians. Jefferson emphasized the goal of &quot;civilizing&quot;
                              the Indians-turning them into Christian farmers who would use animal
                              power and male, not female, labor in the fields. This transformation,
                              he hoped, would free up &quot;excess&quot; land for white settlement.
                              The Louisiana Purchase opened the further possibility of moving
                              Indians west of the <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi</geogName> onto the excess lands of other Native

                              resistance to further cessions after 1809. After Tecumseh&apos;s death
                              in 1813, his movement fell apart, and any real possibility of British
                              support for Indian resistance ended shortly after the war. The outcome
                              of the war for Indians in the Midwest was, in the words of historian
                              Lucy Eldersveld Murphy, &quot;loss of land, status, wealth, and
                              power.&quot; Armed resistance was no longer an effective strategy for
                              native peoples fighting their dispossession. As the government

                        <p>As early as the Treaty of Greenville, Native people had begun to receive
                              annuities in cash and goods from the federal government, which rose as
                              they sold more land. These payments became increasingly vital to the
                              Native economy, providing needed income for exchange with white
                              traders. Treaties often included provisions designed to further the
                              civilizing mission; more commonly, a significant portion of money paid
                              for land was earmarked to reimburse traders&apos; claims for debts for
                              goods bought on credit. The fur trade persisted, although under stress
                              from decreasing animal populations. European demand for raccoon skins
                              increased in the 1830s, and areas like the Kankakee marsh continued to
                              supply furs. Indian traders, however, found a steadier source of
                              income in treaty money and schemed to get their hands on it. With
                              their considerable influence among Indians, they played an important
                              role in negotiations.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>

                              government took charge of millions of acres in the public domain. The
                              1796 Land Act established the office of Surveyor-General and provided
                              for the sale of land at public auction for a minimum price of $2 an
                              acre. Originally, the smallest tract available for purchase was one
                              section (640 acres), which meant that small farmers would need the
                              huge sum of $1,280 for purchase. An 1800 act allowed the sale of
                              half-sections and set up credit terms for payment. It also set up the

                              years later. By 1812, eighteen land offices distributed former Native
                              holdings, and Congress had created the General Land Office (GLO)
                              within the Treasury Department headed by the Commissioner of Public
                                    Lands.<hi rend="sup">10</hi></p>
                        <p>After the War of 1812, the government surveyed and sold large tracts of
                              land, but the panic and depression of 1819 (fueled in part by land
                              speculation) left the GLO with a great deal of paper money of little
                              value, as well as with huge defaults on amounts owed on credit. The
                              1820 Land Act, created in response to the crisis, eliminated credit
                              but reduced the minimum land price to $1.25 an acre. Additionally, the
                              minimum purchase was reduced first to eighty acres and later to forty.

                              faced an assault on their remaining lands. They were not nomadic
                              hunters, as those who sought to justify their dispossession often
                              portrayed them. Indians grew corn and other crops, and their summer
                              economy in permanent villages centered on this cultivation; by the
                              early 1800s, they had also acquired horses and other livestock. Indian
                              women were the cultivators-using only hand tools, which limited
                              productivity-but removal advocates such as Lewis Cass ignored the
                              female economic role. At the same time, the economies of Native
                              peoples were increasingly oriented to trade with whites and to the
                              world economy. Trade brought to them firearms and ammunition, metal
                              utensils, and cloth, along with less utilitarian items like tea,
                              jewelry, and alcohol (which had a notoriously debilitating effect on
                              Indian society). Native traders were tied to the world market, as
                              eastern firms like the American Fur Company and Suydam &amp; Sage sold
                              furs to a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7011781" reg="London">London</settlement></placeName> broker who marketed them in Europe.<hi rend="sup"

                              settlement than the Potawatomi. They had sold most of their territory
                              in 1818, but much of their remaining land and many of their villages
                              were located along the Wabash, in the path of the projected Wabash and
                              Erie Canal. At the same time, they had a smart, acculturated leader in
                              Jean-Baptiste Richardville. Son of a Frenchman and a Miami woman who
                              were both involved in the fur trade, Richardville was in his sixties
                              at this time. He had been a young village leader during the Northwest
                              Confederacy; the American attacks in the War of 1812 had forced him
                              over to the British side. Richardville came to the fore as the central

                        <p>Native societies did not perceive land in the same manner as the
                              developing American capitalist society that was pushing them aside. In
                              traditional Native society, land was not something that could be
                              bought or sold; however, decades of Euro-American influence challenged
                              and modified those views. During the period of armed resistance to
                              U.S. expansion, the Northwest Confederacy had promoted a view of land
                              as intertribal property belonging to all Indians. Mohawk leader Joseph
                              Brant had been a proponent of this view, and Tecumseh revived the 
                              concept in his efforts to unite against white expansion. From 1795 to the
                              1830s, tribes ceded their lands even as individuals and small family
                              groups—often of mixed ancestry—received a few sections of land. Still,
                              Indian societies did not fully incorporate the concept of land as
                              individual property, as a commodity and a source of profit.<hi

                        <p>Cass initially received a negative response. Aubenaubee, a leader at the
                              1812 siege of Fort Wayne, acted as the primary speaker for the
                              Potawatomi. In response to Cass, he denied any desire on his
                              people&apos;s part to sell any of their lands. Le Gros of the Miami
                              expanded on Aubenaubee&apos;s rejection: <quote rend="blockquote">It
                                    is yourselves destroying us, for you make the spirituous liquor.

                                    game there, but the Great Spirit has made and put men there, who
                                    have a right to that game, and it is not ours.</quote> Cass and
                              Governor Ray responded with threats and sarcasm, arguing that the
                              government could simply have taken Indian land after the war. Cass
                              credited Indian prosperity entirely to annuities being received for
                              earlier cessions.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>
                        <p>Proponents of removal were motivated by the drive for internal
                              improvements. Men like Tipton and Ray were aware that improved

                              economic development, and the treaty with the Potawatomi directly
                              furthered those goals. As a direct result of the signing, Congress

                              cessions in 1828 and 1832. These reservations reduced the amount of
                              land ceded, and continued a Miami presence in the area, but they also
                              chopped up tribal land into discontinuous pieces. Despite their

                        <p>In their evaluation of the 1826 treaty, Cass and his fellow commissioners
                              stated that removal could be accomplished, but would have to wait
                              until &quot;[t]ime, the destruction of game, and the approximation of
                              our settlements&quot; forced the Indians to capitulate. They also
                              believed that the isolation of small groups on reservations would help

                        <p>Although the earlier James Monroe and John Quincy Adams administrations
                              had promoted Indian removal, it became a national priority with the
                              presidency of Andrew Jackson. In December 1829, Jackson urged Congress
                              to pass a general policy of removal. He claimed removal was in the
                              Indians&apos; own best interests and presented it as an aid to the
                              process of &quot;civilization.&quot; Theoretically, emigration to the
                              West was to be voluntary. The following month, Cass—who shortly
                              thereafter supervised Indian policy nationally as Jackson&apos;s
                              secretary of war—published <hi rend="i">Considerations on the Present
                                    State of the Indians, and Their Removal to the West of the
                                    Mississippi</hi>. In justifying removal, Cass presented Indians
                              as steadily degenerating, incapable of reform in their current
                              locations, and without rights to sovereignty. Cass functioned as the
                              federal government&apos;s ideological point man; McCoy was another key
                              proponent of removal, promoting the concept of the civilizing mission.

                              missionaries saw removal as a necessary step in saving Indians from
                              alcohol and demoralization—a theme that Cass had already raised in the
                              1826 negotiations.<hi rend="sup">24</hi></p>
                        <p>The Indian Removal Act enacted in 1830 put into law the practices that
                              had begun with previous treaties. The act is widely remembered for its
                              implementation in the South, including the forced removals of the
                              Creek and Cherokee and the long, bloody war fought by the Seminole.

                              to the legislature, Governor Ray called for removal of Indians from
                              the state, &quot;[b]ut in love and without force&quot;; the
                              legislature responded by calling for the extinction of Indian property
                              ownership in the state.<hi rend="sup">25</hi></p>
                        <p>In the same year, the Black Hawk War to the west provided an urgency—and

                              thirty-six sections was given to Cass&apos;s adversary, Aubenaubee;
                              another reservation of twenty-two sections was given to Menominee and
                              three other chiefs on the Yellow River. Other reserved lands were
                              individual &quot;floating&quot; reserves, usually a section or less,
                              which the recipients—often influential chiefs and mixed-race traders
                              and their families—could locate anywhere within the ceded territory.
                              Historians sometimes characterize these land grants as bribes or as a
                              way for speculators to bypass the normal policy of sale at public
                              auction. Most of the grants required the permission of the president
                              for sale or assignment; however, permission was often achieved with
                              the intervention of a sympathetic Indian agent. A small minority of
                              grants were issued in a form of freehold ownership known as fee
                              simple, eliminating the need for presidential permission.<hi

                        <p>There is little doubt that these small reserve lands helped Native people
                              seeking to avoid removal. Many such grants went to Richardville and
                              other Miami leaders. Richardville received forty-four quarter sections
                              in treaties from 1818 to 1840; another Miami leader, Francis Godfroy,
                              received seventeen sections. The government also made some cash
                              payments in lieu of land grants in later Miami treaties, as it had in
                              the 1833 Potawatomi treaty. Many of Richardville&apos;s holdings were
                              issued in fee simple (as in 1818) or converted to fee-simple tenure in
                              the 1834 treaty. Although he sold some of this land to Tipton and
                              others, Richardville was able to delay Miami removal until after his
                              death in 1841, and obtained exemptions from emigration for many Miami,

                              business with the Indians on credit, which meant the annuity money was
                              essential to keeping their businesses solvent. The fact that traders
                              often greatly inflated debts and prices had an even greater impact on
                              the real value to the Indians of the portion of annuity payments made
                              in goods at treaties. It is not surprising that the traders&apos;
                              payment period was marked by excessive drunkenness and spending.<hi

                        <p>Traders were not always consistent in their position on Indian removal,
                              based upon changing perceptions of their self-interests. William Ewing
                              wrote to Tipton in 1830 discouraging removal of &quot;the blood
                              thirsty and degenerateing Miamies,&quot; thinking it better to
                              &quot;suffer them to occupy back and unimportant situations for a
                              while, as their increased annuity will be of material benefit in the
                              first settleing of our country and there is yet room for all.&quot;
                              Eight years later, Ewing&apos;s brother and partner, George,
                              participated in the forced removal of Potawatomi from the Yellow River
                              area to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254"

                              obtaining musicians to accompany the volunteer military detachment).
                              The Ewings later supported Miami removal after obtaining an interest
                              in the removal contract in 1846. The brothers&apos; firm adapted to
                              removal by following the Indians west, establishing operations in

                              Tipton&apos;s associates Allen Hamilton and Jordan Vigus, maintained

                              reservations with four treaties in December 1834, although only the
                              last of these pledged removal within a three-year period.
                              Marshall&apos;s successor, Abel Pepper, continued this process with
                              ten treaties between April 1836 and early 1837. The treaties followed
                              a set form and pledged removal west within two years. In later
                              treaties, the government paid $1.25 an acre, the minimum price it
                              would realize from public land sales. Although many village leaders
                              agreed to these terms, some did not and objected to others selling
                              their lands.</p>

                              150 years, with deep roots in French communities associated with the
                              fur trade, and had influence among many mixed-race tribal members
                              (including Richardville). Interest in Catholicism had grown among

                              on the Yellow River, also developed close ties with the church.
                              Although he never agreed to give up his people&apos;s land, the
                              signatures of three other chiefs sharing his reservation appeared on
                              an August 5, 1836 treaty. In a letter to Tipton, forwarded to the
                              commissioner of Indian Affairs, Menominee and seventeen others,
                              including the ostensible signers of the treaty, repudiated the sale:

                        <p>After Indian removal, the next step in the transformation of land
                              ownership was the distribution, or sale, of the land to white owners.
                              Federal land office business burgeoned in the 1830s as millions of
                              acres became available through Indian cessions. According to historian
                              Malcolm Rohrbough, sales peaked nationally between the fall of 1833
                              and the spring of 1837, a period when land revenues exceeded the total
                              value of sales to date. The government sold over twenty million acres
                              in 1836, over three million acres in <placeName><region type="state"
                                          key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                    >Indiana</region></placeName> alone. By 1837, sixty-two land
                              offices were operating. These sales led to a frenzy of speculation
                              until the financial panic of 1837 and the ensuing depression. Although
                              the sale of land slowed considerably during the financial crisis, it
                              did not stop completely.<hi rend="sup">41</hi></p>

                              Potawatomi two years earlier, setting the stage for the public sale of
                              lands and future settlement, although not necessarily in that order,
                              as squatters rushed in. Almost all the 1832 cession area fell under

                              issue. The 1838 Preemption Act allowed such claims for up to 160 acres

                              improvements had been made. Poorly timbered claims were allowed to add

                        <p>Confrontations between settlers and Potawatomi on ostensibly ceded
                              reserve lands occurred in the area of the Tippecanoe and Yellow

                              1838. To the northwest, where much of the land was swamp more useful
                              for hunting than farming, relations with the Natives were more placid.
                              The Potawatomi were the &quot;best customers&quot; of Robinson&apos;s
                              store, paying promptly in raccoon, muskrat and mink skins, and
                              cranberries. Robinson reported that three Indian men had taken 1,300
                              raccoon skins in one season, earning $1,625. The Potawatomi continued
                              to trap in the Calumet and Kankakee marshlands. Settlers reported
                              hundreds of Potawatomi in winter hunting camps in the Kankakee Marsh

                        <p>Transportation and internal improvements had long been key interests of
                              many who desired to promote such economic development. The success of
                              the Erie Canal in bringing commodities and settlers from eastern
                              markets through the Great Lakes engendered great interest in canal
                              building in the newly acquired lands of the Midwest. As mentioned
                              earlier, men like Tipton and Ray were strong believers in the
                              &quot;American commercial agricultural system&quot; that, as historian
                              Ginette Aley has written, included such improvements as the projected

                              factored prominently in the 1826 negotiations and in later
                              negotiations with the Miami. Despite the <placeName><region

                              development into the early 1840s. Many projected improvements never
                              came to fruition, although the canal was open to

                        <p>Railroad construction was also part of the 1836 plan, and while,
                              according to historian Donald E Carmony, a &quot;paper network&quot;
                              of railroads was set in place before the 1837 panic, the economic
                              crisis delayed actual construction in <placeName><region type="state"

                              Railroad development recovered slowly in the 1840s. Indeed, horses,
                              rather than locomotives, actually pulled some trains in the down
                              period. Robinson, who rode on one of these in <placeName><region

                              &quot;with very few exceptions, good common roads are more advantage
                              to the farming community than railroads.&quot; The 1840s brought an
                              enthusiasm for plank roads as a substitute for the stalled railroads.
                              Propertied men such as Ellsworth saw them as even more important than
                              railroads for enhancing the value of their land.<hi rend="sup"

                              had played a prominent role. Even those who saw themselves as friends
                              of the Indian, including Isaac McCoy, were part of a new society based
                              on private property and the pursuit of monetary gain. After the best
                              lands for agriculture and town development had been snatched up, less
                              desirable acreage was still an object of speculation and a source of
                              profit. Indian removals in northern <placeName><region type="state"

                                    >Indiana</region></placeName> took place within the context of a
                              speculative boom in midwestern frontier land; men such as John Tipton,
                              Allen Hamilton, George Ewing, and Henry Ellsworth—backed by the money
                              and military power of the federal government-led what was, perhaps, an
                              irresistible push to make Native peoples disappear from the tribal
                                    lands.<hi rend="sup">61</hi></p>
                        <p>In 1907, John T. McCutcheon could look back with nostalgia on the

                              perpetuated the myth of a picturesque, vanished Indian who had had
                              little, if any, relationship to contemporary society.
                              McCutcheon&apos;s Indians bore only the slightest resemblance to real
                              people like Richardville, Menominee, Le Gros, Okamanse, and the
                              Potawatomi and Miami men and women who followed them. In reality, the
                              Indians did not vanish they were pushed aside. They were deliberately
                              removed from the scene, or marginalized into its corners, to make way
                              for a new society. McCutcheon, his <placeName><region type="state"

                              Chicago in which he worked were products of this new order in the
                              Midwest. Its origin lay in the dispossession of the Natives from their
                              lands. Far from being a picturesque sidebar to the area&apos;s
                              history, this removal constitutes a vitally important part of its
                              story.</p>

                        <p>If you were to envision the ideal preparation for a novelist who would
                              write with great insight and vividness about the westward expansion of
                              the fledgling <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>—say from the 1770s to the 1830s—you might
                              specify that he or she grow up in the hill country of southern
                                          <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                          reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, the region
                              where, during those decades, crucial battles took place and white
                              settlement surged. (Needless to say, your future novelist could be
                              female or male. For the sake of simplicity, please consider the male
                              pronouns that follow as referring to women as well as men.) You would
                              want your writer-in-training to acquire deep knowledge of the
                              indigenous cultures that were displaced or erased, so that he could
                              write with sympathy about what was lost as well as what was gained as
                              whites laid claim to the land. He should do service as a soldier,
                              preferably in wartime, so that he could understand military life
                              without romanticizing it. By working for a spell as a journalist, he
                              could develop essential research skills and a healthy skepticism about
                              official versions of the truth. Experience as a university professor
                              would train him in the use of libraries and archives. So that he might
                              understand life on the frontier, including its hardships, let him live
                              in a log house, cut and split his own firewood, and learn to use tools
                              that work by muscle power rather than electricity. Let him prefer
                              writing with pen and ink on paper rather than on a computer. Let him
                              relish camping and hiking and river running, so that he could retrace
                              the paths his characters took as they traveled the inland waterways,
                              crossed the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                              explored the wild continent to the west. Above all, let him descend
                              from a long line of raconteurs, so that he might acquire a keen sense
                              of storytelling and a love of American speech.</p>
                        <p>Add all of those qualities together and you will come up with someone
                              very like James Alexander Thom, one of the pre-eminent historical <pb
                                    n="64" id="VAA4025-107-1-070"/> novelists of our day. He was

                              parents who were both physicians. His mother was one of the first
                              female doctors in the state, as much of a pioneer as any of the
                              heroines he has written about. As a child, he kept company with
                              storytellers who conveyed to him a rich sense of familial and regional
                              history. He lives today on a ridge in his native county, at the edge
                              of a forest that harbors a white oak as old as our republic, and he
                              enjoys a view to the west across a valley that still looks, to a
                              squinting eye, much as it might have looked in 1800. Thom helped to
                              build the log home he shares with his wife, Dark Rain Thom, who is a
                              Shawnee elder and tribal historian. She has opened the way for him to
                              spend much time among Indians of numerous tribes, in
                              <placeName><country key="tgn_7005685" reg="Canada">Canada</country></placeName> as well as

                              later, he served as a Marine during the Korean War, worked as a
                              reporter and editor for the <hi rend="i">Indianapolis Star</hi> and
                                    <hi rend="i">Saturday Evening Post</hi>, taught classes in
                              journalism at Indiana University, and traversed North America by road
                              and rail and a pair of robust legs.</p>
                        <p>Everything about this author is robust—the body with which he splits
                              firewood and carves wooden sculptures, the intelligence he uses to
                              search out and sift the truths about the past, and the imagination
                              with which he brings that past to life. From <hi rend="i">Long

                              with his wife) have attracted millions of readers worldwide and two
                              have been made into films. Moreover, he wrote and rewrote all of those
                              thousands of pages longhand. Only in composing his latest book, <hi
                                    rend="i">The Art and Craft of Writing Historical Fiction</hi>,
                              he tells us, has he resorted to one of those newfangled, odorless
                              machines with a keyboard and screen.</p>
                        <p>If you aspire to write historical fiction, if you love reading it, or if
                              you are enamored of straight history and imagine you have nothing to
                              learn from novels, you should sit down with this book and listen to
                              one of the masters of the form. Thom&apos;s voice on the page is wry,
                              witty, and wise, and richly informed about history as well as art.
                              Much of this engaging book is devoted to explaining how he acquired
                              the knowledge that has enabled him to write his acclaimed novels, and
                              how anyone who aims to write movingly and accurately about the past
                              must prepare for the work.</p>
                        <p>The shorthand version of his advice is: research, research, and more
                              research. Thom believes that the serious historical novelist should
                              consult the full range of materials that any good historian would
                              use—published <pb n="65" id="VAA4025-107-1-071"/> works, archival
                              collections, letters, journals, census reports, genealogies, period
                              newspapers, and a whole long list more. Having worked as a journalist
                              before turning to fiction, he knows how to delve into sources:
                              &quot;It came as a pleasant surprise to me, when I got busy in the
                              historical genre, that doing research is at least as exciting and
                              fascinating as doing the writing. Sometimes the giant task of finding
                              all the facts you need to know turns into a life adventure&quot; (p.
                              54).</p>
                        <p>While recounting some of his own research adventures, he distinguishes
                              between <hi rend="i">facts</hi>—which can be documented—and <hi
                                    rend="i">verisimilitude</hi>—which must be created by drawing on
                              everything that is known about the place, time, and individuals of
                              one&apos;s story. Where historians look into the past from the
                              present, he argues, historical novelists render the past as the
                              present: &quot;[W]hat you want to do is re-create it in full-live,
                              colorful, smelly, noisy, savory, painful, repugnant, scary, all the
                              ways it actually was-and then set your reader down smack in the midst
                              of it&quot; (p. 26). The effect of such rendering is to make
                              &quot;that long-ago moment so vivid, so real, so sensuously complete
                              and immediate that the reader is there, then, looking forward, not
                              just here, now, looking back&quot; (p. 27).</p>
                        <p>Thom credits his Butler University professor, Dr. Werner Beyer, for
                              teaching him the key to immersing readers in the scene-by-scene
                              unfolding of events: &quot;Write to their senses!&quot; (p. 43). In
                              order to evoke the sensory richness that saturated past moments—the
                              smells and sounds, tastes and textures, as well as visual
                              impressions—the historical novelist must range beyond documents to
                              visit museums, historic reconstructions, and gatherings of
                              re-enactors. He should explore the places where the events occurred.
                              He should eat the foods, handle the tools, heft the weapons, and try
                              on the clothes appropriate to the time and location.</p>
                        <p>By turns craft talk and autobiography, this book is also a meditation on
                              the often-strained relations between historians and historical
                              novelists. A remark by the celebrated historian, Stephen Ambrose, to
                              the effect that the &quot;novelist doesn&apos;t have to have
                              facts,&quot; set Thom &quot;thinking about the relationship between
                              historians and historical novelists, about their relative authority
                              and levels of veracity&quot; (pp. 23-24). As he envisions and
                              practices this art, historical fiction must be utterly faithful to
                              documented knowledge about the past, but it must also imagine what
                              cannot be documented: the thoughts and feelings and dialogue of
                              characters, the smells and sounds and textures of a particular place
                              and moment, all the things that make up the lived experience, the
                              interior of history.</p>
                        <p>&quot;To envision the difference between early <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName> and our country as

                              imagination,&quot; he observes (p. 154). If you wish to see such leaps

                              educational history, Notre Dame stands apart. Conventional wisdom
                              focuses attention on the university&apos;s legendary president, Father
                              Theodore Hesburgh, who served from 1952 to 1987. His successor, Father
                              Edward A. &quot;Monk&quot; Malloy, continued the process of elevating
                              Notre Dame&apos;s status beyond the gridiron. In 2005, Malloy
                              published <hi rend="i">Monk&apos;s Notre Dame</hi>, a collection of
                              stories and reminiscences of the school&apos;s past culture and
                              idiosyncratic characters. <hi rend="i">Monk&apos;s Tale</hi>, his
                              follow-up to that book, covers the first thirty-four years of
                              Malloy&apos;s own life from his birth in 1941 to the completion of his
                              PhD at Vanderbilt University in 1975.</p>
                        <p>Born and raised in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7015717"
                                          reg="District of Columbia">Washington,
                                    D.C.</settlement></placeName>, Malloy grew up in a dutiful,
                              middle-class Catholic family. His early years were formed by religious
                              devotion, parochial school, and the basically conservative culture of
                              the 1950s. Even so, Malloy&apos;s life was not confined by
                              stereotypes. The nickname &quot;Monk&quot; came from a childhood
                              acquaintance, not his religious <pb n="67" id="VAA4025-107-1-073"/>
                              vocation. Malloy played endless pick-up basketball games at a
                              neighborhood park where racial barriers were not recognized. All that
                              mattered was &quot;talent, confidence, and a positive reputation&quot;
                              (p. 62). His racially integrated high school team—featuring future
                              Georgetown coach John Thompson Jr.—was undefeated and nationally
                              ranked. A basketball scholarship to Notre Dame actually moved Malloy
                              into a less-integrated environment populated with Catholic parochial
                              stars from the East Coast. In this narrative, however, Malloy&apos;s
                              undergraduate years are defined primarily in academic and cultural,
                              not athletic, terms. Malloy spends more time discussing his
                              experiences as a student-athlete than describing games and scores.
                              After almost flunking out his first year, Malloy majored in English,
                              one of Notre Dame&apos;s strongest departments.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Pilgrimage&quot; usually implies a journey of both physical and
                              spiritual dimensions. Malloy sees his life as a journey involving, but
                              not limited to, Notre Dame. His call to the priesthood came through
                              missionary work in rural <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560" reg="Mexico">Mexico</country></placeName>. Although some spiritual
                              autobiographies feature a clear revelatory moment standing in stark
                              contrast to life&apos;s routine, Malloy&apos;s call was different. He
                              did experience a moment when he discerned his call, but that event
                              only sharpened the focus of his already Catholic life. He remained at
                              Notre Dame for his seminary studies and ordination; he then became the
                              first Catholic priest admitted to the Vanderbilt University doctoral
                              program in Ethics. At this historically Protestant school, Malloy
                              finally confronted the startling denominational diversity of American
                              religion, a reality that existed just beyond the confines of Notre
                              Dame. After receiving his PhD at age 34, he considered himself, like
                              Lou Gehrig, &quot;the luckiest guy in the world&quot; (p. 252).</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">Monk&apos;s Tale</hi> offers a clear testimony to the
                              formative years of one of <placeName><region type="state"

                              administrators. The book will appeal to those with a connection to
                              Notre Dame. Other readers will appreciate Malloy&apos;s meticulously
                              reconstructed cultural and religious history. While not a native
                              Hoosier, he shares a passion for basketball seldom matched among his
                              Holy Cross brethren or fellow college administrators. That alone makes
                              this volume worthy for consideration as <placeName><region

                              is an important addition to understanding the dynamics within one of
                              the best-known universities in both the state and nation.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="i">The Bourgeois Frontier</hi> focuses on the Chouteau family
                              and its important role in American expansion, from the founding of

                              Emilie Anne (nee Gratiot), in 1862. Jay Gitlin uses the
                              Chouteaus&apos; history as an emblematic narrative of the integration
                              of French fur traders into the increasingly Americanized West in the
                              decades between the American Revolution and the Civil War. His primary
                              goal is to dispel the belief that the French had vanished into the
                              creolized and mixed-race lower classes of the frontier after 1763—a
                              myth perpetuated well before Francis Parkman concretized it in his

                              as Anglo-American immigrants, who settled there in growing numbers
                              after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. Through careful documentation,
                              Gitlin shows how the family learned to profit from its role as brokers
                              between the Anglos and Native Americans, as the commodities in
                              question shifted from furs to land to mining rights. Other French and
                              even some Metis traders are mentioned as well, but Gitlin never strays
                              far from the Chouteaus.</p>
                        <p>Gitlin&apos;s most compelling chapter focuses on the family&apos;s
                              opportunistic turn to the Southwest, well in advance of large-scale
                              Anglo regional penetration along the Santa Fe Trail. When the Anglos
                              finally did arrive in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007566"

                              bargaining with the same French families they had encountered to the
                              east a generation before. The French ability and willingness to engage
                              Indians in non-confrontational matters eased the settlement process
                              for a great many tribes, from the Shawnee and the Osage to the
                              Comanche and the Cheyenne.</p>
                        <p>As family history becomes western history, the Chouteaus multiply,
                              marrying wisely with Anglos, Indians, and other French entrepreneurs,

                                    Chouteaus and the French Dynasty that Ruled America&apos;s
                                    Frontier</hi> (2004) for, if nothing else, its Chouteau family
                              tree. Gitlin&apos;s omission of any citation to Christian&apos;s
                              thoroughly researched (if not necessarily scholarly) book is
                              representative of his somewhat problematic relation to contemporary
                              scholarship, much of which has focused on issues of race and slavery.
                              Gitlin&apos;s is an older type of story, one that narrates the rise of
                              a family business and examines the nuts and bolts of economic ventures
                              but gives scant attention to the slaves and laborers who made these
                              ventures work.</p>
                        <p>When race does become a central issue as the Civil War approaches,
                              internal family struggles over alliances and abolition seem sudden and
                              under-contextualized. Dred Scott&apos;s owner was a Chouteau son-in-
                              law, and although the case is mentioned several times, it is never
                              linked to larger family attitudes toward slavery or any other
                              political, economic, or social issues. As the book&apos;s title
                              suggests, Gitlin&apos;s emphasis is on the bourgeois French elite who
                              retained the older cultural values of the French frontier, as the
                              lower classes were absorbed into the American working class or simply
                              pushed west with their Indian relatives. In that sense, Gitlin has
                              stayed within the limits of his topic.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="i">The Bourgeois Frontier</hi>&apos;s strengths and weaknesses
                              are epitomized by the image of a sumptuous steamship&apos;s ballroom
                              on its cover. While its grandeur is undeniable and the beautifully
                              dressed Creoles sauntering about are recognizable from Gitlin&apos;s
                              study, the well-dressed and dark-skinned slaves waiting table and the
                              bartender in shirtsleeves remain relative strangers. This is a well-
                              researched and well-written book about a colonial culture whose last
                              visible remnant was its elite.</p>

                        <p>If a book is to be judged by the goals it sets, then Robert P.
                              Sutton&apos;s <hi rend="i">Heartland Utopias</hi> is deserving of
                              praise. As the author explains in his conclusion, the volume is
                              &quot;not intended to be a new theoretical analysis of utopian
                              communalism&quot;; rather, its purpose is &quot;to summarize the
                              importance of communal societies to the history of the heartland in

                              region known as the Old Northwest should know something of these
                              communal experiments.</p>
                        <p>The book is organized in a loosely chronological manner, with chapters
                              designated to specific communal groups (i.e., &quot;Shakers&apos;
                              Villages&quot;), to specific locations (&quot;New Harmony,&quot; home
                              to the followers of George Rapp and then to followers of Robert Dale
                              Owen, and &quot;Chicago Area Utopias,&quot; for example), or to groups
                              that, while perhaps undeserving of a chapter to themselves, still
                              share meaningful links to other communities. In chapters such as
                              &quot;Other Separatist Communities&quot; and &quot;Contemporary
                              Heartland Utopias,&quot; the author explains the reasons for such
                              linkage.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of each utopian group includes background information that
                              often predates the group&apos;s appearance in the heartland. As a
                              result, the historical expanse of the volume includes commentary on

                        <p>Scholars will quickly note Sutton&apos;s reliance upon what might be
                              called key secondary sources rather than primary materials. Exceptions
                              to this methodology can be found in the chapters devoted to
                              &quot;Chicago Area Utopias&quot; and &quot;Contemporary Heartland
                              Utopias,&quot; both of which draw on primary material such as
                              interviews conducted by Timothy Miller and Deborah Altus as part of
                              &quot;The 60s Communes Project&quot; and newspaper accounts. These
                              chapters exceed others in the volume for the insights they provide to
                              readers already familiar with nineteenth and early twentieth-century
                              communal utopias.</p>
                        <p>The most valuable contribution of <hi rend="i">Heartland Utopias</hi> is
                              its compilation of this material into one volume. Numerous histories
                              and specialized articles have been written about the utopian groups
                              discussed here, as the <pb n="71" id="VAA4025-107-1-077"/> citations
                              suggest. Yet those teaching classes on either the region or American
                              communal utopias should find this summation a good starting guide for
                              students to learn the basics, and to locate possible points of entry
                              to further study of any one of the groups discussed.</p>

                              read to construct identity and build community. In the process, they
                              also found paths to meaningful civic participation in the Progressive
                              Era. The book is organized into three sections: the first establishes
                              the context for young women&apos;s reading during the second half of
                              the nineteenth century, the second examines the role of reading in

                              easy access to a wide array of books. Steeped in a print-based
                              interpretive community, the Hamiltons read passionately, played word
                              games, and created entertainments based on their favorite literary
                              themes and characters. Emerging from this context, Edith subsequently
                              became well known as <pb n="72" id="VAA4025-107-1-078"/> a scholar of
                              classical civilization and author of several significant works, among
                              them <hi rend="i">Mythology</hi> (1942). Also a voracious reader, her
                              sister Alice moved to Jane Addams&apos;s Hull House before becoming
                              the first woman professor at the Harvard Medical School in 1919.</p>
                        <p>Historically, elite women have often preserved their reactions to books
                              in diaries, correspondence, and autobiographies, but reconstructing
                              the reading habits of working-class women and racial and ethnic
                              minorities presents more of a challenge. Like their counterparts in
                              the privileged classes, Polish immigrant Hilda Satt Polacheck, Jewish
                              immigrant Rose Gollup Cohen, and anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells
                              left autobiographies. Sicherman&apos;s close reading of
                              Polacheck&apos;s <hi rend="i">I Came a Stranger</hi> (1989),
                              Wells&apos;s <hi rend="i">Crusade for Justice</hi> (1970), and
                              Cohen&apos;s <hi rend="i">Out of the Shadow</hi> (1918) results in a
                              diligent reconstruction of how these women read for personal and civic
                              empowerment. One cannot help wondering, however, about the role of
                              reading in the lives of women who lacked the resources to capture, let
                              alone preserve, their experiences in print.</p>
                        <p>In an epilogue, Sicherman observes that today&apos;s proliferation of
                              reading groups affirms the continuing popularity of reading among
                              women, but unlike their nineteenth-century predecessors, busy
                              twenty-first-century female readers use book clubs less as &quot;a
                              launching pad for public activities&quot; and &quot;more like places
                              of refuge&quot; where they can reconnect with one another (pp. 255-
                              56). As Sicherman shows throughout this invaluable monograph, Gilded
                              Age women used books as vehicles for moving from highly gendered
                              private spaces into lives of public service. Reading with both emotion
                              and purpose, the women of ambition and accomplishment she portrays
                              drew insight and inspiration from the predominantly male role models
                              they encountered in print and ultimately inserted themselves into
                              history for others to read.</p>

                        <p>In this study of the 1888 presidential election, which pitted incumbent
                              Democrat Grover Cleveland, against Republican Benjamin Harrison of

                              Calhoun examines the political issues that the nation faced in the
                              1880s (most notably the protective tariff); reflects on the ups and
                              downs of Cleveland&apos;s administration; and follows the complex
                              maneuvering that led the Republican Party to nominate Harrison, who
                              was something of a dark horse.</p>
                        <p>Calhoun draws on extensive primary source material—including campaign
                              documents, speeches, private letters, and a variety of other archival
                              materials—to examine the issues, personalities, and political
                              machinations that led to Harrison&apos;s narrow margin of victory in
                              the electoral college.</p>
                        <p>A notable feature of the election was Harrison&apos;s decision to
                              campaign from his front porch and other locations in
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>,
                              rather than to tour the country. Such a strategy no doubt enabled him
                              to seem more dignified, more presidential, by giving the impression
                              that his supporters were flocking to him. In later elections, fellow
                              Republicans William McKinley and Warren Harding would use a similar
                              method with equal effect. While Cleveland, too, stayed home, he did
                              little campaigning. Harrison campaigned aggressively, delivering, by
                              Calhoun&apos;s count, &quot;over ninety speeches to more than 300,000
                              listeners&quot; (p. 133). Shorthand reporters, wire services, and mass
                              production printing insured that the words he uttered in
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                                    reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                              reached the whole country by the next day.</p>
                        <p>Calhoun&apos;s arduously gathered primary sources allow him to break free
                              of previous thought about this period. He employs this information to
                              shatter the myth that the era&apos;s politics were tedious and the
                              public unmotivated, and he convincingly demonstrates several modern
                              aspects of the campaign: the influence of business and labor, the use
                              of mass media to market the candidates, and the careful calculation of
                              political strategies. Calhoun concludes that President McKinley would
                              later pick up &quot;where Harrison had left off&quot; and that
                              &quot;it was Harrison, much more than Cleveland, who set the stage for
                              the creation of the modern presidency&quot; (p. 189).</p>

                              Convention, state-by-state election results, and the text of
                              Harrison&apos;s inaugural address. Extensive references and a
                              well-prepared index offer great help to the reader. If one desires to
                              quibble, this book could have spent <pb n="74" id="VAA4025-107-1-080"
                              /> more time examining the campaign itself, rather than the events
                              that led up it, but Calhoun&apos;s decision to dive so deeply into the
                              election&apos;s background is a legitimate choice. The author might
                              also have given more attention to the influence of James
                              Garfield&apos;s previous front porch campaign. All the same, readers
                              interested in the creation of the modern imperial presidency—not to

                                    America</hi>, examines how emerging discourses on black
                              criminality marred African Americans&apos; aspirations for racial
                              equality and shaped broader notions of race in cities such as

                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>. With a temporal focus on the period
                              between 1890 and the 1940s, Muhammad demonstrates how crime
                              statistics, conveyed through census data and pseudo-scientific
                              studies, aided the transformation of European ethnic immigrants from
                              outsiders to white Americans—and thusly, white racists and
                              supremacists. At the same time, such studies localized degeneracy and
                              criminality onto native-born blacks—city dwellers as well as southern
                              migrants. Ultimately, the rhetoric of criminality justified the
                              exclusion of blacks from the rights and privileges of citizenship for
                              generations after emancipation.</p>
                        <p>Muhammad draws from an exhaustive array of census data, government
                              reports, organizational records, news accounts, and personal papers
                              from scholars and activists such as James Stemons and Sadie Tanner
                              Mossell Alexander. He builds his argument through an examination of
                              the writing that followed the 1890 census including works by Frederick
                              L. Hoffman, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Franz Boas, and Frances
                              Kelly, to name a few. Hoffman&apos;s <hi rend="i">Race Traits and
                                    Tendencies of the American Negro</hi> (1896), Muhammad notes,
                              &quot;tied <pb n="75" id="VAA4025-107-1-081"/> black criminality to a
                              repudiation of abolitionists&apos; and neo-abolitionists&apos; claims
                              that with freedom, education, and moral training blacks would
                              gradually achieve equality with whites&quot; (p. 51). Hoffman
                              highlighted rising black crime despite an increase in the number of
                              black churches and schools—for him proof—positive that criminality was
                              a black thing rather than attributable to social ills. Muhammad
                              juxtaposes Hoffman&apos;s claims with those of Du Bois and Wells, who
                              refuted such arguments by diagramming structural bigotry and mapping
                              the racism that attended policing and criminal justice
                              administration.</p>
                        <p>Through such analysis, Muhammad deftly critiques liberal white writers of
                              the time. He follows transitions in mainstream scholarship to
                              explicate the shift from biological notions of criminality to broader
                              indictments of poverty and exclusion in the early twentieth century.
                              Yet Muhammad notes that even as a small cohort of white liberals
                              acknowledged northern racism, they remained &quot;deeply ambivalent
                              about black criminality and immorality&quot; (p. 139). That
                              ambivalence impeded reform efforts for African Americans; ethnic
                              immigrants and poor whites, almost exclusively, benefitted from
                              settlement houses and other initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty
                              and arresting crime.</p>
                        <p>Through his examination of the complexities of black reforms, Muhammad
                              argues that black activists ironically &quot;contributed to the
                              racialization of crime prevention by linking racial progress to crime
                              fighting&quot; (p. 193). Attempting to secure municipal resources and
                              police protection, black reformers called attention to crime in black
                              areas—in their minds fewer criminals would help to eliminate negative
                              stereotypes and simultaneously create safe neighborhoods for black
                              children. But when police responded to individual calls, they did so
                              without regard for black civil liberties. Muhammad provides evidence
                              of blacks, attacked by whites, ending up in jail or themselves beaten
                              by police. He skillfully uses the <hi rend="i">Philadelphia

                              the frustrations of local blacks. The story of a middle-class black
                              woman&apos;s act of self-defense in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                              spotlights not only the prevalence of white-on-black crime, but also
                              the limited justice available to African Americans—even those of good,
                              middle-class standing, as was the case with Adella Bond. However, a
                              more nuanced examination of the gendered aspects of race and crime
                              might have added an important layer to our understanding of the
                              complexity of these issues.</p>
                        <p>Muhammad&apos;s work incisively indicts the role of falsely labeled race-
                              neutral tools like crime statistics in allowing European ethnic
                              immigrants access to the full rights of citizenship at the same time
                              that they encouraged the exclusion of native-born blacks. His study is
                              a testament to the <pb n="76" id="VAA4025-107-1-082"/> enduring nature
                              of these tools; his caution against the &quot;ubiquitous referencing
                              of crime statistics about black criminality today,&quot; given the
                              silence that often surrounds white crime, is both provocative and
                              well-founded (p. 277). Undoubtedly, his book will be a seminal text
                              for historical, as well as contemporary, studies of race, crime, and
                              urbanity.</p>

                        <p>Scholars of gender often benefit from tracing the societal intersections
                              that guided women toward power—unless the topic concerns the Roman
                              Catholic Church. Under the broad umbrella of Catholicism, authority
                              and womanhood stand apart, seemingly intractable antagonists in a
                              history that stretches over centuries. In her thoughtful book, <hi
                                    rend="i">New Women of the Old Faith: Gender and American
                                    Catholicism in the Progressive Era</hi>, Kathleen Sprows
                              Cummings challenges that assumption, illuminating the intellectual and
                              spiritual complexities of faith-driven women.</p>
                        <p>Within the context of the Progressive Era, when an emerging female
                              identity remained largely grounded in Protestant ideologies, Cummings
                              examines the lives and thoughts of four Catholic women, two religious
                              and two secular. This multiple character design is risky, as a text
                              can lose its thematic unity or its subjects can appear forced into a
                              pre-ordained conclusion. Cummings avoids these problems, giving this
                              work its purchase from richly diversified primary research conducted
                              in numerous archives, buttressed by a wealth of secondary literature.
                              The result is a monograph of balanced interpretation that considers
                              how Catholic women viewed their religion, themselves, and their life
                              choices in early twentieth-century <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                        <p>Cummings argues that Catholic women carefully maneuvered themselves into
                              aspects of the &quot;new woman&quot; image associated with higher
                              education, professional occupations, and suffragist impulses, even as
                              their church fiercely opposed <pb n="77" id="VAA4025-107-1-083"/>
                              changing female behaviors. She successfully demonstrates that Catholic
                              women invoked early religious &quot;heroines&quot; as indicators of
                              the way the church uplifted its distaff side, endorsed female
                              enlightenment, and stamped out ancient pagan oppression. Praising
                              these feminine models of the European past in modern
                              <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>,
                              Progressive Era women relied on non-threatening language and demeanor
                              to secure gender concessions, promote their own public authority, and
                              stay within church-approved boundaries. Essentially these female
                              church loyalists adopted the quixotic position that inside the
                              <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                              States</country></placeName> democracy, charged by its documents to uphold republican
                              ideals, the true gender liberator remained a non-American organization
                              that by law and custom openly denied women equality.</p>
                        <p>Cummings&apos;s insightful assessment of the religious vision and
                              personal goals of women standing on shifting Catholic ground proves
                              one of the major strengths of her book. Few authors tackle the
                              subjects of professed religious and their lay counterparts in the same
                              study, for the two—regardless of their close interactions—live out
                              different world-views. As Cummings unravels their attitudes and
                              actions, she shows that harmony as well as contention moved events
                              within and across both groups.</p>

                        <p>The editors&apos; excellent introduction not only provides a
                              chronological foundation upon which the array of essays are built, it
                              also supplies additional context and detail for those essays that
                              center on less familiar sports: cycling, car racing, and horseracing.
                              To be sure, the city&apos;s more obvious sports stories remain, with
                              Daniel Nathan&apos;s first-rate retelling of the Black Sox scandal and
                              Walter LeFeber&apos;s well-known take on Michael Jordan and global
                              capitalism. But the pieces that truly stand out are those that take on
                              sports other than the Big Four and integrate them into a larger local
                              and national history. Riess&apos;s own piece, for example, examines
                              horseracing through the lens of organized crime, while Cord
                              Scott&apos;s essay on car racing makes it clear why

                              vein, Bruce J. Evensen analyzes the Dempsey-Tunney fight within the
                              context of the rise of sports media, demonstrating why his book on the
                              same topic is far more than a history of the two fighters.</p>
                        <p>Because of its variety, this is a very teachable text. Short
                              introductions to each essay provide solid background material and
                              connect to the volume as a whole, and the scholars represented offer
                              access to a variety of methodologies. Robin Dale Lester&apos;s essay
                              on Amos Alonzo Stagg, for example, the first tenured coach in the
                              <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>, demonstrates a near-perfect way to use biography to discuss the
                              bigger picture. Susan Cahn&apos;s exceptional essay about the
                              All-American Girls Baseball League—unfortunately the only one to focus
                              specifically on gender and one of the few to deal with the later
                              period—with its easy prose and sound arguments, shows how women&apos;s
                              history should be integrated within a broader scope.</p>
                        <p>That Cahn&apos;s essay stands alone may be the only significant shortfall
                              of this book, even though the introduction demonstrates the plentiful
                              history of women in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                                    reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> sports. And this collection certainly had
                                    <pb n="79" id="VAA4025-107-1-085"/> space for more essays
                              devoted to women. The Chicago Blackhawks seem to be an important
                              enough subject for the editors to have solicited John Chi-Kit
                              Wong&apos;s essay, the only one specifically written for the
                              collection. David Claerbaut&apos;s descriptive history of the Chicago
                              Cubs stands out rather oddly with its lack of cited sources and little
                              content that anyone other than a Cubs fan would care about, taking up
                              space in an otherwise finely honed critical collection.</p>
                        <p>With that said, this volume makes a significant contribution not just to
                              sports history or <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                                    reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> history, but also to the story of the

                              World War II. It is a worthy book, indeed.</p>

                        <p>As someone who is deeply involved in the art and science of oral history
                              and has contributed to a &quot;how-to&quot; book focusing on oral
                              history, I often wonder how many more such books should join the
                              pantheon. Keeping an open mind when a new book in this genre appears
                              has, in this case, led to quite a find—<hi rend="i">Catching Stories:
                                    A Practical Guide to Oral History</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The authors did not intend this volume for the seasoned practitioner.
                              They offer it primarily to those folks, from the county historian to
                              the community volunteer, who want to &quot;add oral history to their
                              toolkit of methods&quot; and gain the &quot;confidence to take on new
                              projects&quot; (p. ix).</p>
                        <p>Breaking the process into eleven chapters, the authors walk the beginner
                              through oral history from initial idea to finished product. Giving
                              readers the essential information to undertake and complete an oral
                              history project should stand as the least accomplishment of a how-to
                              book. <hi rend="i">Catching Stories</hi>&apos; creators hit that mark
                              and more by offering a piece that should be part of any fledgling, or
                              veteran, oral historian&apos;s bookcase.</p>
                        <p>Having multiple contributing authors could cause a work to seem <pb
                                    n="80" id="VAA4025-107-1-086"/> disjointed, but <hi rend="i"
                                    >Catching Stories</hi> does not read that way. The authors 
                              present their material concisely and cogently. One can assume that their
                              years of working together aided the book&apos;s smooth transitions,
                              supporting the oral history maxim that building rapport will benefit
                              an interview or project.</p>
                        <p>While newcomers will welcome all chapters in this book, and will
                              particularly appreciate the anecdotes that flesh out key points, this
                              reviewer found the sections on current technology the most useful. Too
                              many recent how-to books gloss over technology, hiding behind the
                              excuse of constant change. The interdisciplinary focus of the guide
                              allowed Charles Ganzert to use his technical knowledge and writing
                              skills to open up all aspects of sight and sound to readers. These
                              chapters give those interested an excellent overview of the challenges
                              of recording—either with audio or audio/video-in these early years of
                              the twenty-first century.</p>
                        <p>In most book reviews, this second-to-last paragraph seemingly exists to
                              offer criticism of any kind. While people who will read this book with
                              a fine-toothed comb might offer some comments here, there appears to
                              be little to dissuade someone from purchasing this book. In addition
                              to its content, its length and its price will appeal to a wide range
                              of readers.</p>
                        <p>While Hoosiers will find no anecdotes specific to their state—the authors
                              drew their examples exclusively from the Buckeye State—anyone from

                              history projects. <hi rend="i">Catching Stories</hi> may not stand as
                              the best how-to book on the subject; however, it should be included in
                              the discussion. And anyone interested in learning (or being reminded)
                              about the art and science of oral history should give it a thorough
                              read. They will not finish it disappointed.</p>

                              artifacts from the Center for History&apos;s own Civil War collection.
                              I visited the display, alone and with several college classes, and
                              found that its engaging, hands-on, interactive displays, and its use
                              of music from the time period, combined with informative traditional
                              board displays and artifacts to make it worth a trip to the
                              museum.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Liberty Denied&quot; compares the views of slavery supporters and
                              abolitionists in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255"

                              reproductions of paintings and photographs, as well as in intriguing
                              displays such as &quot;Slave Music: Real and Perceived,&quot; where
                              visitors push a button and listen either to an idealized slave song
                              created by white minstrel singers or to the authentic music (albeit
                              recorded in the twentieth century) sung by slaves themselves. Nearby,
                              one hears the haunting recollections of former slaves, recorded by the
                              Federal Writers&apos; Project in the 1940s. This kind of contrast is
                              one of the main themes of the exhibit.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps my favorite display was &quot;A Question of Liberty,&quot; a
                              video touchscreen with six antebellum characters, from a southern
                              white slaveholding woman to a northern free black man. When you touch
                              the person&apos;s name on the screen, you hear the character talk
                              about the dilemmas he or she faces, while photographs representing
                              scenes from his or her life appear on the screen. Two other characters
                              then argue with the first about slavery, race, or class, bringing home
                              the reasons that different people felt the way they did about slavery
                              and about each other.</p>
                        <p>&quot;Liberty&apos;s Trial&quot; contains the largest number of
                              artifacts, perhaps because the Civil War is so revered in American
                              memory. An army belt and buckle, a New Testament, a .44 caliber Colt
                              Army Revolver, and an example of the .38 caliber minie ball that
                              caused such a high number of casualties are all on display. The Center
                              for History adds its own ball of grapeshot, embedded in a tree
                              trunk.</p>
                        <p>Interactive displays in &quot;Liberty&apos;s Trial&quot; include
                              &quot;What Would You Do?&quot;, a set of three scenarios in which the
                              visitor, identifying as a slave in <placeName><region type="state"
                                    key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>, must choose whether or
                              not to escape to Union lines. After deciding &quot;yes&quot; or
                              &quot;no,&quot; each person lifts the cover to see his or her fate.
                              Slavery was protected in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255"
                                    reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>, so a recaptured runaway would
                              probably be beaten or sold—a fate that one might also meet staying in
                              slavery. Still, a runaway&apos;s chances improved as the war

                              in a border state.</p>
                        <p>The exhibit of a life-size porch with a recording on enlistment was less
                              effective. Stepping onto the <pb n="82" id="VAA4025-107-1-088"/>
                              wooden porch, I pushed a button on a barrel and heard a recording of a
                              horse&apos;s hooves and the voice of a Union recruiter. The voices of
                              a recruit and a pro-Confederate man follow, but because the sound is
                              unclear and the context is not given anywhere nearby, the interchange
                              is confusing.</p>
                        <p>The final part of the exhibit, &quot;Liberty&apos;s Legacy,&quot;
                              features artifacts as contrasting as Mammy figurines, dignified
                              sculptures of soldiers, and civil rights movement buttons. Highlights
                              of this section include selections from films such as <hi rend="i">The
                                    Birth of a Nation, Roots</hi>, and <hi rend="i">Glory</hi>. Like
                              the contrasting slave songs, these juxtaposed portrayals of African
                              Americans from 1915 to 1989 are striking.</p>
                        <p>History Channel documentaries, running continuously on television screens
                              in wooden cases among the displays, provide some background on women
                              during the Civil War and other subjects. A final documentary clip,
                              &quot;One Flag, Two Meanings,&quot; explores the controversy over the
                              Confederate flag as a state flag. The meaning of the Civil War is
                              still contested, and <hi rend="i">Liberty on the Border</hi> sheds
                              light on the most crucial issue of the war and on the racial issues

                                    Land, The People</hi> is an ode to a way of life. Peden moved to
                              a farm during the Great Depression, and for nearly half a century she
                              wrote a weekly column on agrarian life which appeared in both the <hi

                                    Evening Press</hi>. In this reprint of the original 1966
                              collection of her essays, Peden describes her life as a farm wife and
                              mother, meditates on industrialization and its effects, and laments
                              that the family farm is &quot;among our diminishing natural
                              resources&quot; (p. xviii). With language echoing Emerson and Thoreau,
                              Peden&apos;s work reveals her love of land and soil. Although
                              ostensibly about the simple life, this thoughtful book raises complex
                              issues still relevant today.</p>

                              productions, the volume considers the theater&apos;s history by topic:
                              premieres and first productions, the core repertory, diverse and
                              unusual productions, operas presented on tour, summer musicals and
                              operettas, <pb n="85" id="VAA4025-107-1-091"/> and finally a glimpse
                              behind the scenes. Three appendices offer complete lists of operas by
                              season, operas by title, and singers by role. Graduates of the Jacobs
                              School of Music and the many thousands of opera lovers who have
                              attended the theater over the decades will appreciate the book&apos;s
                              evocative rendering of past productions. Given the expertise of the

                              to be gay and in a deeply committed relationship. The media flock to
                              report the unique story—their coverage distorting truth and value.
                              The author artfully weaves animal rights and gay rights into this

                        <p>In 1895, James Whitcomb Riley published a small book of poems, many of
                              which would remain famous for generations, including &quot;Little
                              Orphant Annie&quot; and &quot;The Raggedy Man.&quot; This
                              well-produced little volume is a reprint of the 1905 edition with
                              illustrations by Brown County artist Will Vawter. Readers only vaguely
                              familiar with Riley will enjoy reading some of his best-known poems,
                              including several of the author&apos;s famous &quot;dialect&quot;
                              poems, written in Riley&apos; s somewhat fanciful rendition of a
                              southern <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                              Riley&apos;s poetry is especially enjoyable when read aloud—&quot;The
                              Bear Story&quot; alone is worth the price of this book.</p>

                        <p>Many presses have anthologized the &quot;haunted&quot; tales belonging to
                              a variety of cities and states, but too often these books are poorly
                              written. Enter Roberta and Lonnie Brown, who have collected a

                              behind the door and another under the bed.</p>
