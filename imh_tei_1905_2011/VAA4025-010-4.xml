            <p>This is only a tentative study of the academies of the State. Superintendent
                    Thomas has used all the materials available. The subject offers great
                    difficulties on account of the nature of the source material. Every historian
                    knows how dangerous it is to found a statement on traditional evidence. The
                    subject, however, is one of wide and vital interest. The study is published not
                    so much for its final value as for the purpose of arousing attention to the
                    necessity of collecting the materials for the history of the Academies before it
                    is too late. The editor will appreciate any material such as catalogues,
                    advertisements, announcements, or reports concerning any Academy of the State.
                    This study shows what a powerful influence they have been in the
                    State's history. They cannot be neglected, especially in the history of
                    our schools.–ED.</p>

            <p>In 1818, the General Assembly of Indiana passed an act, approved December 31,
                    1818, entitled, "An Act for the Encouragement of Religion and
                    Learning." By it-the Board of County Com-misisoners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Gibson county</region>
                    </placeName> were given the power to appoint three fit persons of the county as
                    trustees, under the name and style of "The Board of Trustees of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Academy." The county agent was given the power to convey
                    to the board of trustees and to their successors, lot number one in the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, to be used for "the building of houses of religious
                    worship and seminaries <pb n="332" id="VAA4025-010-4-002"/> of
                    learning." Pursuant to this act, the county commissioners at their next
                    meeting in May, 1819, appointed Alexander Devin, William Prince, and Robert
                    Evans trustees "of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>

            <p>In 1822, a new "board of trustees was appointed, consisting of Alexander
                    Devin, Robert Milburn, and Samuel Hall. The county agent, Robert Stockwell, was
                    authorized by the commissioners to convey to the board of trustees, lot number
                    one, as provided for in the Act of December 31, 1818.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1818, by Robert Evans. The next board of trustees that met on
                    May 5, 1826, acted under the law of the General Assembly providing for the
                    establishment of Public Seminaries. The board consisted of five men instead of
                    three, as provided under the Act of December 31, 1818, and out of this movement

                    early history. The building was a three story brick and is now used by the high
                    school. Professor Barnes taught in the academy from about 1858 to 1864.</p>
            <p>The course of study was about the equivalent of our present high school course.

                    Dr. John M. Coulter, ex-president of Indiana University. It was incorporated
                    January 6, 1829, by John Finley Crowe, James H. Johnson, Williamson Dunn, George
                    Logan, John M. Dickey, Samuel Smock, William Reed, Samuel Gregg, and Jeremiah

                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>
                    </placeName> College. On January 1, 1833, the articles of incorporation of the
                    Academy were surrendered and the College was incorporated. In 1843 the charter

                        <settlement type="city">Hanover</settlement>

                    Burt, Rev. Daniel Lattimore, W. A. Bullock, Alanson Andrews, and Rev. J. B. New.
                    The first building erected was a two story brick with two rooms and an outside
                    stairway. This was known as the Old Seminary. It was abandoned in 1859 and has
                    since been used as a residence.</p>
            <p>In 1859 the present two story four room brick was built, and the name was changed
                    to the Jennings Academy.</p>
            <p>Some of the teachers of the Old Seminary were Miss Elizabeth Leiper, 1828; Prof.

                    about ninety. Two of the students of this period still living and worthy of note
                    are Capt. Wallace Foster, "The Flag Man," of <placeName>

            <p>Due to the teachings of Prof. Dunning and wife, Vernon became noted as a literary
                    center and was poetically called "The Classic Shades." The
                    Seminary was co-educational. The course of study included reading, grammar,
                    geography, arithmetic, algebra, philosophy, chemistry, rhetoric, astronomy,
                    Latin, and German. Some of the old text-books were Butler's Grammar,
                    Davis's Arithmetic, and Blair's Rhetoric.</p>
            <p>Mr. O. Phelps was the first principal of the Academy in 1859. He was followed in
                    1869 by C. W. Inyersts and W. PI. Venable, in 1861, of the Southwestern Normal

                    included algebra, geometry, chemistry, Latin, French, elocution, spelling, and
                    daily lessons in Spencerian penmanship. Vocal music was taught twice per week.
                    The school was governed by the "self reporting system."</p>

                    Vawter assistants. The Academy was organized into three departments. The Higher
                    Department included courses in Latin and Greek; Greek, Roman, and modern
                    history; classical and sacred geography; logic, rhetoric, composition, and
                    elocution; chemistry and botany; surveying and navigation; higher arithmetic and

            <p>The Eugene Academy was incorporated December 23, 1829, by Samuel Baldridge, John
                    M. Coleman, James Groenendyke, William Clark, Josephus Collett, Stephen S.

            <p>In the early 20's the Friends of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> built a brick meetinghouse on the grounds called the Public Square.
                    The'lot contained about one acre and was situated between Fourth and
                    Fifth streets on south B street, where the Finley school now stands. This ground
                    had been previously given to the city by John Smith. In 1823 or 1824, after the
                    building had been completed, the city desiring the use of the building, bought
                    it of the Friends for what it had cost them to build it. This was known as the
                    "Red Brick School House." Since it was later used for an
                    Academy I have chosen here to call it The Red Brick Academy to distinguish it
                    from the other schools and academies of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The first school was taught in the building about 1834, by Mr. E. H. Buckley. In
                    1835, William M. Gorkin, A. B., of Jefferson College, opened an Academy in it
                    for both sexes. In 1839, J. Arnold taught in this building. In 1848, William W.
                    Austin opened school in it. In 1850-51, Milton Hollingsworth, assisted by Phoebe
                    Crawford and Daniel Clark, taught a term. Since that time the building has been
                    used by the public schools.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

                    </placeName>, but for the whole county. Many of the higher branches of learning
                    were taught, and for those days it gave a thorough preparation for College.
                    During the 40's, however, the Seminary began to decline and was
                    attended by students only from Martinsville and the surrounding district.</p>
            <p>In 1853 the Seminary was sold, in pursuance of the law of 1852, and after that
                    numerous private subscription schools sprang up to meet the demand for higher
                    education. Among these private schools was the Martinsville Female Academy,
                    which was founded by M. L. Johnson in 1855, in the rooms over Mr.
                    Creary's store.</p>
            <p>The Academy prospered for a number of years, but for lack of proper support the

            <p>In July, 1847, Rev. William Townley, A. M., opened a high school in a room of his
                    dwelling and advertised the following academic course of study: First Grade,
                    orthography, reading, writing, and arithmetic, $2.50; Second Grade,
                    geography, English, grammar, natural philosophy and chemistry, $3.00;
                    Third Grade, algebra, geometry, surveying, and Latin, $3.50.</p>
            <p>This school continued until September, 1855, when an educational association was
                    formed for the purpose of raising not less than $500 for building a
                    school-house. The stock was divided into shares of $25 each, one-half
                    to be paid in cash and the balance in sixty days after October 1, 1855. The
                    following subscriptions were made: E. M. Cramer, $50; W. A. Clark,
                    $100; Frederick Foster, $50; Harvey Pettibone,

            <p>A good substantial frame building was erected and was called the

                    Academy was a success, but soon the entire enterprise collapsed and the building

            <p>Pursuant to the act of 1848, W. W. Thrasher and Henry R. Prichard canvassed the
                    community and enlisted the support of the most influential citizens. William
                    Shawhan donated four acres of ground for the site, and the necessary funds for
                    building were soon raised. The building was finished in the fall of 1849.</p>
            <p>By chance, in the spring of 1849, Mr. A. R. Benton, who. had just received his
                    Master of Arts Degree from Bethany College, <placeName>

                    employed as the first principal of the Academy. It was first opened in the
                    office of Dr. Ephriam Clifford before the Academy building was completed.</p>
            <p>The course of study was similar to that of the best Academies of the State, and
                    was perhaps the equal of any school in the West. Students from several States
                    came to it and its fame spread far and wide.</p>
            <p>Professor Benton severed his connections with the Academy in 1854, to accept a

                    fitted up for a female Academy. By the act of 1848, all deeds, grants,
                    conveyances, etc., made to the board of trustees prior to that time, were by
                    that act to be as good and effectual in law as if the trustees had been an

                    Shrader, and John R. Hugo. A peculiar provision in the charter provided for a
                    public examination to be held annually just before commencement, to which the
                    patrons and trustees should be invited, "to show the fidelity of the
                    teachers and the diligence of the scholars." The College ran about
                    three years.</p>
            <p>On the first Monday in March, 1853, John Orr., A.M., and his wife organized the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> Female Institute, which was held in the M. E. church basement.
                    There were three departments: Primary, Academic, and Collegiate. The Collegiate
                    Department was virtually a miniature College. Its courses included algebra,
                    geometry, trigonometry, mensuration, botany, chemistry, geology, astronomy,
                    natural philosophy, ancient and modern history, political economy, moral and
                    intellectual philosophy, natural history, evidences of Christianity, and weekly
                    exercises in composition. This lasted until 1854. On July 5, 1854, Miss R, P.
                    Burr opened a "Female School" in the basement of the church
                    which ran one year. In 1854 the Seminary was opened to females again and the
                    church basement: was abandoned for school purposes.</p>
            <p>In April, 1835, a female high school was organized by Henry T. Morton, and in the
                    spring of 1856 the Academy was completed. It was located on the east side of
                    West street, between Emerson and Chestnut streets, a little north of the middle
                    of the block. It was a two-story frame building with five rooms. An outside
                    stairway with two landings led to the second floor at the end of the building.
                    The Academy was seated with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> school chairs and desks. The. chairs were made of maple and
                    white-wood and were varnished. The desks were made of walnut and cherry. It was
                    heated by means of a Resor's Globe Furnace, and was ventilated by
                    Emerson's Ventilating Apparatus. In school equipment it was provided
                    with maps, globes, chemicals and physical apparatus, a geological cabinet,
                    containing several thousand specimens belonging to the principal <pb n="342" id="VAA4025-010-4-012"/> and a library. The building and equipment were the
                    best that could be found in Indiana. The original plan included a gymnasium, to
                    be located near the Academy, but it was never built.</p>
            <p>At first the building was called the "New Seminary," and next
                    the "Girls High School Seminary." On September 1, 1856, it was
                    opened to both males and females, and after that the school was called the
                    "Male and Female Academy" and the building was known as the
                    "Academy."</p>
            <p>The school year was divided into two sessions of twenty-one weeks each. The first
                    session began about September 1st, the second about February 1st. There were
                    three departments: the Primary, the Academic, and the Normal. An old catalogue
                    of 1857 gives the following courses of study:</p>

            <p>Exercises in Reading, Writing, Composition, Geography, Grammer, Mental
                    Arithmetic, and the study of the Bible were continued through the whole course.
                    French, German, Latin, and Greek were offered as electives.</p>
            <p>The tuition per session of twenty-one weeks was as follows: Primary Department:
                    first class, $7.50; second class, $10.00. Academical
                    Department: first and second classes, $16.00; third and fourth
                    classes, $20.00. Extra: music on piano, $20.00; use of
                    instrument, $20.00; painting and drawing, $10.00;
                    embroidery, $6.00. Board, light, and fuel per term, average,
                    $50.00.</p>
            <p>The Normal Department was for the training of teachers, and a model school was
                    conducted for the primary teachers.</p>
            <p>In 1857 H. F. Morton was principal of the Academy and had six assistants: Mrs.
                    Mary M. Morton, Miss Matilda E. Ellingwood, Miss Hattie W. French, Miss Martha
                    S. Paxton, Miss Eliza M. Paxton, and Mrs. M. W. Paxton, who was the special
                    teacher of music. The total attendance for 1856-57 was one hundred and
                    forty-three.</p>
            <p>On October 15, 1858, Mr. Morton sold the Academy to Messrs. Henderson &amp;
                    Brown. The school year was then divided into three sessions of fourteen weeks
                    each, beginning in September. Bookkeeping was added to the course of study.</p>
            <p>On November 12, 1859, the Academy was sold to Brown and Sturges and continued
                    under this management until the end of the spring session in 1860, when it was
                    forced to close for lack of attendance and support.</p>
            <p>On February 24, 1862, a three months term was begun. During this term it was
                    called the "Morton School House."</p>
            <p>On August 31, 1863, the Academy was sold to Wm. Kurtz, acting for the school
                    trustees, and it became a part of the public school property. It was used for a
                    part of the intermediate and primary departments until the Irving School
                    Building was completed in January, 1871. In 1870 the Academy was sold to Seth

                    willed the Academy a library of about eight hundred volumes.</p>

                    1858. A building 30x40 feet was built out of hewed logs on a beautiful wooded
                    lot with blue grass lawn and a pretty stream of water. It was furnished with
                    community desks and seats made especially for the Academy. The lot and building
                    were donated by Mr. Harriman. The library was the private property of Mr.
                    Hopkins.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hopkins was principal from 1858 to 1862. His two sons, Alex C. Hopkins and
                    John O. Hopkins assisted in conducting the school on Mondays, until Mr. Hopkins
                    returned from his Sunday's preaching tour. Mr. Hopkins was both the
                    educational and spiritual leader of the community. He was succeeded by U. B.
                    McKinney as principal from 1862-64, and by J. O. Cutte from 1864-65. Mr.
                    Harriman died about this time and the school was closed for lack of support, and
                    was used for several years by the public schools.</p>
            <p>The course of study embraced the common branches, some Latin, algebra, and
                    jurisprudence. There were usually about one hundred pupils in attendance,

            <p>Professor Evans was succeeded in 1861 by Rev. Wm. M. Daily, A. M., formerly

                    to the tuition to make up the teachers' salaries.</p>
            <p>In 1864 the trustees leased the property to the Episcopal church. A Mr. Rafter
                    was appointed principal, and the name of the Academy was changed to St. Albans
                    Academy. This management failed the first year. The Baptists next tried it by
                    putting Rev. I. W. Brunner in charge as principal. They failed after two years
                    and turned the Academy over again to the trustees. After this the building was
                    used as a public hall, as a township school, and as a private school by various
                    teachers. So much of the $2,000 had been used for repairs and
                    mismanagement that in about 1901, when the walls of the building needed
                    extensive repairs, the trustees offered to deed the property and the remainder
                    of the endowment fund to the township. The offer was accepted by J. H. Lee,
                    trustee of Tobin township, arid in 1902, after a special act of the legislature,
                    the property was transferred to Tobin township. For a time <pb n="347" id="VAA4025-010-4-017"/> afterward it was used as a district school. Since
                    1910 it has been a certified high school.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    Leroy Templeton, Theophilus Stembel, Isaac Lewis, Robert M. Atkinson, Jasper N.
                    McConnell, and Samuel Phares. Leroy Temple-ton was elected president, D. R.

                    500 shares of $20 each.</p>
            <p>W. J. Templeton furnished the site for the building, and on May 17, 1866, the
                    contract was let to Isaac Lewis for its construction for $6,480. A
                    two-story brick building was erected and the Academy was opened September 13,

                    </placeName> and was therefore acquainted with a number of people there. She
                    rented the Academy Building for one year at $100, and opened her
                    first term, April 3, 1871, with sixty students. Miss Hattie Morgan and Miss
                    Eliza Anderson were assistants. The course of study included the common
                    branches, algebra, geometry, geology, chemistry, surveying, rhetoric,
                    literature, and Latin. The fall term of 1871 opened with one hundred and
                    eighty-eight students and soon increased to two hundred and twenty-five. The
                    tuition was from $3.00 to $10.00 per term of three months.

                    withdrew from the Academy. This lessened the income but the expenses remained
                    the same, and at the close of the term Miss Wright found that she had lost
                    $225.00. This did not discourage her for she opened the term of 1872
                    with an increase in the teaching force. Miss Sarah J. Bugbee was employed as a
                    regular teacher and Mrs. A. R. Owens as a teacher of music. On account of the
                    superior advantages afforded by the Academy, Mr. John Crosson, township trustee,
                    transferred all the pupils of that neighborhood to the Academy. He paid Miss
                    Wright $75.00 a month, and the other teachers, except the music
                    teacher, $40.00 a month, for the three months, and also paid the
                    Other running expenses.</p>
            <p>The entrance of the public school pupils of all ages, sizes, and stages of
                    advancement, precipitated at once a problem of classification and gradation.
                    Many of the older boys objected to pursuing the course of study as prescribed,
                    especially English grammar, but Miss Wright's will 'prevailed
                    and the Academy became a model school for the county.</p>

                    </placeName> was organized as a separate school corporation, and the school
                    board contracted with Miss Wright for the year 1873-74. Under this contract she
                    furnished the. building and teachers and received $710.00 for her
                    year's work.</p>
            <p>The public schools were organized in 1874, and Miss Hannah M. Wright, Sarah J.
                    Bugbee, E. H. Hazlett, and Thomas A. Baldwin were employed as teachers. The
                    Academy building was rented by the board for $250.00. The
                    stockholders desired to donate the building for the use of the town school but
                    the institution was in debt. The association was incorporated with Robert M.
                    Atkinson, president, and Jasper N. McConnell, secretary. On January 22, 1880,

                    </placeName>. It was organized in March, 1869, by Rev. J. M. Johnson, A.M., of
                    the class of 1851, Indiana University.</p>
            <p>The Academy was a two-story frame building 40x50 feet. On the first floor there
                    were an ante-room and a chapel, 40x40 feet. On the second floor there were an
                    ante-room, two recitation rooms on the east side, and one on the west. It
                    contained a library of a few hundred volumes and a number of globes for teaching
                    geography.</p>
            <p>Professor Johnson, assisted by various teachers, had charge of the Academy from
                    1869 to 1902, a period of thirty-three years. During this period more than a
                    thousand young men and women went out from the Academy and are today scattered

                    the Gulf, and are engaged in about all of the walks of life. The moral and

            <p>The course of study included the common branches, algebra, geometry,

                    cavalry drill. Ten flowing wells, strong in medicinal properties, furnish an
                    abundance of good water.</p>
            <p>The building in which the cadets are quartered consists of five large fire-proof
                    barracks, with accommodations for four hundred and fifty boys. There are

                    and a library and reading room containing over 5,000 volumes.</p>
            <p>The main hall of the gymnasium is 70x140 feet. The roof is supported by steel
                    trusses which makes possible a large floor space unbroken by pillars or posts.
                    It is provided with the most modern equipment.</p>
            <p>The riding hall is a handsome building of brick and steel with a clear floor
                    space of over a quarter of an acre.</p>
            <p>The mess hall is the most complete and beautiful of its kind in the country. In
                    connection with it is a model kitchen, which is said to be one of the most
                    completely equipped in the world.</p>
            <p>The Academy hospital is a fire-proof structure fully equipped with the latest
                    sanitary appliances. An administration building is being erected which will add
                    greatly to the Academy.</p>
            <p>The Academy provides a one-year preparatory course, a four-year classical course,
                    a four-year scientific course, a four-year English and business course, and
                    courses in vocal and instrumental music. In addition to these courses a thorough
                    course in physical and military science is made an especial feature.</p>

                    exceed $25,000, exclusive of library and necessary apparatus. The
                    Academy was to be conducted upon Christian principles, but no student was to be
                    compelled to study theology or to adhere to any particular denomination.</p>
            <p>The buildings, grounds, and library and apparatus were the gift of A. M. Phelps.
                    Prior to its incorporation the school had been known as the Newburgh Cumberland
                    Presbyterian Academy, but was incorporated under the name of the Delaney Academy
                    in honor of Rev. Henry F. Delaney, an eminent minister of Morganfield, who
                    preached in various places in southern Indiana.</p>
            <p>At first, the academy was conducted in a frame building with two rooms and a
                    basement. The building was also used for a church by the different
                    denominations, and was furnished with seats, desks, a pulpit, and a bell. Two
                    teachers were employed. The basement served as a recitation room, a library, and
                    as a laboratory for the philosophical apparatus.</p>
            <p>In 1853, the academy was moved to the basement of the Cumberland Presbyterian
                    Church, where it remained for four years. In 1857, a two-story brick building
                    was erected and furnished by Mr. Phelps and others, upon a beautiful site
                    overlooking the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>. A number of valuable lots were
                    also donated by Mr. Phelps for the support of the academy.</p>
            <p>Rev. R. Ewing was the first principal. The following year he was succeeded by
                    Rev. Calvin Butler, a Congregational preacher from Boonville, and a native of <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName>. Rev. Azel Freeman, D. D., served as principal at different times
                    and was connected with the academy longer than any other teacher.</p>
            <p>The order and dates at which these men taught could not be definitely determined.
                    Rev. William B. Lambert, who was afterwards pastor of the Cumberland
                    Presbyterian Church of Evans-ville, probably followed Rev. Freeman. He was
                    followed by Rev. John D. Cowan, who later became a pastor in <placeName>

                    College; by Prof. O. H. Baker, and by Rev. C. A. Hampton, who was the last
                    principal.</p>
            <p>The course of study consisted of the common branches, the natural sciences,
                    rhetoric, mental and moral philosophy, logic, Latin, Greek, mathematics,
                    including arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy, and a normal course for

            <p>The academy was never endowed and had therefore to depend upon tuition fees for
                    its support. After the common schools were organized in 1867, the academy was
                    forced to close.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>It was organized and controlled by the <placeName>

                    </placeName>, but its purpose was to give "better intellectual and
                    religious training to the pious youth for the gospel ministry," and to
                    prepare students for college.</p>
            <p>The committee chosen to select a site for the academy at first selected in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a site near <placeName>

                    </placeName> as a location and raised $1,200 for the erection of a
                    building.</p>
            <p>In 1859, a new charter was obtained which changed the name of the academy to the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Waveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Collegiate Institute." The new charter also changed the
                    course of study. Students who had not the time nor means to take a full college
                    course might, under the new charter, pursue a shorter course which comprised
                    most of the branches taught in the scientific courses of the colleges, and
                    obtain a degree.</p>

                    of the Presbyterian Church, but distinct from the church board of trustees. Rev.
                    Jonathan Edwards, D. D., LL. D., was pastor of the church at that time and was

                    </placeName> street between Calhoun and Clinton, on the site now occupied by the
                    old high school building. It was a one-story frame building with a hall, cloak
                    room, and two school rooms, separated by folding doors so that both could be
                    made into one large room. The rooms were supplied with very good desks and
                    seats, and were well lighted and ventilated.</p>
            <p>The first teachers of the academy were Henry McCormick, of <placeName>

                    Squires. Mr. Irvin conducted the academy successfully until 1857, when the
                    present school system was established, then it was merged into the city schools.
                    On July 10, 1867, the real property was transferred to the city school board.<hi rend="sup">29</hi>

                    schools run in the summer or winter by transient teachers. Mr. Hendricks saw the
                    need for better schools and in 1854, he erected rooms in connection with his
                    residence and fitted them up for school purposes. This school was styled the
                    Blythe-Wood Academy, and continued about fifteen years until the common schools

                    to understand that corporal punishment had no place in the school. The only
                    method of punishment was dismissal from school and that was a very rare

                    east room for music. Above the assembly room was a large hall that was used by
                    the literary societies. The rooms were heated by long, open stoves. The wraps,
                    baskets and buckets were left in the hallways and in winter the lunches often
                    froze.</p>
            <p>The course of study consisted of reading, writing, philosophy, physiology,
                    English grammar, American history, algebra, geometry, Latin, arithmetic, higher
                    arithmetic, botany, science and literature.</p>
            <p>The school year was divided into three terms. The first began in September, the
                    second in December, and the third in March, ending the last of May or the first
                    of June.</p>
            <p>The academy was the only school in the county offering advanced courses of study,
                    and it was attended by students coming from different parts of the State. What
                    is now the Orphans' Home was once used as a boarding school.</p>
            <p>The first principal was Prof. T. P. Kelley, of <placeName>

            <p>A prospectus of the academy for 1862 shows the tuition fees as follows: Primary
                    Course, $3.00 per term; Common Schools, $4.00; Scientific
                    Course, $6.00; Classical Course, $8.00; extras–

                    term was twelve weeks.</p>
            <p>Samuel G. Blythe was principal in 1865-66; Robert Shaw, 1866-68; David Moore,
                    1868-73; Robert Sturgis, 1873-75; E. P. Cole, 1875-81; Mons Coulter, 1881-82;

            <p>The academy was supported by benevolences and tuition fees. In March, 1870, the
                    friends of the academy subscribed for capital stock in the academy to the amount
                    of $4,000.00, and it was incorporated. It was continued until 1884
                    when the high school was organized and the academy was abandoned.<hi rend="sup">32</hi>

                    Presbyterian church, in 1860. It had its origin in the union of the "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Boys' School," and the "<placeName>

                    </placeName> Female Institute." Only the most meager accounts of these
                    schools could be found.</p>
            <p>Early in the 30's or before, the Masonic fraternity erected a two-story
                    brick building, the large upper room of which was used as a Masonic lodge hall.</p>
            <p>In 1831, a Mr. Baker conducted a school for boys in the basement of this
                    building. Nothing is known of the school except that he taught the boys to swim
                    in a large box that was built in the basement.</p>
            <p>In 1848, Prof. Z. B. Sturges opened the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Boys' School in a large frame house in the eastern part of
                    the city. At about the same time Prof. George Reed was principal of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> Female Institute, which was conducted in the brick building built
                    by the Masonic fraternity.</p>
            <p>Professor Reed was succeeded by John W. Lindley in 1856, who continued as
                    principal until 1860, when the two schools were combined in the brick building
                    under Prof. Z. B. Sturges, A.M., and it was afterwards known as the Barnett
                    Academy. It was probably about this time that the "L" was
                    added to the building for school purposes. At this time there were three
                    teachers in the faculty and the attendance was about 150. The graduating class
                    of 1861 consisted of seven members.</p>
            <p>The academy was controlled throughout its history by the Presbyterian church. A
                    clause in the charter of the academy provided that all principals and assistants
                    should belong to that church.</p>
            <p>Professor Sturges was succeeded by H. C. Donnell from 1864- <list type="footnotes">

                    and entrances on the north and south.</p>
            <p>The academy was equipped with a library of fifty volumes, including
                    Shakespeare's complete works. There was also considerable apparatus for
                    use in physics and chemistry.</p>
            <p>The faculty in 1861 consisted of J. M. Coyner, A. M., principal, and teacher of
                    higher mathematics, history, natural, mental and moral science; Rev. C. K.

                    settlers began to enter in considerable number, and by the year 1800 the

                    Methodist societies in the older states. By no means, however, were the

                    territory, and there were no official Methodist societies in Indiana at that
                    early date, but there were undoubtedly Methodist services conducted and
                    Methodist preaching by local preachers who came into the Indiana country among
                    the first settlerr.</p>
            <p>In the year 1800 a great revival began, which spread all over the western
                    country, resulting in more than doubling the membership of the Methodist
                    societies, in the Western conference, and also greatly increasing the number of
                    both local and traveling preachers. This remarkable revival made its appearance
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> in the spring of 1801, at a Quarterly meeting held on the Hinkston
                    circuit. This meeting lasted from Friday until Monday morning, and preaching and
                    exhortations were almost continuous during that time. One of the preachers at
                    that meeting has told us that there "was a great trembling among the
                    dry bones. Great numbers fell to the ground and cried for mercy, old and
                    young." The next week another meeting was conducted on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit, in which "every local preacher and exhorter was
                    employed," holding small meetings at various places on the circuit, and
                    on Sunday morning all the people came together for a great meeting, and as they
                    came they could be heard "singing and shouting on the road."
                    With this beginning the work and enthusiasm spread into all the circuits of the
                    Western conference, and Methodist work was extended into many of the new
                        settlements.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The first reliable record of Methodist
                    preaching in Indiana was in 1801, at a village called Springville, located in
                    what was then known as Clark's Grant, or the Grant. Two local

                    settled in the Whitewater country in the southeastern section of the Territory
                    and established regular preaching and, soon after, this section was included in

                    personally acquainted with and had given them letters when they removed from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to that new country.</p>
            <p>"There was then no Methodist circuit-preachers in that region. There was
                    an old brother, Collins, a local preacher, who withstood the Shakers, and in
                    private combat was a full match for any of them; but he was not eloquent in
                    debate, and hence the Shaker priests overcame my old brother, and by scores
                    swept members of different churches away from their steadfastness into the muddy
                    pools of Shakerism. The few who remained steadfast, sent to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> for me, praying me to come over and help them. I sent an
                    appointment with an invitation to meet any or all of the Shaker priests in
                    public debate; but instead of meeting me they appointed a meeting in opposition,
                    and warned the believers, as they called them, to keep away from my meeting; but
                    from our former acquaintance and intimate friendship, many of them came to hear
                    me. I preached to vast crowds for about three hours, and I verily believe God
                    helped me. The very foundation of every Shaker present was shaken from under
                    him. They then besought me to go to the Shaker meeting that night. I went, and
                    when I got there, we had a great crowd. I proposed to them to have a debate and
                    they dared not refuse. The terms were these: A local preacher I had with me was
                    to open the debate, then one or all of their preachers, if they chose, were to
                    follow, and I was to bring up the rear. To this agreement the Shakers, however,
                    failed to comply, after the debate was under way, and one of them, a Mr. Gill,
                    called all the Shakers present to disperse, but the sturdy circuit rider, Peter
                    Cartwright, then arose and called upon them to remain and succeeded in holding a
                    considerable number of them. He says: 'When I arose to reply I felt a
                    sense of the approbation of God, and that he would give me success. I addressed
                    the multitude about three hours and, when I closed the argument, I opened the
                    doors of the church and invited all that would renounce Shakerism to come and
                    give me their hand. Forty-seven came forward, and then and there openly
                    renounced the dreadful delusion. The next day I followed those that fled; and
                    the next day I went from cabin to cabin, taking the names of those that returned
                    to the solid foundation of truth, and my number rose to eighty-seven. I then
                    organized them into a regular society and then next fall had a preacher sent <pb n="364" id="VAA4025-010-4-034"/> them; and perhaps this victory may be
                    considered among the first fruits of Methodism in that part of the new
                    country.' "<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

            <p>By 1812 two more new circuits had been added, the Lawrence-burg circuit in the
                    southeastern corner of the Territory, between the Whitewater and the Silver
                    Creek circuits, and the Patoka circuit in the southwestern corner, south of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuit and to the west of the Silver Creek. In 1816 another new
                    circuit appears in the minutes for the first time, which was known as the
                        <geogName>Blue River</geogName>. The total membership of these six earliest
                    Indiana circuits, in the year 1816, the year of Indiana's admission to
                    the Union, was 1,877.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> I have attempted to draw a map of
                    these early Indiana circuits, though I have found it extremely difficult to fix
                    any definite boundaries. The early circuit rider was not confined to any
                    definite limits, but went where there was a call or need of his services.
                    Besides regular preaching places he had many irregular ones, the cabins of the
                    scattered settlers, and no company was too small for him to preach to.</p>
            <p>The men who manned these early Indiana circuits from the founding of the first
                    one in 1807 to 1816, were as follows (and I give their names because I feel that
                    from the standpoint of Indiana history they are worthy to be recorded): The
                    first regularly assigned preachers to Indiana circuits were Moses Ashworth to
                    the Silver Creek circuit and Joseph Williams to the Whitewater, as has already
                    been stated. From 1808 to 1816 the following men served these two circuits:</p>
            <p>Silver Creek–1809, Josiah Crawford; 1810, Sela Paine; 1811, Isaac
                    Lindsey; 1812, Wiliam McMehan; 1813, Thomas Nelson; 1814, Charles Harrison;
                    1815, Shadrach Ruark and in 1816, Joseph Kinkaid. The men who manned the
                    Whitewater circuit after Joseph Williams to 1816 were: 1809, Hector Sanford and
                    Moses Crume; 1810, Thomas Nelson and Samuel H. Thompson; 1811, Moses Crume;
                    1812, Robert W. Finley; 1813, John Strange; 1814, David Sharp; 1815, William
                    Hunt; 1816, Daniel Fraley. The <placeName>

                            Shakers were a communistic sect officially known as "The United
                            Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming." The
                            Shakers did not recognize marriage as a Christian institution and
                            considered it less perfect than the celibate state. The Shakers were
                            very active in <placeName>

                    Moses Crume; in 1815, by John Strange, and in 1816, by David Sharp. In 1816, the

                    Shrader. Among the Presiding Elders who oversaw Indiana circuits during these
                    early years were William Burke, from whose autobiography we have quoted, John
                    Sale, Samuel Parker, Soloman Langdon, Learner Blackman, James Axley, James Ward,
                    Peter Cartwright, Charles Holliday and Jesse Walker.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among these names are some which will live as long as the Methodist church lives,
                    and some which are worthy to have a permanent place in Indiana history. The
                    Jesuit Fathers, in the days of exploration on this continent, undertook no
                    greater task than the task which was undertaken by these rude, but earnest and
                    upright frontier preachers, who had a vision of what the western country might
                    become, and helped as few others helped to work out that vision.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of Indiana Methodism there were, of course, no meeting-houses,
                    but in the winter time the cabins of the settlers were the temples, and in the
                    spring, just as soon as it became warm enough, the people worshipped out under
                    the trees. It was not long, however, before log meeting-houses began to be
                    erected, for there was plenty of material, and a Methodist revival always
                    resulted in providing willing hands to build the desired house of worship.
                    During Moses Ashworth's first year on the Silver Creek circuit three
                    meeting-houses were erected, and each succeeding year saw other rude log
                    structures rise in the wilderness. In these log meeting-houses there were none
                    of the comforts known to present-day churches. The roofs were made of clapboards
                    held on by weight poles, the floors were made of puncheons, the chimneys of
                    sticks and clay, and the seats were split logs, hewn smoothly with an ax, while
                    the pulpits were made of clapboards smoothed nicely with a drawing knife.<hi rend="sup">20</hi>

            <p>Practically all of the early circuit riders, traveling in the new country, were
                    single men, for Bishop Asbury discouraged marriage among his preachers, knowing
                    the increased hardships marriage would bring to the preachers themselves and
                    especially to their wives. For this reason many of the pioneer preachers ceased
                    to travel, as it was called, while they were still comparatively young men,
                    simply because they married, and were advised to "locate,"
                    that is, they settled down in a certain locality and ceased to travel a circuit,
                    though they did not cease to be preachers. At this early time sixty-four to
                    eighty dollars was the amount allowed a traveling preacher, and he must provide
                    his own horse and equipment, such as saddle and saddle-bags. William Burke, who
                    was Presiding Elder'of the <geogName>Green River</geogName> district in
                    1810, which included the Silver Creek circuit, was the first married preacher in
                    the west who continued to travel after his marriage. And, he says, "I
                    met with every discouragement that could be thrown in my way. People and
                    preachers said, 'you had better locate.' I shared equally with
                    the single men when they were on the circuit with me, in order to keep peace.
                    * * * One winter I had to use a borrowed
                    blanket instead of a cloak or overcoat."<hi rend="sup">21</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is interesting to note that all of the Indiana circuits were named after
                    streams, either rivers or creeks, except the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuits. The reason for this is, of course, obvious. The early
                    settlements were along the rivers and creeks, and these were the natural
                    highways of the country, and so, very naturally, the early circuits derived
                    their names from some river or creek along which the settlements were located.
                    There were in those days few towns or postoffices after which circuits might be
                    named, and when there were such towns the circuits soon came to bear their
                    names, rather than that of rivers or creeks, as, for instance, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lawrenceburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> circuits. This naming of circuits after streams was not peculiar to
                    Indiana, but the same was true in all the western country.</p>
            <p>How were these great circuits manned, by many times one, and seldom more than
                    two, circuit riders? When we look at those three earliest Indiana circuits, it
                    would seem almost humanly impossible for one man to spread himself over so much
                    territory and be at all effective in his work. And yet that seemingly impossible
                    task was accomplished and many times whole communities stirred in a remarkable
                    manner. The early circuits in Indiana were six or eight <list type="footnotes">

                    rider from six to eight weeks to make the round of his various preaching- places
                    once. <hi rend="i">That meant that there</hi> was <hi rend="i">preaching</hi> at
                    the regular preacning places not more than once in six or eight weeks. At least
                    four times yearly came the quarterly meetings on every circuit, and on these
                    occasions the presiding elder would work a week or more, and sometimes make the
                    whole round with the circuit preacher. And these were the great meetings to
                    which both preacher and people looked forward for weeks and months ahead. These
                    were the times when the two and three day meetings were held, the usual way
                    being, the meeting beginning on Saturday afternoon and lasting through, with
                    little intermission until Monday morning. Many of the early circuit riders had
                    no homes, but lived in the cabins of the settlers or in the saddle. It is no
                    wonder that the Methodist preacher got a reputation as a horse trader, and as a
                    judge of good horse flesh, for the ease and comfort in which he traveled his
                    circuit depended upon the kind of horse he rode, and the preacher and his
                    faithful horse were necessarily constant companions.</p>

                    has changed… The aborigines, our former neighbors and friends, have
                    become our inveterate foes. They have drawn the scalping knife and raised the
                    tomahawk, and shouts of savage fury are heard at our thresholds. Our frontiers

            <p>In order to facilitate navigation on <geogName>Whitewater river</geogName>, the

                    The county courts in the various counties through which the river ran were
                    instructed to lay the river off into divisions and to appoint an overseer over

            <p>This legislature also passed an act regulating exportation of meat products and
                    flour. It provided for the inspection of flour, beef and pork, that were packed
                    for shipment. A barrel of beef or pork should contain 200 pounds, and should be
                    branded, "Indiana Territory, Mess Beef," "Prime
                    Beef," "Mess Pork," or "Prime

                    stopping in the eastern part of the territory. Farther east the sales at the <placeName>

            <p>With the increase in the sales of land arose also the demand for more money.
                    There were no banks in the territory in which the government could deposit the
                    money received at the land offices, so this money was taken east for depositing,
                    thus draining coin from the West. The people of the West bought more goods of
                    the East than the East bought from the West, so the balance must be paid the
                    East in money. These two drains upon the supply of money in the West were so
                    great that the people of the West were badly in need of some form of money. They
                    saw that the easiest way to get this form of money was to create banks, which
                    could make "money" as fast as printers could print the bills.
                    So, the General Assembly, which met for the first time at the new capital,
                    Corydon, in the summer of 1814, chartered two banks, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Bank, and the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the seat of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jefferson county</region>
                    </placeName>. This last bank was to prove a boon to the farmers of the
                    community, and it aided the merchants in their transactions with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and with the East.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were at the time three main ways in which money was secured for
                    investments: the military campaigns in the West had brought a good deal of money
                    to this region, as the contractors and merchants were paid for furnishing
                    supplies for the army; the continual stream of immigration brought in money to
                    invest; the banks could issue paper "money" almost without
                    limit. Consequently, a period of active speculation in town lots began. During
                    the year 1815, proprietors of various towns along <geogName>White

                        <country>Great Britain</country>
                    </placeName> alone amounted to $83,000,000, and in 1816 to
                    $155,000,000. While the merchants were sinking their circulating
                    capital in these goods, American woolen, cotton, paper and iron manufacturing
                    was being ruined.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> These investments were felt along the

            <p>With the return of peace, migration to Indiana Territory increased. In his
                    message, December 1, 1815, Governor Thomas Posey said:</p>
            <p>"Our emigration which is rapidly populating our fertile lands in a
                    little time will enable us to be admitted into the political family of the
                    Union, as an independent State. Permit me to recommend to the legislature the
                    propriety as well as the justice of imposing as moderate taxes on the emigrants
                    to this territory as may be compatible with the public interest. Most of them
                    have moved from a great distance, at a considerable expense. They have to
                    encounter money difficulties in opening their farms for cultivation, before they
                    can derive a support, much more a profit from them; and consequently their
                    ability will be lessened from contributing largely for a short time to the
                    public exigencies."<hi rend="sup">31</hi>

            <p>This document expresses the essence of settlers'
                    troubles–getting on a paying basis after expending so much of their
                    limited capital to get to the new country and to pay for their farms. It took
                    the greater part of the first year for a settler to get a small clearing made.
                    Even on prairie land, it was a great task to get the sod broken and the soil
                    subdued for planting. Labor was scarce, and there was little money to pay what
                    labor was available. All of these factors, together with many others, made the
                    task of forming a new settlement a difficult one. The capital of the West was
                    thus used up in getting started, and in investments, so that there was little
                    left in getting crops to market at a distance. In 1819 the <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The General Assembly in 1815 followed the suggestion of the governor, and

                    the union, and as various in their customs and sentiments as in their persons.

            <p>One of the reasons given by the petitioners for asking as much as <hi rend="i">7</hi> per cent, of the proceeds of the land sales was that the settlers had
                    endured many dangers and hardships to found settlements in this wilderness, as a
                    consequence of which the government lands were to be enhanced in value. It was
                    thought that this fact would justify the settlers in asking for a large per
                    cent, of the sales. These settlers had political theories almost as acute as
                    those of the French philosophers, although they seldom made display of their
                    theories unless they thought their rights were being interfered with. In the
                    latter part of 1815, some of the settlers thought the general government was
                    interfering with their rights. For about seven years the boundary between whites
                    and the Indian country had been stationary, but the frontier line of settlement
                    had moved onward, and many squatters could be found on Indian soil, where they
                    had no legal right to be. So, December 12, 1815, President Madison ordered all
                    such "unlawful occupants" or "uninformed or
                    evil-disposed persons" to remove from such Indian lands by March 10,
                    1816, under penalty of the law. In case they had not removed by the time set,
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> marshal was to remove them.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A storm of protest ensued, but it seems that perhaps a majority of the squatters
                    never took the proclamation seriously. However, one editorial writer under the
                    name of "Farmers' and Patriots' Rights," in
                    a continued series of articles, vigorously asserted the rights of the squatters,
                    and magnified what he thought was the high patriotism shown by the settlers as
                    they "kept in awe for the last three years, a savage foe, whose
                    tomahawks and scalping knives would otherwise have glittered in our
                    houses… Are they," said he, "when danger has ceased
                    to threaten, to be called uninformed or evil-disposed and ordered off the land
                    their presence alone has hithertofore secured?" This writer maintained
                    that the pre-emption laws passed by Congress at various times, benefitting those
                    who had settled illegally on government land, were as surely violations of the
                    law for preventing squatters from settling on <list type="footnotes">

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> executive set an act at defiance, that the people should
                    not?"</p>
            <p>His final argument was that such a policy of removal would injure the Territory
                    By weakening the frontier, by taking away those daring men who had been keeping
                    back the Indians.<hi rend="sup">40</hi> Additional force is given these squatter
                    arguments when it is remembered that because of recent hostilities, many of the
                    settlers could not pay the final or fourth annual' installments on the
                    farms which they had purchased from the government. Upon this failure to make
                    the final payment, the settlers were obliged to forfeit their farms back to the
                    government, thus losing what they had paid down, and their improvements. Such
                    losses during the hostilities were comparatively great, running up to several
                    thousands of dollars. In 1813 more than half as much land reverted to the
                    government as was bought.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The same persons who were
                    obliged to lose money because of the hostilities, were the daring men who had
                    been engaged in protecting the frontier–which protection enabled the
                    government to sell the lands at better advantage. The losses helped to unify the
                    settlers in their expression of what they called their rights.</p>

            <p>The growth of towns, that had been begun in 1814, increased, and much capital was
                    invested in town improvements. Many paper towns were advertised during the year
                    1817, but a large part of these could not be found by the
                    "tender-foot" purchasers and many of the towns have not been
                    heard of since. Others, however, received a substantial growth. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which three years before was merely a collection of huts, had
                    grown to be a flourishing county seat, with seventy-five dwellings, in which
                    lived a prosperous people. In this town were thirty-one mechanics of various
                    trades. It received mail three times a week, and supported a weekly
                        newspaper.<hi rend="sup">47</hi> In this year about 5,000 gallons of wine
                    were pressed from the grapes at <placeName>

                    with extensive farms, large barns and busy shops. All sorts of trades were
                    carried on, such as shoemaking, saddlery, weaving, etc. These communists in 1817
                    reaped a harvest from many acres of vines, 200 acres of wheat, 40 acres rye, 20
                    of barley, 30 of oats, and they had a meadow of 50 acres. They had a large stock
                    of cattle, hogs and merino sheep, the wool of which they manufactured into
                    broadcloth. A large ornamental garden, well-tended, caught the eye and fancy of
                        travelers.<hi rend="sup">49</hi> In the fall this colony was largely
                    augmented in numbers by a fresh immigration, about 1,000 being expected.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> This town became for a few years, one of the most noted

                    this paper money as possible to the investors. Bad banking stimulated greater
                    investments, and desire to invest stimulated bad banking.</p>
            <p>In the early part of 1818 the Indiana State legislature passed an act for the
                    execution of the estates of insolvent debtors–a law that seemed fair
                    to debtors and creditors, but which was oppressive to the debtors, however just
                    it might appear. The debtor, after legal exemptions for personal property were
                    made, was to surrender the remainder of this property to the county courts which
                    would sell the property to pay the creditors.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Because
                    money was scarce, and debtors could not pay, sheriff sales became common. The

                    either? Both were very scarce in the West. When the farmer sold his produce, he
                    had to accept the various issues of paper money then in circulation, or the
                    "shin plasters" issued by the merchants. If he did accept this
                    paper for his produce he could not pay for his land with it, and neither could

                    opportunities for speculation for those who can command funds which are
                    receivable, unless Congress shall interfere in their behalf."<hi rend="sup">73</hi> If land could be paid for only at a heavy discount on the
                    money which the farmers were compelled to accept for their produce, this
                    discount, the governor said, was "an indirect but exorbitant tax on the
                    farmer." He said that there were two reasons for this condition:</p>
            <p>(1) There was a mere regulation adopted to the interest of the stockholders of
                    the national bank, referring to the fact that this bank, in 1818, refused after
                    June 30, 1818, to accept any money except its own notes and specie.</p>
            <p>(2) The national bank was aided in this purpose by the Treasury Department, which
                    refused to accept from the debtors anything but specie and currency of the
                    national bank. Undoubtedly the governor was expressing the general view of the

            <p>The State legislature came to the aid of the debtors, and legislated for their
                    benefit. The amount of personal property exempted from sale, under execution for
                    debt, was considerably enlarged.<hi rend="sup">74</hi> A few days later the
                    General Assembly passed an act, to go into effect in January, 1819, compelling
                    the creditor to accept the paper of the State bank and its branches and of all
                    other chartered banks whose money was "current with the
                    merchants" at the time, or, should the creditor refuse to accept it at
                    par, the debtor should have a stay of execution for one year. Obviously this was
                    partial to the debtor, entirely unfair to the creditor, a political job, and,
                    under less distressing conditions, would have appeared a disgrace upon the
                    General Assembly.<hi rend="sup">75</hi> In the State senate, all members except
                    one, voted for the measure, and this one represented border counties where land

            <p>Such legislation soon raised opposition on the part of certain classes, for it
                    was evident that the law passed for the relief of debtors was aimed as much for

                    system of the State as injurious and dangerous, and that its influence was
                    "already too prevalent in our legislative councils." <hi rend="sup">77</hi> The incoming settlers opposed the State bank, because

                    with the Government to promote; the former by lending money to the speculators,
                    and the latter by this wretched system of selling the lands on credit. Nearly
                    all the money which is paid, goes over the mountains; the Government has but

            <p>This last grievance was a very real one, and was felt by all. Many of the
                    immigrants brought good money with them to pay for the lands. The government,

                    received for lands was taken to the Eastern banks for deposit. At the beginning
                    of 1819 the State bank of Indiana at <placeName>

            <p>The petition was granted, but the last deposit was made in June, 1820, because

            <p>When the General Assembly met in the winter of 1819, it had to struggle with the
                    distressing conditions. The popular opposition which had shown itself to the
                    State bank had been active, and now appeared in the General Assembly, 1819-1820.
                    The previous General Assembly had ordered that all county and State collectors
                    of revenue should collect the bills of the State banks and of about all the
                    State and private banks of the surrounding States as long as such paper passed
                    current in the State. The notes of the <placeName>

                    the year 1819 it was found that scarcely any of the bills passed current, so the
                    new General Assembly of 1819-1820, repealed the former act, and passed an act
                    authorizing the collectors to accept notes of "the banks of the <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Bank, by the end of 1819, was coming into favor in Indiana. The
                    State election of 1820 was conducted upon the question as to whether the State
                    bank should be compelled to redeem its notes or not. Only a few friends of the
                    State bank were returned to the General Assembly.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General Assembly also passed one of those ingenious laws for the
                    "relief of debtors." By this act, if a debtor could not meet
                    his obligations, the sheriff should provide for "an inquest of five
                    respectable freeholders," who should estimate the value of the property
                    of the debtor whose property was to be sold under execution. No property was to
                    be sold "for less than two-thirds of the returned value of the
                    inquest." If the property would not sell for at least two-thirds of its
                    assessed value, there should be a stay of execution for one year. It is obvious
                    that in a country where nearly all the people were debtors, it would be
                    impossible to get "five respectable freeholders who would assess the
                    property low enough that it would find a purchaser even at two-thirds its
                    assessed value.</p>
            <p>Congress also came to the relief of the debtors. In fact, relief acts of some
                    kind had passed Congress nearly every year since lands were first put on sale in
                    Indiana. In 1818, 1819, and 1820 relief acts were passed for the relief of
                    debtors. By these acts, debtors whose lands were subject to forfeiture, were
                    given an extension of credit for one year, if the holding did not exceed 640
                    acres. The final period, at the end of which forfeiture of land for non-payment
                    should take place, was extended by the last of these acts, to March 31, 1821.<hi rend="sup">85</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the factors mentioned by the various writers quoted possibly were
                    instrumental in bringing this distressing condition upon the West in 1819. Lack
                    of good money; extravagant living; excessive buying from the East; the drain of
                    money from the West through the land offices; excessive speculations in lands
                    and town property; bad and reckless banking; the restrictions placed by the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Bank and by the Secretary of the Treasury on what money would be
                    received at the branch banks and at the land offices. All these undoubtedly
                    operated in bringing disaster to business and farming in the West. But one
                    factor, though perhaps not so distinct, was really above all other causes, and
                    yet related to them. The credit system had been abused. Banks and individuals
                    would loan money without sufficient security, on investments that were not
                    likely to pay <list type="footnotes">

                    years' credit to land purchasers, and this unduly encouraged credit in
                    all financial operations. As a result, the greater part of the people in the
                    West were in debt, and could not meet their obligations, as the amount of
                    acceptable money available became less and less. By December 31, 1820, the total
                    indebtedness at the land offices in Indiana was $2,214,168.63, which
                    amounted to a per capita indebtedness of $15 to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Government alone, in a population of 147,178.<hi rend="sup">86</hi>
                    This was a great indebtedness in a land where money was so scarce. Probably this
                    indebtedness was not more than half of the entire indebtedness in the State.</p>
            <p>Twenty years of the credit system in its operations on the public land sales had
                    shown its incompetency. It had worked disastrously to the Western people. In
                    1820 Congress passed an act establishing a new system of land sales. Treat, in
                    speaking of the act, said it "was the most important piece of land
                    legislation since the Congress of the Confederation laid down the principle of
                    the American land system in 1785." Credit was abolished, and the
                    minimum price was reduced from $2 to $1.25 per acre. After
                    July 1, 1820, cash must be paid for land, and land could be purchased in tracts
                    as small as eighty acres.<hi rend="sup">87</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With credit on lands abolished, and speculation stopped of necessity, the country
                    could only wait for better times. As David Brown, the new president of the Bank
                    at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    "It will be a gradual work, and a steady perseverance will accomplish
                    it." <hi rend="sup">88</hi> The new land system helped in this, for it
                    required that prospective purchasers should bring their money into the West with
                    them. The General Land Office, too, arranged to deposit the money for the public
                    land sales in the various State and private banks throughout the West, so that
                    it might enlarge the amount of much-needed money.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> The

            <p>A decade had seen many changes in Indiana. It began with Tecumtha's
                    conspiracy to prevent further advances of the whites. The hostilities which were
                    thus precipitated lasted till the middle of 1814 on the eastern border, and till
                    the end of 1815 on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>. During this period continued migration to Indiana consolidated the
                    territory in the older regions and increased population in 1814 and 1815 enabled
                    the territory to become a State in 1816. As hostilities lessened, increased
                    immigration, excessive speculation, reckless banking, and the credit system,
                    began to affect the economic situation. These causes were stimulated in 1816
                    when Indiana became a State, and the middle <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> region began to be peopled. The climax of these operations came in
                    the form of the financial depression of 1819. There were in 1819 thirty
                    counties, extensive farming lands, and many new towns, more or less prosperous.
                    The settlements arranged themselves in the form of a crescent, with the tips in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Randolph</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>
                    </placeName> counties, and the center at the capital, Corydon. The next decade
                    was to see the filling in of the rich country between the two tips of the
                    crescent, and the moving to the new capital at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. With the cession of the Indians in 1818 of the central part of the
                    State, settlers began rapidly to move toward the interior. Hardly had the
                    treaties been signed when Jacob Whetzel cut the famous "Whetzel
                    Trace" inland from Brook-ville to the <geogName>White river</geogName>,

                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                    </placeName> road about a mile south of Parish Grove. At the intersection Thomas
                    Torrence kept a tavern.</p>
            <p>In the grove was another tavern kept by Robert Alexander. The Alexander tavern
                    was the most noted one on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> road. Here was toddy and a frontier welcome for the traveler,
                    home-seeker, or hunter. Many of the latter came to hunt deer, wild turkeys,
                    prairie chickens and quail. In the spring and autumn myriads of wild geese and
                    ducks were to be seen and the heavens were darkened by flocks of wild pigeons.
                    The tavern was a modest affair. There were several bed rooms, the big
                    dining-room, and the indespensible bar-room where the men loafed. Around the big
                    fireplace on a cold night mine host entertained his guests with the traditions
                    of the famed grove and of the Indians who made it their home. There were tales
                    of those lost on the prairie, the dreaded prairie fire, and the bravery and
                    self-denial of the early pioneers. The grove was a favorite camping place, as it
                    afforded shelter in time of storms, furnished wood for the camp fires and close
                    to the tavern was a spring of pure cold water. In the 40's and
                    50's there was a constant stream of "prairie
                    schooners" over this road. Through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> it wound over the broad prairie broken only by Parish and Sugar
                    groves, while farther to the north it led through bog and fen. The swift running
                    deer often crossed the path and the gaunt wolf sniffed the evening meal and with
                    his echoing howls called his ever hungry comrades. There were tragedies on the
                    old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> road. Many an emigrant or some member of his <pb n="398" id="VAA4025-010-4-068"/> family sickened and died and found a resting place
                    in an unmarked grave along its way.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Road was a historic thoroughfare in its time, it being the main
                    artery of communication for travel from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the thriving city on the lake. When <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> became a live stock market thousands of cattle and horses were
                    driven over it. In places it was from thirty to forty rods wide, the teamsters
                    leaving the deeply worn places to find better footing, especially during a wet
                    time. The trail could be followed by the timothy and blue grass that grew along
                    the way, having been started from seed that had been dropped by teamsters going
                    to and from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>, or the land hunters from <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> on their way to the Northwest. In the fall many hauled apples from
                    Southern Indiana to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and many were the small boys who begged pennies from their mothers
                    to buy the luscious fruit. Evidence of this old trail still remains, the beaten
                    path in places being easily discernable across the fields.</p>
            <p>At the several stopping places taverns were to be found for the accommodation of
                    the travelers. The numbers and the frontier sociability at these places did much
                    to soften the asperities of travel especially during inclement weather. After
                    Parish Grove was passed going north the following were the stopping places: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Sumner's Grove</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The trip required from six to eight days, all depending upon the
                    condition of the roads and streams, the latter being forded. This road was
                    abandoned in 1865 or 1866.</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Benton county</region>
                    </placeName> pioneers made the trip to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in companies sometimes ten to twelve in number. The wagons were
                    usually drawn by oxen, two yoke to a wagon. In the fall when the roads were good
                    they often drove two teams of horses to a wagon and when the city was reached
                    one of the teams was sold. Travel to the south on this road was mostly to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where the land office was located, or to the Yountsville woolen
                    mills close by.</p>
            <p>There are still a few living in the county who went to and fro over the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Road, and as they journeyed along the winding trail watched the
                    days go over the Western plains.</p>

            <p>For the purpose of starting a museum of Indiana History at Indiana University,
                    Warder W. Stevens recently gave to the University a valuable and extensive
                    collection of materials illustrating pioneer life in the State.</p>
            <p>The collection includes relics from nearly all fields of pioneer activity. There
                    is a fully equipped conestoga wagon, one of the real old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Prairie</settlement>
                    </placeName> Schooners; there are several plows, including the wooden, wooden
                    moldboard, jumping shovel, home-made double shovel, and others, with the single
                    and double-trees to match; there are cradles, sickles, a thresher, a cotton gin,
                    a hominy mill, a corncracker, a feed cutter, and many other relics to illustrate
                    this phase of life; there are spider skillets, ovens for baking corn pones,
                    pewter and wooden table ware, a crane for cooking in the fireplace, arid a full
                    assortment of what the old sales bills would call "household and
                    kitchen furniture too numerous to mention"; there is a loom, spinning
                    wheels, reels, winding blades and. some things along this. line for which I have
                    no names at present; there are flintlock, percussion caps, rifled and
                    smooth-bore guns wtih an assortment of bowie knives, pistols and revolvers.</p>
            <p>The following brief article written by the donor as he was waiting for a train
                    will convey some idea of the collection and the sentiment that makes such things
                    dear to the sons and daughters of the pioneers.— Ed.</p>
            <p>All of us, in a greater or less degree, find pleasure in comparing the present
                    with the past in order that we may note the rapid strides that have been made
                    along all industrial and educational lines since the days of our forefathers. We
                    look back over a brief life's space and are wrapt in wonderment as we
                    contemplate the rapid developments and achievements of a hustling, bustling
                    people along every walk of life. We listen to the stories of miraculous
                    accomplishments, but-we fail to catch onto the spirit of the age fully, until an
                    object lesson is placed before our eyes, which enables us, at a glance, to fully
                    realize that we stand in the midst of a rapidly developing age with
                    possibilities beyond all power of conception. For example, we can scarcely
                    realize that only a few years since there was no telephone, or that no farther
                    back than 1898 there was but one concern on the continent that had begun the
                    manufacture of the automobile. What an object lesson in rapid development it
                    would be to place that first horseless carriage alongside one of the most
                    complete models of the present day!</p>
            <pb n="400" id="VAA4025-010-4-070"/>
            <p>I am asked to give a brief account of the collection of relics recently turned
                    over to Indiana University as a nucleus that is bound to grow until it will at
                    no distant day become a very interesting and instructive feature of this great
                    seat of learning in Indiana. The collector, like the specialist along all
                    progressive lines, is probably born, not made. Early in life most all of us show
                    some peculiar bent of mind that has much to do in shaping our destiny of
                    life's <hi rend="b">work. As I</hi> now look back over a period of more
                    than three score years it is plain to be seen that as a boy I had a <hi rend="i">penchant</hi> for the collection of old "traps" and but
                    for this love of preserving relics of various kinds many of the interesting
                    things this little collection contains would have been missing, as it would now
                    be impossible to duplicate them, except by model or imitation.</p>
            <p>The several thousand pieces of the prehistoric section were almost all picked up
                    in Southern Indiana, mostly in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName>. Whenever there was an idle day, or a day off from regular duty or
                    occupation, it was a great pleasure to roam the hills and valleys in search of
                    the old-time Indian village or camping ground, or in digging into the monument
                    of the mound builders, in search of those mute speciments of handicraft that
                    told of a people that in other years or ages existed and nourished in our land.
                    In many ways it is left for the imagination to picture out where these people
                    originally came from, how they employed their time and existed or what was the
                    cause of their fading away from the earth's surface. Not infrequently a
                    whole bunch of stone hoes, spear points, axes, tomahawks or arrows would be
                    unearthed near a spot where burned stones, flint chips and a nearby spring
                    showed that some time in the remote past there existed a village of Red Men or
                    the mound builder. The scattered finds were pieces lost by the hunter in the
                    underbrush while in pursuit of game. As a matter of course all these finds are
                    becoming scarce as the years go by and the country is being cleaned up and put
                    under cultivation. The most valuable finds were always made along the large
                    rivers and streams where not only hunting was best, but fishing could be
                    indulged in with greatest success. Bone fish hooks are still to be found in some
                    places along the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName> where the larger Indian
                    villages were located.</p>
            <p>As one looks at the wooden mould board plow it hardly seems possible that they
                    could ever have been used successfully by the husbandman in breaking up new
                    lands, full of grubs and roots. But they were a decided improvement over the
                    forked stick, its immediate predecessor. The "bar share" came
                    first in the order of invention, <pb n="401" id="VAA4025-010-4-071"/> it being
                    the flat share, with wooden mould-board attachment, fastened to the plow stock
                    or frame with wooden pins, bolts for such purpose not having as yet come into
                    general use. The pair of wooden double-trees, now over a century old, show to
                    what straights the farmer of that day was compelled to resort in order to get a
                    field with team and plow to cultivate the land. Almost every farmer was then a
                    sort of Jack-at-all-trades. He manufactured his own harness from leather of his
                    own tanning, and such farm implements as were used were home products. No such
                    thing as a plow or wagon factory was to be found anywhere in the country,
                    especially in the newly settled portions. Hoes, spading forks, nails, knives and
                    forks, spoons and the like were manufactured by the blacksmith, who burned the
                    charcoal that was used in the forge of the shop.</p>
            <p>But to go back to the plows, the "Carey" was successor to the
                    bar-share pattern. It was made with an upright iron projection extending above
                    the flat bar, finished with a smaller wooden mould-board. This plow came into
                    use in Indiana about 1815. The earliest settlers, about 1800, located in the
                    southern tier of counties, were content with the bar share. The "Daniel
                    Webster" plow came into use about 1835, the share and mould board being
                    made of un-wrought and cast iron. In a remodeled form it was known as the
                    "Peacock" plow, a man by that name back East, probably in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName>, having first made and put it upon the market. The mould-board was
                    cast in the furnaces up in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pennsylvania</settlement>
                    </placeName> and shipped down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> on rafts or flat boats to destination, where they were fitted to
                    plow stocks by the wagon-wright or blacksmith, the latter not infrequently being
                    able to work in both iron and wood successfully. About the year 1850 the
                    "Rounder" came into use, a plow that had share and mould all
                    in one solid piece, and made of steel, the first plow made that would scour in
                    light, loose soils. They were used in cultivating corn, running the bar side
                    next to the row till last cultivating when the earth was thrown up against the
                    corn. The jumping shovel was its successor in corn cultivation, as well as in
                    breaking up new land. The double shovel cultivator with wooden frame was first
                    made and used along in the 50's.</p>
            <p>Spinning wheels, large and small, were to be found in every well-furnished home,
                    home-made in most instances, and kept buzzing by the housewife in manufacture of
                    thread and yarn to be used in making the homespun linen, jeans and flannels that
                    was worked up into wearing apparel for the entire family.</p>
            <p>The very first settlers were content with cabins with puncheon <pb n="402" id="VAA4025-010-4-072"/> floors and doors, but a little later on the whipsaw
                    was introduced to make such boards as were necessary in home building. In this
                    collection is a saw brought into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Washington county</region>
                    </placeName> about 1807 and used for a number of years. A poplar log, the
                    yellow, soft variety, was hewn square, and then mounted upon some sort of
                    trestle about seven feet above the ground. On top it was lined off with blue dye
                    or poke-berry juice, the lines being spaced according to the" thickness
                    of lumber or joists desired. One sawyer was located on top of the log and
                    another underneath, and with every downward stroke of the saw a cut into the
                    timber was made. Two good sawyers would thus cut about two hundred feet per day.
                    The last time the saw in this collection was used was on exhibition display at a
                    Granger picnic near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 187G, when Bluejeans Williams was a candidate for Governor, who
                    was top sawyer, and a man named Morris pulled at the handle underneath. What a
                    contrast there is between this saw, considered a great invention a century ago,
                    and the immense sawmill plants in the lumber camps of the country where lumber
                    by the thousands of feet are turned out every hour of the day.</p>
            <p>The old-time trundle bed, upon which John Hay, the celebrated author and
                    statesman, slept during his boyhood days in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, is a relic every Hoosier should feel proud of. The dog-wood glut
                    or wedge, unquestionably made by Lincoln's hands during his youthful
                    days in Southern Indiana, when he earned his name as the "Rail
                    Splitter" President, is one of the interesting pieces of this
                    collection.</p>
            <p>The various items in this collection are carded and briefly described, and when
                    all are properly arranged in cases will no doubt be interesting to students of
                    the University who care to compare the present with the past. And it is to be
                    hoped that this display may induce others who have old-time relics or heirlooms
                    of an interesting nature to deposit same with the University, and that in time a
                    very interesting historical museum may be collected.</p>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, died August 23, 1914. Mr. Lamb was the son of. Michael
                    and Katherine (Mc-Govern) Lamb, both of whom were born in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName> throughout his entire life. When a young man he studied law in the
                    office of Voorhees &amp; Carlton, and was admitted to practice in 1874. At
                    the time of his death, he was a member of the law firm of Lamb, Beasley,
                    Douthitt &amp; Crawford.</p>
            <p>During the whole of his mature period, Mr. Lamb was an active leader in the
                    Democratic party. He was appointed prosecuting attorney for the judicial
                    district, including the counties of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>

                    </placeName>, in 1875 to fill a vacancy, and was elected to the same office in
                    1876. In 1880, and also in 1888, his name appeared on the Democratic ticket as a
                    candidate for presidential elector. In 1882, he was elected to represent his
                    congressional district in the national House of Representatives. He was a
                    candidate for re-election in 1884 but was defeated. In 1886, he was again
                    nominated, but again suffered defeat. He served his party as a delegate in
                    several national conventions, including those of 1896 and 1912, presiding at one
                    session of the latter convention.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lamb was united in marriage to Esther, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Kent,
                    in 1890. One son, John Kent Lamb, was born in 1902. The widow and son survive
                    the deceased.</p>

                        <salute>My Dear Mrs. Lamb:—</salute>
                        <p>I wired my sympathy last night as soon as I received the sad news
                                    of Mr. Lamb's death. It occurs to me that in this dark
                                    hour it may lighten your burden of sorrow to know that for more
                                    than a year the President has held the office of ambassador to
                                    Mexico for Mr. Lamb– the appointment only awaiting
                                    the restoration of peace in that country.</p>
                        <p>It is a special disappointment to us that Mr. Lamb did not live
                                    long enough to receive this merited recognition of his worth and
                                    political <pb n="404" id="VAA4025-010-4-074"/> services.
                                    Vice-President Marshall and Senators Kern and Shively will, I
                                    know, share this disappointment. Again expressing condolence,</p>

                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> and a widely known Indiana Democrat, died September 21 at his home.
                    He was the Democratic candidate for secretary of State in 1900, and was the
                    candidate on the Democratic State ticket for clerk of the Supreme Court in 1902.
                    Mr. Heimberger was prominent in the Evangelical Church and was district

                    ever before been registered at the State gathering of the D. A. R. in Indiana</p>
            <p>The State organization now numbers fifty-four chapters with a total of 2,582
                    members, in addition to 90 members-at-large.</p>
            <p>That the Indiana State society of Daughters of the American Revolution is having
                    a steady and substantial growth was shown by the report of the state regent,
                    Mrs. Frances H. Robertson, submitted Wednesday morning.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Robertson stated that during her three years' regency there had
                    been an addition of 264 new members, of whom more than one-third were members of
                    newly-organized chapters of the year 1913-1914 at <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The State organization has lost two chapters and gained five. Attempts have been

                    </placeName> in forming chapters but nothing definite has as yet been done.
                    Chapters can be formed if the State regent will visit the towns and further
                    arouse interest.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Robertson expressed her appreciation of the always able <pb n="405" id="VAA4025-010-4-075"/> and cordial support afforded her by her co-workers
                    and the program committee. She urged greater consideration of the home, of
                    husband and of children as upon them depend the safety and stability of the
                    nation. "Train your sons to be good and patriotic citizens and your
                    daughters to be homemakers with their highest ambition to be queen of a home and
                    mother of children," urged the regent. That her remarks met with
                    approval was shown by a burst of applause.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Robertson's interesting report was a mingling of statistical facts,
                    historical incidents and poetic thought.</p>
            <p>"The hardest thing a regent has to contend with is that women want to
                    hold office. Every office carries its responsibility of some duty, however, and
                    no member of a chapter is without some sort of work to do if she carries out the
                    thought and the aim of the society. If women desire to help their chapters and
                    their chapter regents they can do no two things better than to be present at all
                    meetings and be prompt in attendance.</p>
            <p>Mrs Robertson greatly deplored the entrance of "politics" into
                    the national organization and gave as a comparison the great work of the W. C.
                    T. U., which is accomplishing so much without quarreling and quibbling. An
                    announcement of the candidacy of Mrs. G. J. Guernsey, of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, for the office of president-general of the national society and
                    parts of her platform were read and the State regent heartily endorsed such
                    planks as she read as coincident with her own ideas of real progress and the
                    highest purpose of both national and State societies.</p>
            <p>The chief address of the program was given by Mrs. Charles W Bassett, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Md., who was one of the first visitors to arrive. Mrs. Bassett is
                    historian general for the National Society of the Daughters of the American
                    Revolution, and with her mother and sisters were among the founders of the
                    society, which is not yet a quarter of a century old. But in spite of the many
                    things Mrs. Bassett has done and is doing, for she is a farmer, is preisdent of
                    the Woman's Exchange in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>–with over two hundred consigners weekly–has a
                    home with her husband and daughter to look after, she has enough enthusiasm left
                    to scatter at every meeting or convention of the D. A. R. she attends.</p>
            <p>Owing to the prominence of Mrs. Bassett in the national society of the
                    organization, her address was anticipated with unusual interest and the
                    auditorium was filled with an audience of men and women whose attention was
                    gripped by the force and inspiring content <pb n="406" id="VAA4025-010-4-076"/>
                    of her address and who were touched by the charm of her very evident natural and
                    sincere personality.</p>
            <p>Early in her address Mrs. Bassett referred to the Bible story of the three,
                    stewards, remarking of the two who did something that their reply to the Master
                    was in fourteen words each, while the one who hid his talent and laid it away
                    took fifty-two words to make his statement about himself. Without pursuing the
                    analogy further Mrs. Bassett asked concerning the work of the past, if it is not
                    greater to create than to examine and report. In that way then can the work of
                    the spirit that actuated the heroes of the revolution and their immediate
                    descendants be preserved and cultivated in the hearts of the present and future
                    generations? This query, put by Mrs. Bassett was. enlarged upon as she gave
                    remarkable as well as interesting facts and suggestions. She said patriotism is
                    not something to be carried out by societies organized to perpetuate the
                    memories of the men and women who laid the foundation of this great republic but
                    is rather to instill a regard for the spirit of self sacrifice which was a
                    dominant trait in the character of the heroes, men or women, of the early years
                    of this country.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bassett urged the preservation of historical records and told of many
                    documents of value that had been brought from Salvation Army piles of waste
                    paper where they had been consigned by men and women who in their housecleaning
                    efforts from time to time had "cleared out the old rubbish."
                    Mrs. Bassett also talked of the destruction of old historic places, landmarks,
                    alteration of names of streets, occupation of buildings, even of churches,
                    commercialized as places of business and referred to the preservation of
                    beautiful and sacred Mt. Vernon through the efforts of a woman of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ncu">North Carolina</region>
                    </placeName>. Referring to the admiration often given in extravagant praise to
                    old historic spots abroad and the familiarity many Americans have with the
                    "old country," Mrs. Bassett asked, "Isn't
                    our history picturesque; hasn't this country any romance?" The
                    price of the peace we enjoy was the bloodshed of thousands of brave men. To
                    forget is to be ungrateful for our blessings.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bassett praised the western country and coincident with that part of her
                    address urged that Indiana should have written and published a history of
                    herself and a copy be sent to the National Society of D. A. R. Mrs. Bassett
                    referred to the idiomatic speech of Bret Harte–as one
                    example–of Whitcomb Riley as another, saying that the plea for one
                    English speaking language was good but deploring the disappearance in records of
                    things that have been a part of the character making and upbuilding of the
                    people. Mrs. <pb n="407" id="VAA4025-010-4-077"/> Bassett is a believer in
                    "family trees," even if the crop is sometimes a failure, in
                    keeping records from generation to generation of birth, marriages, etc., and in
                    instilling a regard and a respect for the family; for home and the love of
                    liberty, the most priceless of blessings of the many with which this country is
                    endowed.</p>
            <p>The entire exercises of the session were extremely interesting and the musical
                    features brought great applause.</p>
            <p>Interest upon the choice of a design for a flag to be adopted by the conference
                    with an idea of a further request of the state legislature to make this accepted
                    design a State flag, had a setback un-looked for. It had been understood that
                    Indiana had no flag, but one of the committee on investigation produced a copy
                    of the Indiana banner or emblem, accepted by the legislature previous to
                    Governor Mount's election, which she had recently received with a
                    letter from the Secretary of State, L. G. Ellingham. The letter stated that this
                    banner of the State was not called a flag, but was the official emblem used in
                    connection with the State seal.</p>
            <p>The matter of whether the State Conference of Daughters should adopt a design for
                    a flag as their own insignia or adornment was postponed in the future.</p>
            <p>Mrs. James B. Fowler, chairman of the committee on resolutions, read resolutions
                    extending thanks to the local chapter, to the press, to various chairmen of
                    committees, to the presiding officer, Mrs. Frances H. Robertson, for numerous
                    courtesies, to musicians and others who lent aid and the consideration for
                    delegates extended by the Anthony Hotel.</p>
            <p>The conference was voted one of the most successful, as well as the largest in
                    the history of the organization.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting features of the State Conference of the D. A. R. was
                    a talk by Mrs. W. B. Neff, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, who is chairman for the National Girl Homemakers of <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName>. Mrs. Neff spoke without notes and so brimful is she of her work
                    that statistics, word pictures and description of plans rolled from her lips
                    almost faster than she could speak them. Mrs. Neff's talk was of
                    compelling interest and her audience gave her flattering attention. In
                    commenting upon the work of the branch of educational work which she represents,
                    Mrs. Neff said that the divorce evil was in a measure the result of unprepared
                    girls and young women to make the home what it should be. Eighty-five per cent,
                    of the divorces secured are sought by women and sixty-seven per cent, of the
                    eighty-five are sought with the excuse of lack of financial support. On the
                    other hand, Mrs. Neff declared the cause of the <pb n="408" id="VAA4025-010-4-078"/> greater part of marital trouble to be the ignorance
                    of the wife for domestic affairs. The majority of girls marry with no knowledge
                    of cooking, sewing, planning, keeping things clean, saving "the
                    pennies," mending or the hundred and one things a competent housekeeper
                    knows about. The strong old Anglo-Saxon word, "help," used in
                    early days of this country in the sense of employed household service has been
                    lost to use just because of the incompetency of the girls employed to be that
                    very thing, a "help" in the household. But the incompetency is
                    not confined to those who can be obtained through the medium of the employment
                    bureaus. They are found in the homes of the laborer, the artisan, the
                    manufacturer, the millionaire. Now with the loss of life and the awful
                    destruction going on in the European war, the American woman will
                    become–in the words of an eminent writer–the
                    "torch bearer of the world." The American woman must establish
                    the standard. And yet, according to more statistics from Mrs. Neff in a long
                    procession of employes of an industrial concern in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> but one-tenth of them were Americans. That is but one example. The
                    duty of <placeName>
                        <country>America</country>
                    </placeName> is to teach. So the work of the Girl Homemakers club is to educate
                    the foreigners to be fitted to make the American home. In <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> the work has been taken up by the D. A. R. Society and similar work
                    is being done in other organizations of the Daughters.</p>
            <p>Reports on different phases of works of the society were given during the
                    afternoon by Mrs. Newberry J. Howe on the reciprocity bureau, and Mrs. Harry V.
                    Sheridan. The report on conservation by Mrs. M. C. Garber, another of welfare
                    women and children by Mrs. Martha B. Hanna, who is state chairman and also a
                    member of the national society's board of historians, and a talk on old
                    trail roads by Mrs. W. W. Garr, on the Daughters' magazine, by Miss
                    Mary Alice Warren, and report of the movement for children of the American
                    Revolution, by Mrs. H. W. Moore, were other important subjects taken up for the
                    day. A dinner at the Anthony and a reception given by the local chapter at the
                    home of Mrs. Roberts in the vening were the social events of the day.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Henry A. Beck, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>

            <p>The selection of Mrs. Beck for the highest office of the State organization
                    followed the nomination of Mrs. W. A. Cullop, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, for the same honor and the immediate withdrawal of Mrs. Cullop as
                    a candidate, owing to her receiving Thursday morning from Mrs. W. C. Story,
                    president-general of the national society, a request to serve as corresponding
                    secretary-general on the national board.</p>

                    of his graduate students are doing research work in this field. The district
                    superintendents are assisting and the interest is reaching individual
                    congregations. In such a large field there is no limit to the amount of work to
                    be done.</p>

            <p>The history of other churches, such as the Baptists, Disciples, Congregational,

                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> and Benton counties on the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName> campaign. Harrison feared an ambuscade. For that reason he crossed
                    the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at the site of the present town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Montezuma</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He sent scouts to cut a road upon the east side of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName>, hoping to thus deceive the Indians if they intended an ambush. The
                    feint in the direction of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> towns was also made to disclose any forces hiding in the vicinity
                    of Pine Creek. As stated above the little army crossed the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> at what is now Montezuma.</p>
            <p>From this point they skirted the prairie. They detailed sixteen men as a guard to
                    prevent an ambush from the river between the camp and the river. These sixteen
                    men were deployed on each side of Pine creek nearly straight north from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName> and just abou: where the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName> road starts across the Pine creek bottoms in going to Kramer. The
                    army skirted the prairie for the reason that in its march to the Battleground it
                    could easily watch and guard the left flank of the army and the view of the
                    prairie would prevent an ambush. There were many Indians along the river so the
                    soldiers left the timber land of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>
                    </placeName> well to their right as they moved northward. It took the soldiers
                    two hours to cross the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wabash</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Montezuma</settlement>
                    </placeName>. They then followed near the banks with the army, taking their
                    provisions in boats on <pb n="411" id="VAA4025-010-4-081"/> the river, to a
                    point a little below the mouth of Coal creek, which is a little below the south
                    line of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>. Here on the banks of the river they built a fort as a base of
                    supplies, sent forty men back to guard the women and children at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Harrison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and left eight men to guard the fort. With the assistance of W. W.
                    Pcrter and his wife and sons we were able to locate the site of this fort, which
                    is on the Porter land. John C. Colett, at one time the state geologist of
                    Indiana, a local historian of rare worth, had inspired Mr. Porter with a pride
                    in local history. The Porters were thus able to show the remains of the corduroy
                    roads made by the Harrison army through the swampy lands near their place. The
                    soldiers crossed the Little <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName> just south of
                    Eugene, at what is known as the "army ford" near the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Shelby</region>
                    </placeName> place. This was the principal camping ground of the Kickapoo
                    Indians. After crossing the <geogName>Vermillion river</geogName> they went
                    north to the prairie in the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, south of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Danville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, crossing the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> line south of State Line. Two private soldiers of the army were
                    buried in the <geogName>Gopher Hill</geogName> cemetery south of Marshfield. The
                    trail can be plainly seen through the yard of a farmer who has carefully
                    preserved it about a mile and a half northwest of the cemetery. They camped one
                    night in the Round grove, now the property of Frank Goodwine of <placeName>

                    grove was far out in the prairie. On their return trip two of the soldiers were
                    buried in this grove. The grove can be plainly seen from Sloan or Hed-rick.
                    Cassius M. Clay said the soldiers got blue grass seed here and carried it back

                    ford" of Pine creek above Brier's mill. On their return trip
                    they camped one night there. On the northwest shore of the creek two of the
                    soldiers died and were buried. There was a very large rock in the middle of the
                    road one mile south of the Butler place known as the "army
                    rock." It was a niggerhead and the largest niggerhead in <placeName>

            <p>Dr. Buck has gathered a list of county histories, atlasses, biographical
                    collections and a list of Territorial and State laws, as well as a descriptive
                    list of such books of travel and description as deal with <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and its history under the head of "Travel and
                    Description." The author has 660 titles. The description of the books
                    are brief, averaging about four to the page. The full titles are given together
                    with a very brief note indicating the nature of the volume, the number of pages,
                    the date and place of first publication and the number and date of later
                    editions. By a system of key letters a number of libraries are also indicated
                    where the books may be found. The titles are arranged in chronological order,
                    beginning with 1765. An excellent index disarms any criticism of this
                    arrangement by those who might prefer an alphabetical arrangement. The question
                    of typography evidently was more troublesome and has not been so well handled.</p>
            <p>In the field of county histories there are 463 entries. Here the arrangement is
                    chronologically by counties. It is worth noting that no single library has as
                    many as half the complete list. In the introduction to this section, the author
                    has made some observations worth quoting. In discussing the incentive to such
                    work he says, p. 255:</p>
            <p>The great mass of county histories produced in the west during the last forty
                    years has been the work of business enterprises pure and simple–an
                    enterprise which finds its basis in human vanity; in the desire of the average
                    middle-class American to see his name in print and to be able to read in a book
                    glowing accounts of himself, his family,. and his neighbors, their virtues, and
                    their achievements.</p>
            <p>Concerning their historical value he says, p. 257:</p>
            <p>To the student with the critical ability, who knows what to accept and what to
                    reject, they have a very considerable value. The probability of error is
                    certainly no greater than in the Medieval Chronicles, and <pb n="413" id="VAA4025-010-4-083"/> much of the information which can be gleaned from
                    them and which might otherwise escape the investigator can be verified from the
                    more original sources to which they point the way.</p>
            <p>Again on page 257 he says:</p>
            <p>No historical library is doing its full duty which fails to collect and preserve,
                    so far as possible, all books of this sort relating to parts of the territory
                    which it attempts to cover. As time goes on and the people and conditions with
                    which these books deal fade away into the remote past and as the books
                    themselves become scarce and difficult to procure, the value of such a
                    collection will be more and more apparent.</p>
            <p>The last section is devoted to the Territorial and State laws. This part of the
                    bibliography has no special interest to Indiana readers after 1808, when the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory was set off from Indiana.</p>
            <p>The volume is very useful to Indianians since nearly all travelers who did <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> also included Indiana in their itineraries.</p>

                    Oberholtzer, editor of the series called "The American Crisis

                    </placeName> University, had intended to write the volume but was compelled to
                    give it up. The design of the volume is to give a new, brief, popular version of
                    the story of Webster's life. Dr. Ogg has used only the easily
                    accessible materials contained in the <hi rend="i">Letters of Daniel
                    Webster</hi> published in 1902, and the eighteen volume edition of <hi rend="i">Webster's Writings and Speeches.-</hi> There is no pretense of any
                    search for new material, neither is there any new interpretations offered. As a
                    plain, straightforward chronological story it is very well done. It is an
                    interesting story all the way from the humble beginning in the <geogName>New
                        Hampshire hills</geogName> to the equally simple funeral at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Marshfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The style of the author, though at times wordy, is usually plain
                    and dignified. There is no attempt at rhetorical display, though the subject is
                    one which easily lends itself to that kind of writing. A list of the chief
                    events in his life chronologically arranged takes the place of an introduction.
                    The book is neatly <pb n="414" id="VAA4025-010-4-084"/> made, has a good index
                    and sufficient foot-notes for ordinary high-school purposes. For popular use or
                    for high-school libraries it will be a useful little volume.</p>

                    contains a brief but circumstantial history of the university by Irving Frederic
                    Brown. DePauw, or Asbury as it was formerly called, opened its doors in
                    September, 1839. It was extremely fortunate in having as its first president
                    Bishop Matthew Simpson. His salary was placed at $800 per year.
                    Besides being president he was professor of mathematics and the natural
                    sciences. There were eleven students. The curriculum was considered a very
                    liberal one, especially for a church school. Emphasis was shifted just a little
                    from the classics in the direction of English, public speaking, and modern
                    history. The collegiate year was divided into two semesters of twenty-one weeks
                    each. The book is an excellent little monograph.</p>

                    are giving considerable attention to the influence of the fur trade on the
                    settlement and early history of the western country. It furnished the ready
                    money to the first generation of settlers. Besides this the hunters and trappers
                    being the first in the field did the exploring and thus opened up routes to the
                    settlers, in large measure directing the line of settlement.</p>

                    fraternity of the northwest. Dr. Quaife's article is a criticism on the
                    sources of western history. The writer has dealt especially with the travelers.
                    The article is a timely warning to those writers who have been using such books
                    freely as source material. Professor Cox continues along his familiar line of

                    article by O. H. Williams on "The History Teacher as Viewed by the
                    History Student." The following quotation from the article is worth
                    keeping in mind at present when it seems that the "laying on"
                    of work constitutes the important function of the teacher: "To
                    cultivate a taste for historical reading, to create interest in the cultural and
                    humanistic aspects of history, to kindle a passion for the fascinating story of
                    human-kind, constitute far more vital educational results for the adolescent of
                    the secondary school than can come from mere drill."</p>
