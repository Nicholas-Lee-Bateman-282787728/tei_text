            		<p>These hymns and poems are collected into this volume
            			for my personal acquaintances and friends, and not for the
            			literary world. Many of them are memorial in their nature
            			and will have an interest, therefore, for some
            			readers aside from any special poetic merit. That they
            			are of unequal merit I am well aware; and I have been for
            			many years sufficiently acquainted with a limited range of
            			poetic literature to know quite well their merits and
            			demerits. Such as they are, and written quite hastily as
            			of necessity nearly all of them have been, I am sure that
            			my friends will receive them cordially into their homes
            			and libraries, collected as they now are from different
            			periodicals and manuscripts and presented in a single
            			volume. They are arranged, it will be seen, in chronological
order.</p>                                  <p rend="right sc">T. H. B.</p></div1></front>

		<lg><l rend="ti-2">"The noise as of a running brook</l>
	<l rend="ti-3">In the leafy month of June,</l>
			<l rend="ti-2">Which to the sleeping woods all night</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Singeth a quiet tune."</l></lg>
            		
<lg><l>The noise of running water is music to my ear;</l>
<l>I love to see the running brooks all seasons of the year;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">But when stern, stormy winter yields to spring its reign,</l>
<l>And all the ice and snow dissolve to water clear,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Then do I love to see it rush sparkling to the main.</l></lg>
            		
<lg><l>And very swiftly too, do the waters glide away;</l>
<l>The limpid stream that now is seen stays not a single day,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">But onward to the ocean so surely doth it glide,</l>
<l>That many, very many, a weary league away;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">The waters of the inland brook do mingle with the tide.</l></lg>
            		
<lg><l>Thus, like the waters of the brook, passes the life of man;</l>
<l>Swiftly, as its clear waters unto the ocean ran,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And passed without a single pause the longest life will be</l>
<l>And speedily, though lengthened to the longest span,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Will disappear within the ocean of eternity.</l></lg></div2>

            			<p>"Died--On Sunday, 21st June, 1846, at the residence
            				of her father, in Lake county, Ind., A<hi rend="sc">NN</hi>, the youngest
            				daughter of George and Elizabeth Belshaw, aged eighteen
years."</p>
            			<p>Thus was removed from among us one whose more
            				than ordinary natural grace, amiable qualities, and Christian
            				virtues, made her indeed the joy of her connections
and the delight of many hearts."</p>

<lg><l>We say that she is dead, but what is death?</l>
<l>Is it to cease to be forevermore?</l>
<l>When the low, sad, parting words are given,</l>
<l>Beside the bed of death is that indeed</l>
<l>The last farewell? And when that mournful look</l>
<l>From tearful eyes, so fixed and so prolonged,</l>
<l>Falls on the cold, inanimate clay</l>
<l>That lately was with life so radiant,</l>
<l>Is it all hopeless, ever more to view</l>
<l>That form, which the damp earth will soon receive?</l>
<l><hi rend="i">Oh no</hi>--love, praise and glory give, to H<hi rend="sc">IM</hi>,</l>
<l>The High and Holy One, that we are not</l>
<l>Thus comfortless.</l>
<l>A revelation has to us been made</l>
<l>From which we learn the soul will ever be;</l>
<l>Wil1 live and act to all eternity.</l>
<l>That death is but its separation from</l>
<l>The mortal frame, the frame that turns to dust;</l>
<l>And still again we learn, that tho' in dust,</l>
<l><hi rend="i">This</hi> will be brought to life to die no more.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A pleasant and a lovely one</l>
<l rend="ti-2">Has passed from earth away;</l>
<l>On her the spoiler set his seal,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">She might not, could not stay;</l>
<l>Away to realms of glory bright,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">The gentle spirit took its flight.</l></lg>
            			
<lg><l>Like a fair, fresh, opening rose bud,</l>

	<l rend="ti-2">This precious, priceless gem;</l>
<l>Called by a Father kind, away,</l>
<l>To shine in realms of endless day.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Sweet was the music, when she here</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Sang Zion's sacred songs;</l>
<l>But now ecstatic it must be,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">'Mid the angelic throngs,</l>
<l>As she beholds her Saviour's face,</l>
<l>And sings of all his matchless grace.</l></lg>
            			
<lg><l>She is a spirit, then is free</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">From earthly pain and woe;</l>
<l>Yet all her pleasures and rich joys</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">We do not, cannot know;</l>

<lg><l>I dreamed; for we may dream in waking hours;</l>
<l>I dreamed 't was almost midnight, on the last</l>
<l>Of this December's nights. That warning note</l>
<l>Which the clock gives five minutes from the hour,</l>
<l>Was given; and I mused, in silent thought,</l>
<l>How soon the old year would be gone. A step,</l>
<l>Solemn and stately, struck on fancy's ear;</l>
<l>And a strange form drew near. It paused. It spoke.</l>

<l>These are its fancied words:</l>
<l><hi rend="ti-3">"Behold me here,</hi></l>
<l>Bowed down with age, my journey almost o'er,</l>
<l>Three hundred, five and sixty times the sun</l>
<l>Over the earth its 'customed path has gone,</l>
<l>Since I began my course. Much have I seen.</l>
<l>When I was young, I clothed the earth in flowers</l>
<l>Of loveliest hue, of sweetest fragrance.</l>
<l>The cheerful notes of joyous birds were heard</l>
<l>From leafy boughs, at early, dewy morn.</l>
<l>Then did I cause more rich luxuriance still,</l>
<l>As all my vigor woke. Rich, golden grain</l>
<l>Waved in the harvest fields; and earth's green robes</l>
<l>Bowed to the mower's scythe. I onward went;</l>
<l>And strewed along my pathway luscious fruits</l>
<l>To gratify the appetite of man.</l>
<l>Then I grew old; and the green leaves assumed</l>
<l>Rich auburn tints and yellow hues; faded,</l>
<l>Withered, fell; and the snows of age came down</l>
<l>Upon the brown earth, and the naked boughs.</l>
<l>I have heard the merry notes of children,</l>
<l>As they wandered 'mid my flowers and streamlets,</l>
<l>Plucking with eager hands the fruits I gave.</l>
<l>And I have witnessed silent, gushing tears;</l>
<l>Tears for disappointed hopes, wounded pride,</l>

<l>And	her young light heart has been wooed and won.</l>
<l>I have seen the bride to the altar led;</l>
<l>The beautiful infant, yet unsullied</l>
<l>By this cold, bustling world, laid low in dust.</l>
<l>Ah! the young, and the old hundreds, thousands,</l>
<l>Who greeted my youth with joy and gladness,</l>
<l>Now <hi rend="i">are not</hi>. I have seen, too. the black crimes</l>
<l>Of the dark-hearted sons of men, on which</l>
<l>The light of day, and human eyes, looked not.</l>
<l>I have seen the acts of kindness, secret,</l>
<l>Untold deeds of love, of self-denial,</l>
<l>Sacrifice, recorded but in heaven.</l>
	<milestone unit="typography" rend="center" n="* * * * * "/>

<l>And enjoyed; I carry with me. Faithful</l>
<l>Are the records made. Whither I depart</l>
<l>I bear them. They must be met hereafter."</l>
<l>The midnight bell pealed on the ear. The voice</l>
<l>Had ceased: the form had vanished. Then I knew</l>
<l>The old year had forever gone, and half</l>
<l>Of this, the nineteenth, century had passed.</l>
<l>Its records sealed; its joys, its hopes, its fears,</l>
<l>A11 ended. Hour for deep and solemn thought.</l>
<l>This hour approaches. Who will fancy then,</l>
<l>They hear the voice of the departing year?</l></lg>

<l>How can I send it? Between us and you</l>
<l>Lie the red fields of battle. Fearful strife</l>
<l>Is raging now, and precious life-blood flows.</l>
<l>The written messengers of joy and grief</l>
<l>Pass not that line of strife. The lightning spark,</l>
<l>Though trained to do man's bidding, cannot flash</l>
<l>To you, as once it could, the thrilling words,</l>
<l>The message glad or sad. .Around your clime</l>
<l>The might of human power, just power and right</l>
<l>We call it, guards and barriers strong has placed</l>
<l>Which shut out knowledge. Ah, my sister dear,</l>
<l>Too long, too long the dwellers in your land</l>
<l>Have shut out knowledge. True of them it is,</l>
<l>Once what they could they would not know, and now</l>
<l>What they would know they cannot. Nor can we.</l>
<l>War rages. Who has seen such strife before?</l>
<l>So man would have it, and so God permits.--</l>
<l>Since God permits 'tis well. Wise ends no doubt</l>
<l>He will secure, for over all the strife,</l>

<l>Wild warfare which man's passions seem to rule,</l>

<l>The youngest of us seven, Henrie dear,</l>
<l>Has ceased to live on earth. Of life not tired,</l>
<l>Just fitted, as it seemed to us, her place</l>
<l>To take amid its toil, and din and care,</l>
<l>And do her part so nobly we had hoped,</l>
<l>In life's great battle, she was called away.</l>
<l>How can I say that Henrietta's dead?</l>
<l>But she is dead. That mystery is solved.</l>
<l>She knows the meaning of that solemn word.</l>
<l>I do not know why such should die so young.</l>
<l>And we have wept for Henrie. Many tears</l>
<l>My eyes have shed; and I am glad the power</l>
<l>Is given to me to weep. I envy not</l>
<l>The stern of heart from whom no touch of woe,</l>
<l>Nor thrill of joy, "bids the sweet waters flow."</l>

	<lg><l rend="ti-2">A brief sad message came to me along</l>
<l>The silent wire. I hastened homewards. Soon</l>
<l>A thousand miles were passed, but ere our home</l>
<l>I reached, the burial train moved slowly forth.</l>
<l>We met; within our pastor's home, beside</l>
<l>Our house of prayer, father, mother, sister</l>
<l>Brother; within that Sabbath home I met</l>
<l>The dead. Oh sister, you can think what grief,</l>
<l>What sadness came upon me thus to meet.</l>
<l>I looked on that loved face; but those dark eyes,</l>
<l>So like your own, sparkling and flashing once</l>
<l>With so much brilliancy 'mid life's bright scenes,</l>
<l>Looked not upon me. The long lids were closed,--</l>
<l>Gently, but firmly closed. They heeded not</l>
<l>My presence. Slumber deep was there; yet calm</l>
<l>And sweet the dead face seemed. I never looked</l>
<l>On one to me so beautiful. I touched</l>
<l>Her cheek which used to glow with life, and health,</l>
<l>And beauty. But that cheek was cold, so cold,</l>
<l>To the warm, gentle pressure of my hand.</l>
<l>Oh sister, death is very cold!--How cold</l>
<l>Death is I never knew before. My hand</l>
<l>Once more I pressed upon her own; but now</l>
<l>That kind right hand which had performed so much</l>
<l>In deeds of love for others, never tired,</l>
<l>Had surely lost its cunning. No response,</l>
<l>No pressure it returned. It never failed</l>
<l>Before. Upon her "marble brow," though cold,</l>

<l>I pressed my own warm lips. Why should I not,</l>
<l>Though she was dead? We had not met for years,</l>
<l>And nature's sympathies are very strong.</l>
<l>You would, had you been there; and so would three</l>
<l>I need not name; but they were far away.</l>
<l>I therefore gave alone that last, fond pledge</l>
<l>Of earthly love. A kiss more sacred, pure,</l>
<l>And tender, my lips never gave. The last</l>
<l>To her, from all upon the earth. My right</l>
<l>It seemed to be, for she the youngest was,</l>
<l>And I the first-born. Oh how sweet to think</l>
<l>In that sad hour, between her soul and mine</l>
<l>No cloud had ever come. One pure, true love</l>
<l>Had knit our hearts together, and in thought,</l>
<l>And word, and feeling, each had done to each</l>
<l>No wrong. How happy they who thus can feel</l>
<l>In presence of the dead. Why do not all</l>
<l>Sisters and brothers live as we have done?</l>
<l>Oh happy, happy home! sweet type of heaven.</l></lg>

<l>Enjoy some longer here that pleasant home</l>
<l>In which God cast her lot, and from her heart,</l>

<l>On all around her; enter active life,</l>
<l>The active life of woman, in some sphere</l>
<l>Of quiet labors spend the years of toil</l>
<l>Allotted here to many, and do good,</l>

<l>Much good to others, winning for herself</l>
<l>Just meeds of praise as she should gain success,</l>
<l>And thus adorn the Gospel which she loved.</l>
<l>Such was our wish. But such was not God's will.</l>
<l>His will is right. We bow to his decree.</l></lg>
	
	<lg><l rend="ti-2">She has achieved success, if, as we trust,--</l>
<l>If, as we cannot doubt, she rests above.</l>
<l>What can a child of earth gain more? Faithful</l>

<l>To her baptismal vows; and Jesus came,</l>
<l>She felt his presence with her;--came to take</l>
<l>Her home to rest until the morning dawns.</l>
<l>A crown of righteousness he then will give.</l>
<l>She rests and she enjoys. And side by side</l>
<l>With our loved brother has her dust been laid.</l>
<l>You stood among us when we laid him there.</l>
<l>There may those forms of clay repose till day,--</l>
<l>The near approaching day, I sometimes think,</l>
<l>Of the bright resurrection morning, breaks</l>
<l>Along the sky. Rest brother; sister rest.</l>
<l>We too ere long shall sleep, and may we wake</l>
<l>With you in glory; wake to join the throng,--</l>
<l>The countless, blood-bought throng of kings and priests</l>
<l>That shall with Jesus reign, and dwell with him</l>
<l>Forever. Oh my sister dear, happy</l>

<l>In paradise above beyond the ether blue.</l></lg>
	
<lg><l>So from his pleasant home with his brothers forth he went--</l>
<l>A messenger perhaps God had already sent--</l>
<l>He went a little distance and reached the rail-road track;</l>
<l>The cars! Pale, mangled, dead, from thence one bore
him back.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Death in one brief moment came and took him by surprise,</l>
<l>Those swift cars o'er him passed before his brothers' eyes:</l>
<l>They stopped; and in a moment his father left the train,</l>
<l>To have his spirit rent with anguish and with pain.</l></lg>

<lg><l>How terrible it seems in an instant thus to die!</l>
<l>And what a sight was that to meet a father's eye!</l>
<l>But God is good and kind, and he deals with us in love;</l>
<l>He knows best how and when to take us up above.</l></lg>

<lg><l>If we do but safely reach that bright and blissful shore,</l>
<l>Where sorrow and where sin will never harm us more,</l>
<l>I'm sure it matters not now God takes the spirit back,</l>
<l>Whether from beds of pain, or from the rail-road track.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And when that glad morning comes that bids the dead
arise,</l>
<l>And they are "caught up" to meet Jesus in the Skies,</l>
<l>I'm sure it will not matter 'mid all that thrilling joy,</l>
<l>How or when death came and took this beloved boy.</l></lg>

		<p><hi  rend="ti-2">Written and read at the marriage of Dr. Andrew S. Cutler</hi>
and Miss Mary Jane Ball at Cedar Lake, December 16, 1869.</p>

<lg><l>On a lovely prairie in the State of Ind,</l>
<l>In a pleasant home well sheltered from the wind,</l>
<l>Two little flowers appeared not many years ago,</l>
<l>Growing in the sunshine and dreading not the snow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Like the lily opening, like the rose, they grew,</l>
<l>Showing forth alike the sweet, the pure, the true;</l>
<l>Like twins indeed they seemed on one rich rose stalk set,</l>
<l>Fed by the self-same showers, by the same dew-drops wet.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Fast they grew and lovely thus growing side by side;</l>
<l>But lovely things and pleasant may not long abide;</l>
<l>The one was taken up within the gates of light,</l>
<l>The other blooms in beauty here with us to-night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Said I two little flowers? Oh no, two gentle birds,</l>
<l>Came to that prairie home, I change two little words;</l>
<l>One came in glowing autumn, mid October's sun;</l>
<l>The other in December, this the youngest one.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I know not whence they came, but I am very sure</l>
<l>They seemed to us like doves and like the robins pure.</l>
<l>Were they birds of passage? or were they birds of song?</l>
<l>One flew to Paradise; may this one tarry long.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Did I say flowers and birds? They were my sisters dear,</l>
<l>Who for some twenty years were seldom severed here;</l>
<l>Alike they grew in knowledge and alike in love,</l>
<l>Were they gentle visitants sent us from above?</l></lg>

<lg><l>They were the household pets, the youngest of our band;</l>
<l>(There are not "seven" to-night together here to stand;)</l>
<l>It has been said, the youngest never do grow old;</l>
<l>'Tis sure that loving natures never need grow cold.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Joy for that flown and freed one. Perfect joy and love</l>
<l>Are where we trust she dwells among the good above.</l>
<l>And joy to this young bride, unmingled by earth's fear;</l>
<l>Though perfect joy and bliss are not the dwellers here.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Yet to sister Mary and brother Andrew joy!</l>
<l>May life for them be bright with little to annoy.</l>

<l>Long years ago into thy shade I came,</l>
<l>Laying the sharp scythe by to rest from toil,</l>
<l>And drink from that cool spring, now and for years</l>
<l>Vanished beneath the surface. And how fair</l>
<l>Those youthful fancies and romantic thoughts,</l>
<l>Viewing thy possibilities for rare</l>
<l>Wild beauty, planning then to make thee mine,</l>
<l>Thinking how loved and gentle ones would come</l>
<l>And sportive children play amid thy shades,</l>
<l>And laugh along thy flowing waters there.</l>
<l>And they did come; jungle and dell they came,</l>
<l>Almost beyond my fairest youthful thoughts</l>
<l>They came, and wandered in that very spot,</l>
<l>And in their youth and joy and freshness they</l>
<l>Rejoiced amid thy beauty, where, from toil</l>
<l>Reposing, I in boyhood built air castles.</l>
<l>Strange that so many of my early dreams,</l>
<l>My day dreams, ever fair, have been so well</l>
<l>Accomplished! But these and I, as owners</l>
<l>Of the soil, as having any heirship</l>
<l>Left in thee, amid thy summer foliage,</l>
<l>Or through thy hazel mazes, or in dell</l>
<l>So bright and sunny, or in jungle</l>
<l>Dense and dark, where earliest spring flowers grew,</l>
<l>Will roam, and play, and dream no more, And so</l>

<lg><l>But seven years of age, and laid beneath the sod;</l>
<l>A gentle little girl, her soul has gone to God;</l>
<l>In Paradise she shares the gracious Saviour's love,</l>
<l>And loving him we too shall go to dwell above.</l></lg>

<lg><l>A message for her came, came from the Lord of life;</l>
<l>Permission came to leave this world of toil and strife;</l>
<l>She lay upon her couch and closed her dreamy eyes,</l>
<l>She partly waked, then slept to waken in the skies.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Her slender little form, robed in the spotless white,</l>
<l>Was laid out to repose through death's uncertain night,</l>
<l>Little class-mates went, and her loving teacher dear,</l>
<l>To see the folded bud that might not blossom here.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Within the open coffin there at rest she lay;</l>
<l>One scarce could think that form was only lifeless clay;</l>
<l>So quiet and so peaceful in her narrow bed,</l>
<l>She seemed a weary child resting her graceful head.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Death is not often lovely to a human eye,</l>
<l>Nor often beautiful beneath earth's changing sky;</l>
<l>But beauty rare and sweet was resting on her face,</l>
<l>From which not even death could steal away the grace.</l></lg>

<lg><l>As in some ancient forest in a lonely glen,</l>
<l>Far from the busy world, the world of toiling men,</l>
<l>We sometimes find a wild flower exquisitely fair,</l>
<l>Glad'ning with its beauty lonely wanderers there--</l></lg>

<lg><l>So, in her village home, she lay awhile at rest,</l>
<l>Without the gentle motion of the heaving breast,</l>
<l>In a wondrous loveliness charming to the heart,</l>
<l>Of God's signet telling stamped on the mortal part.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The cheeks, of course, were bloodless and the lips were pale,</l>
<l>Sharing not the glow of the lily of the vale;</l>
<l>But few sculptors' chisels can finer features trace,</l>
<l>Than the well set lineaments of this dead young face;</l></lg>

<lg><l>And a soft light was resting on each curtaining lid,</l>
<l>Which a once sunny eye from look of love now hid,</l>
<l>And the long dark lashes seemed in such sweet repose,</l>
<l>You'd think the eyes must open when the sun arose.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Here was that rarest beauty, here that peace so sweet,</l>
<l>As though the eyes had closed to wait for angels' feet;</l>
<l>But death had sealed forever each soft curtaining lid,</l>
<l>No more on earth to waken till the Saviour bid.</l></lg>

<lg><l>No painter with his skill was present on that day,</l>
<l>To trace that peaceful beauty; so this simple lay,</l>
<l>Simple and childlike if it be, to help us keep</l>
<l>In mind how peaceful yet may be our own long sleep.</l></lg>

	<milestone unit="typography" rend="center" n="* * * * * "/>
<p><hi rend="ti-2">Youngest daughter of Hon. David Turner of Crown Point,</hi>
Indiana, born Nov. 3, 1867, who died at the family home in
Crown Point, January 9, 1879.</p>
<lg><l>Eleven years ago, last autumn, came,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Into a village home, a little child;</l>
<l>Her parents gave to her a pleasant name,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And she from heavy cares their hearts beguiled:</l>
<l>Sometimes no doubt she grieved, but often smiled,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And grew in beauty as she grew in years;</l>
<l>Grew rich in humor, yet continued mild;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And seemed quite far removed from childish fears.</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">How should she know that this is called a world of tears?</l></lg>

<lg><l>She was the youngest, and around her heart,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">From brothers two and gentle sisters five,</l>
<l>Love was entwined. Love makes it hard to part,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">When some must die and others still survive;</l>
<l>But love forever must be kept alive,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">If we would know the joy of being blest;</l>
<l>Love is an air in which the soul can thrive,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">If we love those on whom our hearts can rest:</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">But parting hours must come. They come at God's behest.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Among the paths of childhood life she walked;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">At home, in school, at church, she filled her place;</l>
<l>Cheerful her flow of spirit when she talked,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And winsome also with sweet childhood's grace,</l>
<l>Her budding youth was coming on apace.</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">She had been taught in prayer each day to bow,</l>
<l>Had learned that she must run the Christian race,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Had learned that she must seek Christ's favor now,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">And that a glorious crown might one day press her brow.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then she lay down to die. 'Twas winter time;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">Cold was the air and white with snow the ground;</l>
<l>The summer birds within a distant clime,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">A sunny sky and leafy woods had found;</l>
<l>Her home was soon to be a grassy mound;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">When spring returns with all its sounds of mirth,</l>

	<l rend="ti-2">Then will his sainted ones come forth from out the earth</l></lg>
	
<lg><l>Yes, she lay down and died. Day after day,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">The bright light faded from her hazel eyes,</l>
<l>And then the sunny spirit passed away.</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">We could not see in Heaven the glad surprise,</l>
<l>With which, where glories after glories rise,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">She looked upon the face of Heaven's great King;</l>
<l>We have no glass with which to pierce the skies;</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">We could not hear those lofty arches ring,</l>
	<l rend="ti-2">While holy, happy angels round her soul did sing.</l></lg>

	<l rend="ti-2">Her lovely smile had faded. It was night.</l>

<p>In a note book, which she requested from her father a

	Romans, "As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to
	me, and every-tongue shall confess"--and there the tired fingers
	laid the pencil down. Her right hand was soon to lose
	it's cunning, but her soul would not lose the sacred teachings
treasured there.</p></div2>

<l>Where care and pain and sorrow never come,</l>
<l>Where night is not, where grief and wrong and woe,</l>
<l>Where toil and sin, and aching heart and brain,</l>
<l>And cloud o'er thought, or cloud o'er loving soul,</l>
<l>Within the brightness of the Father's love,</l>
<l>Can never dwell nor for one moment be.</l>
<l>Farewell then, Edith Ball, Edith of Lake,</l>

	"the head of the woman is the man:" The last line of the
	third stanza alludes to the words of John Quincy Adams,
	when dying: "This is the last of earth, I am content." "He
alone is great," in the fifth stanza alludes to the noted words
	of Massillon when as he stood before the altar and beside the
	remains of Louis XIV, pointing to the form of the dead monarch
	he slowly uttered "God only is Great," and that magnificent
	assembly, moved as by one impulse, rose and reverently
bowed.</p></div2>

<lg><l>Full fifty years ago,</l>
<l>Amid the winter's snow,</l>
<l>These groves, this prairie land,</l>
<l>Our northern lake shore strand,</l>
<l>Were bare, and bleak, and wild;</l>
<l>But white man, wife and child,</l>
<l>One cabin dwelling place had found,</l>
<l>Had come to hold and till the ground.</l></lg>

<lg><l>These fifty years of time,</l>
<l>Passing o'er every clime,</l>
<l>Have wondrous changes made</l>
<l>Wherever man has strayed.</l>
<l>Within our borders small,</l>
<l>Changes have passed o'er all,</l>
<l>Those who shared happy childhood then,</l>
<l>Are gray-haired women now and men.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Of children, women, men,</l>
<l>In years now five times ten,</l>
<l>(Those years of war and peace,)</l>
<l>Has been a large increase:</l>
<l>Some sixteen thousand here</l>
<l>Have homes this fiftieth year,</l>
<l>The year which now we celebrate</l>
<l>As half a century in our date.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The Red men are no more</l>
<l>Upon our northern shore,</l>
<l>With birchen bark canoes</l>
<l>And moccasins for shoes;</l>
<l>They hunt no more the deer,</l>
<l>They wield no more the spear,</l>
<l>They trap no more the rat and mink</l>
<l>Along our river's grassy brink.</l></lg>

<l>Imbedded in our ground;</l>
<l>Their spear and arrow heads</l>

<l>The race from us has gone,</l>
<l>To live but in our song,</l>
<l>And on our own historic page,</l>
<l>In records of our earliest age.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The tread of busy feet</l>
<l>Is now on many a street;</l>
<l>Voices of girls and boys,</l>
<l>The homes of household joys,</l>
<l>Are on our prairie lea,</l>
<l>And by the streamlets free,</l>
<l>Where late was nature's solitude</l>
<l>Or where the Indian wigwam stood.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The busy marts of trade,</l>
<l>When sales for gain are made,</l>
<l>The ware-house and the store,</l>
<l>Filled yearly o'er and o'er,</l>
<l>With purchased grain and hay,</l>
<l>With goods for ready pay,</l>
<l>These give us town and village now,</l>

<l>The one true God of love,</l>
<l>Where late the Red men bowed and prayed,</l>
<l>On prairie wild, in forest shade.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Next to the church the school,</l>
<l>Where, under gentle rule,</l>
<l>Our children knowledge gain,</l>

<l>School houses trim and neat,</l>
<l>Where fair-haired children meet,</l>

<l>Bringing a richer spoil,</l>

<l>Of labor claims its part:</l>
<l>Our shops, our mills, our kilns, our homes,</l>
<l>Would not be found where Indian roams.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Our ceaseless toil and trade,</l>
<l>Where honest gains are made,</l>
<l>Growing through fifty years,</l>
<l>Years with their hopes and fears,</l>
<l>Have made a wondrous change</l>
<l>Where wild deer found free range;</l>
<l>And we expect a city yet</l>
<l>Upon the winding Calumet.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The ponderous, loaded car,</l>
<l>Bringing the freight from far,</l>
<l>Drawn by steam's wondrous power,</l>
<l>Is passing every hour;</l>
<l>And thousands on each day,</l>

<l>Rich tribute every day;</l>
<l>Not iron rail or wire alone,</l>
<l>We have this year the telephone.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But our true wealth is made,</l>
<l>Not by the means of trade,</l>
<l>Although mechanic art</l>
<l>Has borne a useful part.</l>
<l>We plow, we sow, we reap,</l>

<l>Herds crop the meadows fresh and gay,</l>

	Allman was the great social event of Crown Point for the
	year 1885. More than one hundred guests were present.
	Some forty others invited were obliged to send their regrets.
	One of the finest family residences in Crown Point or in Lake

	was now the family home. The presents were beautiful and
	valuable. A congratulatory address was made by Judge Field
	and a response was given by Mr. James H. Luther, Mrs.
	Allman's brother. The supper was in keeping with the
	surroindings, and the whole entertainment of the evening was
peculiarly delightful.</p>
	
	<p><hi rend="ti-2">To Mr. Amos and Mrs. Mary Allman. Married at Crown</hi>
Point, March 22d, 1860:</p>
	
<lg><l>Kind friends, dear friends, I wish you joy to-night;</l>
<l>In this rich home brilliant with love and light;</l>
<l>And while so many, silver offerings bring,</l>
<l>Permit me as a troubadour to sing.</l></lg>

<lg><l>My song should be of silvery sound and thought,</l>
<l>With living truth like threads of silk inwrought;</l>
<l>Perchance of love, of wedded love I ween,</l>
<l>The love that makes a matron home's true queen.</l></lg>

<lg><l>The wonders of our life are manifold;</l>
<l>They cannot in one hour or day be told;</l>
<l>They upward soar beyond the highest reach</l>
<l>Of human thought, much more of human speech.</l></lg>

<lg><l>For them to-night my harp has not been strung;</l>
<l>I leave them therefore in their height unsung:</l>
<l>You celebrate to-night a bridal eve,</l>
<l>And for your brows some chaplet I would weave.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Marriage we know goes back to Eden's bower;</l>
<l>It tells us of creative love and power;</l>
<l>Fairest of women Eve became a wife,</l>
<l>On the first day of her God-given life.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Your days had passed, the days of childhood fair,</l>
<l>When boys chase butterflies in summer air;</l>
<l>When dolls and patch-work please our little girls,</l>
<l>Who skip and play and toss their auburn curls.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And youth had ended with each golden dream</l>
<l>When things that are mingle with things that seem;</l>
<l>And womanhood had come with its rich dower,</l>
<l>And manhood with its noble aims and power.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then, by love guided, each of each made choice;</l>
<l>Well may you in this wedded love rejoice;</l>
<l>Love from a marriage altar shines afar;</l>

<lg><l>How wondrous is this love that binds two hearts!</l>
<l>Some speak of Cupid and his shining darts;</l>
<l>You each the other chose and took the vow,</l>
<l>That binds you as a wife and husband now.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Then years came on, with cares and toils and joys;</l>
<l>Into yon cottage home came girls and boys;</l>
<l>And they have lived, their life has opened bright;</l>
<l>Great cause for thankfulness have you to-night.</l></lg>

<lg><l>As five and twenty years are ending now,</l>
<l>Years that have left some impress on each brow,</l>
<l>We rest awhile to think and to enjoy;</l>
<l>To taste life's bliss without that life's alloy.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And here, within even this charmed circle gay,</l>
<l>Your thoughts go back to that first bridal day;</l>
<l>Then life was new and fresh and all untried;</l>
<l>'Twas joy to be, and joy to have, a bride.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And as to-night you glance o'er these swift years,</l>
<l>How bright each mercy in the past appears;</l>
<l>Of earthly good, what need you ask for more?</l>
<l>Surely with blessings now your cup runs o'er.</l></lg>

<lg><l>You have Irene and Jessie, daughters fair,</l>
<l>With girlhood's light still on their sunny hair;</l>
<l>You have two stately sons, Walter and Claude,</l>
<l>Whose manly ways all noble hearts applaud.</l></lg>

<lg><l>You have a fifth, another daughter yet,</l>
<l>Bright little Nellie, now the household pet;</l>
<l>And in each form there dwells a radiant mind,</l>
<l>Bright, apt to learn, intelligent, refined.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Such are five treasures which you hold most dear;</l>
<l>You have a home of comfort, ease, and cheer;</l>
<l>Economy and skill, still gaining more,</l>
<l>Have year by year increased your earthly store.</l></lg>

<lg><l>And here you are this eve in middle age,</l>
<l>To turn in life's strange book another page;</l>
<l>Say I not well, what could you ask for more?</l>
<l>Surely with blessings does your cup run o'er.</l></lg>

<lg><l>This evening's joy will pass; time flies along;</l>
<l>And that reminds me I must end my song:</l>
<l>And threads of silver on your heads and mine,</l>
<l>Remind us we must look for life's decline.</l></lg>

<lg><l>I have no second sight, no prophet's ken,</l>
<l>Although I hold this eve a poet's pen;</l>
<l>But I might look along the coming years,</l>
<l>And guessing at the joys omit the tears.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But rather let us rest, review the past,</l>
<l>Enjoy life's blessings while these blessings last;</l>
<l>Friends throng around you here; friendship is sweet:</l>
<l>'Tis pleasant in this palace home to meet,</l></lg>

<lg><l>I hope that you may reach your golden day;</l>
<l>As yet you've journeyed toward it half the way;</l>
<l>In wisdom and in mercy on our eyes,</l>
<l>The curtain o'er the future will not rise.</l></lg>

<lg><l>One said, Thou shalt thy children's children see,</l>
<l>While peace, sweet peace around thy home shall be;</l>
<l>Such was a blessing God pronounced of old;</l>
<l>May you share this, and reach the day of gold.</l></lg>

<lg><l>But friends, dear friends, old age will come apace;</l>
<l>And by and by must end the earthly race;</l>
<l>Life is a voyage; when this life is o'er,</l>
<l>Be sure you land upon the Golden Shore.</l></lg></div2>

<p rend="center">BROTHERHOODS.</p>

<lg rend="center"><l>As childhood listens to the songs of birds,</l>
<l>So wisdom listens to well chosen words.</l></lg>

<lg><l>This earth with all its storms and rugged wilds,</l>
<l>Parched desert solitudes and fields of ice,</l>
<l>Its dreary wastes of ocean and its nights,</l>
<l>Is yet adorned with beauty. Over all</l>
<l>The habitable parts, and all the known</l>
<l>Foot-trodden regions of our native earth</l>
<l>Traces are found of that bright world of light,</l>
<l>That at creation's dawn flooded this earth</l>
<l>At God's express command and mantled it</l>
<l>With loveliness. I do not know why God</l>
<l>Made so much beauty here on earth, beauty</l>
<l>In color, motion, symmetry, and life,</l>
<l>The very poetry and grace of youth,</l>
<l>Unless he meant that we should beauty love.</l>
<l>Doubtless in other worlds, where only truth</l>
<l>And goodness dwell, are higher forms of grace,</l>
<l>That kind of grace that we call loveliness,</l>
<l>Adorning perfect life. But also here</l>


<pb
                    id="VAB8212-095"
                    n="95"/>
<l>Is higher beauty than the outward kind,</l>
<l>Of color, form, and motion. Even here</l>
<l>Where bloom the rose and lily, where the shells</l>
<l>From ocean's depths are wondrous, and the light</l>
<l>Of sunshine flashes on high mountain tops,</l>
<l>And rainbows span the valleys, even here</l>
<l>We all acknowledge beauty of the soul,</l>
<l>We recognize what we call lovely sights,</l>
<l>And therefore beautiful, in social life,</l>
<l>In mental and in moral acts performed,</l>
<l>In those relationships that bind us here,</l>
<l>To one another, to our race, and God.</l>
<l>This brings me to my subject,<hi rend="sc">BROTHERHOODS.</hi></l>
<l>And first of all we must allow and feel</l>
<l>That a true brotherhood is beautiful.</l>
<l>Look at its simplest form, a family,</l>
<l>A family of boys and gentle girls,</l>
<l>For girls we know come into brotherhoods.</l>
<l>Those boys are surely to be pitied who,</l>
<l>In all their lives have known no sister's love.</l>
<l>To be an only child, alone in life,</l>
<l>Is not a lot that any one need crave.</l>
<l>To stand alone, perhaps on dizzy height,</l>
<l>Is sometimes terrible. Some have e'en thought,</l>
<l>If there be one archangel, one who dwells</l>
<l>Above all other homes of holy ones,</l>
<l>Without a peer in this wide universe,</l>
<l>He sometimes must feel lone. I do not think</l>

<l>God has made creatures to be all alone;</l>
<l>At least I know that for earth's loneliness</l>
<l>A solace is in God. But let us look</l>
<l>At girls and boys in one small home of earth.</l>
<l>When these are bound by ties of kindred love,</l>
<l>And are what children of one home should be,</l>
<l>What sight on earth can be more beautiful!</l>
<l>See how the eldest watches gently o'er</l>
<l>The younger ones and good examples sets.</l>
<l>See how the younger to the elder ones</l>
<l>Look up in perfect confidence for care,</l>
<l>Encouragement, protection, help, and love.</l>
<l>See how all strive to work some common good.</l>
<l>And when the little sister, full of grace,</l>
<l>A bud unfolding fast, but timid, shy,</l>
<l>To strangers, like a fawn in forest wild,</l>
<l>Trustful at home, like that same spotted fawn</l>
<l>When it has felt the hand of gentle child,</l>
<l>Gives to her elder brother the sweet kiss</l>
<l>Of childhood's trusting love, he has the best</l>
<l>That there is left on earth of innocence</l>
<l>And purity and peace. Childhood is near</l>
<l>To Heaven, near to the blessed care and love</l>
<l>Of angels; and a trusting child's sweet lips</l>
<l>Have yet some tremulous vibrations left</l>
<l>Of words and songs, of echoes and caress.</l>
<l>That might have been in Eden's sinless bowers.</l>
<l>We all do know that homes of earthly love,</l>

<l>Brothers and sisters in sweet concord there,</l>
<l>Are the abodes of beauty. Are such rare?</l>
<l>Look at a larger brotherhood and say</l>
<l>If the ideal at least thrills not the heart,</l>
<l>The brotherhood of man. Here is one race,</l>
<l>All in one world, made of one blood, and all</l>
<l>Children of one same God. Suppose they all</l>
<l>Each for the other cared, and each one loved</l>
<l>All others, as some earth-born children do</l>
<l>In one small household? What if some are black,</l>
<l>Or white, or brown, have swarthy, tawny skin,</l>
<l>Are yellow, red or copper colored, what</l>
<l>To us the difference, if our hearts but glow</l>
<l>With kindred love? Some eyes are blue, some black,</l>
<l>Some gray, some hazel, and some seem to have</l>
<l>Such changeful hues as thought and feeling flash</l>
<l>To mine, I do not know their actual shade.</l>
<l>Some lovely forms are blondes, some are brunettes,</l>
<l>Some have dark olive hues, and some there are,</l>
<l>So poets say, so novelists affirm,</l>
<l>Who roses blend with lilies in their rich,</l>
<l>God-given beauty. But it should be now,</l>
<l>It will be by and by, the heart, the soul,</l>
<l>We love. If now we could exemplify</l>
<l>Upon our earth this brotherhood of man,</l>
<l>Would not the angels from the world of light</l>
<l>Look down and say, How beautiful! Behold</l>
<l>The family of man! Look once again.</l>

<l>'Tis written in the holy Book love ye</l>
<l>"The brotherhood." That is a smaller, yes,</l>
<l>A choicer band, brothers and sisters called</l>
<l>From every tribe and nation to come out</l>
<l>And form one glorious band, bound heart to heart,</l>
<l>Made not of blood alike alone, but born,</l>
<l>Yea, of one Spirit born. They ought to show</l>
<l>On earth, not waiting for the heavenly world,</l>
<l>All tnat is beautiful in brotherhoods,</l>
<l>For they are taught even to lay their lives</l>
<l>Each for the other down. I let them pass.</l>
<l>Their record is not what it ought to be.</l>
<l>Then there are many smaller brotherhoods,</l>
<l>Among which ours is one. The thousand more</l>
<l>I need not even name. How are we one?</l>
<l>We have a common mother. College hall,</l>
<l>Our dear old college, school of classic lore,</l>
<l>Planned by our fathers for the prophets' sons,</l>
<l>We have personified, and call her now</l>
<l>Our <hi rend="sc">ALMA MATER</hi>. Within college walls</l>
<l>We drink from the Castalian fount, we drink</l>
<l>From the Pierian spring. We drink from founts</l>
<l>Of knowledge all unknown to Grecian minds.</l>
<l>Their poems grand, their wondrous myths we read,</l>
<l>Immortal writings of their ancient men</l>
<l>We study; then we pass, beyond their ken,</l>
<l>Into the world of modern thought, the world,</l>
<l>Of science, which their wise philosophers</l>

<l>Had not explored. All this rich food for mind,</l>
<l>This mental pabulum, our mother gives.</l>
<l>Well may we call her <hi rend="sc">ALMA</hi>. Using food</l>
<l>So much alike, by the same teachers trained,</l>
<l>Passing, as hand in hand, by the same ways</l>
<l>Up the steep hill of science, thus we learn</l>
<l>In part to think alike; we have some stock</l>
<l>Of learning all in common; what one knows</l>
<l>The others know of this our common lore;</l>
<l>And as one thinks, in part, the others think,</l>
<l>In the great beaten lines of human thought.</l>
<l>And so this mental likeness makes us kin.</l>
<l>We do not all the same expressions use,</l>
<l>Our shades of thought are various, and our tastes,</l>
<l>May vary widely,--in one home I know</l>
<l>The children are not all alike, I think</l>
<l>That angels differ each from each, and yet</l>
<l>Are angels all--and we are brothers all.</l>
<l>There was a time when we were very few;</l>
<l>And when our mother might have worn the weeds</l>
<l>Of widowhood; her halls were still and lone;</l>
<l>Forsaken she seemed to be of all her sons.</l>
<l>I cannot claim that then our brotherhood</l>
<l>Was beautiful. But a new era dawned.</l>
<l>Fair gentle forms, sweet flute-like voices came,</l>
<l>Voices our elder brothers never heard</l>
<l>Repeating songs of Homer, never heard</l>
<l>In college walls discoursing ancient lore.</l>

<l>Our mother had borne daughters! With surprise,</l>
<l>Almost with awe, and with perhaps some dread,</l>
<l>We saw our little sisters come, take seats,</l>
<l>And eat at the same table with ourselves.</l>
<l>And we were boys, were men, their brothers tall.</l>
<l>But they have grown to goodly size, and now</l>
<l>We have choice sisters in our brotherhood.</l>
<l>To-night this brotherhood is beautiful.</l>

<l>Glowing on each fair cheek and radiant brow,</l>

<l>Sitting at ease upon our brothers' forms:</l>
<l>But more etherial beauty, that which shines</l>
<l>When gifted minds and noble hearts unite</l>
<l>In some high enterprise. And we may think</l>
<l>To-night of that grand song of ancient times,</l>
<l>Behold how good, and see how pleasant too,</l>
<l>For brothers here, in unity to dwell</l>
<l>Together. Like the precious ointment poured</l>
<l>On Aaron's head, and like Mount Hermon's dew.</l>
<l>Like dew on Zion's mountains where the Lord</l>
<l>Commands the blessing, life forevermore.</l>

<lg><l>That you may prosper, this I hope and pray;</l>
<l>And may God grant you many a happy day.</l>
<l>Your names instruct; fair Cynthia light to shed,</l>
<l>And Henry "of the house the chief or head."</l></lg>

<lg><l>The formal "honey-moon" is very brief,</l>
<l>And sometimes days and months succeed of grief.</l>
<l>But there are those, may you be such a wife;</l>
<l>Whose moon of honey lasts through wedded life.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Old is the saying, in a Latin guise,</l>
<l>A word sufficient is unto the wise;</l>
<l>And now that word to you in hope I give;</l>
<l>The word is <hi rend="sc">TRUST</hi>. O heed it while you live.</l></lg>

<lg><l>Be this your talismanic word, your charm.</l>
<l>Your husband trust; lean on his manly arm;</l>
<l>Trust him most fully in his manhood's prime;</l>
<l>Trust him through all your years of coming time.</l></lg>

<l>Where we may rest, and shut earth's discords out,</l>
<l>Its wrangles and its strifes, its vexing cares,</l>
<l>Where we may lay aside our sternest toil,</l>

<l>Where we may feel secure in sharing love,--</l>
<l>These have to us become sweet types of rest,</l>
<l>Of peace and freedom and of love secure,</l>
<l>Which we expect in Heaven. We call that Home.</l></lg>
	<lg><l rend="ti-2">What are these homes of ours, these homes of Lake?</l>
<l>The building vary much in form and size;</l>
<l>Most are of wood, but some of stone and brick.</l>
<l>Designed by skillful architect, or planned</l>
<l>To suit only the owner's wants and taste,</l>
<l>Not many, it may be, would models prove,</l>
<l>For those who take as law John Ruskin's words.</l>
<l>Yet they give shelter from the winter storms;</l>
<l>They shut out cold and heat and rain and snow;</l>
<l>But well we know they are not cyclone proof.</l>
<l>From that dread visitant as yet God spares.</l>
<l>Long may he shield us from the tempest's power,</l>
<l>And spare the dwellings that our hands have reared.</l>
<l>They let in light and air, the light of day,</l>
<l>The pure fresh air of heaven that all must breathe.</l>
<l>They give us thus the shelter that all need.</l>
<l>In cost these buildings vary as in form,</l>
<l>For some are dwelling places of the rich,</l>
<l>And beautiful as England's "stately homes,"</l>
<l>And show how well their owner's goods increase;</l>
<l>And some are rented rooms built for the poor.</l>
<l>It is enough if they are truly homes.</l></lg>
	<lg><l rend="ti-2">Man cannot make alone a true, sweet home.</l>
<l>It needs and it must have a woman's love.</l>

<l>If not the presence, it must have within</l>
<l>The hallowed memory of some woman's form.</l>
<l>An aged mother may make home within</l>
<l>The humble walls where comes, at close of day,</l>
<l>An only son; and as they two find rest</l>
<l>And shelter from the cold, harsh world without,</l>
<l>They may have rich home joys. They have a past.</l>
<l>And they look forward to some future bright.</l>
<l>A little daughter or some sister lone</l>
<l>May be the woman form that makes a home,</l>
<l>For father or for brothers kind and good.</l>
<l>But a full home will hold the loving wife;</l>
<l>A faithfull mother, with her children fair.</l>
<l>And such are many of our homes to-day;</l>
<l>The father, mother, children, all are there.</l>
<l>Homes seem the brightest where are children young.</l>
<l>Life is so fresh in childhood's early days,</l>
<l>When all the birds sing sweetly, when the flowers</l>
<l>Are fragrant, and their blooms have such rich hues</l>
<l>For the young, sparkling eyes, that see them first.</l>
<l>And in that life, so free from care, come toys,</l>
<l>And childhood's merry sports at morn and eve.</l>
<l>Visit our homes, our town and village homes;</l>
<l>Look on our country homes in summer time,</l>
<l>And watch the plays of childhood. At a home</l>
<l>On a large farm, I saw one day a group,</l>
<l>Not long ago, of children four, two boys,</l>
<l>Two little girls; sweet, gentle children all;</l>

<l>And while the older ones were in the field,</l>
<l>Stacking the fragrant hay, these children played,</l>
<l>Beneath a maple, in the shade, close by</l>
<l>Their door-way, in the mother's sight within.</l>
<l>They played stack hay, with a long line for rope,</l>
<l>And for a fork a very long strong spoon,</l>
<l>One little girl, so lovely in her sweet</l>
<l>Child beauty, on her seat upon a box,</l>
<l>Stacking each bunch of hay, one boy "to dump,"</l>
<l>The youngest boy, called "Toadie," playing horse,</l>
<l>The least one sitting on the ground at ease.</l>
<l>I stood and watched this happy group; so pure</l>
<l>Seemed their enjoyment, fancy all of course;</l>
<l>But long ago 'twas said, "so near approach</l>
<l>The sports of children to the toils of men."</l>
<l>It is not almost strange how fancy weaves</l>
<l>Her potent spell over our children's minds?</l>
<l>Play this, play that, one to the other says;</l>
<l>And one is pony; one is queen; and one</l>
<l>Wi11 ride his trained stick war-horse; and will lead</l>
<l>His troops of soldiers in their serried ranks</l>
<l>To meet the charging foe. It is not strange</l>
<l>I staid and watched awhile, with pleasant thoughts,</l>
<l>That group of four, children of two dear friends.</l>
<l>Departing from another home I saw,</l>
<l>Within her hammock, swingihg in the shade,</l>
<l>Another fair young girl, a "Kittie" child,</l>
<l>With whom I had been holding coverse there.</l>

<l>How could I fail to see a young queen there?</l>
<l>And so the hundreds, yes, the thousands are.</l>
<l>Go by our homes and in their hammocks see,</l>
<l>When summer eve is bright, the gentle girls,</l>
<l>Some with their curly heads, and some with long,</l>
<l>Brown ringlets, some with straight dark hair, but all</l>
<l>So independent in their fathers' homes,</l>
<l>So free from care or dread for coming years.</l>
<l>And are they not more free in many ways,</l>
<l>In these free homes of ours where none may say,</l>
<l>Here are the limits, as to social life,</l>
<l>Here are the limits, as to wealth and fame,</l>
<l>Here are the limits, as to earth's career,</l>
<l>Beyond which none of you can ever pass,--</l>
<l>yes, are they not more free than any girls</l>
<l>Who find themselves the daughters of a king,</l>
<l>Of king or titled queen beyond the sea?</l>
<l>They are not bound by Hindoo caste; not bound</l>
<l>By customs from the ages past derived</l>
<l>Sterner than law itself; they are not bound</l>
<l>To follow on in the ancestral line</l>
<l>Of daily toil. Their calling they may choose.</l>
<l>From what pursuit in life are they shut out?</l>
<l>More free are they than any palace girls;</l>

ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR MARRIAGE, MARCH 26, 1886.</p>
	
<lg><l>Within our quiet homes with their bright household fires,</l>
<l>Where children dwell and parents, aged dames and sires</l>
<l>Cheerful and warm and safe amid the winter's storm,</l>
<l>Striving in good degree life's duties to perform,</l>
<l>We come at length to greet the spring time of the year.</l>
<l>The robins, larks, and blue-birds even now are here.</l>
<l>They sing their old sweet songs while waiting for the leaves:</l>
<l>This lay, amid their carols, friendship's hand now weaves.</l>
<l>Not good, it is not good that man should be alone;</l>
<l>So said the Holy One who sits upon the throne.</l>
<l>Who called this universe from its primeval night,</l>
<l>Whose great creative word proclaimed "Let there be light."</l>
<l>And then in order formed this beauteous world of ours,</l>

<l>Creatng singing birds and mantling earth with flowers.</l>
<l>It is not good for man to be on earth alone.</l>
<l>And so a woman fair was formed of Adam's bone;</l>
<l>And then that beauteous Eve, fairest of all on earth,</l>
<l>The only woman known who had no mortal birth,</l>
<l>The only virgin fair who never was a girl,</l>
<l>Whose long rich silken hair no mother's hand did curl:</l>
<l>This maid in beauty clothed to Adam's side was brought,</l>
<l>Whose hand in youthful Wedlock he had never sought;</l>
<l>And soon the words were said that bound them both for life,</l>
<l>He for a faithful husband, she a loving wife.</l>
<l>And down through all the ages since that sunny hour,</l>
<l>When God himself ordained in Eden's holy bower,</l>
<l>For this cause shall a man father and mother leave,</l>
<l>And through both good and ill unto his wife shall cleave--</l>
<l>The eons of Adam seek Eve's daughters to decoy,</l>
<l>To be within their homes the center of home's joy.</l>
<l>So marriage came to be the law for man on earth,</l>
<l>A law ordained to last until earth's second birth.</l>
<l>For five and twenty years this law you have observed,</l>
<l>And silver gifts to-night full well have you deserved;</l>
<l>For grown up in your home are now three daughters fair,</l>
<l>And silver threads appear in your once auburn hair;</l>
<l>A God has richly blessed you with abundant store.</l>
<l>May his rich grace be with you now and evermore.</l>
<l>Let prayer and praise each day keep yours a home of love,</l>
<l>Until you reach your Father's glorious home above.</l></lg></div2>

<l>Passing away from earth, to worlds unknown!</l>
<l>Passing--as boats sail into mighty seas</l>
<l>From sheltered harbors and from rivers bright,</l>
<l>To land upon some distant coast and send</l>
<l>No tidngs back of their arrival there;--</l>
<l>Passing--like summer birds away, to spend</l>
<l>The wintry days and nights in other climes;--</l>
<l>So are they passing, human souls, away,</l>
<l>To spend what is to us death's night, perchance</l>
<l>In darkness! or in realms of glorious day.</l>
<l>Death comes. Each hour some souls, some spirits pass;</l>
<l>Dust goes to dust; the soul to God who gave.</l>
<l>Wonders of life and death! wonders are here.</l>
<l>Yes, "trailing clouds of glory" do they come;</l>
<l>Within earth-forms awhile these spirits dwell;</l>
<l>Then with the angel bands they soar away.</l>
<l>They are to us invisible, if near.</l>
<l>Their swiftest pinion we can never hear.</l></lg>

<l>A bride. So young! In the first flush of bright,</l>

<l>Within her own, and not her mother's home,</l>
<l>The center, life, and joy. So young, so fair,</l>
<l>So full of promise; and a year ago,</l>
<l>A single score of years then having lived,</l>
<l>Bidding so fair for long and useful life.</l>
<l>From her near country home into our town,</l>
<l>Some years ago, she came, a girl, a child,</l>
<l>With mother, sister, and with brothers two.</l>
<l>Each day, in term time, forth and back she went</l>
<l>To school and home again, with light, child heart.</l>
<l>She found a place to learn God's holy word</l>
<l>In Sabbath school, when came the Sabbath morn.</l>
<l>She learned those teachings from some earnest lips.</l>
<l>Years swiftly passed. Herself a teacher soon.</l>
<l>And her kind heart for others learned to feel.</l>
<l>She helped the poor and needy, helped to clothe</l>
<l>Mid winter's cold young children whom she knew.</l>
<l>And woman's lot came on her. May Day eve.,</l>
<l>With marriage vows, she gave her hand to one</l>
<l>To whom already she had given her heart.</l>
<l>And soon she hastened,--even then perhaps</l>

<l>To Jesus. She had learned the way to Him.</l>
<l>Said she found; she trusted; she laid hold</l>
<l>Of the great hope of life. And there was need.</l>
<l>For soon upon a sick-bed she was laid.</l>
<l>Kind friends and loved ones gathered round her close,</l>
<l>Among them her new sister loving Maud,</l>
<l>Rich in her Christian trust and love and hope,</l>
<l>Her sweet voice trained to utter sacred song.</l>
<l>But none could hold back dust from dust or stay</l>
<l>The spirit's flight whose wings were plumed for heaven.</l>
<l>So she went forth "to Jesus in the rain."</l>

<l>Farewell to thee, oh sister, neighbor, friend!</l>
<l>Gone from this earth thy presence; gone to dwell</l>
<l>Within the spirit-world, till He shall come</l>
<l>Back to this world of ours, who is the Lord</l>
<l>Of angels and of man; "of quick and dead"</l>
<l>The Judge. When He with all his angels comes,</l>
<l>The souls of all, who now in Jesus sleep,</l>
<l>Will also come, his triumph then to share.</l>
<l>In hope of that glad day sleep on, oh dust!</l>

<l>But where the squirrels, black, or red, or gray abound</l>
<l>Where the quails whistle and their nests are on the ground,</l>
<l>Where the mild, timid rabbit bounds in grace along,</l>
<l>Uncharmed by thrush or cat-birds sweetest morning song,</l>
<l>Where gentle mourning doves discourse their music sweet,</l>
<l>Clothed in living beauty to their small pink feet,</l>

<l>Although the earth might not show trace of shoe or spade.</l></lg>

<l>A forest was a fitting home for such a race.</l>

<l>There is a grandeur left about a forest still.</l>
<l>Without a house we would not in a forest dwell,</l>
<l>But pictures of a mighty past words scarce can tell</l>
<l>Come thronging on the mind when for one single hour,</l>
<l>Alone in forest dark we yield to fancy's power.</l></lg>
