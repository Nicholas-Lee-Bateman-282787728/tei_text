                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                <p><hi>MANY</hi> of these Poems, extending over a period of several years, have
                    appeared anonymously in Chamberâs Journal and elsewhere. The frequent reprinting
                    of them, here and in America, has induced the author to collect, select, revise,
                    and claim her errant children.</p>
                <p>Whether they were worth collecting, and are really âPoems,â public opinion must
                    decide.</p>
                <p>The present edition in the âBlue and Goldâ series contains many pieces not
                    heretofore collected.</p>

                        <l>(Not mine, iâfaith! nor would I that she were:)</l>
                        <l>She walks this world of ours like Grecian nymph,</l>

                        <l>Among the herd of men, environed round</l>
                        <l>With native airs of deep Olympian calm.</l>
                        <l>I have a great love for that lady of mine:</l>
                        <l>I like to watch her motions, trick of face,</l>
                        <l>And turn of thought, when speaking high and wise</l>
                        <l>The tongue of gods, not men. Ay, every day,</l>
                        <l>And twenty times a day, I start to catch</l>
                        <l>Some look or gesture of familiar mould,</l>
                        <l>And then my panting soul leans forth to her</l>
                        <l>Like some sick traveller who astonied sees</l>
                        <l>Gliding across the distant twilight fieldsâ</l>

                        <l>I have a friend, how dearly liked, heartâwarm,</l>
                        <l>Did I confess, sure she and all would smile:</l>
                        <l>I watch her as she steals in some dull room</l>

                        <l>Then goes, and at her going all seems dark.</l>
                        <l>Little she knows this: little thinks each brow</l>
                        <l>Lightens, each heart grows purer with her eyes,</l>
                        <l>Good, honest eyesâclear, upward, righteous eyes,</l>
                        <l>That look as if they saw the dim unseen,</l>
                        <l>And learnt from thence their deep compassionate calm.</l>
                        <l>Why do I precious hold this friend of mine?</l>
                        <l>Why in our talks, our quiet fireside talks,</l>
                        <l>When we, two earnest travellers through the dark,</l>
                        <l>Grasp at the guiding threads that homeward lead,</l>
                        <l>Seems it another soul than hers looks out</l>
                        <l>From these her eyes?âuntil I ofttimes start</l>
                        <l>And quiver, as when some soft ignorant hand</l>
                        <l>Touches the barb hid in a longâhealed wound/</l>
                        <l>Yet still no blame, but thanks to thee, dear friend,</l>
                        <l>Ay, even when we wander back at eve,</l>
                        <l>They careless arm loose linked within my ownâ</l>
                        <l>The same height as I gaze downânay, the hair</l>
                        <l>Her very colorâfluttering âneath the starsâ</l>
                        <l>The same large stars which lit that earlier world.</l>
                        <l>I have another loveâwhose dewy looks</l>
                        <l>Are fresh with lifeâs young dawn. I prophesy</l>
                        <l>The streak of light now trembling on the hills</l>
                        <l>Will broaden out into a glorious day.</l>
