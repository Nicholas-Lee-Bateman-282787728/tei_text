        <p>When Ralph Leslie Rusk published his monumental study of the literature of the middle western
                    frontier in 1926, he attempted to survey everything written about and in the area northwest of the
                    river Ohio down to the year 1840. This goal led him inevitably to consider not only codes of law,
                    periodicals, schoolbooks, volumes of travel, histories, and beginnings of belletristic writing, but
                    also gazetteers. Indeed he listed a dozen such books, notably John Kilbourn's volume on <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>, John T. Blois's on <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, John Scott's on Indiana, Al-phonso Wetmore's on <placeName>
            <region reg="mou" type="state">Missouri</region>
          </placeName>, and two volumes by John Mason Peck on <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>

          </placeName>. Rusk remarked that these gazetteers were generally written by men familiar with the
                    western country and that because of their geographical limitations they were superior to volumes
                    which attempted to cover an entire region.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Twenty-four years after Rusk's book appeared, R. Carlyle Buley published a detailed and
                    informative study of the Old Northwest which won a Pulitzer Prize. Buley too listed several of the
                    old gazetteers, such as those by Kilbourn, Blois, and Peck, and observed that these books contained
                    a little history <list type="footnotes">

                            Among the gazetteers devoted to regions rather than to states are Samuel R. Brown, <hi rend="i">The Western Gazetteer; or, Emigrant's Directory</hi> (<placeName>

                            well as western states and included in Chapter X an excellent general survey of the
                            character of the western people based on long residence and extensive travel.</item>

                    Buley had much to say about the contents of the gazetteers cited.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Both writers
                    implied—and this is a common assumption today—that because these volumes were
                    highly topical they quickly outlived their usefulness. I should like to look at a few of these old
                    gazetteers with a rather different purpose in mind. The modern reader who picks up these tattered
                    and foxed books will often find surprising if miscellaneous information which is not readily
                    available elsewhere; he will also be pleased by sprightly details about locations or settlers and
                    occasionally he will find an unexpectedly literary style.</p>

        <p>A gazetteer is defined most simply as a geographical dictionary, a book which gives descriptions of
                    places in alphabetical order. As the American frontier pushed westward, there was a great demand for
                    such books as convenient sources of information about generally unknown country. Gazetteers were
                    bought and read by a large number of people seeking vital data, by travelers, merchants,
                    administrators, clergymen, professional men, and most of all by prospective settlers. Morris
                    Birkbeck's <hi rend="i">Letters from <placeName>
              <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>

          </hi> (1818) was hardly a conventional gazetteer, but it was widely read and
                    consulted by Englishmen who were thinking about emigrating to the Wabash Valley.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
        </p>

        <p>For the most part gazetteers followed a standard pattern. In an introduction or preface the author
                    described his qualifications for compiling such a book and cited his obligations to various
                    informants. Invariably he reported some personal contact with the state or territory described and
                    often that he had traveled through it extensively. He usually indicated also that he was familiar
                    with the accounts of earlier travelers, ranging from Charlevoix and Schoolcraft to Long, Carver, and
                    Beltrami. The author frequently cited correspondence with leading citizens of the region to confirm
                    factual statements and provided census figures. Generally a long and diffuse essay on military or
                    political history, as well as on the <list type="footnotes">

                    listings. Lewis C. Beck's <hi rend="i">A Gazetteer of the States of Illinois and <placeName>
              <region reg="mou" type="state">Missouri</region>
            </placeName>
          </hi> (1823), one of the best of the early gazetteers, supplied this kind of
                    information about both of the states with which he was concerned. The bulk of every gazetteer, of
                    course, consisted of a compilation of evidence about political divisions and geographical locations:
                    towns, townships, post offices, counties, rivers, creeks, lakes, prairies, mountains, mounds, and
                    swamps. For convenient reference this material was ordinarily given alphabetical arrangement.</p>

        <p>Historians today make little use of gazetteers for obvious reasons. The population figures, for
                    example, are obsolete and may be inaccurate. Geographical measurements, often made casually and
                    quickly, have been superseded by more precise mensuration. The enormous data about climate,
                    topography, wild animals, and even political organizations have little present-day value. Rare
                    allusions to early settlers probably interest only local historians. Nevertheless, many of the
                    gazetteers are still useful. Hamlets or villages which once seemed to have an optimistic future have
                    become ghost towns; some have disappeared entirely. Thus Sprinklesburgh, which John Scott listed in
                    his Indiana gazetteer of 1826, is unknown today. Two Minnesota communities, Sevastopol in Goodhue
                    County and Elliotta in Fillmore County, have completely vanished.<hi
            rend="sup">4</hi> Again, county
                    boundaries have altered and counties themselves have been divided or merged. St. Croix County in
                    western Wisconsin at one time stretched 130 miles from the Falls of the St. Croix River to La Pointe
                    on Madeline Island in Lake Superior and was 50 miles wide. But in 1845 its northern half was
                    detached and formed into La Pointe County, which itself extended to the source of the Mississippi
                    River and the Lake of the Woods.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Ponds and lakes, once shimmering and alluring,
                    have dried up and are as unfamiliar to the present-day citizen as glacial Lake Agassiz. One might
                    have trouble today floating a canoe on streams once called navigable, such as Indiana's
                    Beanblossom Creek (except where it forms a reservoir in <placeName>

                    made arable. And the origins of place names once familiar to every new settler have become lost in
                    the mists of time. It is true that such data can often be garnered from early newspapers or from the
                    reminiscences of old-timers, but the value of the gazetteers in this connection should not be
                    overlooked.</p>
        <p>There are also other values. The gazetteers supply population estimates and other statistics and they
                    include comment on the make-up of the local population in terms of regional or even racial origins.
                    Data on early church organizations frequently appear as well as information about the trades of some
                    of the first settlers. Land and commodity prices are given. Early, often sporadic, attempts to build
                    railroads or dig canals are referred to, and predictions of various kinds about the best crops to
                    grow are printed. The gazetteers may identify settlers whose names were unknown even to the first
                    local newspaper editors. If these books were reticent and unfortunately terse, the details they do
                    record can be fascinating.</p>
        <p>Among the early middle western gazetteers John Kil-bourn's <hi rend="i">The Ohio
                    Gazetteer,</hi> a volume of 166 pages published at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1816, was undoubtedly the most successful. By the time of the compiler's
                    death in 1831 ten editions had appeared, and an eleventh edition was published in 1833,
                    "Rev. and enl. by a citizen of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>

          </placeName>" to 512 pages. Fourteen thousand copies of the gazetteer were sold between
                    1826 and 1830.<hi
            rend="sup">6</hi> Kilbourn's Preface to the seventh edition states
                    effectively not only his own motive but the motives of other compilers of gazetteers: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Much solicitude has been evinced, and frequent enquiries made in the east, concerning this

                    On the other hand, he carefully records place names or multiple names; thus the Portage River which
                    flows into Lake <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Erie</settlement>
          </placeName> used to be called the Carrying River, and Sandusky was once known as <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
          </placeName>. He indicates that the name Belpre was derived from the French words <hi
            rend="i">belle</hi> and <hi rend="i">prairie</hi> and claims that the combination (beautiful meadow) was
                    well suited to the location. Troubled by the usual difficulty of finding something distinctive to
                    say about each of his entries, Kilbourn resorts to cliches which he repeats endlessly: most streams
                    are "considerable," post towns are either "flourishing" or
                    "thriving," and townships are "populous" even when they
                    obviously were not. In contrast, the community of Tarlton in Pickaway County is described as
                    "a tolerably pleasantly situated village" and Old Woman's Creek as an
                    "inconsiderable stream" in Huron County. Some of the towns he
                    included—for example, Union or Shakerstown in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Warren County</region>
          </placeName> where the Shakers once held all property in common—have subsequently
                    disappeared from the map.</p>
        <p>When John T. Blois published his <hi rend="i">Gazetteer of the State of <placeName>
              <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>

                    a tabulation of the geographical names derived from Indian terms. But his own personal indisposition
                    had postponed publication, and for some of his projects data were missing or could not be collected.
                    He felt that the absence of any such book about Michigan had already deterred settlers from choosing
                    that state for their residence. Many persons would have selected <placeName>

                    retains interest today. His first part—210 pages, which comprise just over half the
                    book—surveys the topography, soil, climate, flora and fauna, rivers and lakes,
                    educational facilities, and internal improvements such as canals and railroads. Over thirty pages
                    are devoted to a summary of the state's history. The second part lists the counties in
                    alphabetical fashion and provides information about boundaries, soil, water, and political
                    organization. The third part is the familiar alphabetical tabulation of places and settlements,
                    including rivers, lakes, townships, and cities. Various appendixes supply information about banks,
                    agricultural production, and mileage between communities.</p>
        <p>Blois, like Kilbourn in his Ohio gazetteer, felt obliged to say something specific about each of the
                    items he listed and sometimes this compulsion taxed his ingenuity. Generally his identifications are
                    enthusiastic: rivers are navigable or important, harbors can be improved easily for future traffic,
                    towns invariably have bright futures. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>

          </placeName>, he reports, was the largest city in the young state (Michigan was admitted into the
                    federal union only a year before Blois published his gazetteer), and boasted almost ten thousand
                    people. It had "a healthy and beautiful location on the west bank of a strait" and
                    was "one of the most ancient settlements in North America."<hi
            rend="sup">10</hi>
                    Yet Blois admits that the plan of the city was rather uncouth and ill-adapted to practical utility.
                    He points out, however, that three of the city's main avenues were two hundred feet wide
                    and that the authorities had begun to pave them with wood.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> In general, <placeName>

                    "insignificant," "diminutive," or
                    "inconsiderable." Blois was only slightly concerned with the origins of place
                    names or even their variant spellings, yet could not resist giving an explanation of the meaning of
                    Manitou (which he defines as the residence of a spirit) or making a comment on the pronunciation of

                    The number of lakes, rivers, and creeks named Portage provoked Blois to comment that the name was
                    apparently applied everywhere that bodies of water were fairly contiguous. Blois refrains from
                    identifying early figures in Michigan history whose names were commemorated in towns; Cassopolis

                    1816, originally appeared in 1826 and is a slighter book than the Ohio and Michigan compilations.
                    Scott devotes 21 pages to introductory material, entitled "General Description of the State
                    of Indiana," and 112 pages to the alphabetical tabulation. In his Preface he gives the
                    usual reasons for his authorship of a gazetteer: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Indiana, although young, comparatively speaking, is not surpassed, in point of natural
                            advantages, by many of the older states; she is rapidly advancing in the great work of
                            internal improvement, in literature, the arts and sciences; and is destined to an important
                            post in the ranks of the Republic. To facilitate her march, and to give, not only to her own
                            citizens, but to those of the neighboring states, and emigrants generally, some idea of her
                            Soil, Climate, Population, and advantages of various kinds, are the primary objects of this

        <p>Scott lists townships, counties, and physical features in the usual way, praising settlements
                    liberally and providing a good deal of information succinctly. He locates counties with reference to
                    the state's boundaries or identifies them as interior counties. Villages are designated as
                    mill sites or post towns; county seats are identified as seats of justice. An interesting feature of
                    Scott's descriptions is his occasional enumeration of the occupations of the citizens, his
                    gazetteer differing radically in this respect from the books of Kilbourn and Blois. Thus the hundred
                    inhabitants of <placeName>

                    such artisans as silversmiths, watchmakers, chairmakers, hatters, and a painter, while the buildings
                    housed groceries, taverns, looms, several manufactories, and a public library which contained 280

        <p>One fascinating aspect of the gazetteer's census of occupations in all the Indiana towns is
                    the high percentage of physicians to the population, literally one to every hundred persons. This
                    ratio would suggest an alarming incidence of disease, a speculation which is confirmed by the
                    prefatory admission that fevers and agues often prevailed in Indiana because of the large amount of
                    marshy land and stagnant water. But a more likely explanation is that the term
                    "physician" denoted not a trained medical man but simply a person who had some
                    knowledge of pills and poultices, perhaps gained pragmatically. One suspects the presence of a large

        <p>The earliest important gazetteer of the Illinois country was the work of Lewis C. Beck, <hi rend="i">A Gazetteer of the States of Illinois and <placeName>
              <region reg="mou" type="state">Missouri</region>
            </placeName>.</hi> The scientific interests of Dr. Beck, a graduate of Union College, led him to
                    be more diligent in the assembling of data about the rocks, soils, water courses, minerals, and
                    plants of the area he concerned himself with than the other compilers of gazetteers had been, and he
                    also relied more fully on the works of previous travelers and explorers. His sense of obligation
                    impelled him to make frequent acknowledgments of the work of Schoolcraft, Brackenridge, and of John
                    Mason Peck, who settled in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
          </placeName> in 1817 and began to collect data long before he published his own guides to emigrants.</p>
        <p>Beck's gazetteer contains 353 pages, about equally divided between Illinois and <placeName>
            <region reg="mou" type="state">Missouri</region>
          </placeName>. His method is the same for each state. The initial geographical and statistical view
                    of the region is followed by an alphabetical listing of counties, towns, villages, rivers, creeks,
                    etc.—in the case of <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
          </placeName>, from Albion to York. The introductory essays, however, also contain important
                    observations on basic features of the topography. Beck's attention was attracted, for
                    example, by the fabulously rich American Bottom extending for a hundred miles along the east bank of
                    the Mississippi River from <placeName>

                    of sand held in suspension by the current below their confluence. Of the Mississippi River below

                    indigenous and that both the soil and the climate of the two states favor tobacco. He asserts that
                    the slopes of the Ohio and Illinois valleys would be quite favorable to viticulture and remarks in

                    relevant or desirable information about the states of the Ohio Valley, he refers readers who need
                    additional data to the standard books of travel and to gazetteers for individual states. But he
                    claims that his volume will appeal to three classes of people: prospective settlers; travelers for
                    pleasure, health, or business; and readers eager to have an accessible and dependable reference book
                    about what he called the "Great West." Eighteen years of experience in the
                    Mississippi Valley, he thought, gave him a vantage point which he supported further by extensive
                    reference to the books produced by travelers.</p>
        <p>The brevity of Peck's emigrant's guide and its geographical scope make the ordinary
                    alphabetical tabulation impossible. Indeed he lists the counties for only two states (Indiana and <placeName>
            <region reg="ilu" type="state">Illinois</region>
          </placeName>), gives only brief descriptions of even the principal towns, and omits the usual
                    geographical data. On the other hand, he provides informative essays about the history, educational
                    institutions, manufactures, climate, and geography of the region, and often makes interesting
                    specific comments. In his enthusiasm for the western country Peck was second to no one. Cabbage
                    heads, he affirms, were often two or three feet in diameter. Beets surpassed twelve inches in
                    circumference and apples from <placeName>

                    yielded one hundred bushels to the acre. Hemp and cotton could be successfully cultivated. Peck
                    condemns farmers for their prejudice against clover and thinks they have been remiss in not erecting
                    barns to shelter crops and tools.<hi

          </hi> Peck went to considerable trouble to verify his facts and to be as complete as
                    possible. He claims in his Introduction: "Accuracy of description, or a registry of facts
                    and things as they actually exist in every part of the state, has been a paramount
                        object."<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Peck interviewed men from every county of Illinois in
                    order to check data; in addition he resided in Vandalia (the capital of the state from 1820 to 1839)
                    during the winter of 1831-1832 for the purpose of searching all the legislative documents and
                    printed laws. The gazetteer had three parts: a general view of the state; a general view of each
                    county; and a particular view of "each town, settlement, stream, prairie, bottom, bluff,
                    etc." Peck incorporates into the Illinois gazetteer much of the general material of the
                    emigrant's guide, repeating many of the original statements about plants and manufactures
                    but revising and updating his information. On the other hand, he provides a fairly full description
                    of each county and, in the second edition of the gazetteer, devotes 168 pages to the geographical
                    tabulation of places. Towns getting special attention are <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Alton</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Kaskaskia</settlement>
          </placeName>, Shawneetown,
                    and Vandalia. Peck describes <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>

          </placeName> as an incorporated city "beautifully situated on level ground," and
                    predicts it will shortly become the "emporium of trade and business for all the northern

        <p>Peck was especially interested in place names. He often gives the etymology of names of French origin

                    established pronunciations and orthography. Peck also records alternative place names, some of which
                    have long since been lost to history. Thus, Job's Settlement in McDonough County was also
                    known as New Hope; Fountain Bluff in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Jackson County</region>

            <region type="county">Daviess County</region>
          </placeName> was once known as Bean River. Occasionally Peck is not explicit where the reader would
                    appreciate additional information. He does not comment on the fact that Troublesome Creek was a
                    branch of Crooked Creek. Yet he is more careful than most compilers of gazetteers to link places
                    with celebrated citizens. He cites Dad Joe's Grove in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Putnam County</region>
          </placeName> as a settlement named after Joseph Smith, and identifies the place of Morris
                    Birkbeck's drowning; he explains the tradition that Starved Rock got its name from a band
                    of Illinois Indians who were marooned and eventually perished on its summit. Peck also notes his
                    indebtedness to previous writers and even borrows their place descriptions; his accounts of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Alton</settlement>

        <p>Four years before statehood Wisconsin had a gazetteer, Increase Allen Lapham's <hi rend="i">A Geographical and Topographical History of <placeName>

            </placeName>

            <settlement type="city">Milwaukee</settlement>
          </placeName>. A "second edition, greatly improved" was published in 1846.
                    Lapham's purpose was the usual one of providing useful information for settlers and
                    recording data for future historians, and he fulfills his intention to the best of his abilities. A
                    long introductory essay of eighty pages sketches the history, geography, mineralogy, geology, and
                    internal improvements of the territory. Population and commercial statistics are provided. Lapham
                    then proceeds to describe the individual counties but on a rather peculiar plan. He first deals with
                    the six counties that touched on Lake <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, then devotes seven pages to the lake itself, and eventually describes the interior and
                    the Mississippi River counties. The second edition of the gazetteer ends with accounts of the new
                    counties established in 1845 in the northwestern section of the territory. Since Lapham disregards
                    alphabetical order, his gazetteers are not adapted to quick reference, but the county descriptions
                    are short and compactly written.</p>

        <p>Lapham was interested in geographical nomenclature and not only gives variant names for rivers or

                    brief summer, and the dryness of the air in winter (he does not emphasize a fact in his own tables

          </placeName> in 1853, is a more substantial volume than Lapham's book and includes
                    additional data. The compiler utilized the help of postmasters and legislators to supplement
                    Lapham's accounts. After some thirty pages of physical description, in which Hunt pays
                    special attention to the rapidly developing lumber industry, he devotes the core of his book to the
                    usual alphabetical list in which counties, towns, rivers, lakes, and post offices are juxtaposed.
                    Hunt makes no effort to discriminate his listings and seldom editorializes. Unique is his comment
                    that flagstones cut from the beautiful limestone produced in Fond du Lac County have "a
                    texture nearly as fine and compact as marble."<hi rend="sup">37</hi> But he is careful to
                    list the economic activities and the professional people in the important communities. Beaver Dam
                    had sawmills, oil mills, and flour mills, store buildings, churches, three hotels, and no less than
                    six doctors for some 1,500 people. Hunt's inventory is factual and objective; it is also
                    thorough. He lists the prairies (Bald, <placeName>

                    history, a commercial census, and the narrative of a tour. Ritchie was also greatly interested in
                    the Lake Superior littoral and devotes one hundred pages of his book to an account of the cities and
                    mineral resources of <placeName>

                    his enthusiasm generally overcame his desire to be informative; moreover, he could not repress his
                    liking for rhetorical effusions. Chapter Five of the second part of his volume is entitled
                    "The Early Settler of Lake Superior," and gives a composite picture of a happy
                    forest dweller and paterfamilias who has migrated from the eastern states to benefit from cheap
                    western land. The account suggests Chateaubriand's idyllic picture of life among the Indian

                    geographical and economic facts that had made the gazetteers focused on the eastern side of the
                    Mississippi of signal value. Newhall is enthusiastic about the new territory; its rolling prairies,
                    its soil, its climate are alike admirable. His intention of course is to provide a brief and concise
                    description but he points out that the editor's task was difficult: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    towns. Fifty pages are devoted to minerals and ores, another fifty pages to Indian history and
                    antiquities. New-hall finds room for short essays about education, agriculture, and churches, and

                    entertaining passages, for the purpose of relieving the reader from the monotony of narrative or the
                    sameness of descriptive detail." Sketches of frontier characters and Indian history,

                    goes on to describe the water courses, the minerals, the animals and plants. With two great rivers

                    The reply was immediate: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>There is a right smart sprinkle of snakes in these parts. I and my brother-in-law went out
                            snaking a few days ago, and we killed three hundred and fifty rattlesnakes, and two <hi rend="i">yearlin</hi> copperheads, and it warn't a very good morning for
                            snaking, neither.</p>

          </quote> The visitor suggested that more favorable weather might produce a better haul. Again the
                    reply was quick: "Ye-s, we cords 'em up, sometimes."<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

        <p>In another incident a frontiersman who was also a state legislator had loaded his keelboat with salt
                    for the market. Rough water caused him to lose his cargo, but he reached shore safely and thanked a
                    housewife for hospitality: <quote rend="blockquote">

        <p>Even the language of the main text reflects Wetmore's knowledge of frontier idiom and
                    evinces his desire to make his book colorful. A figure who is admired is called "a real
                    horse" of a man. Citizens of Independence in <placeName>
            <region type="county">Jackson County</region>

          </placeName> who disliked Mormons warned them to depart "or we'll row you up Salt
                    river!" A botanically unidentified plant called "rattlesnakes'
                    master" is proclaimed a sovereign remedy for snakebite if "properly applied and in
                    season." A colt destined for the race track is identified as "sired by
                    Chain-lightning, out of the celebrated full-blooded dam Earthquake."<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps the really distinctive feature of Wetmore's gazetteer, however, results from his
                    decision to include six stories of western life in a seventy-page appendix. Two of them,
                    "Biography of Blackbird" and "Pawnee Sacrifice," relate to
                    Indian life. One, "The Village Gathering," describes the advent at a backwoods
                    hamlet of a moth-eaten circus or animal show, whose creatures included an elephant, a hyena, a
                    baboon, a dromedary, and a freshly painted zebra. "Annals of the Shop" introduces
                    Dr. Bibo Oxygen, the typical versatile frontiersman who was physician, justice of the peace, notary
                    public, postmaster, and politician simultaneously. "The Dead Husband" is the story
                    of a fugitive from justice. Best of all is "Sketch of Mountain Life," the
                    adventures of a hunter named Gall Buster whose biography epitomizes the frontier: "I was
                    raised in <placeName>
            <region reg="ncu" type="state">North Carolina</region>
          </placeName>, got religion in <placeName>

          </placeName>, <placeName>
            <region reg="kyu" type="state">Kentucky</region>
          </placeName>, and emigrated and settled in Missouri in 'early times.'
                        "<hi rend="sup">55</hi> Gall Buster is at times correct in his speech and at other
                    times drops into the vernacular; his language is sharply contrasted with that of Jonas Cutting, a
                    "downeaster" who is his companion on various expeditions. Gall Buster's
                    story is full of escapes from grizzly bears, quests for deer, and meetings with
                    "painters." But, like Natty Bumppo's reliable firearm, his gun Sweet-lips
                    never misses. These six tales not only contribute to the development of the American short story but
                    they add immeasurably to the richness and interest of Wetmore's gazetteer. No other
                    compiler of an American geographical handbook ventured so far afield in order to vary the content
                    and style of his volume.</p>

                    Newhall, he died of cholera. It will be noticed that virtually all of these men were New Englanders.
                    Several were college graduates but for the most part they were self-educated, often with a natural
                    bent toward science. Lured westward by various factors, they resided in the regions of their choice
                    and most of them died there, Dr. Beck being a conspicuous exception.<hi rend="sup">56</hi>
        </p>

        <p>Their gazetteers were based on the hard strata of personal experience, supplemented by extensive
                    travel, interviews, correspondence, and diligent reading of the available records. They consistently
                    strove for accuracy and completeness. They tried to make their books as substantial, as factual, as
                    reliable as they could, regardless of the fact that the extraordinary growth of the Middle West
                    between 1815 and 1850 soon made their tabulations obsolescent. Personal prejudices are not absent
                    from their accounts, but a century later the most subjective works are often the most interesting.
                    Because of the conscientiousness of the compilers, because of their shrewdness and diversified
                    backgrounds, their books still have value and interest. As the editor of a modern reprint of John
                    Scott's Indiana book recently observed, Scott's gazetteer had omissions and
                    errors. "But underneath he has left a solid core of good history."<hi rend="sup">57</hi>

        <p>The most valuable index to the actual use of the library is an incomplete circulation book. Its
                    thirty-four pages contain entries for 1835-1841 and provide the only available record of the use of
                    the library. This circulation record seems to confirm the conclusion that while the library company
                    tended to be controlled by the business and professional men, membership and use were open to all
                    groups and individuals. Thus, in 1836-1837, withdrawals were made by editors and printers Elihu
                    Stout, R. Y. Caddington, and Samuel Hill; by lawyers and judges Abner T. Ellis, Benjamin M. Thomas,

          </placeName>; by physicians Joseph Somes, John D. Woolverton, and Nicholas Troost; and by a dozen
                    merchants, ministers, and teachers. At the same time, among the patrons of the library were men like
                    blacksmith Henry Wheeler, who withdrew 75 books between February, 1838, and April, 1841; John B.
                    Martin, a tailor; Thomas Bishop, a carpenter; Samuel Emison, a miller; and a dozen farmers, one of

                    company's early years–was to authorize residents planning a trip to

                    moved "That Mr. Geo. Wallace be authorised and requested to purchase in Phila. the books
                    above mentioned to the amount of one hundred and fifty dollars, beginning at the head of the
                    list." The books purchased as a result of this authorization were produced by Wallace at a

          </placeName> Library Company which follows covers the period from the organizational meeting of July
                    20, 1806, to the regular board meeting preceding the shareholders' annual meeting of
                    February, 1817. The men who served as officers and on the committees of the company during that
                    period are seen successfully dealing with the problems common–and usually
                    destructive– to social libraries in the early nineteenth century, and with the added
                    problems brought on by the War of 1812. A writer in the <hi
            rend="i">Western Sun</hi> of April 6,
                    1808, referring to the etablish-ment of the library, noted: "considering all the
                    circumstances of difficulty in which the attempt was made, its success has equalled the most
                    sanguine expectations of its patrons." The writer's optimism was based on some
                    encouraging statistics: by April, 1808, the company's "transfer book"
                    listed forty shareholders, half a dozen of whom owned two shares each, and in March, 1809, a special
                    committee reported that during the previous year $80.6114 had been collected in
                    "fines and dues" and $80.59 had been spent on the purchase and
                    transportation costs of books.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>
        </p>

        <p>The early vitality of the institution suggested by such evidence is further revealed by the fact that
                    the War of 1812 and the Indian trouble which preceded it merely retarded rather than killed the
                    library company. The impact of the war on the company was felt in several ways. For example, between
                    August, 1806, and February, 1812, 54 shares in the company were sold, but between February, 1812,
                    and December, 1814, only three shares were sold. It seems more than possible that the Indian menace
                    and the military crisis had some relationship to the fact that in 1811 five of ten and in 1812 five
                    of nine board meetings were adjourned for lack of a quorum, and that there were no meetings held
                    between July 6, 1814, and December 4, 1815. However, by <list type="footnotes">

                    minutes the library company had resumed its regular shareholders' and directors'
                    meetings and its purchases of books. That it had survived for a decade and was intact when Indiana
                    was admitted to the Union was an impressive testimony to its utility. During the next few years the
                    library showed rapid growth. In the period from December, 1815, to August, 1820, the company nearly
                    doubled its membership by adding 35 shareholders, many of whom settled in <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
          </placeName> during the postwar migration from the Atlantic states. During this same period the
                    company's book holdings increased from just over 600 in February, 1817, to 970 in April,
                    1820.</p>

        <p>Following its brief revival, the company's progress from 1820 to 1823 tends to validate the
                    conclusion that "the fortunes of the social library movement were reflections of the
                    undulations in economic activity from the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of the
                    nineteenth" and that they were "so directly dependent upon the day-to-day incomes
                    of their members that they reacted as delicate barometers of economic activity."<hi rend="sup">53</hi> Thus, the Panic of 1819 and the depression which followed became an economic
                    disaster for the West in general and, if a contemporary analysis can be trusted, for <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            rend="sup">54</hi> That the "hard times" of the
                    early 1820's again temporarily stunted the growth of the library company is suggested by
                    its failure to add a single new member from August 9, 1820, to April 12, 1823; by the acquisition of
                    less than one hundred books during the same period, and by the board's preoccupation with
                    either instituting suits for the collection of dues or granting the remission of fines imposed for
                    failure to pay annual dues.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>

                    about three decades. No meetings of the board or shareholders are recorded between February 4, 1861,

                    circulation book, and the list of shareholders, and from contemporary newspaper comment it is
                    possible to trace the history of the company from the economic crisis of the early 1820's
                    through a period of recovery during the latter part of that decade to an era of renewed vigor in the
                    1830's. This strength was evident in the attendance at annual meetings, the regularity of
                    board meetings, and the increase in the company's book holdings. The anonymous writer who
                    praised the company's book collection was also gratified "to see how liberally

          <hi rend="i">The Arts in Early American History,</hi> Essay by Walter Muir Whitehill. Bibliography

          </placeName>, Va., 1965. Pp. xv, 170. Index. $4.50.)</head>
        <p>This volume is a report of a conference held by the Institute of Early American History and Culture
                    at <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Williamsburg</settlement>
          </placeName> on March 7, 1964, to assess the state of knowledge of the arts in this country.
                    Participating were a representative group of historians and museum directors concerned with varied
                    aspects of the arts. In the Preface Whitehill comments that he at first had some doubt that early
                    American arts "because of their provincial and derivative nature could compete with their
                    European prototypes for study by any great number of art historians," but that E. P.
                    Richardson had pointed out "what can be learned from a colonial or frontier scene when the
                    arts are viewed not as an end in themselves but as an element in human society." This
                    statement provides a clue to the treatment of the subject at the conference. The arts in early
                    America, the conference made clear, are an index to the culture and history of that period.</p>
        <p>Whitehill's introductory essay in this volume sums up the collective wisdom of the
                    participating historians. Entitled "An Unexploited Historical Resource," it
                    emphasizes the necessity of understanding the way people lived, the things with which they
                    surrounded themselves, their efforts at aesthetic adornment of their houses, and the countless ways
                    in which they tried to improve their cultural level.</p>
        <p>Until fairly recently, art historians concerned themselves primarily with the "great
                    art" of Europe with perhaps some attention to Chinese ceramics, but all that has now
                    changed. The art historian has found that the silversmiths of New <placeName>
            <country reg="enk">England</country>
          </placeName> in the seventeenth century, or the cabinetmakers of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
          </placeName> in the eighteenth century, or the folk arts of the Pennsylvania Germans are subjects
                    worthy of his scholarship and learning. For this development, much credit must be given to the
                    museums devoted to the decorative arts in America, particularly to the Henry Francis du Pont
                    Winterthur Museum, over which Richardson presides. Already this museum has virtually revolutionized
                    the attitude of many young scholars toward American social history. They have discovered that not
                    all comprehension of the history of the past comes from books and that artifacts have a story to
                    tell.</p>

        <p>This volume provides a carefully annotated bibliography of works about the arts in early America.
                    Divided by subjects, it not only shows what has been done but suggests areas where further
                    exploration is needed. "Its silences automatically indicate needs and opportunities for
                    study," Whitehill points out. "Many of the books that it lists were printed in
                    small editions and are now hard to find. Some could well be revised and improved; others need wholly
                    new substitutes" (p. 28). In <pb
            id="VAA4025-061-4-120" n="392"/> short, this report is
                    filled with suggestions for useful research that professors of American studies might well
                    contemplate when they are casting about for subjects to recommend to hopeful candidates for the
                    doctorate.</p>

        <p>Unlike too many bibliographies of this type, that of Jane and Wendell Garrett has valuable notes
                    appended to most of the items listed. The student is not left wondering whether the book is really
                    pertinent. These able bibliographers provide sufficient information to tell wherein it is useful.
                    For instance, a volume on <hi rend="i">Early American Decorated Tinware</hi> has this note:
                    "An illustrated history of tinware and tinsmiths carried back to the beginnings of oriental
                    lacquer and forward to a tin-wedding celebration of 1873." Scholars can be grateful to the
                    Institute of Early American History and Culture for inspiring a useful conference and for
                    stimulating the production of a handbook valuable to all who work in the field of American social
                    history.</p>

                    Notes, appendix, bibliography, index. $5.00.)</head>
        <p>This study traces British military policy toward the Loyalists during the War for Independence. It
                    was a policy reflecting political considerations at home, the Loyalist potential in America, and the
                    actual course of the war itself. At first British confidence in a short war with a successful
                    outcome was based in part on the imagined strength of the Loyalists. A varying strategy, never well
                    understood, regarding use of the Loyalists sometimes ignored their proffered help and at other times
                    courted it. Sometimes they were organized to fight, at other times merely for their own protection.
                    And in the end they were used as an excuse to continue what many members of Parliament considered an
                    otherwise hopeless war.</p>
        <p>As the war progressed, misunderstandings between provincial troops and regulars, common during the
                    colonial wars, remained an unsolved problem. Provincials were regarded as a stopgap in the first
                    year of the war. For the short war anticipated, untrained Loyalist regiments offered an expensive
                    and unsatisfactory solution. Britain prepared to rely on the regulars.</p>
        <p>Planning for 1777 was based on a reappraisal of rebel strength and an enlarged role for the
                    Loyalists, since Britain could not possibly provide Howe with the reinforcements he deemed
                    necessary. Smith credits undue optimism about Loyalist support for the failure to coordinate
                    Burgoyne's campaign with that of General Howe. The difficulties of both generals would seem
                    to stem, according to Smith's evidence, from the actual lack of the large numbers of
                    Loyalists historians usually have assumed were in the middle states.</p>

        <p>The author raises but does not answer the question of whether they were fewer in number or merely
                    lacking in zeal and capability. Just <pb
            id="VAA4025-061-4-121" n="393"/> how big a reservoir of
                    manpower Britain could call upon in America remains a moot point. Smith does note the lack of
                    consideration, and the careless and inconsistent treatment the Loyalists suffered both in and out of
                    the service. He concludes that though Britain had many "friends" in America, many
                    of them refused an active role in the war. After 1778 the Provincial Line never rose above an
                    estimated 10,000, a figure Britain had hoped for earlier, but which later fell below her
                    expectations.</p>
        <p>After 1778, Britain's strategy was concentrated on the South, an expected center of
                    Loyalism. With the entry of <placeName>
            <country reg="fr">France</country>
          </placeName> into the war, the British were forced to consider their home defenses first. Able to
                    spare little more for America, they had to relinquish the offensive on land in favor of defensive
                    and naval war. Seizing and holding the Southern states with expected Loyalist support would at least
                    maintain appearances in America for the sake of the shaky North regime. And, indeed, protection of
                    American Loyalists became the major argument of the British administration for continuing the war.
                    When the chimera of strong Loyalist forces to be rallied in America failed, the war could no longer
                    be sustained.</p>
        <p>Although the British army was at first militarily successful in the South, administrative errors
                    aroused new revolutionary zeal, Loyalist support in sufficient amount was not forthcoming, and the
                    army was inadequate to its task of protecting Loyalists or cowing the patriots. By 1782 even the
                    British government had seen the futility of a war waged to protect American friends. Events had
                    demonstrated that adequate Loyalist assistance could not be aroused because Britain had failed to
                    provide sufficient leadership, encouragement, and support from first to last.</p>
        <p>Smith has succeeded in providing an important new interpretation of the Loyalists in the American
                    Revolution, emphasizing both the significant role they might have played in the limited war Britain
                    was forced to wage in America, and their political importance to the government in prolonging the
                    North ministry and the war.</p>

        <p>Reviewers' response to the publication of the first three volumes of <hi
            rend="i">Papers</hi> is a mixture of praise and criticism. The editorial work is charged with having gone as
                    far or high as such a thing could go. The footnotes, it is claimed, adequately identify every proper
                    name, and clarify, for the general reader, unusual words and controversial questions.
                    Bibliographical completeness is recognized. The exacting standards of superlative scholarship and
                    the incredible industry of the editors are generally admitted. Yet the editors are charged, too,
                    with the treatment of trivia, and pedantic and even absurd annotation. Reviewers have <pb
            id="VAA4025-061-4-122" n="394"/> accused them of having padded the first three volumes with
                    "piddling documents laboriously glossed," and with "substituting an
                    overabundance of industry for a sense of proportion."</p>
        <p>The fourth volume includes two hundred eleven papers of which only thirty-five have, in whole or in
                    part, been printed in earlier editions of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName>'s hand, and an additional seventeen record what he said or wrote. Nineteen
                    dispatches prepared by his colleagues in the Virginia delegation to Congress were signed or
                    otherwise approved by <placeName>

            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName> personally, and twenty-four addressed to the Virginia delegation in Congress, are also
                    included. The remaining items consist of motions, committee reports, and editorial comments on
                    misdated or missing documents.</p>
        <p>The editorial pattern set in the first three volumes continues in the fourth volume: prodigious
                    industry persists; meticulous annotation is abundant; editorial notes are at times laborious but
                    usually fruitful; the index, typically thorough, conveniently points the reader to documents and
                    footnotes in this and the preceding volumes.</p>
        <p>Absurdity, trivia, and disproportion, like beauty, are judged by the beholder–or reviewer.
                    This reviewer, though admittedly lost at times among the documents and their annotations, accepts
                    the intent of the editors and commends them for their success. True, no issue confronting the
                    Continental Congress or the Commonwealth of Virginia was resolved during the seven months
                    encompassed by this volume. Nor is the origin or culmination of any major issue revealed by the
                    documents. But the many references to the continuous problems of western land claims, the shortage
                    of money, illicit trade with the enemy, war debts and congressional requisitions, interstate
                    rivalries, British peace overtures, battles and rumors of battles in the West Indies, will, when the
                    volumes are completed, bring these issues into focus insofar as they relate to <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
          </placeName>. Personal observations and interesting anecdotes, sprinkled throughout the documents,
                    lend local color and delightful detail.</p>

        <p>This volume is no compact narrative. No new historical interpretations challenge the reader. No
                    reader will be engrossed in its contents into the wee hours of the morning. The layman probably
                    won't use it, nor will the professional engage his colleagues in arguments about its truth
                    or its philosophy. And for good reason, for these are not the objectives of the <hi rend="i">Papers.</hi>

        <p>Curry's purpose in writing <hi rend="i">A House Divided</hi> was threefold: "to
                    determine whether earlier works on the 'disruption of <placeName>

                    examine aspects of Civil War policies in West Virginia that have not been investigated by other
                    historians" (pp. 2-3). Although a large order for so small a volume–there are
                    only 140 pages of text–the author has in part succeeded. The book's central
                    theme challenges the traditional contention that West Virginians overwhelmingly opposed secession
                    and favored separate statehood. While recognizing the strength of Unionism in northwestern <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName>, Curry distinguishes between this section and the total area of the new state. He
                    proves, with statistics compiled from many sources, that "half the counties included in the
                    'new State' area were opposed to statehood; and that 40 per cent of the people in
                    West Virginia were Secessionists" (p. 13). Earlier historians interpreted the origins of
                    the "war born state" in terms of sectional grievances dating back to the American
                    Eevolution. Curry believes that the statehood movement can be understood only in terms of the
                    changing pattern of sectionalism between 1830 and 1861. He also credits McClellan's
                    mountain campaign and the support of federal troops for making a separate state movement possible.</p>
        <p>Whether or not it belongs to that genre of historical literature, <hi rend="i">A House Divided</hi>
                    suffers from many of the faults found in published Ph.D. dissertations. The volume is confusingly
                    organized and in spots reveals the pedestrian quality of research studies in education. Curry
                    overemphasizes the uniqueness and importance of his conclusions and is somewhat intolerant of other
                    historians' views and errors. The shifting pattern of sectional conflict is hardly a new
                    concept even if it has never been applied to the history of West <placeName>
            <region reg="vau" type="state">Virginia</region>
          </placeName>. The contention that democratic gains in the 1850 Virginia constitution were eastern
                    not western victories is at least debatable. Curry nowhere defines a "Copperhead"
                    but uses the term variously to describe opponents of emancipation, Conservative Unionists, and
                    Democrats. The author castigates other writers for their treatment of John Carlile and his defection
                    from the statehood movement; yet, Curry's own explanation is much too facile.</p>

        <p>Despite the book's faults, students of Civil War politics and West Virginia history must
                    take <hi rend="i">A House Divided</hi> into account. The author's story of the complexities
                    of state and local politics is undoubtedly more accurate than the simpler pictures heretofore
                    presented. Although somewhat aside from the central theme, Chapter 6, "Ohio to the
                    Rescue," is the best in the book and gives deserved praise to <placeName>
            <region reg="ohu" type="state">Ohio</region>
          </placeName>'s Governor William Dennison. A few readers may question the use of county
                    histories and the partisan press as bases for statistical analyses, but the appendixes, containing
                    compilations of West Virginia election returns, are invaluable. Curry's conclusion that the
                    statehood movement cannot be judged "solely in the vacuum of constitutionality"
                    but must be considered as a war measure is an important contribution to West Virginia history.</p>

        <p>This book was awarded the Transportation History prize of the Mississippi Valley Historical
                    Association, which should come as no surprise to any of its readers. The author studied the
                    relationship of railroads to federal regulation to ascertain whether legislative controls were
                    foisted upon railroad men or whether the controls sought and embraced. Professor Kolko, after
                    painstaking research and careful craftsmanship, concludes, as does the reviewer, that railroad
                    executives were generally aware of the necessity of governmental action in order to minimize some of
                    the difficulties growing out of competition and extensive construction. Indeed, regulations seldom
                    come to an industry against its will. Executives frequently protest the controls and may feel some
                    impairment of their freedom to act. Most of them, however, when confronted with the alternative of
                    no control, confess that, although they should be modified, the regulations are good.</p>
        <p>Professor Kolko had access to most of the literature of the period under study and made extensive use
                    of private papers and governmental reports which are ordinarily not consulted. He concludes that
                    railroad tycoons found state regulation more of a nuisance than a solution. Their pools and rate
                    agreements proved to be relatively unstable. Kolko agrees with Lee Benson that the influence of the
                    Grangers on the creation of the ICC was less than Ida M. Tarbell thought. Nor does the author think
                    that railroad officials deliberately initiated the federal controls. But Kolko seems to think that
                    the independent oil producers of <placeName>
            <region reg="pau" type="state">Pennsylvania</region>
          </placeName>, working through Representative James Hopkins of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>
          </placeName>, provided some of the initiative in behalf of their colleagues. Benson, on the other
                    hand, thinks that <placeName>
            <region reg="nyu" type="state">New York</region>
          </placeName> merchants were the most important single group working for the ICC bill. By the end of
                    the 1870's and in the early 1880's, various railroad officials came out in favor
                    of control, though there were diehards. Charles Francis Adams, Jr., apparently was willing to have a
                    bill providing for federal control but wished it to be harmless. With the notable exception of
                    Charles E. Perkins of the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Burlington</settlement>
          </placeName>, support grew stronger and when the law went into effect on February 4, 1887, the
                    welcome sign was out.</p>
        <p>A combination of vagueness in the bill and pro-railroad appointments to the ICC by President <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>

          </placeName> made early regulation rather weak. Only commission member Aldace F. Walker had any
                    great knowledge of railroad administration. The fumbling of the early years is depicted in detail in
                    Kolko's work, as is the ambivalence of President Theodore Roosevelt. Perhaps so much
                    strengthening of the federal role came during Roosevelt's administration because
                    dissatisfaction with state control was so great. Kolko's analysis of the reglatory
                    situation in 1908 leans heavily upon a thesis which Marver H. Bernstein espoused in 1955. Kolko
                    reproduces a delightful and incisive quote from <hi rend="i">Regulating Business by Independent
                        Commission</hi> (p. 87): "Its (the ICC) functions are less those of a policeman and
                    more like that of a manager of an industry. The approach and point of view of the regulatory process
                    began to partake of those of business management."</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-061-4-125" n="397"/>
        <p>Kolko neatly summarizes some of his views near the end of the book when he asserts: "If
                    Roosevelt played the role of the self-anointed and fundamentally conservative defender of the best
                    interests of the railroads, and Taft the role of his politically inept but well-intentioned echo,
                    Wilson was to assume the part of the nationalistic advocate of the railroads who allowed the
                    railroads to define his role for him" (p. 208). By the end of the period the railroad
                    served the government and the government seemed to serve the railroads. This mutual relationship was
                    disadvantageous to the railroads in the ensuing period, and the book closes with the railroads about
                    to move into an era of heightened competition with rival modes of transportation. To this day the
                    industry struggles to keep the share of the market which remains after those private and unregulated
                    carriers have skimmed much of the choice movement. If Professor Kolko were to do a series of books
                    on influences over the allocation of resources for transport, he would now write of the power of the
                    public purse, private fleets, the strategic role of the Bureau of the Budget, and the activities of
                    the Department of Commerce. The Interstate Commerce Commission would probably not claim much of his
                    attention.</p>

        <p>The late Carl L. Lokke, former chief of the foreign affairs branch of the National Archives, has
                    presented in <hi rend="i">Klondike Saga</hi> a narrative of the Monitor Gold Mining and Trading
                    Company of sixteen Minnesotans who went to Western <placeName>
            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
          </placeName> in the 1890's. His story is based upon diaries, letters, and newspaper
                    articles the Minnesotans wrote during that trip. Most of the party were young Scandinavian
                    immigrants to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>. The author's grandfather, Lars Gunderson, was the company's leader.
                    Through their narrative one may catch glimpses of the gold rush at its peak. A kaleidoscope of
                    prospectors' experiences, it describes forms of transportation, climbing the Chilkoot Pass,
                    murderous snowslides, boat building, shooting the Whitehorse rapids, and prospecting in the Yukon
                    and Stewart tributaries. Much of the book treats life on the creeks and wilderness survival. When
                    others left the Stewart River country because they failed to strike it rich, the Monitors continued
                    digging for a new Bonanza. But they never found it.</p>
        <p>In his prologue the author remarks that those familiar with the story of Norwegian-Americans will
                    find few surprises in this account of their activities in the Yukon country. They displayed there
                    the same characteristics as the pioneers of the Middle West–physical stamina,
                    self-discipline, willingness to endure hardships, and independence of spirit. Like their Dawson
                    contemporaries, they visited saloons, dance-halls, and gambling places. Yet their chronicles do not
                    dwell on examples of human frailty. Rather they recounted spectacular scenery and problems common to
                    those who toiled for gold.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-061-4-126" n="398"/>
        <p>Lokke contends that the venture proved a modern parallel to earlier Viking exploration, that in
                    spirit they were close to youthful adventurers of all places and times. Further, he believes that
                    the experience quickened the Americanization of the European-born. For "the free and easy
                    life of the mining frontier soon broke down separatist, old-country patterns and substituted new
                    ones native to the land" (p.191). The best writing in the volume is the description of the
                    Chilkoot ordeal and danger and violent death from the deadly avalanches in the mountains and
                    boat-smashing boulders in the tricky rivers of the North.</p>
        <p>Although the Monitors returned to the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> without gold, they felt themselves wealthier men, reminiscent of the Arctic tale that

        <p>After the death of William Jennings Bryan, H. L. Mencken commented on the career of the Great
                    Commoner: "He came into life a hero, a Galahad, in bright and shining armor. He was passing
                    out a poor mountebank." In so writing, Mencken gave expression to what was to become a
                    standard evaluation. Yet, as Lawrence W. Levine proves conclusively, that evaluation can no longer
                    be considered satisfactory. <hi rend="i">Defender of the Faith,</hi> according to the author,
                    originated in an effort to discover why a man who had spent most of his life as a crusader for
                    social and economic reform ended his days as the champion of an outdated rural evangelism. A careful
                    reading of the record, however, led Professor Levine to the view that such a transformation never
                    really took place. As he sees it, the central problem of Bryan's last years is not one of
                    understanding why Bryan changed, but why he proved incapable of change. In addressing himself to
                    this more complex problem, he makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the period
                    during and after World War I.</p>
        <p>The major premise of this book, then, is that Bryan's last ten years were "a finely
                    structured microcosm of his entire career" (p. 358). To demonstrate the validity of this
                    contention Levine probes deeply into the congeries of beliefs–the faith–which
                    lay behind Bryan's efforts for world peace, his continued pleading for reform measures such
                    as woman suffrage, his advocacy of prohibition, and his identification with fundamentalism. Among
                    the central concepts of the Commoner's faith were his Jeffersonian-Jacksonian trust in the
                    people and his distrust of business privilege, concepts which are evident in the early Bryan who
                    would not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.</p>

        <p>Later in life, after World War I had come, Bryan "attempted to convince the government to
                    call a halt to the process which he claimed <pb
            id="VAA4025-061-4-127" n="399"/> had turned every
                    preceding war into an instrument which coined the sacrifices of the many into profits for the
                    few" (p. 98). He spoke out against the liquor interests, whose passion for dollars was so
                    great "that they would, if they could, make drunkards of the entire army" (p.
                    119). And both before the war and after, he rejected Darwinism in part "because it depicted
                    man as having reached his present state 'by the operation of the law of hate–the
                    merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak,' while he preferred to
                    believe that 'love rather than hatred is the law of development'" (p.
                    261).</p>
        <p>Thus it was that in essentials Bryan's beliefs during his later years remained consistent
                    with ideas he expressed early in life. How, then, does Levine explain that consistency? Beyond this,
                    how does he account for the prevalent idea that Bryan began his career as a progressive and ended it
                    as a reactionary? Always representative of a rural ethos, Bryan's mentality was a
                    populist-progressive mentality: "It did not seek, it knew. Its weapons were not pragmatic
                    but moral. Its outlook was not relative but absolute" (p.364). His was, in other words, a
                    mind which could not readily adapt itself to changes which raised questions about his most cherished
                    beliefs. The times did change. Bryan neither comprehended nor accepted the dynamics of urbanization,
                    industrialization, and scientific advance. "And if his final years ended in
                    tragedy," concludes Levine, "it was not the tragedy of a good man gone bad, but
                    the tragedy of a good faith too blindly held and too uncritically applied" (p. 365).</p>
        <p>This is an important work. It is important because it treats Bryan as a plausible figure in a period
                    that has often been misunderstood because a generation of scholars could not bring itself to look
                    upon Bryan as a plausible figure. It is important because Levine skillfully analyzes the
                    assumptions, thought processes, and actions of a leader who embodied a significant part of the
                    American experience. It is important because we have here a treasury of provocative suggestions
                    about what happened to agrarian progressivism during and after World War I.</p>

        <p>J. <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>

          </placeName> Jameson is the honored victim of a small volume of tributes by former colleagues and
                    associates, all of whom should have known better. Ostensibly designed to rescue the master from
                    obscurity, the essays, taken together and separately, merely reinforce the notion that there was
                    something seriously lacking in Jameson's career. By what can only be described as blind
                    perversity, the editors deal with Jameson's shortcomings as evidence of his greatness. His
                    inability to write extensively is turned into an act of self-sacrifice. His difficult personality is
                    made to seem the qualities of a gentleman of the old school. The relationship between personality
                    and professional posture <pb
            id="VAA4025-061-4-128" n="400"/> and performance is nowhere touched
                    upon. In brief, the contributors to this volume give us nothing but the most superficial account of
                    Jameson and they do so in such a manner as to make him seem more than ever a secondary figure among
                    American historians.</p>
        <p>One gathers only by reading between the lines that there is a story, and a rather pertinent and
                    poignant one, that remains to be told. Allan Nevins, one of a number of distinguished contributors,
                    comes closest when he suggests that Jameson courted anonymity. But, caught up in conventional
                    eulogy, Nevins too must make this trait seem an adornment rather than a defect. Boyd C. Shafer,
                    dealing with "Jameson as Editor," offers the entirely irrelevant observation that
                    "editors are creative" after having cited Jameson's own confessions of
                    inadequacy. What Shafer and the other contributors refuse to concede is precisely Jameson's
                    dissatisfactions with his career. Thus one of the editors, Ruth Anna Fisher, insists that
                    "he could have written great books" but chose instead to serve the needs of other
                    historians. And again, Donald H. Mugridge, whose bibliography of Jameson's writings closes
                    the volume, argues that Jameson "sacrificed his own potentialities as a writer of history
                    in the interest of the organization of historical scholarship in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>" (p. 100). All this of course is nonsense and does an injustice to a vastly
                    complex and vital figure.</p>

        <p>The poverty of conception that characterizes this book is especially evidenced by the failure to
                    treat Jameson's original writings, particularly his one work that is a major contribution
                    to American historiography, <hi rend="i">The American Revolution Considered as a Social
                    Movement.</hi> One can only surmise that the editors were so committed to the vindication of their
                    hero as editor-archivist-administrator that they dared not take the risk of confronting his limited
                    output as a practicing historian. But by failing to do so they merely admit their own inability to
                    face up to the man as he actually was, and what he actually was is of far greater interest to the
                    historical fraternity than the papier-mâché "monument" the
                    editors endeavor to raise in his name.</p>
        <p>How does it happen that those who came to praise Jameson succeed only in burying him?
                    Jameson's career was devoted to the cause of professionalism. The good works and services
                    he contributed to the profession are the principal subject matter of the essays that make up this
                    book and are cited by the contributors as positive evidence of Jameson's worthiness.
                    Nowhere in these essays is there evidence of the slightest discernment of the crucial connection
                    between Jameson's professional role and his self-confessed feelings of inadequacy as a
                    teacher and writer. To make that connection would have required some painful probing of precisely
                    those professional practices and pretensions that permitted a man of Jameson's temperament
                    to retreat into an impersonal realm of administrative and scholarly endeavor. Are not those same
                    professional standards Jameson nurtured so lovingly the outward signs of an inward flight from
                    written history as a personal statement? But, rather than confront such sensitive issues, the
                    editors and contributors settled for a ritual praise that merely obscures the real Jameson and the
                    profession he served so faithfully.</p>

          <hi rend="i">The Myth of the 'New History': The Techniques and Tactics of the
                        New Mythologists of American History.</hi> By David L. Hoggan. (Nutley, N.J.: The Craig Press,
                    1965. Pp. vi, 250. Notes, bibliographical supplement, index. $4.50.)</head>
        <p>The author's plan is to consider how American historians have treated eight crises: the
                    various wars the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> has participated in. His purpose is to demonstrate how errant the mainstream of
                    American historical writing has become. The "New History" in his title refers to
                    the current status of our historiography, rather than to an analysis of the work of James Harvey
                    Robinson, although Chapter 10 does deal with what Hoggan takes to be the invidious influence of that
                    practitioner.</p>
        <p>Hoggan has investigated widely, yet his preconceptions have kept him from understanding or
                    assimilating much of what he has read. Moreover, he has either purposely or inadvertently ignored
                    numerous sources that would temper or negate many of his assertions. One of the fundamental defects
                    of this book, in fact, is its assertive nature. Hoggan is given to postulates for which no
                    believable evidence exists. His unsupported statements and unqualified assertions prevent the book
                    from being considered as serious scholarship; rather it is a tasteless and frightfully misconceived
                    polemic.</p>
        <p>As crippling as Hoggan's methodology is, an even greater flaw is his obsession with the
                    rectitude of Hitler's diplomatic and military aims. The author does not confine his views
                    on Nazi <placeName>
            <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
          </placeName> to the chapter on World War II, but rather permeates the book with them. These
                    intrusive opinions illustrate another weakness of the volume, its disorganization. In many chapters
                    the author treats so many disparate factors that he loses the focus. And he deals with his material
                    so haphazardly that it is impossible to sense any sequential development.</p>
        <p>To answer all of Hoggan's allegations would require a volume equal in length to his. But
                    some sampling will illustrate his technique and demonstrate its worthlessness for the serious
                    student. He restates his thesis that World War II resulted from the machinations of Lord <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Halifax</settlement>
          </placeName>: "As demonstrated in my book, <hi rend="i">When Peaceful Revision Failed
                        …</hi>
          <placeName>
            <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
          </placeName>, whatever her faults in her own domestic system and foreign policy, was the victim of
                    an English Tory conspiracy in September, 1939" (p. 4). Perhaps Hoggan demonstrated this to
                    his own satisfaction, but the storm of criticism that greeted the <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
          </placeName> edition, <hi rend="i">Der Erzwungene Krieg,</hi> hardly demonstrates that he did so to
                    the satisfaction of the community of scholars. Again Hoggan declares: "The documentary
                    record has long since revealed that in 1939 it was Hitler's utmost desire to enjoy peaceful
                    and friendly relations, and if possible even alliances, with both Great Britain and <placeName>
            <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
          </placeName>" (p. 5); and, "… <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
          </placeName> and Japanese victory in World War II would not have included an invasion of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> but rather merely a successful defense against American efforts to invade <placeName>
            <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
          </placeName> and <placeName>
            <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
          </placeName>" (p. 64). Such statements as these need no further comment to establish the
                    author as an apologist for fascism.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-061-4-130" n="402"/>
        <p>A different kind of misunderstanding or ignorance besets Hoggan when he speaks
                    historiographically–perhaps, though, this is just another facet of his ungrounded
                    assertions or of his unwillingness to consider contrary evidence. He asserts that Thomas J.
                    Wertenbaker's reputation as a student of eighteenth-century America "has been
                    maintained without challenge since the publication of his first major study more than fifty years
                    ago" (p. 49). How about the impressive rehabilitation of Wertenbaker's "<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>

          </placeName> Oligarchy" coming from the works of Morison, Miller, and Murdock? And the
                    major revision on the role of Nathaniel Bacon offered by Wilcomb Washburn, <hi
            rend="i">The Governor
                        and the Rebel"!</hi> That Hoggan knows something of Kenneth Stampp is clear from his
                    reference to <hi
            rend="i">And the War Came,</hi> but it is just as clear that he is ignorant of <hi rend="i">The Peculiar Institution</hi> when he says, "Slavery was virtually bankrupt by
                    1861 … the high price of Negroes, the low percentage of profit on their
                    employment–all these suggested that the slavery system in the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> was on its way out by 1861" (p. 99). Whether Stampp was right or wrong, Hoggan
                    cannot legitimately ignore him in a discussion of the historical writing on the economics of
                    slavery.</p>
        <p>Pervading the book is Hoggan's religious preoccupation. The reviewer neither comments on the
                    quality of the author's religious experience, nor questions his religious motives. But
                    Hoggan's frequent use of religious allusions gives the book a special coloration; to wit:
                    "The specifically American system consists of a Christian constitutional system of
                    limitations in politics and a free market along scriptural lines in economics" (p. 1).</p>
        <p>A final disquieting factor is the extreme sloppiness of the editing. Apparently neither the author
                    nor the editor knows that the leading student of <placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>

          </placeName> is Irving Brant–not Bryant, as it is printed in both text and index. And
                    neither knows that Brant's publisher is Bobbs-Merrill, not the Indiana University Press.
                    Neither examined the discrepancy between Eugene C. Baker in text and index and the Eugene C. Barker
                    in the citations. Walter Millis is credited with <hi
            rend="i">The National Spirit</hi> rather than
                    his justly famous <hi rend="i">The Martial Spirit.</hi> The magnitude of the errors in this book
                    indicates that Hoggan would have been well advised not to venture into the area of <placeName>

          <hi rend="i">The Middle Western Farm Novel in the Twentieth Century.</hi> By Roy W. Meyer. (<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
          </placeName>: University of Nebraska Press, 1965, Pp. vii, 265. Notes, appendix, bibliography,
                    index. $5.00.)</head>
        <p>Meyer has made a careful and extensive study of a particular literary genre which he has designated
                    "the middle western farm novel." Technically, he has confined his survey to the
                    twentieth century, but he has of necessity gone back into the nineteenth century to look at the
                    beginnings. The results are interesting and instructive.</p>
        <pb id="VAA4025-061-4-131" n="403"/>
        <p>He starts by laying down the criteria by which his selections have been made, illustrates the
                    criteria by concrete examples, and then defends them. In succeeding chapters, he evaluates the farm
                    novelist as historian, arbiter of values, social critic, and psychologist. The work is, of course,
                    primarily in the field of literary criticism, but it nevertheless has much of value to the
                    historian, the economist, the sociologist, and even the statesman. This reviewer is not well
                    qualified to judge the book as literary criticism, but at least it makes interesting reading and
                    from this point of view it is heartily recommended to anyone concerned with American fiction.</p>
        <p>The novels dealing with the pioneering period in the western half of the Mississippi Valley are best
                    from a historical view point. They contribute a great deal to the social and economic history of the
                    region in the last half of the nineteenth century. Perhaps they make an even greater contribution
                    for various immigrant groups–<placeName>
            <settlement type="city">German</settlement>

          </placeName>, Scandinavian, Czech, etc.–than for the native American settlers. The novels
                    of Ole Edvart Rolvaag, especially his <hi rend="i">Giants in the Earth,</hi> are outstanding in this
                    respect.</p>
        <p>Possibly the most significant finding that Meyer has made is the fact that the middle western farm
                    novel as a type rose to great prominence on the American literary scene in the early decades of the
                    twentieth century and has declined almost to the point of disappearance in the past two decades.
                    This would appear to indicate that the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName> is undergoing basic economic and social changes as a nation. Agriculture is undoubtedly
                    a declining industry from the standpoint of both the relative and the absolute number of people
                    engaged in it. It is not, however, a declining industry at all from the standpoint of its volume of
                    output. American agriculture is now producing more and better food, fiber, and industrial raw
                    materials than it ever has before. But middle western farm life now differs much less from that of
                    the towns and cities than it previously did. Especially, the pioneering period, which provided the
                    best raw material for the group of novels under consideration, was a "one shot
                    affair." If there should be another flowering of middle western farm novels, the subject
                    matter would of necessity be quite different from that of the group which Meyer has studied.</p>
        <p>The Appendix, 43 pages in length, in which the author presents an annotated bibliography of middle
                    western farm fiction from 1891 to 1962, is one of the most valuable parts of the hook. There is a
                    second bibliography of a more general nature which is also quite good. The author is to be commended
                    for his energy and his scholarship.</p>

                    highways and byways of the region. The result is informative and indicates the pleasure and
                    relaxation available to persons who leisurely and thoughtfully visit southern Indiana. In general,
                    the authors show discernment and an effort to be factual in their commentary. But residents of <placeName>

                    By John Parker. (Lansing: Historical Society of <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, 1965. Pp. 18. Illustration, map, notes. Paperbound.) In the Burton Lecture for 1964,
                    delivered at the ninetieth annual meeting of the Historical Society of <placeName>
            <region reg="miu" type="state">Michigan</region>
          </placeName>, John Parker summarized his findings concerning Jonathan Carver, early British explorer
                    of the Middle West. This printed version of Parker's lecture offers concise information
                    about Carver, discusses his aims and motivation, and reviews his explorations in the Great Lakes
                    area in the 1760's. According to Parker, Carver was particularly interested in finding a
                    river flowing westward from the Great Lakes which would serve as a passageway to the Pacific. In
                    preparing his lecture, Parker made extensive use of Carver's manuscript journals of his
                    travels in 1766 and 1767. These journals have since been published by the Minnesota Hitsorical
                    Society. Both the Burton Lecture and the recently published journals should help significantly in
                    calling attention to Carver's pioneer efforts and achievements.</p>

                    "considered" or "noted." Inasmuch as such sites and structures

                    naturally are located in the original thirteen states, a significant number of them are in the Ohio

          </placeName>, and the Dakotas. He is principally concerned with politics in
                    these states in an era in which they either completed the transition from agrarian and rural
                    supremacy to industrial and urban dominance or at least made a substantial advance thereto. Nye
                    believes that middle western politics has had unique aspects and accents different from those of the
                    politics of any other important area or region of the <placeName>
            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
          </placeName>. Though explicit about the economic and political diversity within the Middle West, Nye
                    concludes that since 1870 the area has in general been quite successful in making solid political
                    change based on common sense, moderation, consensus, stability, and gradualness. But, according to
                    Nye, the Middle West has changed and matured with the result that middle western progressivism has,
                    at least for the time being, ceased to exist (p. 362). Nye's volume, which first appeared
                    in 1959, is based on wide reading, especially of books and periodicals.</p>

                    how Americans have viewed and used land from colonial times to the present. Highlights concerning
                    the origin, distribution, and persistence of the federal public domain are noted, and the continued
                    importance of the federal government in establishing land policy and determining land use is
                    explained. Consideration is given to ways in which industrialization and urbanization have and are
                    affecting attitudes concerning and uses of land. Clawson's modest volume emphasizes that
                    questions concerning land and its uses have increased rather than decreased as a result of the
                    transition from a rural and agrarian to an urban and industrial society.</p>
