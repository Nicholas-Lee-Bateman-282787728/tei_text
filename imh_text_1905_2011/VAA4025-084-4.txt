            In the first half of the nineteenth century, as settlers migrated to Indiana in ever-increasing
                    numbers, no subject was more on the minds of farmers, businessmen, land developers, and politicians
                    than the need for a transportation system to serve the state. Like many citizens of states
                    throughout the Midwest, these Hoosiers deemed a reliable, well-developed network of roads, canals,
                    railroads, and waterways crucial to the area's success.1 Transportation
                    facilities would connect farming communities with trade centers and link growing towns with regional
                    and national markets. With this in mind a forward-looking group of individuals began to consider the
                    advantages for Indiana of a port on Lake 
                        Michigan
                    . These men felt that a major Great Lakes harbor would grow to be the hub of
                    transportation and trade for the entire Midwest, and they wanted these benefits for their home
                    state.
            Early Hoosiers pinned their hopes on the site of what is today 
                        Michigan
                     City, Indiana, which lies at the southernmost tip of Lake 
                        Michigan
                    . But just as the promoters and developers of 
                        Michigan
                     City sought growth, recognition, and profit for their hometown, so did another group of
                    entrepreneurs in 
                        Chicago
                     fix their sights on the profitable Great Lakes trade. A look at the early development
                    of 
                        Michigan
                     City, and the successes and failures of its leaders' efforts, may suggest
                    reasons why this port on Lake 
                        Michigan
                     never achieved major importance, while 
                        Chicago
                    , only a short distance away, fulfilled its boosters' dreams.
            The site of 
                        Michigan
                     City, near both the states of 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Michigan
                    , legally became American soil on September 3, 1783, with

                        Paris
                     ending the American Revolution.2 During the early years of the
                    nineteenth century, conflicting claims to the area arose as the Northwest Territory was being carved
                    into states. In 1805 the land was given to 
                        Michigan
                    , but in April, 1816, apparently influenced by the arguments of Indiana settlers that
                    they needed a coastline on the lake, the federal government formally assigned a ten-mile strip of
                    land to Indiana.3 Committed to the development of commercial interests, Hoosiers
                    from that time on made sure the coastline remained firmly part of their state.4
            
            In the first two decades of the nineteenth century, settlement in the area of Lake 
                        Michigan
                     was sporadic. Although some families found their way there by following major Indian
                    trading trails, they were frequently reluctant to linger because of numerous drawbacks. Portions of
                    northwestern Indiana at the time were described as prairie, meadows, or grassy patches mixed in with
                    forest land; and, since farmers of that day generally subscribed to the belief that land that would
                    not grow trees would not produce good crops, they doubted its desirability. Immigrants were also
                    concerned about the large wet marshy areas, as was evidenced by their tendency to settle on or near
                    the higher ground along the Indian trails.5
            
            The geography of the land on which 
                        Michigan
                     City itself was built probably did not appeal to visitors at first sight. The surveyor
                    in charge of delineating Indiana's northern boundary in 1827 described the area this way:
                        
                        The lake coast is a continuous chain of hills formed of beautiful white sand in most places
                            very high, and little or no vegetation. Back of these sand hills it is generally swampy or
                            marshy. Therefore there are few places where the lake can be approached without difficulty.
                            No harbors or islands are to be seen.6

                     There were a few trees, chiefly pine and sugar maple, about the
                    town site, and upon further exploration settlers perhaps took heart from the fact that a few miles
                    inland the ground appeared to be fertile, particularly suitable to the production of grain and
                    certain food crops.7
            
            Historian Harry N. Scheiber has written of the development of the Midwest in this period:
                    "Probably the most important single requirement for urban growth and commercial development
                    was adequate transportation. Without reliable transport facilities connecting a town with an
                    expanding hinterland and with outside markets, there were oppressive limitations upon
                        growth."8 People interested in commercial development of the land
                    at the southern tip of Lake 
                        Michigan
                     were thus encouraged by the Indiana General Assembly's plans to build a
                    highway linking the area with the rest of the state. In early 1828 surveyors were commissioned by
                    the legislature to look for the best harbor on the Indiana lake shore as a potential terminus for
                    the 
                        Michigan
                     Road. Their report designated the mouth of Trail Creek, which was the largest stream
                    entering the lake from Indiana, as the best site they could find. Their evaluation of the area as a
                    potential location for a town, however, was not optimistic. They believed that the creek could be
                    used for mills, and that the land was dry enough for construction of a town, but they did not rate
                    it a very good quality town site.9 The town of 
                        Michigan
                     City was, nevertheless, laid out at the mouth of Trail Creek in 1832, undoubtedly
                    deriving its name from its proximity to the lake and to its developers' delight at its
                    relationship with the soon-to-be-constructed thoroughfare. Early promoters no doubt shared the
                    opinions of legislators who believed that this link between the Ohio River and
                    Lake 
                        Michigan
                     would become an important transportation facility that could encourage trade, hasten
                    Indian removal, and promote migration to the northern part of the state.10
            
            Although the new highway interested everyone connected with 
                        Michigan
                     City, those most able to take advantage of the proposed development of transportation
                    links were often speculators like Major Isaac C. Elston of 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . Even though Elston at first found the site forbidding, he apparently had confidence in
                    its potential, for in October, 1830, soon after the area had been made available for purchase at the
                    federal land office at 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , he bought several sections, including most of the land surrounding

                     the mouth of Trail Creek. He based his investment on the
                    knowledge that plans for the 
                        Michigan
                     Road were progressing and that some people were already planning to compensate for the
                    area's shortcomings as a townsite by requesting financial assistance from Congress for
                    construction of a harbor at the mouth of the creek.11
            
            Elston is representative of a type of man not uncommon on the developing frontier. He was an
                    interested and active land speculator almost from the time of Indiana's achieving statehood
                    in 1816. One of his first ventures, entered into with two 
                        Crawfordsville
                     associates, was the purchase of the present site of 
                        Lafayette
                    . The men acquired the land for $240 and used their influence to have the
                    site designated as the seat of 
                        Tippecanoe County
                    , thus assuring themselves of an increase in the land's value.12 Elston was also interested in the development of his hometown of 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . He founded the Rock River Mills there, served as president of the 
                        Crawfordsville
                     and 
                        Wabash
                     Railroad, and as a director of the 
                        Louisville
                    , New 
                        Albany
                    , and 
                        Chicago
                     Railroad, the company with which it later merged. In his later years Elston and his
                    son, Isaac, Jr., established the banking house of Elston and Company at 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . Although he concentrated on his business interests and never took an interest in
                    politics himself, he had many friends who did, and they often provided valuable advice. Elston had
                    associates on the early state road commission and may have conferred with Commissioner William Polke
                    before making his 
                        Michigan
                     City purchases.13 Elston also undoubtedly knew that other prominent
                    men such as Calvin Fletcher of 
                        Indianapolis
                     had invested in land in the 
                        Michigan
                     City area, as well.14
            
            Ironically, settlement at the town site was occasionally hindered by the activities of these
                    speculators. Investors sometimes incurred the wrath of squatters who had already settled in choice
                    spots without bothering to establish legal ownership. In the early 1830s a squatters' union
                    was actually formed to combat the efforts of the rich and powerful, but ultimately, as Dr. Joseph W.

            The surviving papers of investors such as Elston document the extent to which early transactions
                    could be controlled by one individual. In 1833 Major and Mrs. Elston vested their power of attorney
                    in Samuel Miller, a former resident of 
                        Chicago
                     who had moved to 
                        Michigan
                     City in 1832 and established himself as miller, merchant, and real estate agent. As
                    Elston's personal representative, he oversaw the sale of lots and encouraged his friends in 
                        Chicago
                     to invest in 
                        Michigan
                     City. Miller's flurry of reports to Elston in the early 1830s indicates how
                    often early settlers seeking prime sites for mills and other businesses had to buy from the 
                        Crawfordsville
                     speculator.16
            
            Despite such hindrances, it was not long after Elston's initial acquisition that a variety
                    of people began to explore and homestead in the area of what is now 
                        Michigan
                     City. Brothers Abraham and James Andrew, natives of 
                        Ohio
                    , were offered land in the northern part of Indiana in payment for their work as
                    engineers on a segment of the 
                        Michigan
                     Road. In October, 1831, at an auction held at 
                        Logansport
                    , they registered claims to two thousand acres of land near 
                        Michigan
                     City and then proceeded with a group of friends to 
                        Indianapolis
                     where they persuaded members of the General Assembly to create a new county to be
                    called LaPorte.17
            
            Although a few settlers straggled in from 
                        Ohio
                     and southern Indiana, most were either natives of the Northeast or born to parents who
                    came from that region. Such were Simon Ritter from Seneca County, 
                        New York
                    , Deacon W. Peck, also from 
                        New York
                    , and William W. Higgins from 
                        Connecticut
                    . Dr. Joseph W. Chamberlin came from 
                        Connecticut
                     in 1834 and earned a living both by treating the sick and running a store.18 As one source describes these Yankee builders of 
                        Michigan
                     City: "19 They were educated, orderly folks, those pioneer
                    founders, and they did not sign their names by mark nor did they cumber the justice dockets with the
                    records of crimes and misdemeanors."19 They often commented on the
                    uncivilized manner of the local "Hoosiers," and took pride in keeping their New 
                        England
                     habits and culture alive.20
            
            Settlement in the area was slowed briefly by the threat of Indian attack in 1832. When word was
                    received that the Sac Indians under their chief, Black Hawk, were preparing to attack white
                    settlements

                        Michigan
                     City, some men sent their wives and children south to safety, while all rushed to
                    participate in the construction of a fort. General Joseph Orr, an early settler of the area, was
                    commissioned by the governor of Indiana to organize a company of mounted rangers. Although Orr did
                    so, Chief Black Hawk was soon captured by other troops and the scare ended before any real threat to 
                        Michigan
                     City and LaPorte County had materialized.21
            
            Early 
                        Michigan
                     City promoters encouraged land purchases by using their talents as accomplished masters
                    of the practice of "boosterism," a technique well described in recent years by
                    historians Carl Abbott, J. Christopher Schnell, and Katherine B. Clinton.22 Such
                    individuals lost no opportunity to brag about the advantages and attractions of their local area,
                    often in vastly exaggerated terms. This type of promotion was practiced by everyone from speculators
                    and businessmen to newspaper editors and even newly arrived settlers writing to loved ones back
                    east. Their most common themes were soil fertility, rapid settlement, rise in land prices, and
                    development of commerce.23 For example, the Indiana Gazetteer
                    of 1833 predicted that "the beauty and richness of the country and fertility of the soil,
                    together with the commercial advantages of the situation will invite a rapid emigration to this part
                    of the state."24 The Gazetteer further noted that "several
                    families have already settled here; improvements are rapidly progressing; and it is believed that
                    the advantages of the situation, the salubrity of the climate, and the fertility of the adjacent
                    lands, must assure its rapid improvement."25
            
            Aided by such glowing remarks, Elston and others sold lots to settlers virtually without ceasing.
                    Elston finally disposed of the remainder of his holdings to a 
                        New York
                     firm in 1836. The transactions were made on a variety of terms. Sales were complicated
                    by the fact that much of Elston's land lay in a section which the federal government had
                    acquired from the Indians in 1830 and for which it had not yet issued valid titles. Elston sold the
                    land anyway

            The growth and development of 
                        Michigan
                     City was well under way by the beginning of 1834. In that year, Martin M. Post, a
                    missionary from 
                        Logansport
                    , reported that the town's location and a recent appropriation from the federal
                    government for the improvement of the harbor supported expectations that the port would quickly
                    become a depot and merchandising center for the entire region.27 Roads were
                    being constructed into surrounding agricultural areas, he said, making it possible for people from
                    as far south as 
                        Lafayette
                     and 
                        Logansport
                     to use the town as a market for items as diverse as potatoes, fruits and vegetables,
                    maple sugar, and wheat, the most prevalent and readily marketable crop in the area.28
            
            The year 1834 also saw the establishment of a variety of businesses in the port town. Samuel Miller
                    reported to Elston the arrival of a merchant from 
                  Richmond, Virginia
               , who
                    planned to set up a general store with $2,000 in goods. A similar store was begun by
                    David Sprague and William Teall. About half a mile from 
                        Michigan
                     City a grist mill produced flour of such good quality that people came from as far as 
                        Chicago
                    , Joliet, and Galena, 
                        Illinois
                    , to do business there. General Joseph Orr constructed a tannery that furnished leather
                    for the settlers' shoes, and other entrepreneurs built warehouses near the waterfront to
                    serve the grain business. Travelers who passed through the area shortly after year's end
                    reported seeing twenty or thirty houses and a total of twelve stores.29
            
            Business in 
                        Michigan
                     City improved still further the following year. One resident, James M. Scott, wrote to
                    Elston that there was a good deal of land speculation and encouraged him to continue to market lots
                    to keep the town growing.30 In July, 1835, Joseph Chamberlin reported to a
                    relative that people were pouring into town so rapidly that food supplies were dwindling, and prices
                    for remaining foodstuffs were very high. Various types of businesses appeared in increasing numbers.
                    Surveyors for the Buffalo and 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad published a report in the fall of 1835 proposing that their line be built
                    through 
                        Michigan
                     City, a possibility which further increased speculation and confidence in the future of

                    his relatives in the East to invest in land in the area: 
                        If you get any money to spare, you had better send it here and let me lay it out in land
                            before the best selections are taken. This whole country will soon be settled with rich
                            farming. The most respectable rich and enterprising families are constantly flocking on to
                            our prairies and making â€¦ homes.31
                  
                    
            
            Social institutions had also developed by the end of 1835. Elston donated land to be used for a
                    church, a schoolhouse, a public square market, and a burial ground.32 Two men
                    who had migrated from the East, W. W. Smith of 
                  Syracuse, New York
               , and a Mr.
                    Castle of Utica, 
                        New York
                    , set up a printing office in 
                        Michigan
                     City and began to publish the 
                        Michigan
                     City Gazette and General Advertiser. Along with newspapers being
                    published in 
                        South Bend
                    , the Gazette and General Advertiser kept people in the area informed
                    of the latest developments.33 This paper soon reported that the town had at
                    least three religious organizations: a Congregational church with a permanent pastor, a Methodist
                    society, and the beginnings of a Baptist congregation.34 The Gazette and General Advertiser was not merely a source of the latest national news. It
                    also promoted high spirits and optimism about 
                        Michigan
                     City's future by keeping residents abreast of efforts to persuade Congress to
                    appropriate funds for improvement of the harbor and by writing a memorial encouraging the state
                    legislature to locate a branch of the state bank at 
                        Michigan
                     City.35
            
            The town of 
                        Michigan
                     City was incorporated by the Indiana General Assembly on February 8, 1836. The charter
                    for the city was unusually elaborate for those times: fifty-seven sections detailed how the
                    town's government was to function. The geographic area of the town as described by the
                    charter included almost fifteen square miles, making it one of the largest towns in the country at
                    that date.36
            
            By 1836 
                        Michigan
                     City had become the most important grain market north of the 
                        Wabash
                    . Schooners came into the port, even though it lacked a proper harbor, to take on grain
                    for distant markets and to bring supplies on the return trip. More stores were

                     being opened, and piers and warehouses were built to
                    accommodate the growing trade. Estimates of the population at this time range from 1,500 to 3,000,
                    and the establishment of a federal land office at LaPorte facilitated the purchase of land by
                    migrants pouring into the area daily.37 The most graphic and colorful account of 
                        Michigan
                     City's state of health at the time was penned by British writer Harriet
                    Martineau as she traveled through the area in 1836: 
                        Such a city as this was surely never before seen. It is cut out of the forest, and curiously
                            interspersed with little swamps, which we no doubt saw in their worst condition after the
                            heavy rains. New, good houses, some only half finished, stood in the midst of the thick
                            wood. A large area was half cleared. The finished stores were scattered about; and the
                            streets were littered with stumps. The situation is beautiful. The undulations of the
                            ground, within and about it, and its being closed in by lake or forest on every side, render
                            it unique. An appropriation has been made by Government for a harbor: and two piers are to
                            be built out beyond the sand, as far as the clay soil of the lake.... The whole scene stands
                            insulated in my memory, as absolutely singular; and, at this distance of time, scarcely
                                credible.38
                  
                    
            
            Citizens of the growing town shared Martineau's sentiments. William W. Higgins, a young
                    settler from 
                        Connecticut
                    , wrote his parents that the principle topic of conversation in 
                        Michigan
                     City was land speculation: 
                        I thought when I was in Con. that this land speculation was visionary in the extreme, but I
                            am satisfied that such is not the case, and that those that invests [sic] in land early in
                            the spring will double and treble in the course of six months. To be satisfied one must come
                            and see and examine this country for themselves and then they must admit that money must be
                            made if they possess common discernment.39
                  
                     Land continued to sell rapidly under these conditions. In January, 1837, the 
                        Michigan
                     City Gazette reported that 392,362 acres of land had been sold in
                    1836 at the federal land office at LaPorte, for a total sum of $491,026.58.10 Elston is
                    reported to have realized $250,000 in the same year from the sale of his remaining
                    property in the area.41
            
            During the first several years of settlement at the 
                        Michigan
                     City site, no subject was of more importance to investors, businessmen, and settlers
                    than the construction of a suitable harbor to enable the town to take advantage of its proximity to
                    the lake. The

                water along the coastline was too shallow to allow ships to come in to unload, and their
                    cargoes had to be transferred to shore in small, light vessels. The mouth of Trail Creek was
                    navigable, but sand bars frequently blocked the entrance.42 Calvin Fletcher of 
                        Indianapolis
                     recorded in his diary in 1835 that on a visit to 
                        Michigan
                     City he had observed the unloading of a sloop. The task required the work of fifty
                    people. The vessel could not come within three hundred yards of shore, he said, because of the
                        sand.43 As a makeshift solution to the problem, piers were constructed out
                    into deep water and small cars ran back and forth on them, carrying goods from the ships to the
                        warehouses.44 No one doubted, however, that the ultimate recourse must be
                    the construction of a real, serviceable harbor, and much time and effort were devoted to this end.
            As early as 1832 and 1833, Elston prevailed upon John

                     power to have government surveyors sent into the area
                    preparatory to his memorializing Congress for funds for harbor construction.45
                    Elston soon began to receive letters and petitions from the inhabitants of the new town requesting
                    that he use his influence with members of Congress in order to secure an appropriation for the
                        harbor.46 He did lobby strongly for such a grant and attempted to enlist the
                    aid of the Indiana General Assembly as well.
            Citizens in the 
                        Michigan
                     City area had apparently always believed the 
                        United States
                     Congress to be the most likely source of funding for harbor improvement. Memorial
                    resolutions from the state legislature, as well as letters from individual citizens, plied Congress
                    with requests for action. The national body granted $5,000 for a lighthouse in 1834, but
                    the following year saw no further progress. Senator John 
                        Tipton
                     detailed his actions in behalf of funding for the harbor in his report to constituents
                    that year and explained that a recently prepared engineers' report had arrived too late to
                    be of any use.47
            
            The 1835-1836 session of Congress proved more fruitful for 
                        Michigan
                     City boosters. The engineers' report which Secretary of War Lewis Cass had
                    forwarded to Congress at the end of the previous session stated that Trail Creek was the only
                    suitable site for a harbor on that portion of Lake 
                        Michigan
                    . Continuous reports of wrecks and accidents due to the absence of a suitable harbor
                    made construction of a protective breakwater at the site imperative. A resolution from the General
                    Assembly and a petition from ship captains further testified to the need for a harbor and convinced
                    Congress to appropriate $20,000 in 1836. 
                        Tipton
                    's communication to constituents that year assured them that he had done
                    everything in his power to secure approval for this funding, even though the sum was somewhat less
                    than he had hoped.48
            
            Using these first grants,

                     City officials began work on the project immediately. Workers dredged a channel and
                    built piers out into the lake to the point where the water reached a depth of eighteen feet. The

                        we have the pleasure of informing the public that the improvements of the harbor at this
                            place are progressing as fast as possible, under the charge of W. B. Burnett, esq., who is
                            the engineer for the construction of the work. The present appropriation will, we have no
                            doubt, be expended in the most judicious manner towards the completion of the work, by the
                            month of April next, when we may reasonable expect more to continue the work so judiciously
                                commenced.49
                  
                    
            
            State officials, while sharing this optimism, still did not see the 
                        Michigan
                     City port as a project to be funded locally. A bill passed by the General Assembly in
                    January, 1836, provided $13,000,000 for internal improvements, but none of it was for the
                    proposed harbor. Governor Noah Noble, in a message to the legislature in December, 1836, urged the
                    legislature to memorialize Congress for continued funding. Whether the work was seen primarily as
                    the responsibility of the federal government, or whether, as historian Roger 
                        Van
                     Bolt has suggested, Indiana politics at the time was dominated by legislators from the
                    southern half of the state who kept their own constituents' interests uppermost, this view
                    that Congress, not the state legislature, should pay for the work at 
                        Michigan
                     City continued to dominate Hoosier views on the subject for decades to come.50
            
            As time passed, high hopes began to give way. A large portion of the initial appropriation was used
                    for the purchase of horses and supplies, and to realize the full value of this equipment, further
                    funds were needed. In 1837 Congress appropriated $30,000 more, but this amount was
                    considered wholly inadequate. Requests from federal topographical engineers, as well as another
                    memorial, were sent to 
                        Washington
                     in 1838 to inspire further assistance.51 These efforts resulted in
                    funding of $60,733.59 in 1839, but after that no additional monies were forthcoming for
                    several years. During this period accumulated supplies decayed or were sold, and the initial funds
                    and efforts expended upon the harbor were thus to a large degree wasted.52
            
            During the 1840s and 1850s, Congress, distracted by the Mexican War and the deepening sectional
                    crisis, was not as willing as it had previously been to fund internal improvements. During the John
                    Tyler administration the Indiana General Assembly sent to Congress a resolution which repeated the
                    need for an improved harbor for shipping, and army engineers' reports expressed concerns

                about the lack of available shelter for ships during storms. The plea for further funds,
                    however, went largely unanswered. Hopes rose in 
                        Michigan
                     City in 1846 during debates in Congress on an internal improvements package that
                    promised to support further work on the harbor. Congressman John Pettit of Tippe-canoe spoke in
                    favor of the bill, and Indiana congressmen in general supported it. Unfortunately, the bill was
                    ultimately vetoed by President James K. Polk, who opposed such funding. Many citizens of 
                        Michigan
                     City criticized their own representative in Congress, Charles W. Cathcart, suggesting
                    that he had not advocated the legislation because of his loyalty to the Polk administration. One
                    historian has theorized that the bill actually failed of support among some northerners because of
                    their fears of alienating southerners who opposed it.53

                    One traveler in the area in 1842 described the 
                        Illinois
                     town as 
                        the flourishing city of 
                                Chicago
                             [which ten years earlier had not seen a steamboat] whose harbor is crowded with
                            steamers, ships, and schooners full freighted up with emigrants and merchandize, and down
                            with wheat and other products of the rich soil of the vast land of unsurpassed fertility,
                            lying around the head of Lake

                     It was undoubtedly becoming clear to many observers that 
                        Chicago
                     was destined to outstrip her midwestern rivals.
            
               
                        Michigan
                     City residents were distressed by the lack of congressional support and frequently made
                    reference to the failure to improve the harbor, alluding to what it might have been.55 John Pettit's description to the 
                        United States
                     Senate in 1854 gave graphic evidence of the problems that existed: 
                        Last fall, shortly before I came on to this city, I visited the harbor at 
                                Michigan
                             City for the purpose of looking at it; and there, standing upon the pier, as
                            far as the eye can reach, you can see wrecks on either beach.... A small amount of money
                            â€¦ would have saved all that wreck and ruin, would have prevented the loss of
                            thousands of lives, and perhaps millions of property56
                  
                    
            
            During the 1860s the citizens of 
                        Michigan
                     City, disgusted with Congress's failure to act and discouraged by increased
                    competition from harbors at New Buffalo, 
                        Chicago
                    , and other sites, determined to complete the project themselves. Organizing as the 
                        Michigan
                     City Harbor Company, they began in 1866 and 1867 to collect voluntary donations from
                    private citizens. Congress, aroused by this effort and by encouraging reports from engineers, began
                    once more to appropriate funds as well, and finally the harbor was completed.57
                    By 1870 more than $330,000 had been spent on improvements, but the citizens of 
                        Michigan
                     City were not yet satisfied. They continued to pressure Congress until the end of the
                    century for funding to upgrade the outer harbor, and a considerable sum was eventually expended for
                    this purpose. After 1900 federal appropriations for 
                        Michigan
                     City largely ceased. Available funding was diverted to 
                        Chicago
                    , which had become a major port and which by that time received the lion's
                    share of midwestern shipping, including much of what had previously passed through 
                        Michigan
                     City.58

            Although improvement of the harbor was seen as crucial to the town's development,
                    construction of roads to and through the area was also important for the growth of the early
                    settlement. While no records exist to show where the original roads were located, tradition has it
                    that the first pioneers followed Potawatomi trails, and spurs from these are marked on early plat
                        maps.59 Sale of land and work on the 
                        Michigan
                     Road began in 1832. This thoroughfare ran eventually from

                     City to 
                        South Bend

                    .60 As work progressed, citizens of LaPorte County petitioned for
                    and received money for construction of roads connecting this major artery with other parts of their
                    own county.61
            
            As had been hoped, these roads began to draw trade into 
                        Michigan
                     City from settlements to the south, and even from 
                        Illinois
                    .62 In 1833 a stage line was established between 
                        Detroit
                     and 
                        Chicago
                     that took advantage of the new transportation routes through LaPorte County. Between
                    1834 and 1836 improvements continued. The combined efforts of Congress and the General Assembly
                    provided for construction of a toll bridge across the Kankakee River and for the improvement and
                    completion of the lake shore roads. In 1836 a new road from 
                        Chicago
                     to 
                        Michigan
                     City also was opened.63
            
            During the first decade of 
                        Michigan
                     City's existence, plans for canals and railroads to link it with the rest of
                    the state materialized. Proposals for canals included one that would connect Lake 
                        Michigan
                     with the Ohio River; one that would connect Lake 
                        Michigan
                     with the 
                        Wabash
                     and Erie Canal; and one that would connect the port with Lake Erie.64 The first group organized for the purpose of constructing a railroad through the area
                    incorporated the 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Michigan
                     Railroad in 1832. Other railroad lines chartered during this period, with plans either
                    to pass through or terminate at 
                        Michigan
                     City, were the Indiana Northwest Railroad (1834); 
                        Michigan
                     City and Kankakee Railroad (1836); 
                        Indianapolis
                     and 
                        Michigan
                     City Railroad (1837); and the 
                        Michigan
                     City and 
                        St. Joseph

                        Michigan
                     City to the county seat at LaPorte and to fund the potentially important Buffalo and 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad to be centered at LaPorte.66
            
            Because of the high hopes that these plans engendered and the frustrations over problems with the
                    harbor, citizens felt particularly strongly the effects of the panic of 1837 and the depression that
                    followed. The state of Indiana found itself in dire financial straits, and many private companies
                    planning or engaged in construction of roads, canals, and railroads went bankrupt. The cessation of
                    federal appropriations for internal improvements at this time further doomed many of the proposed
                    plans for making 
                        Michigan
                     City the hub of a major transportation network.67
            
            The depression had severe effects as well on business and life in general at 
                        Michigan
                     City. A number of merchants were forced to close their establishments, and the 
                        Michigan
                     City Gazette halted publication in 1839.68 L. A.
                    Viele, who had set up a store in the town sometime before, wrote to his brother in December, 1837:
                        
                        Business has been quite dull in this place this fall, and money becoming very scarce, was it
                            not for the money from the Banks in 
                                Michigan
                            , should have little or none in circulation here. Have sold since we have been
                            here up to the first of the present month about $15,000 of goods. Have crd
                            [credited] some considerable and find it difficult to collect anything on outstanding
                            debts.... I begin to think there is better locations for business somewhere on the 
                                Mississippi
                             than this place, and from what I can hear about the business and looking at the
                            location, it seems to me that 
                                St. Louis
                             offers more opportunities and better prospects than any other place in all the
                            western world .... this place is not what we anticipated for businessâ€”and besides
                            that, not a pleasant place to live in.69
                  
                     Other results of the slump at 
                        Michigan
                     City included a falling off in shipments and in prices for goods. Many
                    farmers' crops were diverted to other markets by the turnpikes and plank roads which had
                    been built to connect the central portion of the state with marketplaces other than 
                        Michigan
                     City.70 The population of 
                        Michigan
                     City appears to have declined substantially between 1836 and 1840. One historian claims
                    that the number of people living there fell from 3000 to under 1000 during the period.71
            
            Some writers have argued that the depression was a blessing in disguise for 
                        Michigan
                     City because it rid the area of speculators who had hoped to get rich in a hurry,
                    leaving the more sober, solid

                     citizens to build a respectable town and a stable economy. A
                    branch of the state bank was established at 
                        Michigan
                     City in 1838, arousing hopes that the town would become a financial center for the
                    surrounding area.72 The bank's existence also promised relief from an
                    uncertain currency, of which businessman J. W. Sprague had complained vociferously to his father in
                    a letter dated April 14, 1838.73 In spite of the problems of the period, a
                    cautious element of "boosterism" remained. A young settler wrote in January, 1838:
                    "Mechanics are wanted very much, and wages are high, and cash paid for almost everything
                    you have to sell. A single man with prudence and 200 or 300 could get rich fairly
                        easily."74
            
            As time passed, signs of recovery became more numerous in spite of worries about the incomplete
                    harbor. In the 1840s 
                        Michigan
                     City became prosperous once again, changing its businesses to produce such items as
                    barrels, boots, and shoes, and developing pork packing facilities. New immigrants arrived, among
                    them a large number of Germans who proved to be very industrious. The General Assembly's
                    memorial to Congress in 1842 estimated that business in imports and exports at 
                        Michigan
                     City amounted to more than $600,000 per year.75 By the
                    end of 1847 telegraph lines had reached the town,76 and there was feverish
                    discussion about the possibility of 
                        Michigan
                     City's being a main stop on several railroads, including the 
                        Michigan
                     Central. In 1849 the 
                        Michigan
                     Central Railroad was authorized to build a line from New Buffalo to 
                        Michigan
                     City. The track was actually laid under the auspices of the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad and reached 
                        Michigan
                     City in 1850. In 1854 the completion of the New 
                        Albany
                     and

                        Michigan
                     City by rail with the Ohio River. The town had dispatched a
                    committee to the state capital to emphasize the city's advantages, since tentative plans
                    were being made for three railroads, originating in 
                  Detroit, Toledo
               , and 
                        Indianapolis

                    market port for the area. Geographer Alfred H. Meyer enumerates the competitors:

                                Michigan
                             City, at the mouth of Trail Creek; City West, at the mouth of Fort Creek
                            (modern Waverly beach of the Indiana Dunes State Park); Indiana City, at the eastern mouth
                            of the Grand Calumet River (now closed by dune sand); and Calumet, at the western mouth of
                            the same river (proximity of present-day South 
                                Chicago
                            )78
                  
                     But of all the competitors, the one against which 
                        Michigan
                     City strove hardest, and by which it was ultimately outrun, was 
                        Chicago
                    .
            Between 1816 and the early 1830s 
                        Chicago
                     functioned mainly as a center for fur-trading. The town was run largely by
                    representatives of the American Fur Company, with many of the residents working for the outfit in
                    various capacities. In 1831 the town was still very small, with a population of about one hundred
                    fifty outside the fort. Shortly after this time, however, the area began to develop. Talk of
                    improvements such as the construction of a canal brought land speculators and led to the
                    incorporation of the town of 
                        Chicago
                     in August, 1833. When Harriet Martineau visited there in 1836, she found the town
                    uninviting but alive with activity: 
                        
                     
                                Chicago
                             looks raw and bare, standing on the high prairie above the lake-shore. The
                            houses appeared all insignificant, and run up in various directions, without any principle
                            at all. A friend of mine who resides there had told me that we should find the inns
                            intolerable, at the period of the great land sales, which brings a concourse of speculators
                            to the place. It was even so. The very sight of them was intolerable; and there was not room
                            for our party among them all.79
                  
                     According to historian John Denis Haeger, the difference in the town's prospects
                    was made by those speculators whom Martineau disliked so intensely. By funding the establishment of
                    the town lots they sold, by buying up outlying property and selling it to farmers at reasonable
                    prices, and by providing funding and political support for construction of the 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Michigan
                     Canal, these developers provided the ingredients necessary for rapid urban growth.80 The late 1830s saw an economic slump similar to that which affected 
                        Michigan
                     City. The panic abated within a few years, and 
                        Chicago
                     began a period of sustained growth. The value of exports surpassed $2
                    million annually as farm production increased.

                    81 Warehouses were constructed to accommodate the crops of wheat and other
                    grains, and grocery stores, hardware stores, and other businesses sprang up quickly to provide
                    supplies for farmers. By the early 1850s the 
                        Illinois

                        Michigan
                     Canal was in operation, and completion of several rail lines terminating in 
                        Chicago
                     contributed to the development of a major commercial hub. Links with towns in the
                    interior of 
                        Illinois
                     gave it a wholesale trade of as much as $40 million by 1859.82
            
            All these developments were undoubtedly aided by the support of the city's boosters. Carl
                    Abbott remarks, "
                        Chicago
                     was notorious throughout the Northwest as a loudmouthed cityâ€¦ . writers
                    pointed out that 
                        Chicago
                    's growth was a function of its eagerness to publicize its 'advantages
                    of locality, its railroads, its shipping and trade, and its manufactures.' "83 Businessmen, newspaper editors, and other residents emphasized the
                    city's fortunate geographic position, an advantage that would undoubtedly make it the
                    transportation and shipping hub of the Midwest.84
            
            
               
                        Michigan
                     City residents claimed that 
                        Chicago
                    's promoters influenced outside perception of the rivalry and thus their
                    chances for success. Members of Congress, they said, were less willing to appropriate funds for 
                        Michigan
                     City's harbor than they might have been as a result of reports by early
                    travelers that the construction of a proper harbor in the area would be almost impossible.
                    Disgruntled citizens also complained that a fair picture of the relative commercial importance of
                    the two ports could not be drawn because in the 1830s and 1840s exports of northern Indiana towns
                    were customarily reported as exports of 
                        Chicago
                    .85
            
            Whatever the determining factors, by 1860 
                        Michigan
                     City had grown to be a town of only about three thousand inhabitants and business
                    opportunities continued to be limited. The harbor had not been completed, and transportation links
                    with other parts of the region were provided mainly by a few railroads. Once finished, the 
                        Michigan
                     Road, though complete, provided only limited connection with areas to the south.
            As scholars Edward K. Muller and Spiro G. Patton have concluded, access to major regional and
                    national supply networks proved to be decisive factors in the relative success of different urban
                    areas. 86 Early migration to

                        Chicago
                    , on the other hand, was able to forge ahead by taking advantage both of its superior
                    harbor and of the completion of various transportation facilities, which fostered expansion of
                    commercial activities, pork packing, and wholesale marketing. Aided by the closing of the
                        Mississippi River during the Civil War,

            As the century wore on, it also became apparent that much of Indiana's trade was not
                    concentrated in the direction of the lake. Central Indiana, as a result of the

                    southward rather than to the north.89

                    continue to prosper and grow, but its vision would be limited. The completion of a modest harbor
                    would allow it to serve as Indiana's major port on the lake, and a vital shipping site for
                    the northern part of the state, but it would, of necessity, accept

            Booth Tarkington and the League of Nations: Advice for Senator Harry S. New
            Edited by Howard F. McMainsâˆ—
            
            Writing from Maine to his friend Harry S. New in 1920, Booth Tarkington claimed,
                    "I'm a farmer now." But the Indiana author was a summer resident of
                    fashionable Kennebunkport, not an Aroostook valley potato grower, and was famous for his novels set
                    in the Midwest. He was also a moderate Republican who supported the League of Nations. When the 1920
                    presidential campaign opened between Republican candidate Warren G. Harding and Democrat James M.
                    Cox, Tarkington believed Harding had to speak in favor of the League to defeat Cox. Senator New was
                    Tarkington's old friend and director of the Republican campaign speakers' bureau,
                    and in his folksy letter from Maine, the Hoosier novelist expressed the viewpoint of Republicans who
                    favored the League of Nations.1
            
            Tarkington and New both came from politically active Indianapolis families. Tarkington's
                    father was an Indianapolis attorney and circuit judge, his uncle a California governor and United
                    States senator. After graduating from Princeton in 1893, Tarkington decided to become a writer
                    instead of reading law. While on vacation at Bar Harbor that summer, he began both his first novel,
                        The Gentleman from Indiana, and his lifeâ€“long attachment to Maine.
                    The book appeared in 1899 and established Tarkington's career, which reached its peak in
                    the years around 1920. The Indiana author wrote the first of his highly successful
                    "Penrod" stories in 1913, and in 1918 he published his most enduring novel, The Magnificant Ambersons, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. Three years later he
                    published Alice Adams, a lesser novel than his saga of the Ambersons but also a
                    Pulitzer winner. He frequently vacationed at

                Kennebunkport; and as his literary success increased, he built Seawood, his summer home.
                    The property gave him claim to being "a farmer now." The
                    greenâ€“shuttered colonial frame house had terraces, groves of trees, and views of the
                    Kennebunkport River. Tarkington preferred Seawood to his Indianapolis mansion.
            A minor character in The Gentleman from Indiana was Brainard Macauley, a
                    newspaperman whom hero John Harkless met while at a country club dance of the sort that Tarkington
                    often attended in Indianapolis during the midâ€“1890s.2 The novel
                    describes Macauley as "an American of affairs; slight, easy, yet alert; relaxed, yet sharp;
                    neat, regular, strong â€¦ and one knew at once that he would make a rattling fight to
                    arrive where he was going."3 Tarkington based the character of Harkless
                    on his closest friend at Princeton, John Cleve Green, who died at Philadelphia in 1897.4 And he probably based that of Brainard Macauley on an Indianapolis
                    newspaperman of the 1890s, Harry S. New.
            New grew up in Tarkington's northside neighborhood, scene of Penrod's adventures
                    and noted in the Gilded Age for attractive

                    streets lined by mapleâ€“shaded houses and picket
                        fences.5 The two were longâ€“time friends, although New was
                    somewhat older. Throughout his life, Tarkington often signed letters to New with his childhood
                    nickname, "Boots." When Tarkington sent New an inscribed copy of Alice Adams, which conjures up that neighborhood of maples and picket fences, New thanked
                    him for the "reminder of old times and a dearly cherished friendship."6 New's father was John C. New, a leading Indiana Republican, publisher
                    of the Indianapolis Journal and 1888 campaign architect for Benjamin Harrison.
                    Harry New worked as a Journal reporter and by the late 1890s was its editor.
                    Having lived in London when Harrison appointed his father consul, Harry New was the very model of
                    the American of affairs whom Tarkington described in the fictional Brainard Macauley.
            Although New was involved in Republican politics, serving as state and national chairman, he did not
                    run for major office until 1916, when he entered Indiana's first primary under the
                    Seventeenth Amendment and sought election to the United States Senate. During the campaign,
                    Tarkington wrote "An Appreciation" of New for an Indianapolis newspaper. Echoing
                    his description of Brainard Macauley, Tarkington wrote that New was from "the old Hoosier
                    stock that stood for cool levelâ€“headedness, for common sense, for steadiness and for
                    kindness â€¦ and when he acts, something happens!"7 The
                    candidate of course admired the article, which he read on board a Monon train entering Indianapolis:
                    "I wish I might tell you how much I appreciate itâ€”and
                    you,â€”but I can't, words won't do it," he wrote.8 New won both the primary and the election.
            In the Senate, New was an undistinguished member of the Republican Old Guard. According to
                    California's progressive Republican Senator Hiram Johnson, "New of Indiana, is the
                    type of Indiana politician, pleasant and affable, whose mind is ever dealing with combinations, and
                    trades, and negotiations, and manipulations."9 During New's
                    six year term, the largest question before the Senate was ratification of the Treaty of Versailles,
                    which included President Woodrow Wilson's idea for the League of Nations. New was strongly
                    opposed to the League, but he was not one of the "irreconcilables" against it root
                    and branch, as were Johnson and Idaho's William E. Borah. The sixteen
                    "irreconcilables" composed

                     approximately 17 percent of the Senate.10
                    New was a "strong reservationist" opposed especially to Article X's
                    mutual agreement to "respect and preserve" territory because it implied future use
                    of American troops under League control.11 Isolationist Hoosiers thought his
                    opposition to the League was his "greatest service," long to be remembered
                    "as equal to the service performed by the [Republic's] early
                        founders."12 Hiram Johnson, on the other hand, considered the
                    affable New to be one of the "darkâ€“age politicians."13
            
            Harry New's Senate friend was Ohio's Warren Harding, another "strong
                    reservationist." Both New and Harding occasionally "engaged in the royal indoor
                    sport" by playing poker with Johnson and other Republicans.14 But the
                    two midwesterners followed Senate majority leader Henry Cabot Lodge's strategy of demanding
                    revisions to defeat the Treaty rather than Johnson's preference for outright rejection.
                    Lodge correctly believed that Wilson would not compromise on the League. After the Senate defeated
                    the Treaty, New and Harding continued to be close friends. Harding sat in New's Delaware
                    Street living room at Indianapolis when he heard of his poor showing in the 1920 Indiana primary and
                    nearly dropped out of the race for the presidential nomination.15 After Harding
                    won the nominationâ€”defeating Hiram Johnson, among othersâ€”the Republican
                    national chairman, New's fellow Hoosier Will H. Hays, asked the Indiana senator to direct
                    the campaign's speakers' bureau, a major responsibility.16 In
                    1922, thenâ€“President Warren Harding appointed New to be postmaster general, replacing
                    Will Hays in the traditional Cabinet chair reserved for a politico "whose mind is ever
                    dealing with â€¦ manipulations." Republican insider Harry New held the post
                    through the Coolidge administration.17

            Tarkington wrote from Kennebunkport on August 16, 1920, to Senator Harry New, campaign insider and
                    personal friend of the candidate, at the speakers' bureau in Chicago. He discussed the one
                    campaign issue about which the two Hoosiers differed, the League of Nations. Tarkington went to the
                    heart of the political issue in 1920, which was world peace. Two former Ohio newspaper editors,
                    Senator Warren G. Harding and Governor James M. Cox, competed for the presidency in a strange
                    contest that centered on President Woodrow Wilson's opinions rather than those of the
                    candidates. The president had staked his career on acceptance of the League, but by 1920 Americans
                    were tired of campaigns for morality and tired of international affairs; they wanted nothing so much
                    as to keep to themselves. Possible campaign issues included inflation, civil liberties, civil
                    rights, and wartime mismanagement of economic mobilization. The candidates in 1920 ignored them.
                    Republicans had controlled Congress since 1918 and could not blame economic dislocation on Wilson.
                    Recent constitutional amendments had settled the issues of prohibition (for the time being) and of
                    women's suffrage. That left only the issue of peace, which both Wilson and Cox equated with
                    the League.18 Harding, however, had opposed the League while in the Senate and
                    at the campaign's beginning was ambivalent, leading proâ€“League Republicans to
                    believe that he might embrace the idea. He spoke of an "association" of nations,
                    encouraging both the League's supporters and opponents with his deliberate obfuscation. His
                    campaign frustrated such moderate Republican supporters of the League as Tarkington, who believed
                    that the world organization could prevent future wars.19
            
            Despite portents of Republican victory, Tarkington feared in August that Cox might win the 1920
                    election on the peace issue. Other Republicans also wanted Harding to adopt a position favorable to
                    the League. Elihu Root led a large group that attempted to persuade the candidate to modify his
                        views.20 To the same purpose, Tarkington informally used his friendship with
                    campaign insider Senator New. Antiwar sentiment was strong enough, Tarkington thought, to determine
                    the election. He predicted that the women's voteâ€”a new and unknown factor in
                    electionsâ€”would go to Cox because women supported the League "by nature." A month later, in September, Republicans swept Maine's early
                    state election, and Harding anticipated how the nation would go. Two days after the November general
                    election, the presidentâ€“elect openly sided with rootâ€“andâ€“branch
                    opponents of the League and said that it was "now deceased."21

            Tarkington wrote the following private letter to New early in the campaign, when it appeared that
                    Harding could be swayed in the League's favor. Although Tarkington adopted the guise of
                    "a farmer" from Maine to discuss concerns he heard "from the
                    soil," he represented moderate Republicans who sought to affect both the
                    candidate's position and the League's fate.

                        Dear Senator:â€”
                        I do hate to see the approach of another eight years of Democratic Administration,
                                    but the weather begins to look that way.
                        Let me tell you how "the masses" feel: I'm a farmer now,
                                    as well as a sensitized plate, and I'm fairly aware of the average inside.
                        For several years high prices have annoyed us a whole lot: we've been
                                    getting more money (which made us restless and sore at the fellers that we hear get
                                    more than we do) but that doesn't make us one bit less
                                    sore about the price of a shave, eggs and coalâ€”and R. R. tickets!
                        Also, Uncle George's wife's nephew got a rotten deal from the draft
                                    board.
                        Moreover, we're mad as hell about our taxes going up. And the Treasury
                                    Dep't asked us the stinkindest questions about our own
                                    potatoesâ€”how much we sold 'em ferâ€”and how much we
                                    paid Ole, the loafing Swede hand. Ole's mad, too, because they probed
                                    around in his private affairs.
                        All this we are going to blame somebody for, dad burn it! and we
                                    blame Woodrow Wilson. He was in charge of things, if anybody was, wasn't he? Well, anyhow we blame him.
                        That's all the Republican Party has got, Senator: the election is going to
                                    be won by the unattached vote, the unâ€“Party vote, and Blaming Wilson, in
                                    ordinary, ornery human nature, is all you can count on to bring that vote to
                                    Harding. 
                                        All.
                                     Except antiâ€“Leaguism.
                        What do the Democrats offer the unâ€“Party vote: They offer Cox and a
                                    League. About Cox. He has "caught the popular imagination" much
                                    more than Harding has. Yes, he has, too! Newspapers rather like to talk about Cox.
                                    More than they do about Harding.
                        So do people. Very significant.
                        Men sore at Wilson say, "Well, Cox isn't Wilson. He gave Ohio a
                                    good administration, and I hear he's a corking fine business man. A couple
                                    of months ago I'd have laughed at anyone who told me I'd vote for
                                    another Democratic administration, but I've made up my mind this man Cox is
                                    a new deal." About the League. An amended,

                                            The author and staff of the Indiana Magazine of History
                                            have made every effort to present the letter as it appears in manuscript
                                            form. The original paragraph structure has been retained;
                                            Tarkington's address is typeset as it appears on his stationery;
                                            and words and phrases that Tarkington underlined for emphasis are italicized
                                            here. Occasional words or phrases that are underlined twice in the original
                                            are both italicized and underlined.

                                     interpreted or somethinged League is what the
                                    "general mass" wants. The mass has a vague idea
                                    that a League will help to stop wars. The mass thinks Wilson's league probably wasn't just
                                    right, but was somewhere near it; and thinks that if this scheme for a League is dropped there never will be any League.
                        The mass now thinks that Harding doesn't want any League.
                        What voters do not want a League and are consequently won by
                                    Harding's position? Certain Republicans and a very few Independents and
                                    Democrats who would vote for Harding anyhow, had he "come out" for
                                    the League in its modified form as passed by the Senate.
                        The mass is for a League and Cox gives it the only chance to vote for one, the mass
                                    thinks.
                        Women will vote for Cox because all women are (by 
                                        nature
                                    ) for a League. There are some women who are against a
                                    League. They are women whose husbands have talked 'em into being against
                                    it. All other women will vote for Cox, if the impression is
                                    allowed to remain that the League dies if Harding is elected.
                        The one Republican asset, Blaming Wilson, is weakened because a Republican Congress
                                    didn't lower the price of shingles and pork chopsâ€”which went up, instead.
                        So there we are; the impression that Harding is against any form of
                                        
                              this League, or maybe against any such
                                    thing, holds [Hiram] Johnson and [William E.] Borah and their 17 per cent [i.e., the
                                    Senate "irreconcilables"]; but may lose the
                                    whole shout.
                        Now, I doubt not you're incredulous; but think a little about the women's vote, for instance. Think of a woman whose husband
                                    hasn't got her against the League. How many of 'em would take a
                                    deliberate or impersonal view? About 3 in 1000. The others would say: "A
                                    vote for Cox and the Covenant may save some poor dear good looking boy from getting
                                    shot through the lungs and everything. Grandpa was a Republican, and I'd like to be oneâ€”but I can't vote against saving
                                    that boy."
                        And the mothers and fathers of growing boys
                                    generallyâ€”you can explain to some of 'em that
                                    you think the Covenant would lead 
                                        to
                                     warâ€”but threeâ€“fourths of 'em won't
                                    hear about thatâ€”and some that do hear about it only get a little more
                                    confused and retain that vague impression of benefit from the League;â€”it
                                        might save their sons from war, they dimly feel.
                        They'd have accepted a denatured League perfectlyâ€”they would 
                                        yet
                                    â€”and the Democrats would have got 
                                        no
                                    where trying to insist on the literal text of Wilson's League. But now what the country sees is this: 
                                        
                                            Harding means no effort to avoid wars.
                                        
                                        
                                            Cox means an effort to avoid wars.
                                        
                                    
                                
                        
                        The mass is a 
                                        simple
                                     mind: it 
                                        takes
                                     things with a startling simplicity. It hates war more than ever it did. The
                                    Great War is fresh in its mind. The exâ€“soldier of the mass says he won't go to war again, no matter what they do to him.
                                    Well, I hope I'm not right, but this is what my ear hears from the soil.

            Centennial History of the Indiana General Assembly: Three Review Essays

               The Centennial History of the Indiana General Assembly, 1816â€”1978. By
                    Justin E. Walsh. (Indianapolis: Select Committee on the Centennial History of the Indiana General
                    Assembly, in cooperation with the Indiana Historical Bureau, 1987. Pp. xxviii, 832. Notes,
                    illustrations, bibliographical essay, appendixes, tables, maps, index. $20.00.)
            Hoosiers will be indebted to Justin E. Walsh for this work, the first of its kind in the United
                    States. Historians should be humbled by the decade of labor behind such an ambitious task. Other
                    states must doubtless be envious of the results, yet intimidated by the time and funding needed to
                    undertake similar projects. Indiana is blessed to have a state legislature willing to subsidize a
                    study of its first one hundred sessions, and lucky that Walsh had at his disposal talented staff,
                    computer technology, the Lilly Endowment, and supportive advisors, historical libraries and
                    agencies. All of these helped bring this project to fruition, and all receive generous praise from
                    the author.
            This centennial history was a monumental endeavor by any standard. To cover more than 168 years of
                    state history, with a focus on more than 6,000 legislators who drafted more than 21,000 laws under
                    two constitutions, the author had to select, compress, and restrict materials in order to keep the
                    finished text under 700 pages. Supplementing his chronicle and analysis are several invaluable
                    appendixes covering such topics as education, vocation, religion, sex and race of the legislators,
                    and sequential apportionment maps of the state. Readers who want more information on particular
                    individuals can consult the two biographical volumes published in 1980 and 1984. A marvelous
                    bibliography reveals the voluminous sources consulted and assimilated into this study.

                  INDIANA STATEHOUSE
                  Courtesy of Indiana State Library, Indianapolis.
                islative records, newspaper coverage, written memoirs and oral interviews from
                    participants, scholarly monographs and articles, and at least two novels supply the facts, opinions,
                    and anecdotes for this lively interpretive history. The author divides his narrative into five
                    appropriate chronological units, subdivides the units into sensible topical discussions, and
                    includes an apparently exhaustive index. The Indiana Historical Bureau has complemented
                    Walsh's work with a handsome production, remarkably free of mistakes, and with footnotes at
                    the bottom of the pages where they belong.
            Significant themes and enduring patterns emerge from the one hundred sessions covered in this book.
                    Through sessions one to one hundred, white, conservative, Methodist males dominated the state
                    legislature. But with the passage of time and the urbanization of Indiana, female and black
                    representation has increased as has the diversity of religious affiliation and level of education.
                    Lobbyistsâ€” the Third Houseâ€”have been a constant and powerful element in the
                    proceedings of the General Assembly as they pursued special interests from canal construction to
                    teachers' benefits. A mutual need and lack of respect has almost always existed between
                    legislators and newspaper reporters; this dynamic tension has not always enhanced political
                    reputations, but has provided more records for hisâ€“ 
                    torians. Until the mid-twentieth century, the frequent turnover of elected officials created
                    discontinuity and truncated leadership. This hampered the state's long-term planning,
                    especially in terms of revenue. Unfortunately, many of the most important changes we now take for
                    granted arrived only when the federal government forced Indiana to move faster or in new directions.
                    For example, female suffrage, district reapportionment, and social welfare programs did not spring
                    willingly from the halls of the statehouse.
            Fascinating episodes, interesting trivia, and pungent interpretations also fill these pages. Several
                    famous literary figures, including Booth Tarkington, Lew Wallace, and William Dudley Foulke, served
                    in the House or Senate. Most of them regarded this service as a minor interlude in their lives, yet
                    it sometimes reappeared in fictional form. The much ballyhooed power of the Ku Klux Klan in the
                    1920s was apparently more threat than substance; Walsh could find little evidence of its legislative
                    productivity other than stringent enforcement of prohibition laws. At times legislators abandoned
                    committee chambers for more convivial quarters in the Claypool Hotel, 
                        Columbia
                     Club, and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Athletic Club. From these quasi-official addresses came bills and policies for
                    different parties at various times. The General Assembly spent inordinate amounts of time on such
                    less-than-necessary activities as banning Sunday baseball games, conducting
                    "witch-hunts" for communists, and debating Daylight Saving Time. But it frequently
                    could not find time for necessary revenue appropriations; hence, ten special sessions had to be
                    called to keep the government functioning. Walsh generally tries to remain non-judgmental.
                    Nevertheless, he occasionally hands out awards to effective public servants such as Thomas Taggart
                    and Will Hays. He also delivers harsh verdicts to the guilty. In the nineteenth century, he argues,
                    fiscally irresponsible legislators had been "made dizzy by the heights of high
                    finance" (p. 33). And the refusal or inability to redistrict the state for more than forty
                    years in the twentieth century was the "greatest dereliction in the history of the General
                    Assembly" (p. 344).
            Monuments are easy targets for criticism, and this book is so big it can withstand a little.
                    Additional appendixes including the 1816 and 1851 constitutions would be helpful since these
                    documents are the subject of frequent reference. Likewise a listing of all constitutional amendments
                    would be equally helpful and logical. The substantial cost and size of this publication probably
                    precluded these additions, however. For unexplained reasons, the author's discussions of
                    race relations prior to 1850 and the state's sesquicentennial celebrations in 1966 are
                    completely out of sequence and violate the usually clear chronology. Minor quibbles include
                    unlabeled photographs of legislators and the seemingly undue attention paid to Freemasonry.
            
            Criticism pales, however, in light of the valuable contribution this book makes. Its immensity of
                    effort, richness of detail, fairness of spirit, and magnitude of success eventually overwhelm all
                    else. This reviewer stands humbled by and grateful for its presence.
            GEORGE T. BLAKEY is professor of history at Indiana University
                    East in 
                        Richmond
                    . His works include Hard Times and New Deal in 
                            Kentucky
                        
                (
                        Kentucky
                    , 1986) and various publications on Progressivism and World War I.
            The Indiana General Assembly enacted a law in 1976 creating a Centennial History project to
                    commemorate its one hundredth session. A legislative committee was empowered to supervise the
                    project and to employ an author and staff to prepare a professional and comprehensive history of the
                    state legislature. The law also established a council, composed of Indiana academicians and
                    historical agency officials, which would advise the legislative committee. Justin E. Walsh, who was
                    among the ninety-five applicants for the post, was ultimately employed as the full-time author with
                    a staff providing research and editorial assistance.
            The completed work is a methodically organized account of the Indiana legislature. The book is
                    divided into five chronological parts covering 1816-1850, 1850-1890, 1890-1930, 1930-1970, and
                    1970-1978. Parts I-IV each give chapter-length treatments of the same themes and indeed each part
                    uses the same four chapter titles: "The Setting and the Major Issues,"
                    "The Constitutional and Political Context," "The Legislative
                    Process," and "The Legislators." These themes are again surveyed in Part
                    V, which consists of one chapter on the 1970s.
            The author undoubtedly intends the volume to be of service to the student and the scholar while
                    accommodating the interests of the general reader. In deference to the academy, the material is
                    presented in a scholarly format with footnotes, annotated bibliography, and appendixes composed of
                    tables summarizing quantitative data about legislators, House and Senate Apportionment Maps, and
                    Congressional Districting Maps. The book reflects the scholar's effort to achieve factual
                    accuracy and to base statements on documentary evidence. The author drew upon an enormous body of
                    primary source material including legislative journals, minutes, bills, laws, reports, manuscripts,
                    and oral histories. The usual problem of evidence selection was compounded by the existence of
                    hundreds of thousands of pages of such source material. Walsh's approach was to select
                    "basic facts" (pp. xx) about the procedure, process, politics, and people of the
                    Indiana legislature. Consequently, the book provides basic information on such topics as
                    constitutional issues, legislative-executive rivalries, apportionments, Congressional districting,
                    the election of 
                        United States
                     senators,  the fortunes of political parties in the
                    General Assembly, contested elections, legislative leaders, offices, rules, and committees.
            Nevertheless, as seen from an academic viewpoint, the book is wanting in some respects. It does not
                    state a central thesis, nor does it offer historical context in any detail. Facts are presented with
                    a minimum of interpretation and analysis. Although the book rarely presents quantitative analysis of
                    legislative behavior in specific legislative sessions, it does offer an enlightening empirical study
                    of the impact. of the Ku Klux Klan on the 1925 General Assembly. In this regard scholars may also
                    wish to consult Marvelyn S. Norton, "Political Influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1925
                    Indiana General Assembly" (M.A. Thesis, Indiana State University, 1970), a work not cited
                    by Walsh. Furthermore, Walsh does not reveal the extent to which the legislative history of this
                    state is distinctive because he seldom compares the Indiana General Assembly to legislatures in
                    other states. The bibliographic essay does not contain a comprehensive list of secondary sources
                    relating to the Indiana legislature. Omitted works include: Frank J. Munger, "Two Party
                    Politics in the State of Indiana" (Ph.D. Dissertation, 
                        Harvard
                     University, 1955) and Empirical Studies of Indiana Politics: Studies of
                        Legislative Behavior, edited by James B. Kessler (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1970). Pertinent articles in regional and national political
                    science journals unnoted by Walsh may be found in the Kessler edition. Other relevant studies not
                    cited by Walsh are recorded in Studies on Indiana: A Bibliography of Theses and
                        Dissertations Submitted to Indiana Institutions of Higher Education for Advanced Degrees,
                        1902-1977 (

            The legislation enacted by the Indiana General Assembly is not treated as a discrete major theme.
                    While entire chapters are devoted to "The Legislators," for example, "The
                    Laws" topic is covered as one of several segments of each of the chapters entitled
                    "The Legislative Process." Here the emphasis is on legislation concerning
                    taxation, revenue, and budgeting. Elsewhere, in chapters dealing with "Major
                    Issues," other laws are discussed as by-products of issues engendering intense public
                    interest or controversy. These include the internal improvements scheme of the 1830s, the racial
                    issues of the 1850s and 1860s, the Prohibition question of the World War I period, and the
                    women's issues of the 1970s. In short, the book stresses laws involving perennial financial
                    concerns and those relating to emotionally charged issues. It underplays other categories of laws,
                    for example, social legislation on such matters as work, schooling, health and safety. Little space
                    is given to explanations of how the historical trends of an era prompted the passage of certain
                    legislation and to assessments of how such legislation altered the lives of Indiana people. Thus,
                    the volume does not fully describe and explain how the Indiana General Assembly  was affected by immigration during 1850-1890 nor how the ethnic
                    composition of the Indiana population was shaped by the legislature's response to
                    immigration.
            The general reader will find much of the book's content and language appealing. An
                    informality of style with some vernacular expressions makes the book eminently readable. Yet this
                    style may account for a number of minor but unfortunate instances of imprecise and incorrect usage,
                    for example, in the statement: "Only thirty-nine specifically stated that they were not a
                    church member" (p. 569). Also, the book's charm is somewhat diminished by several
                    tiresome repetitions of facts, such as the duplication of the number of one-term senators on pages
                    258 and 259. Vignettes about capital city lifestyles during legislative sessions are laden with
                    human interest, as are accounts of partisan rivalries and emotional issues. Likewise, there are
                    countless sketches of archetypical legislators, legislative leaders, lobbyists, and newspaper
                    reporters whose lives involved stories of idealism, statesmanship, romance, sex, violence, and
                    cupidity. Walsh also notes untypical legislators including women, blacks, and others who were not
                    members of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male group that was historically predominant in the
                    Indiana General Assembly. The author often allows his characters to speak for themselves in
                    frequently colorful quotations. Hoosier readers will admire the author's independence.
                    Walsh candidly expresses views critical of the record of the body that sponsored and subsidized his
                    study, for example, see his comments on legislative apportionment, 1921-1963 (pp. 344-45). In
                    summary, this volume is an entertaining read for the general public and a useful factual reference
                    for students and scholars. But readers seeking a full understanding of the Indiana General
                    Assembly's place in history must use it in conjunction with the standard surveys of Indiana
                    history.

                        United States
                     ethnic history. His research sometimes combines these interests as in his article
                    entitled: "The Political Realignment of Black Voters in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1924," Indiana Magazine of History, LXXIX (June, 1983).
                    133-66.
            In 1979 a select committee of the Indiana state legislature, seeking ways to commemorate the
                    approaching one hundredth session of the General Assembly, commissioned Justin E. Walsh to prepare a
                    centennial history. Any historian who undertakes a project of such magnitude faces a wide area of
                    research and must possess overwhelming curiosity and infinite patience. Walsh apparently has both.
                    Although his book addresses the events and people who shaped the policies of the state for more than
                    a century and a half, its chief merit is the encyclopedic information it provides.
            
            Walsh's volume is organized chronologically, biographically, and topically and is more
                    narrative and descriptive than analytical and interpretive. The author divides his material into
                    five sections: the pioneer period, 1816-1850; the middle period, 1850-1890; the early modern period,
                    1890-1930; the recent modern period, 1930- 1970; and the contemporary era, 1970-1978. In each
                    section Walsh discusses the setting and major issues; the constitutional and political context; the
                    legislative process; typical and not-so-typical legislators; and other miscellany.
            While the organizational plan has the obvious virtue of making the book something more than a mere
                    catalog of writings on Indiana history, it also forces the author to repeat the same thematic
                    material in the various chapters. Too many names and facts tumble out of the pages, causing some
                    confusion and disorder. Furthermore, Walsh falls into the trap of many cultural historians who fail
                    to integrate their interpretive analysis into the presentation of data. Had he editorialized more,
                    he might have brought his salient points into better focus and avoided mere narrative.
            The first Indiana General Assembly met in Corydon, Indiana Territory, in November, 1816, amid the
                    excitement and anticipation of statehood, but three years later, these neophyte assemblymen
                    struggled with a major economic dislocation, the onset of the Panic of 1819. The agricultural part
                    of the state and national economy collapsed. Because factories, banking credit, protective tariffs,
                    and other institutions were in the early stages of development, they were less harshly affected. The
                    panic resulted from the War of 1812 and postwar expansion unpoliced by an effective central bank,
                    from extensive land speculation, and from economic adjustments to international competition. Many of
                    the people in Indiana, however, presumed that incumbent legislators were at fault. Because of this
                    perception, one-third of them lost their seats in the 1820 election.
            According to Walsh, the solid accomplishment of the General Assembly during the pioneer period was
                    the establishment of the Second State Bank. He asserts, however, that this success did not save the
                    legislative body from permanent association with fiscal failure. Furthermore, the collapse of
                    internal improvements systems, "conceived and nurtured in the 1830s by legislative fiat led
                    to bankruptcy, repudiation, and destruction of the state's credit" (p. 24). Partly
                    as a result, the second constitutional convention in 1850 was deemed necessary.
            In the decade preceding the Civil War, issues facing policymakers turned from money and internal
                    improvements to race, women's rights, and state control of alcoholic beverages. Walsh
                    indicates that these were the issues that divided Hoosiers into passionate advocates with
                    diametrically opposed views. It was a time of immigration, population growth, and social reform. It
                    was also a time when railroads were being built and antimonopoly laws considered.  Walsh effectively chronicles this most interesting period in Indiana
                    history and clearly describes the maze of politics in which one could easily lose one's way
                    among temperance advocates, suffragettes, Greenbackers, Quakers, Whigs, Know-Nothings,
                    Know-Somethings, Free Masons, Black Masons, Democrats, and nativists and ultimately among the
                    elements of fusion forming the Republican party.
            The Republican party emerged from the Civil War not an all-triumphant, well-disciplined organization
                    but still a party that could garner a sufficient number of votes to win six of the twelve General
                    Assembly elections from 1867 to 1889. The members held themselves together by patriotic appeals to
                    Civil War issues that were fast becoming obsolete. Democrats, although tainted with charges of
                    disloyalty and lacking leaders with more statesmanlike appeal, surprisingly, were also able to
                    sustain a political position. Walsh states that the slight margins of victory between the two
                    parties encouraged widespread tampering and rampant electoral fraud. As the stakes rose at the
                    gubernatorial and presidential levels, the corruption increased. In 1888 when Democrat Grover 
                        Cleveland
                     ran against Indiana's own Benjamin Harrison for the presidency, an attempt by
                    the Republican National Committee to purchase the states' electoral votes for Harrison drew
                    national attention to Indiana's corrupt election practices. By the end of the 1889 session
                    both parties saw the necessity for electoral restructuring.
            Indiana reformers labored mightily in the early part of the twentieth century. While temperance
                    continued as a most persistent issue, it vied, as Walsh indicates, "with several lesser
                    questions of a sumptuary nature" (p. 291). The 1920s intervened between what is now called
                    the Progressive era and the New Deal, an intervention that changed many attitudes and introduced new
                    issues for consideration, issues that appealed to the rising numbers of urban dwellers.
            The New Deal brought Paul McNutt to the governorship. Walsh characterizes McNutt as the
                    state's most powerful twentieth-century governor. Only Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's
                    Civil War governor, exerted such influence. It was at McNutt's insistence that the
                    legislature of 1933 ventured into several new fields of taxation, recodified the banking laws of the
                    state, passed an old-age pension act and a series of measures relating to poor relief, outlawed
                    "yellow-dog" contracts, and restricted the issuance of injunctions in labor
                    disputes. It has been claimed that this governor virtually "pioneered all the laws which
                    afterwards President Roosevelt was given credit for instituting" (p. 448).
            The assemblies that convened in the recent past consolidated the dramatic changes of the
                    mid-twentieth century. In the 1960s forced compliance with court-ordered reapportionment decrees
                    substantially reduced the representation from urban areas. In the 1970s  Indiana's constitution was amended to permit the legislature
                    to convene in annual rather than biennial sessions and to allow governors to serve two consecutive
                    four-year terms. In 1971 Indiana expanded the civil rights of women in employment, a full year
                    before Congress approved the Equal Rights Amendment resolution, and in 1977 the state became the
                    thirty-fifth to ratify the proposed amendment.
            This successful history is presented to the citizens of Indiana and their legislative
                    representatives.

               We Ask Only a Fair Trail should interest a diverse audience. It is written in a
                    popular style, and its rich details on the lives and accomplishments of dozens of 
                        Evansville
                    's Afro-Americans will surely whet the appetites of local citizens. At the same
                    time, Darrel E. Bigham addresses a range of issues of significance to historians of the
                    Afro-American experience, making a real contribution to a collective understanding of that subject.
            
               
                        Evansville
                    's location near the border between North and South has greatly shaped its
                    history. On the one hand, located in the free state of Indiana, it was a frequent target for black
                    migrants (e.g., runaway slaves) from the South. On the other hand, located so close to the South,
                    its racial customs and mores had more in common with southern cities than northern ones. Its
                    sizeâ€”more middling than big cityâ€”was an additional influence. Not unrelated
                    was its general lack of heavy industry. While these sorts of factors made the black experience in 
                        Evansville
                     quite different from that in 
                        Chicago
                     or 
                        Detroit
                    , there were nevertheless some important continuities.
            Bigham demonstrates that for Afro-Americans, even in the late nineteenth century, urbanization tended
                    to mean ghettoization. Black 
                        Evansville
                     grew fastest in the period from Emancipation to the turn of the twentieth century,
                    largely due to an influx of freed slaves who judged that they would find greater opportunities in
                    the North than in the South. In reality, they found a segmented labor market which restricted them
                    to low-paying, largely service-oriented occupations, and an increasingly segregated housing market.
                    By 1880, a "ghetto" had begun to emerge.
            Within this ghetto, Afro-Americans constructed a rich associational and institutional life. Churches,
                    schools, and secret societies grouped black people together and gave them a variety of structures
                    through which they could attempt to meet their community's needs. Holidays and
                    anniversaries, like "Emancipation Day," brought the community together with a
                    sense of shared heritage and purpose.

            Bigham offers an especially rich account of the evolution of the leadership of this community. He is
                    at his best in tracing the transition of the black middle class from the late nineteenth century to
                    the early and mid-twentieth century. The popularity of Booker T. Washington's philosophy
                    among the middle-class had as much to do with the pressures exerted by powerful whites on a local
                    level as it had to do with their own inherent appeal. Although organized
                    "integrationism" was weak in black 
                        Evansville
                    , there was plenty of resistance to "accommodationism."
            Bigham traces the emergence of a new articulate "race pride" in 
                        Evansville
                     during the Depression years of the 1930s. Although neither Garveyism nor the
                    "New Negro" appear to have had any influence in the 
                        Evansville
                     of the 1920s, these ideas did find resonance in the thirties. This was expressed on
                    multiple levels: politically, through a new independence which redefined black relationships to both
                    established parties; economically, through the development of black businesses which served a black
                    clientele; socially, through the further development of black institutions and organizations.
            Moreover, this new "race pride" did not preclude relations with whites. In fact, in
                    this period a new set of relations developed in some new quarters, as manifested by the rise of the
                    UAW-CIO in 
                        Evansville
                     and by the new strength of the New Deal-based Democratic party. Working-class
                    Afro-Americans built new cooperative relations with working-class whites. And in so doing, they
                    began to build the foundations for their struggles for equality in the late twentieth century.

            Toward the end of Walter Gresham's life, a Republican senator dubbed him "that old
                    Welkin of diplomacy, that plantigrade pachyderm from the 
                        Wabash
                    ." The tone of contempt reflected the dislike GOP members felt for a man who
                    had been both postmaster general under Republican 
                        Chester
                     A. Arthur and secretary of state during Grover 
                        Cleveland
                    's second presidential term. The political journey that Gresham took through
                    the complex politics of Indiana during an intensely partisan era from one party to another is well
                    chronicled in Charles W. Calhoun's excellent new biography.
            
            Throughout his career Gresham aroused strong passions among those who dealt with him in Indiana
                    politics. He and Benjamin Harrison disliked each other intensely, yet he worked closely before 1892
                    with Charles W. Fairbanks. Some men regarded Gresham as presidential material; others found him a
                    clumsy intriguer. After two years in 
                        Cleveland
                    's cabinet, Gresham died in May, 1895. He left some personal papers and a
                    legacy of protest against the public life of his time. His wife prepared a warmly favorable
                    two-volume biography, but otherwise Gresham faded from even the historical second rank until the
                    1960s. Then scholars of American diplomacy, particularly those persuaded that overseas markets drove
                    policy-making during the 1890s, focused new attention on Gresham over the past two decades.
            Calhoun writes about Gresham to explain his role in the actions and passions of that day, not to
                    align him with some modern interpretive controversy. Researched with impressive thoroughness and
                    written with authority and insight, the resulting book is balanced and fair. Calhoun recognizes
                    Gresham's strengths, but he also identifies those instances when his subject contradicted
                    his own principles and pretensions. He is not convinced that Gresham was a market seeker.
                    "A close examination of Gresham's attitudes and actions reveals little foundation
                    for this interpretation" (p. 134) is how Calhoun puts it with characteristic clarity. The
                    chapters on Gresham as secretary of state, the heart of the book, are a series of lucid and
                    thoughtful case studies. The treatment of 
                        Hawaii
                     is especially judicious on a subject where it would have been easy to praise Gresham as
                    a premature anti-imperialist. Instead, Calhoun skillfully traces the fusion of principle and pique
                    that moved the secretary's policies.
            Calhoun shows that many men in the Gilded Age believed Gresham would make an admirable national
                    leader. It is harder now to recapture what made him someone who was often suggested for high office.
                    A proponent of republican virtue, Gresham called himself "a firm believer in popular
                    government" (p. 116). Yet time after time Gresham shrank from putting his candidacy to the
                    test of the ballot box, and he gained prominent positions through appointments and the kindness of
                    the politicians he so often scorned. As Calhoun skillfully shows, Gresham spent "a lifetime
                    of political alienation" (p. 221). He thought of himself as the person to call the nation
                    back to the virtues that had made the 
                        United States
                     great, and he was ever at a loss to understand why his fellow citizens never recognized
                    what he could do for them. Like 
                        Cleveland
                    , he regarded politics as a dreadful, self-inflicted penance that he performed for his
                    country. After following Gresham's career of self-doubt and barely repressed ambition
                    through Calhoun's fascinating narrative, the best epitaph for this Hoosier statesman is the
                         phrase attached to the British politician Lord Rosebery.
                    Gresham too wanted the palm without the dust.

                            Indianapolis
                        , 1912â€“1987. By Edwin L. Becker. (

            Edwin L. Becker's history of the Church Federation of Greater 
                        Indianapolis
                     belongs in every Protestant parish library in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . It provides an excellent summary of the first seventy-five years of federation history
                    seen in the context of both American and local religious history. In addition, Becker deserves
                    commendation for his broad view of religious history in its social context.
            Organized in six chronological chapters, Becker's monograph is traditional in its
                    methodology. Becker clearly offers officially sponsored history, since he undertook this work for
                    the federation's Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Committee. He displays a thorough mastery of the
                    federation's collection of the written documentation of its own history. In addition,
                    Becker also demonstrates an acute understanding of how federation history can be traced in local
                    newspaper accounts of its work and in oral history interviews.
            As he documents the way the federation has represented institutionalized cooperation among Protestant
                    churches in the region, Becker also shows that white Anglo-Saxon Protestantism is no longer as
                    secure or as dominant in 
                        Indianapolis
                     religious and sociopolitical life as it was in the pre-World War I era. Becker deserves
                    special commendation for attempting to describe how the federation has been a leader in confronting
                    the problems of racism in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and how the role of black churches within the federation has gradually expanded.
            While Becker does an excellent job describing how the federation has responded to racism, he says
                    amazingly little about how the federation has responded to sexism, although the work of women
                    prominent in federation history is described in some detail. When the Women's Department
                    disappears in the 1930s, women as a group seem to vanish from Becker's history.
            In addition to wondering why the role of women has not been treated in greater detail, one also
                    wishes that Becker had treated the federation's relationship with the Roman Catholic
                    community in greater detail. It is also significant that Becker treats the Jewish
                    community's relationship with the federation basically in terms of rabbinical support of
                    efforts for greater racial understanding and  in terms of how
                    the Jewish community's objections to religious practices in the public schools were
                    received by the federation.
            Despite its minor flaws, this monograph is worthy of commendation. It is interesting, informative,
                    and a pleasure to read.

               Back Home Again consists almost entirely of 132 photographsâ€” but what
                    photographs! These pictures from the Great Depression and the World War II homefront document a
                    brief and often troubling period in the lives of some typical Hoosiers. The limiting word is
                    "some," for the Farm Security Administration photographers worked on specific
                    assignments and did not cover the full range of Indiana society or geography. Their subjects were
                    chiefly the ordinary people of farms and small towns, mainly in central and southern Indiana. 
                        Indianapolis
                     is well represented in numbers, but the peacetime pictures seem rather cold and distant
                    when compared with the intensely human drama of the farms and small towns. A more emotional
                    atmosphere appears in the pictures taken at Fort Benjamin Harrison and the wartime bus station.
            Robert L. Reid's comments are brief but helpful, describing the photographic program of the
                    Resettlement Administration of 1935, renamed the Farm Security Administration after the Department
                    of Agriculture absorbed it in 1937. Unlike some picture books, the images here are sharply printed
                    in a generous six-by-eight-inch format and carefully identified by photographer, location, date, and
                    Library of Congress file number.
            The original purpose of the photo unit was to picture America's rural poverty and the
                    remedial projects of the Resettlement Administration. This attempt soon developed into a broader
                    effort to document rural and small town life in general. As Russell Lee explained to an interviewer
                    long afterward, whenever questioned he answered simply: "I'm taking pictures of
                    the history of today" (p. ix). A half-century later one can begin to appreciate the
                    documentary value of these FSA pictures, which eventually numbered nearly a quarter of a million
                    nationwide. Many of the New Deal photographers moved on to distinguished careers in journalism, and
                    Reid provides brief biographical notes for all those who worked in Indiana.

            Professionals and volunteers in history museums continually ask for hands on examplesâ€”how
                    do you do this, what, when, etc. Theory is fine, but how does one actually do the myriad of things
                    that one is called on to do, particularly in small museums and historical institutions? This volume
                    is as fine a beginning guide as one will find. The various writers offer detailed help and raise
                    important questions. What the reader will find here is offered by those who work in the trenches.
                    Even for the professional or volunteers who have been around museums a long time, this volume is a
                    refresher course, a reminder, and everyone needs reminding and refreshing.
            There is a great deal of depth in the book. The various chapters cover research, exhibits, living
                    history and dramatic interpretation, public programming, and local history. The chapter on
                    "Folklife and Local History in Small Museums" is especially useful. There is a
                    good discussion of the attitudes of small museumsâ€” indeed, more emphasis could and should
                    be given to the neglect of interpretation in small museums. Too often small size is used as an
                    excuse. The discussion of the context and function of an artifact as necessary tools of
                    interpretation is extremely important and easy to overlook in day to day practice, especially in
                    small museums. Without interpretation, however, history museums are simply reliquariums gathering
                    dust rather than the collective memory of a community or state. The chapters on living history and
                    public programs, especially "Education Outreach," "Festival
                    Programming," and "Historic Drama," also provide very useful information;
                    "Remaking the Past" provides a good perspective on research methods.
            This is a very useful book which should have wide readership in spite of what appears at first
                    glance, by title and contents, to be a book exclusively for Indiana. In fact, this reader's
                    only quibble  with the book is that its subtitle will probably
                    prevent many in the profession from reading it. That would be unfortunate and should be corrected.
                    The book could and should have a national readership because it raises questions and provides points
                    of information that are always pertinent to museum professionals in small museums and historical
                    societies anywhere in the country.

               Handbook on Indiana History. Edited and compiled by Evelyn M. Sayers. (

                    : Indiana Department of Education, 1987. Pp. xiv, 224. Figures, maps, tables, graphs,
                    sources, index. Paperbound, free upon request.)
            This handbook, prepared by members of the 1987 Bicentennial Indiana History Task Force under the
                    direction of Evelyn M. Sayers, is a revision of an earlier publication of the same name. Developed
                    to coincide with the bicentennial celebration of the Northwest Ordinance and the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                    , the handbook's general purpose was "to focus attention on the value
                    of studying the history of Indiana" (p. vii). More specifically, the task was "to
                    prepare a brief history of Indiana suitable for secondary social studies teachers to use in
                    celebrating Indiana" (p. ix).
            The handbook gets off to a fine start with "An Introduction: The Study and Teaching of
                    Indiana History" (pp. xi-xiii), written by Donald F. Carmony who authored the earlier
                    edition in 1961. Carmony succinctly puts forth the guidelines that he considers to be important in
                    determining the content of a course in Indiana history. Although one may not agree with his
                    conviction that "unless Indiana history can be offered at not less than the junior high
                    level, there is quite limited value in offering it at all" (p. xi), his rationale for
                    teaching Indiana history is clear and sound, as are his suggestions for teaching and studying
                    Indiana history. Teachers should make certain that they read this introduction.
            The content of the sixteen chapters in this handbook on the history of Indiana are arranged
                    chronologically for the most part. Following the first chapter on geography is one on archaeology
                    and prehistory. In subsequent chapters, the history of Indiana continues to unfold (historic
                    Indians, French and British periods, the Old Northwest, Indiana Territory, and early statehood)
                    through Chapter 14, "Indiana Today." The next chapter, "Indiana
                    Government," is, of course, rich in historical content. The final chapter is
                    "Indiana, Economic Development Toward the 21st Century." The material was written
                    by people who are specialists in Indiana archaeology, economics, geography, history, and
                    governmentâ€”Donald R. Cochran, Joseph A. Rueff, Peter Harrington, Edward E. Lyon,  Patrick J. Furlong, George W. Geib, William W. Giffin, Ralph D.
                    Gray, Liliane Krasean, James H. Madison, Rebecca Shoemaker, and Carl W. Henn, Jr.
            Each chapter begins with a "To the Teacher" note, followed by a "Corollary
                    to U.S. History." The historical content material comes next and is usually divided into
                    "General Comments" and "Points to Emphasize." Marginal notes are
                    employed to highlight the topics that are covered in the adjacent text and to make reference to
                    relevant material that is located in another part of the handbook. Two of the chapters suggest
                    teaching activities. Additional sources for use in teaching Indiana history appear at the back of
                    the handbookâ€”books, periodicals, maps, and lists of organizations.
            This handbook contains a brief history of Indiana. It was not meant to be longer, but as a result
                    there are omissions. Undoubtedly there is material that some people will feel should have been
                    included. It is disappointing, for example, to find so little on historic Native American cultures,
                    particularly when the book repeats other material. Donald R. Cochran's chapter,
                    "Archaeology and Prehistory," for example, is excellent and obviates the need for
                    what then becomes redundant information on prehistoric Indians in the following chapter. The full
                    text of the Land Ordinance of 1785 appears in the handbook, and rightfully so. One questions,
                    however, the need for seven pages on "Land Survey Systems" and the "Metes
                    and Bounds Survey System" (pp. 43-49), particularly since their location breaks the flow of
                    the narrative content. Such material is more appropriately placed in an appendix. One might argue
                    that more cultural geography should have been included, but before carrying that contention very
                    far, one needs to look beyond the geography chapter and read, for example, William W.
                    Giffin's chapter, "Indiana Lifestyle, 1865-1920." The plain white pages
                    that appear between some chaptersâ€”if meant to serve as dividers, they simply are not
                    appropriate, nor are they neededâ€”could have been used more profitably to provide more
                    subject matter content or end-of-chapter bibliographies. Still, there is a lot of fine Indiana
                    history material in this handbook. It is a pleasure to read the many well-written chapters. The
                    handbook does provide secondary teachers with background information on their state.
            This reviewer is reluctant to comment adversely on a publication that has been produced with such
                    fine intentions, and which has been made possible through the contributions of very busy
                    individuals, all well-qualified to write authoritatively in a specific field of Indiana history.
                    Still, professional integrity and the possibility that this publication may undergo another revision
                    prompt the citation of some major shortcomings. Perhaps they can be corrected in any future edition.
            There are problems with this handbook. One glaring error in the "Table of Contents"
                    (p. ii) places Ball State University in 
                    
                        Bloomington
                    . A larger problem, however, exists with the basic format that has been used in each
                    chapter. When turning to "Points to Emphasize," a teacher will very likely expect
                    to find a concise list of important information that is to be stressed, not two to eight pages of
                    discourse. After reading the material several times, this reviewer is still unable to supply a
                    logical explanation for the way in which some chapter content has been divided into
                    "General Comments" and "Points to Emphasize." The
                    "General Comments" range in length from one paragraph to ten pages. These headings
                    are confusing rather than helpful in most chapters. They are not used in all chapters.
            More than infrequently, there is inconsistency among the chapters. It would seem wise to have a note
                    at the beginning of each chapter to call the teacher's attention to the main idea to be
                    developed. In some chapters, "To the Teacher" serves that purpose: "After
                    the long struggle between Britain and 
                        France
                    , Britain took control of the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains" (p.
                    29), and "Following World War I, Indiana was caught up in the same trends that governed
                    national issues" (p. 103). Not all "To the Teacher" notes are of the
                    quality shown in the two examples. Consider the following one: "Discussions of the
                    historical development of local governmentâ€”county, city and town, and
                    townshipâ€”for your community can be discussed in conjunction with this chapter"
                    (p. 43).
            The handbook could be made more useful for teachers in several ways. Although the marginal notes are
                    helpful in directing attention to specific material found in the "Sources" section
                    at the back of the handbook, it would be far better to have the related source material within the
                    chapters instead. The effectiveness of such a plan can be seen in the few chapters where special
                    purpose maps, graphs, charts, and tables are included as an integral part of the content. Not only
                    is it always proper to include the source for statistical data, it is also helpful to the reader who
                    is interested in seeking more information. Sources of data are not always included in this handbook.
                    Footnotes are sometimes missing. Teachers would probably also welcome more teaching suggestions.
                    Unfortunately, there is little information on ways to use the fine content of the chapters.
                    "Indiana, Economic Development Toward the 21st Century" (pp. 157-76), written by
                    Joseph A. Rueff and Peter Harrington, is an exception. Their excellent chapter, very appropriately
                    included as the final one in the handbook, has the teaching materials and activities that teachers
                    need for classroom implementation.
            The "Sources" section (pp. 177-213) of the handbook contains a wealth of valuable
                    material for teachers. Using the bibliography, however, can be frustrating. There are actually two
                    bibliographies, one that is new for this edition and another that has been taken  from a previous edition of the handbook and tacked on to the newer one.
                    It does not help to state that many of the books on the earlier bibliography are out of print or
                    available only at libraries, and a few are being reprinted by Indiana University Press (p. 183). The
                    individual entries should have been checked and included in a single revised bibliography, thus
                    eliminating the repetition and simplifying the usage. The books and periodicals should also have
                    been separated. Within each of those two categories, it would be helpful if the materials were
                    grouped, not only by author, but by topic, or in chapter-by-chapter sequence. (Certainly, there is
                    no place for incomplete bibliographical entries in a professional publication. Citing a book only by
                    author, title, and year of publication is simply not acceptable.) Probably the most valuable part of
                    the "Sources" section is that which includes information on the Indiana Historical
                    Bureau, the Indiana Historical Society, the Indiana State Library, the Educational Resources
                    Information Center (ERIC), and other long-recognized, valuable resources for studying and teaching
                    Indiana history (pp. 187-88).
            This reviewer has come to expect a wide variation in the quality of material that is produced by the
                    departments of education in the fifty states. Where specialists are employed, particularly in the
                    preliminary and final stages of production, more polished publications are the result. The necessity
                    for a polished product, however, is not always felt. Such must have been the case in this instance.
                    In its own way, this publication meets the purpose for which it was writtenâ€”it provides a
                    brief history of Indiana for secondary teachers. One hopes that secondary teachers will use it as a
                    springboard for further study of their state.

               Hail Purdue. By John Norberg. (Dallas, Tex.: Taylor Publishing Company, 1987.
                    Pp. 240. Illustrations, roster of members. $40.95.)
            
               Hail Purdue by John Norberg is a handsome 240-page history of the Purdue University
                    bands from 1886 to 1986. In that first century of Purdue bands' existence only three men
                    served as directors of the department: Paul Spotts Emrick, 1904-1954; AI G. Wright, 1954-1981; and
                    J. Richard Dunscomb, 1981- . Each of the first three chapters records the activities and emphasis of
                    the band program under one of these three (Emrick, military style; Wright, showmanship; and
                    Dunscomb, jazz) together with their  backgrounds, leadership
                    qualities, and personalities as revealed in quoted statements and anecdotes obtained from band
                    alumni.
            A chapter is devoted to the introduction and evolving role of women in the Purdue band program, from
                    the first baton twirling majorette to the Golden Girls backed by a troop of twirlers and ranks of
                    flag carriers. Another chapter tells of securing the "world's largest bass
                    drum," its use in parades and football shows, and its mysterious disappearances. The
                    travels of the Purdue "All-American Bands" to football games, the 
                        Indianapolis
                     500, civic ceremonies, and to foreign countries are described by Norberg and alumni.
            There is, however, little mention of the bands' repertory other than references to frequent
                    playing of "Hail, Hail to Old Purdue" and John Philip Sousa's
                    "Stars and Stripes Forever" and a listing of pieces by recognized composers who
                    had been commissioned by Wright to write them. The text contains needless and annoying repetitions.
                    For example: "Emrick was strict, but the band loved him" occurs on pages 22, 26,
                    32, and 48; and a comment that Purdue did not have a school of music pops up on pages 5, 20, 55, 77,
                    108 (twice), 109, 114, 118, and 119.
            The book closes with an alphabetical list of more than eight thousand persons who have been members
                    of the Purdue bands or auxiliary groups. The volume is profusely illustrated with 114 excellent
                    photographs in color and 285 in black and white. On the whole the gathering and publication, in an
                    attractive format, of so much information about the Purdue bands is a worthy and welcome
                    contribution to Indiana history.

               Statehood and Union: A History of the Northwest Ordinance. By Peter S. Onuf. (
                        Bloomington
                    : Indiana University Press, 1987. Pp. xxi, 197. Maps, notes, index. $27.50.)
            Peter S. Onuf's 1987 work Statehood and Union: A History of the Northwest
                        Ordinance deals with some of the most important political and symbolic issues of the early
                    American republic. Along with Thomas Slaughter and Andrew Cayton, Onuf is one of several early
                    national historians who has studied the strained relationship between America's seacoast
                    communities and its quickly developing frontier settlements. Onuf's earlier works emphasize
                    the interaction between frontier desires for local rule and national efforts to create a unified and
                    legitimatized system. This process allowed recognition of some frontier governments, including 
                        Vermont
                    , but not other self-defined societies. His study of the Northwest Ordinance brings this
                    research to the Northwest Territory.
            
            Onuf places great importance upon the process that assigned the future northwestern states their
                    boundaries. The Ordinance and Congress imposed shapes and self-images for each new community. These
                    boundaries created specific political universes, and thus brought diverse groups of frontiersmen
                    into conflict or cooperation. The size and number of northwestern territories reflected both
                    sectional competition between North and South, and the eastern goal of creating stable, populous
                    frontier states that would not be numerous enough to dominate the national government. Since
                    Congress itself created the boundaries, and later revised several, northwesterners could not feel as
                    strongly committed to states' rights or local government as their southern counterparts.
            Onuf also emphasizes the degree to which settlers saw the Ordinance as an immutable form of higher
                    law, similar to the Constitution. Many pioneers resented the temporary loss of their full political
                    rights, and looked to the Ordinance process to guarantee future self-government. Yet Congress could
                    and did change its terms. Northwest political groups also tried to change the Ordinance, seeking
                    favorable new boundaries or different statehood procedures. The slavery issue focused heavily upon
                    the Ordinance. Many settlers in Indiana and 
                        Illinois
                     hoped that adopting a slavery system would stimulate rapid settlement. Others opposed
                    these people and referred to the enduring Ordinance to bolster antislavery arguments. Both Indiana
                    and 
                        Illinois
                     eventually rejected formal slavery. Onuf suggests that the framers of the Ordinance
                    worried more about boundaries and governmental processes than about slavery. Yet Civil War Unionists
                    praised them as apostles of liberty.
            Peter Onuf brings political and constitutional history together in Statehood and
                    Union and illustrates the importance of the Ordinance in shaping the Northwest. His work should
                    be read by all early national historians.

            "A city of rooted landmarks and changing faces," M.W. Newman's phrase in
                    the foreword, gets at the essence of this large volume. The book addresses those who would like to
                    know more about their city and suggests a series of driving tours through its neighborhoods. Each of
                    the fifteen chapters has two parts: a brief history  or
                    description of various neighborhoods in a particular section of the city, followed by detailed
                    instructions for taking an automobile tour of the area. The illustrations, which are the best part
                    of the work, also divide into two types: old pictures in the history section and current photographs
                    in the tour guide.
            The present work invites comparison with several other recent books which use historical spectacles
                    to look at the city as an artifact. Like Ira J. Bach's pathbreaking 
                        Chicago
                    
                    on Foot (1969 and several subsequent editions), 
                        Chicago
                    : City of Neighborhoods is a celebration of the city. Both
                    publications take readers on a few favorite pathways through the metropolis and then provide
                    background information, graphic aids, and specific "points to notice" to make the
                    tours meaningful. The earlier book focused on great architecture and the urban core. The latter one
                    is interested in neighborhood landmarks and directs the reader to the lakefront and the canal
                    corridor. Its Loop and South Side historical sections often closely parallel the text of 
                        Chicago
                    : A Historical Guide to the Neighborhoods: The Loop and South Side
                    (1979) by Glen E. Holt and Dominic A. Pacyga, but the more recent volume treats additional
                    neighborhoods and adds the tour feature. The 1979 volume, however, was more concerned with
                    conceptual themes and has a more complete bibliography. Ron Grossman's Guide
                        to 
                            Chicago
                         Neighborhoods (1981) is much briefer in outline and more restricted in scope.
                    It is based on the premise that one must walk the streets to get the flavor of the neighborhood. The
                    present volume, on the other hand, takes advantage of the automobile to take a more extensive look
                    at the metropolis.
            It is therefore ironic that the book itself says so little about the impact of the automobile on the
                    city and its neighborhoods. Its selective coverageâ€”only about a third or a fourth of the
                    city's geographical extent is treatedâ€”omits neighborhoods built to accommodate
                    cars and trucks. One searches almost in vain to find a picture of a garage, a driveway, a parking
                    lot, a service station, or an expressway. The impressive thing to many observers driving through the
                    "old neighborhoods" is to note how they are adapting to a suburban style of life.
                    As new schools, shopping centers, factories, and housing developments replace old segments of the
                    streetcar city, 
                        Chicago
                     seems to be taking life off the street and adopting a suburban look.
            The authors indicate at many places in the text that they are aware of the continuing transformation
                    of the city and its neighborhoods, but the book seems stuck in a nostalgic past rather than
                    highlighting contemporary changes. An eighteen-page index with approximately 2,500 separate entries
                    summarizes the book's strengths and weaknesses. It is the great key to the huge volume of
                    information packed into this compendium. O'Hare Airport is mentioned once, on page 12, in
                    passing. The "Saint columns," on  the other
                    hand, lists almost 200 separate churches, many discussed on six or seven different pages. A lot of
                    interesting local details can be located by using the index. But there is no entry for the 
                        Chicago
                     Public Schools.
            One suspects that future historians will use this view of neighborhoods as a key source when
                    discussing how 
                        Chicago
                     tried to come to terms with change in the 1980s. The task facing the present generation
                    is a large one and needs a whole series of books to give it guidance.

            An exhibit guide surpasses its exhibit in value or outlives it in utility only rarely. Such is surely
                    the case, however, with this little volume of essays brought together in celebration of the
                    bicentennial of the Northwest Ordinance. The 
                        Ohio
                     University project to which the exhibit and guide owe their existence has provided an
                    opportunity for some of the best scholars in the history of education to focus their attentions on a
                    rather narrow slice of the field. The result is a book which begins to redress the traditional
                    overemphasis on educational developments along the eastern seaboard and which sets out a framework
                    for further research on education in the North Central region.
            The collection explores the balance point between the influence of the established states,
                    particularly as it was exercised through the Ordinance, and the power of the settlers themselves in
                    shaping the institutions of the new states carved out of the region. The introductory essay points
                    at this with the argument that the authors of the Ordinance embodied in it a particular vision of
                    civic polity, albeit one which left considerable room for local determination. Essays by David Tyack
                    and Carl Kaestle carry the theme forward. Tyack stresses the role of the common schools in
                    articulating and disseminating "Republican values," which in turn, set a framework
                    for institution-building generally, but he suggests that the schools themselves were more an outcome
                    of state action than of a settled federal policy. Kaestle, too, places more stress on local
                    initiative and action in school establishment, arguing that the land  grant provisions of the Ordinance fell far short of the actual costs of
                    operating schools, forcing the new states to work out their own approaches to general taxation for
                    educational purposes.
            Given the main theme, the essay by Peter Dobkin Hall is surely the gem of the collection. Hall
                    manages to trace pre-1787 regional differences in attitudes about the proper relation between the
                    state and private incorporation through the Northwest Ordinance and early 
                        Ohio
                     law into the charters of two of the state's private colleges. He caps the
                    journey with an analysis of how the fortunes of the two were shaped by the details of their
                    incorporation. He does this with such economy and grace that his essay alone is worth the modest
                    price of the volume.

                         Country, 1750â€“1850. By Donald A. Hutslar. (

               The Architecture of Migration is both an extension and a modification of the
                    author's 1977 monograph on The Log Architecture of 
                            Ohio
                        . Hutslar, curator of history with the 
                        Ohio
                     Historical Society, has used the intervening ten years to gather and interpret new
                    information on log buildings and their construction. His new book adds a significant chapter to an
                    understanding of Old Northwest practices.
            Hutslar focuses on log construction practices in the southern half of 
                        Ohio
                     between 1775 and 1825. His central thesis is that building forms, designs, and
                    techniques are the result of particular environmental, economic, occupational, and cultural
                    influences. The study begins with a mining of travelers' sketches, missionary reports, and
                    other published works to detail the log building practices of Indians, frontiersmen, trappers and
                    traders, and various militia groups. The lack of verifiable physical evidence and reliable
                    accountings of constructions prior to the Indian wars prohibits positing many generalities on early
                    origins. Hutslar draws upon his command of population movements and ethnic typologies, however, to
                    suggest possible cross-cultural borrowings and to explain some of the descriptions of syncretic
                    buildings described in early documentations. He demonstrates, for example, that 
                        Delaware
                     Indians learned log construction practices through contact with Finnish, French,
                    German, and Moravian Christian groups and then melded these new techniques to traditional long house
                    and council house designs.
            
            Hutslar devotes most of the text to the log dwellings built by the first waves of white settlers.
                    Material and historical distinctions between cabins and houses guide much of this discussion.
                    Builders erected cabins as temporary structures in frontier areas between the end of the Indian wars
                    and the War of 1812. The structures were characterized by unhewn logs, ribbed and clapboarded roofs,
                    and stick chimneys. Log houses were the more permanent structures associated with long-term
                    settlement. They were built with hewn logs and display some of the marks of a settled population,
                    including rafters and shingles, cellars, brick and stone chimneys, plastered walls, and glass
                    windows. The log house is Hutslar's specialty and the book's most detailed
                    discussions center around the more than four hundred houses documented by the author. Chapters on
                    construction time and cost, tools and materials, design, construction practices, and finishing and
                    furnishings provide a holistic portrait of building patterns. The author's comprehensive
                    knowledge is reflected in comments ranging from the appropriateness of different notching patterns
                    according to the size of the logs to New World evolutions of the felling ax's design to
                    provide more accurate felling strokes.
            The overall excellent quality of The Architecture of Migration is marred only by a
                    few stylistic shortcomings related to the reader's access to the close to two hundred fifty
                    photographs, drawings, and other visual materials. The illustrations are gathered in six groups
                    spaced throughout the text and thus are not immediately tied to specific arguments. This printing
                    compromise is not balanced by a sufficient amount of textual references to the relevant photographs.
                    Further, the only index to the illustrations is based on the geographic locations of the depicted
                    structures, thus benefiting the county historian more than any other group of readers. Apart from
                    these stylistic problems and a few questionable generalizations on ethnic design differences based
                    on still-limited data, this book is an apt testimony to Hutslar's extensive knowledge and
                    long study of 
                        Ohio
                    's log buildings.

            Since at least the days of Frederick Jackson Turner nearly a century ago, many American historians
                    have found it useful to think of the 
                        United States
                     as breaking into a series of "regions" or
                    "sections." This collection of twelve essays and a general introduction  accepts that point of view, yet does not do so uncritically.
                    The book focuses attention on comparative history; editor James H. Madison has encouraged the
                    authors, all of whom live in the "heartland," to define differences as well as
                    similarities among the twelve states that are generally regarded as the "Midwest."
                    Even as the book recognizes diversity, however, a problem lurks within its pages: should states that
                    differ from one another in so many important ways be regarded as parts of one region?
            Diversity or complexity is the theme that appears most frequently in the book. Lawrence O.
                    Christensen, for example, emphasizes 
                        Missouri
                    's complexity and suggests that this makes it "the most American of
                    the midwestern states" (p. 105). Cullom Davis argues that 
                        Illinois
                     is the most diverse of the heartland states and thus "the most representative
                    among all fifty states of the national whole" (p. 129).
            Diversity or complexity appears throughout the book as a feature of the entire region as well as a
                    fact of varying importance in each of the individual states. Note the contrast between the politics
                    of 
                        Minnesota
                     as described by Annette Atkins and the politics of 
                        Ohio
                     as interpreted by R. Douglas Hurt. Compare John D. Buenker's interpretation of 
                        Wisconsin
                     as "Model" and Martha 
                        Mitchell
                     Bigelow's view of 
                        Michigan
                     as "A State in the Vanguard" with David B. Danbom's and
                    Herbert T. Hoover's provocative conception of North and South Dakota as backward. Consider
                    Dorothy Schwieder's portrayal of 
                        Iowa
                     as "The Middle Land" in a region that varies from east to west in
                    degrees of industrialization and urbanization.
            The disagreements among the authors, such as that between Christensen and Davis, reflect the
                    difficulty of doing comparative history, especially when the focus is on a concept as hard to
                    measure as complexity. Frederick C. Luebke, whose essay on 
                        Nebraska
                     makes many comparisons, seems especially alive to the difficulties in the approach and
                    defines a way of employing it.
            Although the book raises fresh doubts about the existence of a reality that should be labeled
                    Midwest, the skills of the editor and the authors strengthen one's conviction as to the
                    value of comparative history.

            In The State and the Non-Public School, Lloyd P. Jorgenson, professor emeritus of
                    education at the University of 
                        Missouri
                    -
                        Columbia
                    ,  provides an engaging and historically competent
                    analysis of important but complex issues that deal with church-state relationships in American
                    education. The author seriously questions the widely accepted belief that the origins of the policy
                    of prohibiting public aid to non-public schools are constitutional. For Jorgenson, the historical
                    origins of this prohibition occurred during the common school movement of the nineteenth century. In
                    his well-researched and articulate narrative, the author develops his thesis that the common school
                    movement was inextricably enmeshed with evangelical Protestantism. The movement for common schools
                    also received support from nativist groups, such as the Know-Nothings, which manifested decided
                    anti-Catholic attitudes.
            For the hundred years from 1825 to 1925 that constitutes the time-frame for Jorgenson's
                    analysis, he focuses on the two issues that comprised the school question: public aid to non-public
                    schools, and religious observances in public schools. These two historically controversial issues
                    continue to generate conflict today. The book's ten chapters provide a historical analysis
                    of how contending religious factions defined these two issues and how the state, at the federal and
                    state levels, attempted to resolve these issues.
            Jorgenson's persuasive narrative, supported by extensive documentation from primary and
                    secondary sources, presents a tightly reasoned argument. He contends public funds were used to aid
                    voluntary schools in the colonial and early national periods. The common school movement, 1830-1860,
                    was shaped and heavily influenced by the clergy of evangelical Protestant denominations. These
                    clergymen not only were advocates of common schools but also served as state superintendents,
                    textbook authors, and teacher educators. While the presence of Protestant clergy in key positions in
                    the common school movement has long been part of the conventional history of American education,
                    Jorgenson highlights their often anti-Catholic ideology. Believing that Catholicism was inimical to
                    American republican institutions, these clergymen sought to curb the growth of Catholic schools by
                    denying them public funds. This anti-Catholic attitude was reinforced by the nativist Know-Nothing
                    movement and the success of the American party in state elections. By 1860, spokesmen for the
                    dominant Protestant culture had defined the school question to mean that no public aid should be
                    provided to non-public schools and that Bible-reading should be observed in the public schools which
                    as institutions were to exemplify the milieu and moral values of Protestantism.
            With their numbers increased by immigrants, Roman Catholics resisted the Protestant resolution of the
                    school question. Catholics, led by many of their bishops, pressed for public funds for parochial
                    schools and protested against Protestant religious observances in public schools.
            
            Jorgenson then describes the hardening of the Protestant and Catholic positions on the school
                    question that generated political conflicts and legal controversies in 
                        New York
                     in 1842, 
                        Philadelphia
                     in 1844, and 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1869. This description is followed by an analysis of Protestant and nativist efforts
                    to enact compulsory attendance laws in 
                  Massachusetts, Wisconsin
               , and 
                        Illinois
                     that were designed to compel attendance in public schools. The concluding chapter
                    examines attempts in 
                        Oregon
                    , overturned by the Supreme Court in the Pierce Case in 1925, to require all children to
                    attend public schools.
            On historical grounds, Jorgenson also questions the "incorporation theory," by
                    which the Supreme Court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment made the provisions of the First
                    Amendment binding on the states. The "incorporation theory" was the basis of the
                    Court's decision in the Schempp Case (1963) that struck down state laws permitting or
                    requiring Bible-reading and prayer in public schools.
            For Jorgenson, the consequences of the history of the state and the non-public schools are that these
                    schools are not only not funded but are virtually ignored by the state. Furthermore, the public
                    schools are devoid of religious observances even for those who desire them. These historically
                    derived consequences are exceptions to policies in other western countries that support and
                    supervise voluntary schools and permit relipous observances in state schools.
            Jorgenson's book is highly recommended not only for historians of education but for students
                    of educational policy as well. However, the title is somewhat misleading in that the book examines
                    only non-public religious schools rather than private schools in general. With the exception of his
                    commentary on Lester F. Ward's rationale for public education, Jorgenson's
                    preoccupation with religious issues excludes consideration of the social and economic forces that
                    are also pertinent to the history of the common school. The book contains a valuable bibliographical
                    essay.

                     who internationalized the antebellum attack on slavery and
                    racism. Now in a well-crafted sequel, Blackett traces the efforts of six people whose careers
                    spanned antislavery, the war, and Reconstruction. Included are three familiar individuals, James W.
                    C. Pennington and William and Ellen Craft, and three of the unacclaimed, Robert 
                        Campbell
                    , John Sella Martin, and William Howard Day. Distinguished by diverse backgrounds,
                    experiences, and approaches, together their lives illustrate nothing so well as "that
                    America has never taken kindly to those who challenged its racial hegemony" (p. xii).
            Material this rich defies easy generalization. Fugitives Pennington, the Crafts, and Martin fended
                    off their own recaptures before returning South to work among freed blacks. 
                        Campbell
                    , an educated Jamaican, finally settled in Lagos after his frustrating encounter with
                    America's two-tiered racial hierarchy. Day, originally a New Yorker, was a skilled printer
                    and Oberlin graduate whose 
                        Cleveland
                     residence made him suspicious of eastern dominance. The issues of colonization,
                    education, religion, African redemption, temperance, perfectionism, self-improvement, nationalism,
                    and free trade touched them all. Emigration proved the thorniest issue. 
                        Campbell
                    , for example, was a Pan-Africanist, and the only one who did not participate in the
                    Reconstruction experiment. A staunch anti-colonizationist, Day temporarily joined emigrationists to
                    use them as a divisive tool against the eastern establishment. Pennington and Martin waffled on
                    emigration out of strong missionary impulses. All promoted education; Day and Ellen Craft were the
                    most tireless and effective, particularly in their postwar efforts. Martin and William Craft figured
                    especially prominently in the free trade movement, promoting legitimate trade in cotton alongside
                    southern boycotts.
            Resilient, shrewd, optimistic, and fallible, all six consistently exhibited faith in progress and an
                    understanding that emancipation was no panacea. The examination of Reconstruction activities, one of
                    the book's particular strengths, exemplifies how the compromise between self-preservation
                    and self-presentation was made ubiquitous. Few, after all, were better-placed to see the
                    contradictions of nineteenth-century society, and the very complexities against which they fought
                    sometimes ensnared them too. Successes entailed enormous personal sacrifices and painful
                    intellectual isolation. Historians need more sensitive books like this one to better appreciate the
                    wide range of people on these critical nineteenth century social and political barricades.

            Clifford Edward Clark, Jr., has produced a valuable study of the ideal and the reality of the single
                    family home in America. Drawing on a diverse range of sources including architectural plan books,
                    advice manuals, magazines, pamphlets, and recent secondary literature on women and families, Clark
                    delineates the changes in housing styles from 1800 to 1960 and links them to shifting expectations
                    of middle-class family life, to demographic trends, and to economic conditions. The different styles
                    of homes are illustrated through a masterful selection of photographs, architectural plans, and
                    advertisements.
            Professional architects, Clark explains, have not been able to exert much influence over housing
                    designs. Local carpenters in the mid-1800s and builders and developers in the Gilded Age and
                    twentieth century have dominated home construction, and they have built according to popular tastes
                    and prevailing middle-class ideologies. Some of the most interesting shifts in these popular
                    attitudes and housing styles occurred between the 1870s and 1920s. For those familiar with
                    nineteenth century women's and family history, Clark covers familiar territory, but he
                    skillfully connects the nineteenth century glorification of the middle-class family and the ideology
                    of true womanhood with the evolution of popular housing styles. The artistic ideal, which began as
                    the belief that women had an idealistic and expressive nature, became, according to Clark, an end in
                    itself. "Houses, earlier considered a personal statement of the owners' hopes and
                    aspirations, now became individual works of art. In the hope of making a more intensely personal
                    comment about their inhabitants, the structures became even more wildly eclectic" (p. 129).
                    Ornate and cluttered interiors and exteriors became the Victorian norm.
            Yet new critics emerged even as the artistic ideal triumphed, and by the end of the century,
                    "the home as a treasure house had begun to pass its prime" (p. 130). By 1910, a
                    new family ideal which stressed "naturalness and conviviality, openness and
                    informality" had replaced the Victorian ideals (p. 132). By the beginning of World War I,
                    the Victorian aesthetic had virtually disappeared and had been replaced by a new emphasis on
                    simplicity inside and outside the home. Functional bungalow houses, the Frank Lloyd Wright 
                        Prairie
                     School designs, and a revival of the Colonial and Tudor styles all were evidence of the
                    new importance attached to honesty, naturalness, and organic unity in the design and placement of
                    homes. The bungalow, which was simple, functional, and relatively inexpensive, was the most popular
                    housing style of the teens, twenand  thirtiesâ€”a
                    "house with which middle class Americans could easily identify" (p. 192).
            A decline in home construction during the Depression and World War II meant an unprecedented demand
                    for houses in the postwar period. Architects and builders recognized the need to focus on
                    "practical questions of size, efficiency, and cost" (p. 198). The ranch house
                    replaced the bungalow as the most popular housing style, and sprawling new suburbs with
                    mass-produced houses developed throughout the country. Americans who had come of age during the
                    Depression and World War II, and who were now reproducing themselves at an unprecedented rate,
                    identified with the new housing ideals that stressed efficiency, convenience, consumption, leisure,
                    and children. Despite social criticism that warned about a homogenized society living in
                    mass-produced suburban homes, middle-class Americans seemed happy with their homes.
            Clark concludes that the old ideal of the home as a protective place for the family became even
                    stronger in the twentieth century. More than anything else, he believes, middle-class Americans have
                    sought "to create a safe environment in which to live and bring up their children"
                    (p. 242). He explains that the uniformity and narrow range of choices do not bother middle-class
                    Americans because they have "always desired the reassurance that comes from shared
                    standards for behavior â€¦" (p. 242). The single-family home has, from the
                    beginning of the nineteenth century, been a tenacious symbol of the middle-class quest for security.
            This important study, which synthesizes an impressive amount of information, provides valuable
                    insights into American values and behavior. The American Family Home is not a
                    pathbreaking study in terms of new material in architectural history, material culture, family
                    history, or women's history, but by drawing all of these areas together, Clark has written
                    an illuminating and stimulating overview of housing and middle-class culture.

               Houses and Homes: Exploring Their History. By Barbara J. Howe, Dolores A.

            This handy volume is packed with information. It begins with careful definitions of the various terms
                    commonly misused in restoration and preservation literature. It clarifies the language used in the
                    various Acts of Congress, and explains what is allowed and  what
                    is not. The authors then go on to discuss the reasons for trying to determine the history of a house
                    or structure and its architectural significance. The suggested readings at the end of each chapter
                    are works familiar to the professional restorationist and worthy of the reader's perusal.
                    This is especially true of the later technical chapters.
            The first topic of discussion is the home's setting in its geographical area, town, and
                    neighborhood. Landscaping is important. If any evidence remains from the original setting, it can be
                    significant in pinpointing both the date of construction of the original house and the national
                    origin of the builder. Houses and Homes illustrates the points with well-known
                    examples and, in later chapters, with maps, drawings, and photographs.
            From the setting, the authors move briskly to the exterior of the home itself, then the interior,
                    with some surprising clues to finding the original structure beneath the remodeled present state.
                    The ends of removed lumber, backs of mantels, and even cabinets often are numbered. At the end of
                    the chapter are a number of suggested sources for information heretofore unexplored. Libraries,
                    archives, tax records, plat books, old newspapers, and court and census records all assist the
                    researcher in finalizing the history of the house. One surprise is the checking of law suits,
                    particularly those concerning boundaries and non-payment of fees.
            The authors suggest that oral and visual sources of information should be thoroughly documented,
                    since "old-timers" may glorify or "mis-remember" just how it
                    really was. But the measuring of lumber, the type of glass, the roof material and style, the style
                    of brick or way in which stone was laid, all add to the body of knowledge about an old structure.
                    There are many good suggestions for the handling of this phase of the search, and the reader will
                    find the line drawings clear and easy to interpret. It is interesting to note that there are whole
                    areas of houses bought from catalogs and shipped by rail to a nearby town, then by mule wagon to the
                    site. Once on the site, simple directions were followed by a house builder or even the owner, until
                    the house was complete. Early examples of the catalogs exist in libraries and museums and make
                    fascinating reading.
            While there does not seem to be any particular style or type of house developed in or native to
                    Indiana, careful observation shows the influence of those who migrated from the East, bringing their
                    ideas and tastes with them.
            Perhaps the greatest contribution the authors have made is the wealth and diversity of source
                    material. To provide this for the entire country within the confines of 168 pages shows restraint
                    and an insistence upon excellence seldom found in volumes of this type.  It is to be highly complimented. Houses and Homes is
                    well worth its cost and the time it takes to read it.

            By the character of America James A. Ward means "a distinctive aura that envelopes the 
                        United States
                     and its people" (p. 3), an aura that is made up of myths and images, as well
                    as reality. What Americans thought about the railroads was both the product of that aura and
                    contributed to it. Ward's book is a series of essays, each of which examines a body of
                    railway literature that illustrates an aspect of that exchange.
            The essays fall into two groups. The first comprises three-quarters of the text and covers the 1820s
                    to the 1840s, when Ward sees the railroads as projecting an image of national unity for the
                    fledgling 
                        United States
                    . The second set of essays concerns the period from the 1850s to the passage of the
                    Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, a time of rapid growth of the railway network and, on the political
                    level, of sectional conflict, civil war, and reconstruction. In this period Ward finds railroad
                    promoters and executives abandoning the image of national unity for one of large, competitive
                    companies as corporate states with the attributes of political entities. The incompatibility of the
                    latter with a politically reunited nation in the 1880s contributed to federal regulation of
                    interstate commerce.
            The first essays are especially appealing, for here Ward deals with subjects that are less familiar
                    than the "robber baron" image of latter nineteenth century railroad leaders. For
                    instance, a chapter on "Taming the Iron Horse" traces early railroad
                    promoters' use of the locomotive as "a metaphor for what they thought Americans
                    were and what they were becoming" (p. 28). Another chapter concerns the image of the
                    railroad as peace-keeper, given the potential ease of military transport as a deterrent to enemy
                    invasion. A third chapter examines the effect of "railroad time" on American mores
                    and mentalitÃ©. All chapters of the book repay a careful reading, but
                    the book as a whole fails to hang together.
            For the early period, Ward draws his material very largely from the promotional literature of
                    railroad publicists. Thus he usually sees the railroads from outside the owners' point of
                    view. This leads him into error when he moves from the mythical to the real  world, as on page 70, where he avers that most early railroad leaders
                    "believed that they were furthering the national, state, or municipal good first and
                    foremost; they considered any personal returns in such a speculative security as
                    lagniappe." The letters of Erastus Coming, John Murray Forbes, and other shareholders in
                    the first railroads prove that those early investors sought personal profit as avidly as later ones.
                    Similarly, Ward's claim that early railroad promoters "positively blanched at any
                    mention that their projects might be weapons designed for use in urban commercial wars" (p.
                    15) would certainly have been modified by a more extensive appeal to local sources, including
                    newspapers and merchants' correspondence.
            More damaging to acceptance of Ward's thesis that there was a distinct change in the
                    myth-making of railroad promoters in the 1850s is the author's switch from chief dependence
                    upon promotional literature before that decade to a wider survey of sources, including company
                    records and the correspondence of railroad executives, from that time onward. Was early railroad
                    imagery markedly different from that of later decades? Doubtless it was, but is Ward's
                    perceived difference a valid one, or, rather, does it reflect the limitations of his sources? This
                    question remains unanswered.

            A statement on the dust jacket of this volume serves as a succinct but accurate summary of what is
                    inside: "John F. Stover packs this narrative history with careful scholarship and colorful
                    description which will appeal to the railroad buff and the professional historian, as well as to any
                    reader who wishes to travel with the â€˜Mother of Railroads' through an exciting
                    period in 
                        United States
                     History." Such, of course, is to be expected of a writer with the credentials
                    of Stover, professor emeritus of American history at Purdue University and one of the foremost
                    American railroad historians. As an experienced practitioner of the art of culling through mountains
                    of data to distill the essence, Stover knows how to find something of interest to each of his
                    several "audiences," and at the same time how to come forth with a presentation
                    that has the ring of authority.
            
            Without doubt, the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     has been one of the great American railroads. About 10 percent of its trackage
                    crisscrossed the state of Indiana. Its long history has so many themes and subthemes that any writer
                    dealing with it is obliged to make delicate choices as to how to make best use of the four hundred
                    or so pages allotted to the finished product. Stover pretty well sticks to a chronological format,
                    generally compartmentalizing his narrative around the two dozen presidencies of the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad Company since its inception in 1827. Such a commitment to chronology might
                    have its drawbacks because it can give a uniform blandness to all elements of a long and diversified
                    story. But the history of the B&O Railroad is replete with the sort of information that in
                    the right hands can be moulded into engaging tales. Examples of this are Stover's depiction
                    of the landmark steps during the B&O's infancy, the unique role this railroad was
                    obliged to play during the American Civil War, its perennial competition with other major trunk
                    lines heading westward, its status under the federal government's developing regulatory
                    policies, the tapering off of business during the 1930s and the World War II resurgence, and the
                    B&O's eventual absorption in 1964 by the "Chessie System."
                    Inherent in such episodes are drama, paradox, elation, and sometimes a note of sadness.
            An important feature of the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad story is its effective leadershipâ€”presidents and other top
                    officials who typically were selected on the basis of the most needed managerial requirements at any
                    given time. Thus in the course of a century and a half the company was headed by pioneer
                    entrepreneurs, capable engineers, insightful traffic managers, outstanding financiers, and, almost
                    always, superior promoters. It may, in fact, have been this variety and quality of leadership that
                    made the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad the unusual enterprise it became. When to extend or refurbish the line, when
                    to replace rolling stock, when to encourage and when to curtail certain forms of hauling business,
                    when to pay stock dividends: these are the kinds of questions that railroad executives have
                    routinely had to deal with, and, as Stover's account strongly suggests, those identified
                    with the B&O over a period of many decades had unusual success in these matters.
            Stover has had access to the major 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad manuscript collections, including a complete set of the company's
                    annual reports. His narrative, notes, and appendixes reflect the extensive use of these important
                    primary sources, as well as a wide variety of secondary materials. Throughout the book Stover has
                    inserted a series of traffic and financial tables based on contemporary statistical information;
                    these not only help convey the story of the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad but are useful for comparisons with other railroads. Appendixes provide
                    listings of B&O presidents, the road's mileage by year (13 miles in 1830; 5,201
                    miles in  1980), annual figures on passenger and freight
                    revenue, operating ratio and dividends, rolling stock, and employee data (numbers and compensation).
                    There are several maps, properly placed to show the development of the 
                        Baltimore
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     Railroad system. Finally, there are about a hundred photos illustrating evolutionary
                    trends in locomotives, freight and passenger cars, stations, bridges, and other elements of the
                    railroad's massive operations. Pictures of most of the presidents are
                    includedâ€”demonstrating that hairstyles, beards, mustaches, etc., of railroad executives
                    over the years altered about as much as did the appearance of the railroad's equipment.

               The Eagle's Nest: Natural History and American Ideas,
                    1812â€“1842. By Charlotte M. Porter. (University, Ala.: University of 
                        Alabama

            Contemporary historians of American natural history traditionally exhibit a parochialism that
                    typified students of American flora and fauna more than a century and a half ago. Where
                    nineteenth-century students once reflected a patriotic zeal to enhance the natural possessions of a
                    new nation exploring the interior of a new continent, contemporary scholars often incline to
                    national or regional glorification in a catalog of heroic figures and deeds. What with a philosopher
                    president who challenged the theories of the great Buffon in his Notes on the State of 
                            Virginia
                        ; with a William Bartram, a farmer's son, captivating the literati
                    with his adventures to 
                        Florida
                    ; with a John James Audubon, a frontiersman, instructing the world with his paintbrush,
                    and with that naively optimistic "boatload of knowledge" disembarking on the 
                        Wabash
                    , there are stories enough to isolate naturalists and historians from the general trends
                    that are the real stuff of history.
            Charlotte Porter, author of The Eagle's Nest, is exceptionally well versed
                    in the local events, figures, and publications in American natural history between the Revolution
                    and the 1840s. By the end of her account a general pattern emerges of the dozens of scientific
                    explorers who collected, published, and painted their way across the Appalachians, into the Old
                    Northwest, and up the Missouri River to the 
                        Columbia
                     basin. The book takes its primary title from an observation written by Titian Ramsey
                    Peale when he accompanied Thomas Say on an expedition to the 
                        Missouri
                    . It reflects the nationalistic sentiments in Peale's day and perhaps  Porter's judgment about the misdirected efforts of
                    forty years of natural history. The title is doubly poignant, for Peale had written of "a
                    goose in peaceable possession of an eagle's nest" (p. 10).
            Although the book is not chronological in its organization, the early chapters concentrate on the
                    precedents set by Bartram, Jefferson, Alexander Wilson, and Charles Willson Peale, each of whom
                    argued for the uniqueness of the American flora and fauna and for the need of naturalists to break
                    free from the bonds of European dominance in explaining the American scene. Since the Linnaean
                    system restricted the search for a natural system of classification and the Buffonian theory of
                    degeneration insulted the inhabitants of the western hemisphere, Americans had to strike out on
                    their own and interpret their world. The two foci of this parochial American natural history became
                    the Academy of Natural Sciences in 
                        Philadelphia
                     and the revamped village of 
                        New Harmony
                     purchased from the Rappites by Robert Owen. The intellectual bonds between the two
                    centers were forged by William Maclure, a wealthy merchant who was impressed by Owen's
                    brand of socialism and who became the patron of a generation of frontier naturalists. Thomas Say,
                    Charles Alexander LeSueur, Gerard Troost, Titian Peale, and Owen's sons, Robert Dale and
                    David Dale, all spent time pursuing natural history subjects while based in 
                        New Harmony
                    . Only Say stayed for an extended period when he became a leader in another one of
                    Maclure's ventures, the Education Society, and when over a number of years he attempted to
                    print his Conchology. Other naturalists, many of them from Europe, such as Thomas
                    Nuttall and Constantine Rafinesque, were also attracted to the American frontier and attempted to
                    describe and interpret the local flora and fauna.
            Porter makes it clear that the efforts of the field naturalists were limited in scientific value. The
                    studies were infused with a Baconian approach; descriptions were confined to external structures and
                    form, and there were no attempts to establish biological relationships between individual types.
                    Because the field naturalists did not have access to European collections and scholarship, their
                    classifications were often duplicative of previous efforts and unnecessarily multiplicative of
                    species. Their illustrations, however, were often superlative and "provided surrogate
                    collections" where cabinets did not exist and a substitute for type specimens under
                    circumstances where collections were subject to destruction. This frontier natural history also
                    reflected continental views on education mediated through Jefferson, Pestalozzi, and Maclure.
            By the 1840s the two generations that had popularized these methods and ideals were challenged on a
                    number of fronts. Government sponsored explorations, such as the Wilkes expedition and national
                    geological surveys, supplanted the free wheeling independent researches of the frontier naturalists.
                    It was symptomatic  of this transition that Titian
                    Peale's report on the birds and mammals he collected and painted while on the Wilkes
                    expedition became superseded by a second report by John Cassin, who had not been on the expedition
                    but who was authorized to use Peale's drawings. On the second front, botanists led by 
                        New York
                    's John Torrey and 
                        Harvard
                    's Asa Gray turned toward Europe for their professional standards. Their new
                    approach to taxonomy and the shift from wilderness collecting to herbarium studies is epitomized by
                    Gray. Traveling west only in 1877 after he had become the undisputed leader of American botany, he
                    collected "from a railroad car which carried his wife, a cook, a picnic table with a white
                    tablecloth, and other accoutrements of civilized life" (p. 157).
            Porter's story is a fascinating one and provides a general pattern in which to place the
                    episodes and details of early frontier natural history. At times, however, the author gets so
                    involved with the particularsâ€”many of which are spirited and enchantingâ€”that
                    the reader easily loses the central point. Considering that illustrations play such an important
                    role in the natural history of the period and that Porter describes some at length, more
                    reproductions might have been included for the reader's benefit.

               To Their Own Soil: Agriculture in the Antebellum North. By Jeremy Atack and Fred
                    Bateman. (Ames: 
                        Iowa
                     State University Press, 1987. Pp. xi, 322. Tables, figures, appendixes, notes,
                    bibliography, index. $29.95.)
            Jeremy Atack and Fred Bateman have produced a valuable addition to the literature on northern
                    agriculture during the late antebellum period. A very detailed analysis of a sample of farms from
                    the 1860 census manuscripts, the book is more a statistical account of the economic characteristics
                    of northern farms and farmers than a descriptive survey of northern agriculture in the tradition of
                    Percy Wells Bidwell and John I. Falconer or Clarence H. Danhof. As such, the book does not make
                    light bedtime reading, but it nonetheless rewards the reader with some important insights about the
                    character of northern farming.
            Drawing on a sample of northern farmers compiled by Bateman and James Foust, the authors examine the
                    demographic profile of the farm population (family size, fertility, and migration), the distribution
                    of wealth (found to be relatively equal), the costs of farm enterprises, crop yields and labor
                    productivity, the self-sufficiency question, and agrarian profitability. Some of the findings  (e.g., fertility was higher in the Midwest than the Northeast)
                    are conventional and unsurprising, while others (e.g., farming was more profitable in the Northeast
                    than the Midwest) are perhaps more novel and controversial.
            All farms in 102 randomly selected townships are included in the sample. Some areas are very clearly
                    overrepresented, while others are not adequately included. A calculation taken from page 112 and the
                    published census shows that farms in the sample were 4.39 percent of the 
                        Kansas
                     total, measured by "cash value"; by contrast, in 
                        Ohio
                    , the sampled farms had only 0.26 percent of the state's cash value,
                    one-sixteenth as much. Moreover, the selected 
                        Ohio
                     townships are from counties with below average productivity by most measures. While
                    over 30 percent of the farms are in Indiana (making the work a reliable description of Indiana
                    farming), 
                        Massachusetts
                     is not represented at all. Since some of the key statistics measured vary dramatically
                    between states, this introduces potential distortions in the conclusions.
            The possible impact of the sampling problem is hinted at in the discussion of profitability. The rate
                    of return on northern farms where the results are weighted by farm capital is estimated at 12.1
                    percent (p. 250); where sampled farms are simply weighted equally, the return is estimated at 7.1
                    percent (p. 257). In either case, the authors conclude (probably erroneously) that agriculture was
                    much less profitable than manufacturing, and that farmer behavior was still governed perhaps as much
                    by a Jeffersonian romantic ideal as by strict economic rationality.
            Despite these reservations about sampling and some undiscussed estimation procedures, the book on
                    balance materially increases knowledge of antebellum northern agriculture, and is accordingly must
                    reading for American agricultural historians and students of Indiana history.

               Conspiracy of Knaues. By Dee 
                        Brown
                    . (
                        New York
                    : Henry Holt and Company, 1986. Pp. 392. $17.95.)
            Treason, espionage, and conspiracy against the state are activities best conducted without leaving a
                    detailed documentary record, and it might be argued therefore that fiction is better equipped than
                    history to explore the psychology of the marginal characters who engage in such work. W. Somerset
                    Maugham's Ashenden stories, for example, are widely regarded as the best things ever
                    written on espionage.
            
            Dee 
                        Brown
                    's historical novel about the Northwest conspiracy of Copperheads during the
                    Civil War probably owes its largest intellectual debt to another writer of fiction, John LeCarre,
                    whose disillusioned look at spying forever destroyed the world of Ian Fleming as anything but cinema
                    fantasy, and rather campy fantasy at that. 
                        Brown
                    's heroine and narrator, double agent Belle Rutledge, observes at a secret
                    Copperhead meeting, "I saw no lion, not even a tiger among that gathering of deceivers,
                    beguilers, tricksters, and liars" (p. 340). 
                        Brown
                    's book also partakes of the post-Viet Nam era's disillusioned view of
                    warfare: "More of us lied and cheated because of the war than performed brave deeds, I can
                    assure you," says Belle near the end of the book. "It turned honest men into
                    thieves, good women into bad. It turned thousands of young men under the sod, severing half a
                    century from their prospects of life, or left thousands more of them armless, legless, or
                    eyeless" (p. 381).
            
               Conspiracy of Knaves is a competent historical novel. It eschews the obligatory
                    heavy breathing and bodice-ripping of its more degenerate cousins in the genre. There are few gross
                    violations of Victorian language and intellectual assumptions. And 
                        Brown
                     takes the sensible view that there were very few disloyal people in the North.
            Yet there really is no reason to read this book. The history is more quickly accessible elsewhere, in
                    the work of Frank L. Klement, for example. There is far, far better fiction available. And the book
                    fails to deliver the crucial substance: real psychological insight into treason or espionage. Conspiracy of Knaves puts the reader no closer to understanding disloyalty in the
                    Civil War than its little-known ancestor, Harold Frederic's novel, The
                        Copperhead, published in 1893. In fact, despite its sentimentality, Frederic's
                    depiction of the hardheaded Democratic partisan farmer in upstate 
                        New York
                     probably renders a more useful and accurate picture.
