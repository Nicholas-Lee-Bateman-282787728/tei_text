            <p>The Indiana Asbury University, which in 1884 became DePauw University, was established in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1837. Its original charter authorized its Joint Board of Trustees and
                        Visitors<hi rend="sup">1</hi> to appoint such professors and instructors as might be necessary
                    to offer proper instruction "in the learned professions" as well as in the arts
                    and sciences.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> It was naturally impossible to start a complete university
                    program at once. A start was made with an "ABC," or primary, school in the spring
                    of 1837, followed by a preparatory department in the fall of that year; and by the year 1839-1840 a
                    four-year college program was in operation. During this same academic year the Trustees appointed a
                    committee to inquire into the expediency of establishing a "professorship of
                        law."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> In 1847 the Trustees started preparations for an
                    "Agricultural Professorship" and had an agent at work collecting money for the

            <p>It was indeed high time to give attention to medical education in Indiana. The Old Northwest had a
                    reputation as a land of cholera, ague, malaria, and numerous fevers.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> An
                    "enormous amount of quack medicines" was consumed through the "credulous
                    confidence of our physic-loving people," said Dr. John S. Bobbs in 1849;<hi rend="sup">6</hi> and most of these concoctions, commented his contemporary, Dr. Robert Curran, were compounds
                    of cheap whiskey with dirty molasses covering the taste of the drugs, "generally the refuse
                    and sweepings of old warehouses."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Some of the doctors were pure
                    quacks, with no training whatever. The majority had undergone apprentice training which Professor
                    Buley describes: "A young man ‘read medicine’ with some local doctor,
                    rolled his pills, mixed his powders, and took care of the horses. After a time he was ready to
                    doctor on his own."<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In addition, there were some who had supplemented
                    their apprenticeship with a term or two in one of the few medical schools available.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> At best, physicians were not well trained, and one book on frontier medical practices is
                    dedicated "to the Pioneer Doctor who boldly faced the wilderness; and to the Pioneer who
                    boldly faced the Doctor."<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Attempts to improve medical training were being made gradually in Indiana as well as in other
                    midwestern areas. A Medical Society of the State of Indiana, with ill-defined power to regulate
                    admission to the profession, was provided for by law in 1819 and reorganized in 1825.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Supplementing eastern medical publications, which had little circulation in the
                    Midwest, a <hi rend="i">Western Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences</hi> began publication
                    in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>
                    </placeName> University School of Medicine, which had begun to function in 1842. Within its first
                    eight years of existence it enrolled 565 students and graduated 127. By the time Asbury's
                    medical college was opened, however, the Medical College of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was opening. The college at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName> was "a product of the religious fervor and temperance agitation of the
                    time," classes were opened with prayer, and the study of anatomy was said to have been made
                    more interesting by an "occasional injection of Bible-reading." Tuition was free
                    for students who promised not to use liquor, tobacco, or profanity.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> The
                    Committee on Medical Education reported to the American Medical Association in 1849 that there were
                    thirty-eight medical schools in the country, including a few that had been projected but were not
                    actually in operation. Of these, half were in <placeName>

            </p>
            <p>On December 23, 1846, the Trustees of Indiana Asbury requested that Dr. D. J. Evens start an
                    investigation of the propriety of establishing a medical school and report to a later meeting of the
                        Trustees.<hi rend="sup">22</hi> In the following month an amendment to the charter was secured,

            <p>Plans for the medical school caught the attention of the Indiana Conference of the Methodist Church,
                    and that body, the original sponsor of Indiana Asbury, in its annual conference at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName> in October, 1848, recommended a called session of the Trustees as soon as possible to
                    select the location and proceed with the establishment of the medical school.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On November 1, 1848, the Trustees met, with some unnamed "medical gentlemen"
                    sitting with them, and agreed on the founding "of the Medical Department of this
                    University," to be located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> "in the name of the Indiana Central Medical College." "Seven
                    Chairs of Tuition" were listed, and men were elected to fill each of them. The Trustees
                    agreed that they would "not incur any pecuniary responsibilities in the establishment or
                    maintenance of said Medical College." The medical faculty was to have full power of
                    government and to fix tuition, length of sessions, and qualifications for graduation. The medical
                    faculty might temporarily fill vacancies on their staff, subject to approval by the Trustees. They
                    might by majority action also recommend vacation of any chair. Final action on the staff itself and
                    on all matters not specifically delegated to the medical staff was reserved to the Trustees. The
                    newly appointed faculty was instructed to meet later that month to fix the time for opening the
                    school and to transact any other necessary business.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would appear from these actions that instruction was to begin soon, but the minutes of the July,
                    1849, meeting of the Trustees indicate that there was confusion and delay. Since the meeting of
                    November, 1848, had been a called rather than a regular one, the Trustees in July, 1849,
                    "with a desire to remove the scruples of the most cautious," ratified and
                    confirmed their previous action, except in regard to the <list type="footnotes">

                    could act without the advice of the medical staff. They also straightened out some confusion
                    regarding one of the professors elected, and elected men to take the place of two who had
                        resigned.<hi rend="sup">27</hi>

            <p>Finally, a notice appeared in the <hi rend="i">Western Christian Advocate</hi> of August 8, 1849,
                    announcing the forthcoming opening of the Indiana Central Medical College. An accompanying editorial
                    called attention to its "eligible" location in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>—which was "destined to become an inland city of no small
                    size," was already connected by rail with the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>, and had

                    </placeName>, Indiana. The fact that political activity of the state centered at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> would make possible good contacts with members of the supreme court, legislature, and
                    other officials. The editorial continued by calling attention to the acknowledged ability and high
                    moral tone of the faculty, men who were not materialists but who would "inculcate the great
                    principles of Christianity, so far as pertains to their connection with medical science."
                    Supervision by the Trustees of Indiana Asbury, it added, would further guarantee the high quality of
                    the first medical school to be established by any Methodist University.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>In similar vein the official Visitors to Indiana Asbury reported back to the Indiana Conference of
                    the Methodist Church in October the splendid prospects for the medical venture. They mentioned
                    "the general character of <placeName>

                    "long established experience in Medical Science and practice of at least a portion of the
                    gentlemen who compose the faculty of instruction." They urged members of the conference to

            <p>The faculty for 1848-1849 included: John S. Bobbs, dean, general and special anatomy; Robert Curran,

                    in February, 1850. During the year 1850-1851 there were forty-one students and eighteen graduates.
                    In the final year, 1851-1852, there were again forty-one students, with twelve graduates. Seven

            <p>A total of over one hundred different students attended during the three years Indiana Central
                    Medical College was in operation. Of the forty graduates, twenty-eight received their degrees after
                    only one year of study, ten after two years, and two after three years. At least twelve of them
                    served as surgeons or assistant surgeons in Indiana infantry or cavalry regiments during the Civil
                        War.<hi rend="sup">36</hi> Four of the students may be specially mentioned. Thaddeus M. Stevens,
                    who was one of the students who attended all three sessions, became in 1881 the first secretary and
                    executive officer of the Indiana State Board of Health, set up one of the first clinical

                    Central with its seven professors and a demonstrator of anatomy thus fit into the general pattern,
                    and the professorships were similar in nomenclature as well as in number to those of other schools.
                    Requirements as to admission, graduation, and fees also followed the general pattern.<hi rend="sup">41</hi> The student had to be at least twenty-one years old, of good moral character, and to
                    present evidence of having studied medicine and surgery not less than three years. Each student had
                    a physician as a "preceptor"; in only a few cases was the preceptor a member of
                    the faculty. To receive the M.D., the student was to take two courses of lectures in a medical
                    school, one of which had to be in Indiana Central Medical College. The catalogue noted, however,
                    that "having been respectably engaged in the practice of medicine four years …
                    will be regarded as equivalent to one course of lectures."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> The annual
                    sessions lasted about four months, starting in October, November, or December and continuing through

            <p>The announcement for 1850-1851 states not only that the curriculum was to "embrace every
                    subject usually taught in well conducted Medical Colleges," but also that there were
                    adequate aids in the form of drawings, models, specimens, apparatus, and instruments, as well as
                    frequent examinations. During the evenings, the announcement added, the "Demonstrator of
                    Anatomy will be in constant attendance in the dissecting rooms, to afford the necessary instructions
                    and demonstrations in Anatomy." Furthermore, "each professor will afford
                    opportunities to such students as may desire it, for clinical observations, both Medical and
                    Surgical, in their private practice."<hi rend="sup">44</hi> During December, 1851, a series

                    each instructor, making a total of $70 for the entire course. In addition there was a
                    matriculation fee of $5 and a charge of $5 for a "dissecting
                        ticket."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> By the second year "tickets of all the
                    instructors" were reduced to $56, and a graduation fee of $20 was
                    added. Boarding, it was stated, could be obtained for $2 to $2.25 per week,

                    copies of the addresses made at the opening of each of the three years during which the college
                    functioned, and there are also summaries of two addresses made at the commencements. Dean Bobbs made
                    the first opening address, in which he referred to the "cares, duties and
                    responsibilities" of the position in which he had been placed and called attention to the
                    need for more medical schools, especially for schools "domesticated" and brought
                    within the reach of all, so that there would no longer be any excuse for practitioners who had no
                    medical training. "Every day spent in storing the mind with the important practical truths
                    in the science of medicine," he asserted, "will as surely bring its reward as the
                    gentle shower of spring is succeeded by the golden fruits of autumn." He also referred to
                    the prestige that would accrue to graduates of a medical school affiliated with Indiana Asbury and
                    mentioned the obligation of Indiana Central Medical College to reflect honor on Asbury.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>

            <p>In the opening address the second year Dr. Curran referred to the success which had crowned the
                    efforts of the staff and expressed appreciation of "the strong interest manifested by the
                    intelligent members of our profession throughout our state and the surrounding borders." He
                    called attention to the necessity of educating physicians in reference "to those forms of
                    disease which they will be called on to combat," asserting that "no Eastern or
                    European school can furnish competent and complete instruction for a western practitioner."
                    Criticizing the "present absurd methods" used in liberal arts colleges
                    "by which the intellects are placed in a straight jacket and confined there," he
                    asserted that "three years pupilage in the office of an intelligent physician, including
                    public courses, is at least equal to three years at college" in cultivation and discipline
                    of the mind. As Dr. Bobbs had done the previous year, he assailed cheap nostrums,
                    homeopathy—"that cunningly devised fable," other new medical theories,
                    and especially that type of medical theory which was the basis of a group termed
                    "botanics." Members of this group, he asserted, traveled around the country
                    "with a good stock of braggadocia, cayenne pepper, lobelia and other course <hi rend="i">fodder</hi>, a cantering horse and a pair of pill-bags as large as a blacksmith's
                        bellows."<hi rend="sup">50</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 1851 address by Dr. Deming was largely a history of medical progress from the Greeks onward.
                    Deming disputed the allegation sometimes made that medicine "is last in the great race of
                    progress—that while all else travels with the velocity of the steam car, it has still its
                    snail-like pace." He too condemned homeopaths, eclectics, botanics, and others and went on
                    to assert that the interests of society demand well-educated and competent physicians.<hi rend="sup">51</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his address to the first graduates in 1850 Dr. Harrison urged professional industry and
                        integrity.<hi rend="sup">52</hi> In 1851 Professor Downey warned the young doctors that they
                    would often have to deal with "perturbed spirits" as well as diseased bodies. They
                    were advised to "enter into communion with the troubled spirit," leading it back
                    to God. A minister might well be called in to become, for the time being, an "assistant
                    physician." <list type="footnotes">

            <p>The Trustees met in July, 1852, with some of the medical professors present. They were informed that
                    the medical faculty had held no meeting since February, that two of the newly elected professors had
                    declined to serve, and that no building had been secured. They wavered between two committee
                    reports, one recommending suspension of the school and the other stating that
                    "notwithstanding the difficulties that lie in the way … [the Trustees] will give
                    the department their most vigorous support." Finally the Trustees voted that
                    "lectures in the Medical department of the University be suspended until such time as means
                    can be obtained for the erection of suitable buildings." A committee was appointed to take
                    charge of the apparatus and equipment, and Professor Downey was authorized to sell whatever
                    equipment "would be likely to injure by keeping." Downey himself was re-elected to
                    the faculty of Asbury, this time as professor of mathematics.<hi rend="sup">56</hi> In 1855 the

                    that it could not start as a superior school,<hi rend="sup">78</hi> but as a good school. And after
                    it had operated two years he reported to the Asbury Trustees that with the fostering care the
                    Trustees could extend, it could "be made to take position, at no remote period, in
                    character and usefulness, with the most respectable schools in the West."<hi rend="sup">79</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the main cause of the college's failure was financial, there were several additional
                    factors. There was some criticism of the school on the ground that it was under Methodist influence.
                    Asbury's Trustees and the Methodist Conference of course took pride in its Methodist
                    auspices. To counteract the reports of undue Methodist control, a correspondent of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> pointed out that some members of the faculty <list type="footnotes">

            <p>One incident probably attracted unfavorable attention to the school. It was the expulsion of David J.
                    Lee, whose long letter explaining the circumstances was published in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Locomotive</hi> under the caption "Medical College Outrage." Lee was
                    a "botanic," one of a group strongly condemned by members of the medical faculty
                    and orthodox physicians in general. Among other cures, the botanics emphasized steam baths and
                    herbs. Lee's statement was that he purchased a "ticket" for Dr.
                    Meeker's lectures on anatomy and attended regularly for several weeks. When it became known
                    that he was not reading with an allopathic physician as his preceptor, Lee states, "a mere
                    faction of the baser sort of the students, began their insults, hissing, hollowing steam and
                    ‘yarbs,’ not only in the College, but on the streets." These students
                    also passed resolutions saying Lee ought to leave the class. Dr. Meeker defended Lee's
                    right to attend lectures, even though he might believe in doctoring with cornstalks. The faculty
                    met, and the majority decided against Lee. Dean Bobbs informed him that he had not matriculated
                    properly, <list type="footnotes">

                    acted as gentlemen and disapproved of the treatment he received because of a few students'
                    objections. He expressed the opinion that one reason for his dismissal was fear that he might
                    attempt to gain prestige for himself as a botanic from having attended the school; Lee went on to
                    defend the botanics against the orthodox practitioners by commenting, <quote rend="blockquote">

                    </quote>Dean Bobbs evidently did not take the affair very seriously, however, as he reported to the
                    Trustees that he did not know of any occurence during this session which might "awaken an

            <p>Lack of permanent quarters was an additional difficulty which the medical college faced. The two
                    rented buildings seemed to suggest that the college was of a temporary nature. In February, 1850,
                    Governor Joseph A. Wright, an Asbury trustee, headed a committee to look for a site, perhaps for a
                    combined medical and law building.<hi rend="sup">85</hi> In June of that year the state legislature
                    authorized the sale of an acre in University Square, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, to Asbury at its appraised value of $3,566, but apparently the price seemed
                    too high to the Asbury Trustees.86 The Asbury catalogue published in 1851 made the inaccurate
                    announcement that the Trustees had "adopted efficient measures to provide for the erection
                    of a suitable College building."<hi rend="sup">87</hi> About the same time, the Trustees

            </p>
            <p>The school was probably not sufficiently advertised. For instance, when an historian in 1883 was
                    trying to get information about early Indiana medical schools, he received word from an Indiana
                    physician who practiced in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion County</region>

            </p>
            <p>The chief difficulties, however, were financial. At the end of the first year of operation there was
                    a deficit of $200, and the Trustees recommended that this amount be collected by
                    subscriptions from "Bystanders" or by agents if necessary.<hi rend="sup">91</hi>
                    At the end of the second year Professor Downey was appointed a special agent to travel through the
                    state "to disseminate information, collect funds for the erection or purchase of buildings
                    … and secure students." After he had labored three months, he had collected
                    $5 in cash.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> Reduction in the number of professors and the
                    assumption of the extra duties by the remaining faculty was of little help.<hi rend="sup">93</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Indiana Asbury did not give financial help to its medical college is hardly surprising. Through
                    the 1840's its annual deficits frequently amounted to two or three thousand dollars; at one
                    time it owed the president and faculty considerably more than a year's back salary. While
                    its finances had slightly improved by the early 1850's, it was still struggling to maintain
                    a balanced budget.<hi rend="sup">94</hi>

            <p>Indiana University's School of Medicine was established in 1903 and is now the only medical
                    school in the state. Twenty-two medical colleges had been founded in Indiana prior to that date;

            <p>During the years preceding the outbreak of the Civil War, citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> were confused and frustrated by the increasing sectional bitterness that threatened to
                    divide the nation. Being Hoosiers, they strongly supported their political convictions. Many
                    followed the leadership of Schuyler Colfax from nearby <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and vigorously supported the new Republican party in the election of 1860, while others
                    continued to support the old Democratic party. As the nation drifted into the
                    "irrepressible conflict," there was a division of opinion on national affairs
                    among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s citizens. Some believed that the nation would be split by the secession of
                    the southern states and voiced threats against all traitors; others advocated the preservation of
                    the Union by reasonable concessions to and compromises with the southern people. Confused and
                    uncertain about national affairs, the citizens gave little vent to any manifestations of patriotism,
                    and, as the nation approached the time of crisis, they seemed to be waiting, along with the rest of
                    the North, for an overt act by the South.</p>
            <p>The news of the fall of Fort Sumter was received at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> on the morning of April 15, and the response of Mishawakans to its fall was immediate
                    and enthusiastic. In a series of public meetings, citizens vigorously reacted in support of the
                    Union. A permanent organization was formed to represent the village in matters pertaining to the
                    war, and a Soldiers' Aid Society was organized, with over $2,000 subscribed for
                    the relief of volunteers' families. Forty-two men volunteered for the army, uniting with
                    fifty-five volunteers from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> to form a company. The company was accepted by Governor Oliver P. Morton and ordered to
                    leave for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on Friday, April 19. Patriotism, war fever, and excitement were in the air. Over three

                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>

            <p>The week following the departure of the volunteers for their training camp in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was anticlimactic for citizens of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName>. True, ladies wore badges—rosettes made of the national
                    colors—and stories of patriotism were being told. For example, there was the one about
                    the "prominent married lady who wished she were a man, so that she might volunteer and go
                    down and fight"; and a tale circulated about the young man who was told to leave a certain
                    young lady's presence and never return because of his expression of secession
                        sentiments.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> But the excitement of the past week, when the war meetings had
                    been held and men had volunteered for the army, simply could not be kept at its fever pitch. On
                    April 27, Editor Archibald Beal of the <hi rend="i">Enterprise</hi> stated that because of a
                    scarcity of help he was unable to collect much local news; nevertheless, he did manage to obtain the
                    information that eleven men had enlisted in a rifle company formed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> and had left for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but that thirteen of the original forty-five volunteers had returned home, honorably
                    discharged for physical reasons. Summing up national news about the war, Beal wrote that "a
                    terrible civil war is at hand and that nothing but bloodshed and a final triumph by arms will
                    restore peace."<hi rend="sup">3</hi>

            <p>The men had many new and exciting experiences while at Camp Morton. During the early part of the war,

                    </placeName>, and a portion of Company I was detailed to guard the Statehouse. Two men of the
                    regiment later died, and it was believed that their deaths resulted from drinking water from a well
                    that had been poisoned, possibly by southern sympathizers. A peddler, nearly mobbed because he was
                    accused of selling poisoned oranges, had to be rescued from an angry gathering by the guards.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>

            <p>The volunteers began their training and were soon emitting the complaints of civilians being made

                            annoying one was the food question. Charges were made that food was spoiled or adulterated;
                            then too, the men were not accustomed to army rations and wanted food such as they were
                            accustomed to having at home. See William Dudley Foulke, <hi rend="i">Life of Oliver P.

            <p>As their three-month enlistment was about to end, the Indiana men were being urged to reenlist for
                    three years. As early as June 10, Schuyler Colfax had written to Colonel Robert Milroy, and
                    referring to an order by President Lincoln, had told the Colonel that Indiana troops could be
                    mustered immediately into the federal service for three years. "Where less than one fifth
                    decline to (re-enlist), those declining are to be paid and discharged and their places filled with
                    recruits as soon as possible and the regiment to be accepted when four fifths full."<hi rend="sup">26</hi> Colfax urged Milroy to instruct each of his captains to encourage his men to
                        re-enlist.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> Governor Morton also put pressure upon the Indiana men, for he
                    sent letters by special messenger to all Indiana three-month regiments asking the men to reenlist
                    for three years' service.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> On July 13, however, Colfax again wrote to
                    Milroy stating, "The Secretary of War promised me today most postively [sic] that all our
                    three months regiments should be allowed to go home to recruit and re-enlist for the
                        war."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The attitude of the men on re-enlistment was well stated by

                                    where John Auten was killed, a sergeant of the Ninth Regiment wrote that
                                    "it was solely and entirely a battle begun and fought to an end by privates
                                    and ‘noncoms,’ independent of leader ship except as some one
                                    more daring than his fellows would push to the front shouting to his fellows to
                                    ‘come on’ when a rush would be made to support him. In short,
                                    it was the enlisted men's fight; with not a commissioned officer in the

            <p>On Wednesday morning July 31, the volunteers from the Ninth Regiment returned home to be welcomed
                    with cheers, music from the military band, and the firing of cannon. Yet the town almost missed the
                    homecoming. Rumor had it that the men would be returning on the 9:49 A.M. train, but so many other
                    conflicting rumors circulated that the people were really not prepared when shortly before 9:30 a
                    dispatch arrived from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>
                    </placeName> announcing that the "boys" were indeed coming on the 9:49 train. The
                    news spread like wildfire, and practically everyone who was able went straight to the railroad
                    station. Business places were closed; members of the bands and of the drum and fife corps were
                    quickly assembled. The flag was waving and the cannon loaded when the long train pulled into the
                    village with the men aboard. There ensued a happy confusion of hugging, kissing, crying, talking.

                    Plans had been made for a march to the picnic grounds and a formal reception, but the
                    "boys" would not have any more of marching and soldiering. All they wanted was to
                    be allowed to do as they liked, and so some of them left for home with their families, while others
                    went to the Milburn House where they were served a large breakfast.<hi rend="sup">47</hi>

                    their families were invited, along with the general public. Speeches, music, and other entertainment
                    were planned to enliven the occasion. In the evening there was to be a dance at the Milburn House in
                    honor of the soldiers and their ladies.<hi rend="sup">48</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The young ladies' picnic for the volunteers was a fine affair. There was a large crowd, and
                    the tables were loaded with choice foods. Speeches were made by citizens who told the
                    "boys" that the home folks appreciated Company I's "deeds of
                    valor" in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>. Answering speeches were made by some of the soldiers. Two large flags had been raised
                    on poles placed near the river bank, and a tent had been stretched between these poles, giving the
                    picnic grounds the appearance of a military encampment. When the military band played martial music
                    and the cannon fired, everything seemed very warlike and brave, at least for the citizens who were
                        present.<hi rend="sup">49</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was dancing in the evening at not one but two dances. At the Milburn House there was an
                    invitational dance attended by some thirty couples from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mishawaka</settlement>
                    </placeName> and surrounding towns. A second dance was arranged by those who were dissatisfied with
                    the way the dance at the Milburn House was to be conducted. They did not approve of the invitational
                    dance or of having to pay $1.50 for a few hours of dancing. Permission to use the fire
                    engine house was secured from the town board, and money was collected from those attending the dance
                    to pay for the rent of the hall and for the dance band. A large number of people were present at
                    this dance and all who came had a pleasant evening. The dances proved to be a proper ending to the
                    big day of public welcome for the returned soldiers.<hi rend="sup">50</hi>

            <p>Some of the volunteers believed that they should re-enlist, for they wanted to see the war carried to
                    a victorious conclusion; but on the other hand they were in no hurry to join again. There was some
                    doubt that a company should again be raised in the village, despite the statement in the <hi rend="i">Enterprise</hi> that Captain Houghton was "a fine man, somewhat versed in
                    military matters, and just the one to go with."<hi rend="sup">52</hi> A large rally was
                    planned for August 16 to promote enlistments for the new three-year regiment. Schuyler Colfax and
                    Colonel Robert Milroy were invited and asked to give patriotic speeches to help arouse enthusiasm.
                    Colfax was unable to attend,<hi rend="sup">53</hi> but Milroy arrived in town about 5:00 P.M., and
                    after dinner at the Milburn House, where a large crowd of people had gathered to greet him, he was
                    serenaded by the military band and called upon to make a speech. The "old hero made a
                    speech, setting forth the necessity for putting down the rebellion and calling upon all his old
                    boys' to go with him." Later the band played patriotic music, and the people sang
                    songs and cheered as each man stepped forward and signed his name to the roll. A number of
                    enlistments were secured, but more were needed. The next day the <hi rend="i">Enterprise</hi> urged,

            <p>The parting was sad for many who gathered at the railroad station to see the men leave. The festive
                    occasion of the three-month volunteers' homecoming was now overshadowed, and old fears and
                    worries had again returned. Outwardly there were the usual manifestations of patriotism, but
                    inwardly there was undoubtedly the dread feeling of loss. For the re-enlisted men, this second
                    departure was not the exciting experience of their April enlistment. They had already had a taste of
                    war and army life and had found nothing romantic or exciting about it; besides this enlistment was
                    for three long years. This departure was not one of flag-waving patriotism, but rather one
                    reflecting grim determination. A few days after the men left, Editor Beal mused: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    necessary to readjust themselves rather quickly. They had recently been engaged in political
                    campaigns of some intensity and had continued to be critical and even hostile towards the Lincoln
                    and Morton administrations.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> In the first days of the war public criticism of
                    the conduct of the war was unwise. As time passed, however, open expression of adverse opinions
                    became less risky, and soon it became apparent that most Democrats would support the war effort, but
                    that they intended to maintain their position as the opposition party.<hi rend="sup">68</hi>

            <p>On September 7, this same partisan Republican editor stated that "our paper is neither

                    offered a plan which was rather highhanded and perhaps confused politics with patriotism. The editor
                    proposed <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Milburn's letter gives an interesting insight into the methods of contract letting and wagon

                            $120, making an aggregate of 600 at an average of $127.50. This is all
                            that need be said about the price we get, though it is proper to say that until I took the
                            first contract at $140, the Government had never bought them for less than
                            $141;. and we furnished in addition to what previous contractors had done, a
                            fifth chain with stretchers and whiffletrees attached, making our price at least six dollars
                            less than ever before purchased; further, as before stated, Studebaker built fifty of the
                            wagons on our contract at $130 and they had the offer of fifty on our last
                            contract at $120 which they declined, not considering the compensation sufficient
                            to justify them in doing so—which at once puts to rest the charge that those
                            wagons can be profitably manufactured for the sum of $95, as no one knowing that
                            enterprising firm would believe they would throw away an opportunity to make the snug sum of
                            either $2,000 or $3,000.</p>

            <p>Milburn retorted that since Liston's letter was written to discredit the government and the
                    war effort, he would prove that the cost of wagons purchased by the government under the Democratic
                    administration prior to the war was higher than the cost for the army wagons being manufactured by
                    his company under war contracts. <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>In the year 1859 we built for Messers. Russel, Majors &amp; Waddell, and in 1860 for

                            capacity of regular army wagons with this difference in furnishing them The army wagons are
                            fitted for six mules or horses, and have all the necessary fixings, as doubletrees,
                            stretchers, fifth chains, stay chains, etc. The transportation wagons have simply an ox
                            tongue without any chain, the army wagon we supply with a frame bed and wagon cover, the
                            other has a plank bed without a cover, and it will cost at least $25 more to make

                    </quote> Milburn concluded his defense by accusing Liston of belonging to the political party that
                    was in rebellion against the Union and stealing arms and forts from it. The reason for
                    Liston's charges, Milburn contended, was to hamper the Union war effort and promote the
                    cause of the southern rebellion.<hi rend="sup">84</hi>

                    appointed to meet on Monday afternoons to receive donations and plan the work for the regular

                    useful for the soldiers—were solicited. All articles left at the Milburn, Eberhart

                    regardless of church affiliation. The gathering was for prayer, music, and talks, but the main
                    purpose was to take up a collection to purchase the "Soldier's Camp
                    Library" for the men of Company I. This library consisted of twenty-five volumes of
                    religious books and tracts considered worthy to be sent to the soldiers. It was resolved that while
                    "the ladies took care of the body comforts of the boys—by sending them things to
                    keep them warm and to keep them from getting hungry—the men should think of the spiritual
                    well-being of the boys." A committee was appointed to collect money, purchase the books,
                    and send them to Captain James Houghton with the suggestion that he or the regimental chaplain act
                    as company librarian. All persons having secondhand books were urged to give them to the committee

                            of winter and to the sufferings which the troops must undergo. Many articles, he said,
                            which, to men with houses and warm fires, were hardly more than luxuries, to those with no

                    Additional young men were leaving for military service or government work. For example, Schuyler

                    left for camp there were five fights in town and one almost resulted in a general riot. One man
                    accused another of being a secessionist, and, both being quite drunk, they fought out their
                    differences in the center of Main Street. One beat the other badly and bit off a large portion of

                    while at home citizens donated money and worked in various patriotic activities. Later in the year,
                    forces released by war became noticeable in the village. War hysteria and intolerance influenced
                    some people. Inflation increased the hardships of the poor and of the soldiers' families.
                    Gambling, drinking, and other forms of vice were more in evidence. Casualties on the battle fronts
                    had touched few from the village, but in many families there was constant fear that sickness,
                    permanent disability, or death would come to a loved one. To Mishawakans as the year ended, the
                    future was still dark and filled with the uncertainties of war, but now preservation of the Union
                    became a symbol which would sustain and help them continue the fight for what they believed to be
                    right.</p>

            <p>Political parties developed in Indiana during the second quarter of the nineteenth century. In this
                    period, party organization, platforms, speakers' committees, and party conventions evolved
                    and became established. Party conventions, then considered very democratic, made nominations,
                    adopted platforms, and selected party leaders. Although Jeffersonian Republicanism had been the
                    dominant political philosophy during the initial quarter of the nineteenth century, real political
                    parties did not emerge in Indiana until the schism within the Jeffersonian Republicans, which
                    resulted from the presidential election of 1824. Soon after this election, followers of Adams and <placeName>

                    </placeName> became National Republicans and those of Jackson and his associates, Democratic
                    Republicans. In 1834 the former were succeeded by the Whigs; meanwhile, the latter became known as
                    Democrats. The rivalry between the National Republican- Whig element and the Democratic Republicans
                    or Democrats continued until the Whigs were succeeded by the Republicans in 1854. Thus the
                    development of political parties during the second quarter of the nineteenth century also included
                    the evolution of the two-party system which has persisted to the present.</p>

                    each month through July, 1844, when the minutes lapse. Additional pages of the document offer
                    information about two Rough and Ready clubs that the Whigs organized during the presidential
                    campaigns of 1844 and 1848. Though not part of the minutes of the Clay Club, these pages also offer
                    useful information about the organization and operation of political parties at the local level.</p>
            <p>The Clay Club was doubtless founded principally to rally support for Henry Clay as the Whig nominee
                    for president in 1844. Its minutes indicate that its important objectives included: collecting
                    newspapers to read, procuring and listening to speakers, obtaining public documents for study,
                    encouraging attendance at party meetings, and stimulating attendance at a mass meeting to whip up
                    support and enthusiasm for the party. Newspapers, oratory, and public documents played major roles
                    in pioneer campaigns and elections. The quibbling with the Democrats about plans for a debate and
                    the appointment of a vigilante committee suggest that members of the Clay Club were eager to make
                    certain that the rival Democrats gained no unearned advantage over them. Moreover, the use of music,
                    the erection of an ash pole, and the proposed mass meeting with several speakers invited indicate an
                    effort to reach voters by appealing to their emotions as well as to their heads.</p>
            <p>Most members of the Clay Club apparently were residents of <placeName>

                            are almost exactly alike. In the text which follows, the second copy of the preamble is used
                            because it connects immediately with the text of the constitution. The material that follows
                            is not a part of the record of the Clay Club. It is included here, however, because it
                            offers relevant information about party organization and party practices in the
                            1840's. These pages offer information about the formation of Rough and Ready clubs
                            to encourage support of the Whigs in the presidential campaigns of 1844 and 1848. Some of
                            the people mentioned in the following material are the same as those already noted as
                            members of the Clay Club, but this is to be expected since Addison Township took the lead in
                            organizing all of these clubs, and also because Henry Clay was the Whig nominee for
                            president in 1844.</item>

            <p>Few Americans have been more venerated during their lifetimes than Benjamin Franklin. In his later
                    years he occupied a place in the hearts of his countrymen second only to that of George Washington.
                    Nor has the luster tarnished with time. No fewer than six editions of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s works, five published in the nineteenth century, testify to his enduring
                    popularity. During the half-century following his death in 1790, William Duane, William Temple
                    Franklin, and Jared Sparks published many of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s writings in six, three, and ten volumes respectively. In 1887-1888 John
                    Bigelow, discoverer of the original manuscript of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s autobiography, presented a new ten-volume collection. The most recent
                    edition of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> papers is Albert Henry Smyth's ten volumes, the first of which was issued in

                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s birth. All of these editions were necessarily selective, and a number of
                    excellent smaller volumes appearing over the last half-century did not begin to exhaust the vast
                    amount of <placeName>

                    </placeName> material scattered throughout American and European libraries and private collections.
                    Scholars will therefore welcome this first volume of the new and comprehensive edition of Benjamin
                    Franklin's papers.</p>
            <p>Edited by Leonard W. Labaree with the assistance of Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., Helen C. Boatfield, and
                    Helene H. Fineman and sponsored jointly by Yale University and the American Philosophical Society
                    with generous support from <hi rend="i">Life</hi> magazine, <hi rend="i">The Papers of Benjamin
                        Franklin</hi> will fill a projected forty volumes. The editors promise to present the full text
                    of every document written by Franklin alone or with others, including both preliminary and final
                    versions of important state papers in which he participated and those essays to the press for which
                    the weight of the evidence indicates his authorship. They will also edit "letters and other
                    communications, personal or official, addressed to <placeName>

            <p>The publication of the Adams-Jefferson correspondence by the Institute of Early American History and
                    Culture is an event of major importance to all students of American history and to all scholars of
                    the Age of the Enlightenment. Not since the appearance of Zoltan Haraszti's <hi rend="i">John Adam and the Prophets of Progress</hi> in 1952 has so penetrating a light been shed upon
                    the intellectual world of Adams, <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-056-2-075"/> and the feast that is spread
                    before Jefferson enthusiasts in these two volumes should add zest to new labors. Perhaps the most
                    important thing to be said about these letters is that they are revelations of the most intimate
                    kind. While every public question that ever engaged the energies of these two great men is touched
                    upon, often in depth, it is with a profound sense of having been exposed to a great body of
                    literature that one reads this correspondence. If there is a subject that eighteenth-century men
                    were likely to have pondered or a problem in religion, history, government, or the practical arts
                    that men of the Revolutionary generation might be expected to have wrestled with, Jefferson and
                    Adams pondered or wrestled with it. Fortunately, their letters were written for one another out of a
                    friendship that grew deeper as a result of the problems they encountered in preserving it. It is not
                    difficult to hear the voices of men talking, oblivious to the use which listeners may make of their
                    words. They communicated in order to make themselves understand, not by posterity, but by one
                    another. The result is an unrivaled clarity of meaning and expression that would certainly have been
                    lost otherwise.</p>
            <p>All of the letters contained in these volumes are either already available or soon will be in
                    editions of the Adams and Jefferson papers. Great value is to be gained, nevertheless, in having the
                    exchange of thought between these two men in juxtaposition. Their differences of temperament and
                    background are the more apparent, and their wide areas of agreement the more surprising as a result.
                    Differences so bitterly felt during the period covered by their presidential administrations receded
                    into the background as they became increasingly aware of the importance of their Revolutionary
                    heritage, an awareness sharpened as contemporaries slipped away. A better explanation of what deism
                    implied to men who reached maturity in the latter half of the eighteenth century would be difficult
                    to find outside these letters. Adams and Jefferson's concurrence on religious questions and
                    their vital sense of the meaningfulness of life heightened their sense of dedication to the cause of
                    freedom as they grew older. Yet the skepticism of Adams and the sanguine expectations of Jefferson
                    remained constant.</p>
            <p>Lester J. Cappon's introductory passages to each of the chronological periods covered by the
                    letters of the friendship, his footnotes, and his editorial sense are admirable. Wisely, he chose to
                    include Abigail Adams' sprightly letters to Jefferson written during the middle period of
                    their lives. The impression remains that Jefferson found the <placeName>
                        <region>New England</region>
                    </placeName> matron more congenial than her husband in this period, for there is a jocular quality
                    to his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Paris</settlement>
                    </placeName> letters that is rare in the broad range of his writings. John Adams, who wrote more
                    profusely and more often than Jefferson, reveals all the strength and vitality that was in him in
                    these letters. We stand in debt to Mr. Cappon and the many others to whom he so generously pays
                    tribute in his introduction for making readily available the record of a great friendship and some
                    of the finest prose in the English language.</p>

            <p>This volume, inaugurating a projected ten-volume edition of the papers of Henry Clay, will delight
                    scholars concerned with the first sixty years of the Republic. That Clay's papers have
                    sufficient historical significance to merit this ambitious effort would appear obvious from the
                    public record of the noted Kentuckian. In quantity alone they are quite astonishing. The first
                    thousand pages span only the years from 1797 to the conclusion of the Ghent negotiations in
                    December, 1814. In large measure, they reveal <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s early activities in law, land speculation, and horse racing. Occasional
                    papers, usually signed "Scaevola" or "Regulus," suggest his
                    early interest in politics. But much of this material illustrates the sometimes tenuous relationship
                    between the importance of an individual and the general usefulness of his papers, for the value of
                    the latter is determined more by their intrinsic quality as historical documents than by the
                    prominence of the man or his correspondents. With the exception of several letters to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> from <placeName>

                    </placeName>, for example, there is little of consequence in this volume on frontier development.</p>
            <p>As the young <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> became increasingly concerned with national and international affairs, his papers
                    assume a broader meaning. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s early nationalism was apparent when he wrote on the prospects of war in
                    1806: "Perhaps this is a fortunate moment to repress European Aggression; and to evince to
                    the world that Americans appreciate their rights in such a way as will induce them, when violated,
                    to engage in War with alacrity and effect" (p. 216). <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>'s Jeffersonian proclivities were made clear in a set of resolutions, rephrased
                    by him, which passed the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> House of Representatives in 1808 with one dissenting vote. These resolutions concluded
                    with the observation that "Thomas Jefferson is entitled to the thanks of his country, for
                    the ability, uprightness and intelligence which he has displayed in the management both of our
                    foreign relations and domestic concerns" (pp. 388-389). Similarly Clay voiced his early
                    philosophic allegiance to Jefferson in his vigorous argument against the recharter of the first <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>

            <p>For the diplomatic historian, the final 150 pages of this volume are of particular value, for they
                    relate <placeName>

            <p>After reading Dr. Smelser's preliminary articles on the founding of the navy in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> Naval Institute Proceedings</hi> and in <hi rend="i">Military Affairs</hi>, this
                    reviewer awaited publication of the full work with great anticipation. He was not disappointed, for
                        <hi rend="i">Congress Founds the Navy</hi> is the definitive study of the establishment of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy during 1787 to 1798. It is, moreover, a carefully reasoned and well-researched
                    study written with touches of dry wit.</p>
            <p>The book is basically a study in the politics of the Federalist period. As such, it corrects several
                    common misconceptions. For instance, it demonstrates the inaccuracy of the frequently repeated claim
                    that Congress wished to do more than it did about the Algerine depredations before 1793, but was
                    frustrated by the country's weakness. As Dr. Smelser points out, the problem was generally
                    overlooked and its rival claimants for Congressional attention "had the advantage of being
                    in some congressional constituency" (p. 44).</p>
            <p>Dr. Smelser's thesis is not unique but seems to this reviewer to be both apt and accurate.
                    "In the Federalist Period," he says, "naval policy was made in
                    Congress…. Only the most technical details, such as the exact dimensions of ships and the
                    precise tables of organization, were left to the executive, The policy which was enacted was the
                    policy of congressional Federalists" (p. 200). Since these statements infer a lack of
                    direction by Federalist administrations, particularly that of George Washington, it would have been
                    worthwhile for Dr. Smelser to have pointed out the then current concept of the division of powers
                    between the executive and legislative branches. In this connection it is useful to remember the
                    words used by George Washington in his first inaugural address: "It will be …
                    far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation
                    of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the patriotism
                    which adorn the characters [of the congressmen] selected to devise and adopt them."</p>
            <p>It can be argued that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Navy came into existence more from force of circumstances than from design. This
                    contention is amply supported by <hi rend="i">Congress Founds the Navy.</hi> In it Dr. Smelser
                    points out that during <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s first administration there was no attempt to create a navy because Congress
                    saw no immediate need for <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-056-2-078"/> one and assigned the task a low
                    priority. The first halting steps were taken because something had to be done to protect American
                    shipping heretofore shielded by Portuguese warships which kept the Algerians confined to the
                    Mediterranean. It remained for the depredations of French privateers during 1797 and 1798, combined
                    with national infuriation at the XYZ Affair, to force a reluctant Congress to send a navy to sea.</p>
            <p>This study was written by Dr. Smelser while he was a Forrestal Fellow in naval history at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Annapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, It is the first study published under that grant. If other studies approach this one
                    in merit, it is to be hoped that they too will soon be published.</p>

            <p>In the annals of American biography, the 1950's may go down in history as the "be
                    kind to businessmen decade." John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford were favorably
                    reinterpreted in full-length studies by Allan Nevins. Even Jay Gould found an able apologist in
                    Julius Grodinsky. Finally at the close of the decade this revisionist trend reached a culmination in
                    the book under review, Thomas Payne Govan's adulatory biography of Nicholas Biddle.</p>
            <p>In his Preface Govan says: "I began the research upon which this book is based, with the
                    intention of writing an objective, impartial biography that would do justice to Biddle and his
                    opponents alike. This ambition has not been fulfilled. I have written an apologia, a defense
                    … but I could do nothing else and remain loyal to the evidence." Even this
                    candid statement hardly prepares the reader for what follows. In the first chapter, Govan states his
                    belief that as a boy Biddle did not inherit privilege or status. He then provides an account of
                    Biddle's distinguished ancestry, his father's career as a leading citizen of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, his boyhood home "in the fashionable section of the city," and his
                    education at both the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Throughout Biddle's struggle with Jackson over the rechartering of the second Bank of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and his later attempt to play the role of central banker after his institution had been
                    chartered by the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, Govan defends his hero with unquestioning devotion. Neither omitting nor playing down
                    the aspects of Biddle's career which have been most criticized, Govan finds that
                    Biddle's course was uniformly wise, his purpose always to promote the national welfare, and
                    his interpretation of that welfare enlightened. Biddle's thoughts seem almost to become
                    those of the author. Even Biddle's megalomaniacal rationalizations during his last
                    desperate years are accepted without question. Thus, when Biddle (or is it Govan? One is seldom
                    quite sure.) contended that Jackson and Van Buren were really responsible for the near insolvency of
                    the state of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, that he (Biddle) bribed <pb n="179" id="VAA4025-056-2-079"/> members of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName> legislature for patriotic reasons, and that he speculated in cotton and objected to the
                    resumption of specie payments for the public good, Govan never raises any question as to the
                    soundness of Biddle's explanations.</p>
            <p>The book reflects the narrowness of the author's research, which consists chiefly of an
                    exhaustive examination of the Biddle papers. Much might have been gained had more attention been
                    devoted to other contemporary records, even to the secondary accounts of the period.</p>
            <p>In defense of this book, it can be said that the author threads his way with some skill through the
                    complicated political intrigues of the age and that he competently and lucidly describes
                    Biddle's involved banking and foreign exchange operations. Possibly this strongly partisan
                    and uncritical study provides an understanding of Nicholas Biddle, the man, which might not be
                    gained from a less friendly biography.</p>

                    </placeName>, published <hi rend="i">Lincoln's Parentage and Childhood.</hi> A product of
                    rigorous research and critical analysis, the book replaced many a flimsy legend with solid fact,
                    raised the status of the Lincoln family, and demonstrated that Lincoln's early years were
                    considerably less drab than they had previously been pictured.</p>
            <p>The book also led to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>'s appointment as Director of the Lincoln National Life Foundation at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Wayne</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Lincoln students hoped that he would soon do for the Indiana
                    years—also a murky period—what he had done for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> years. The duties of his position, however, were too onerous, so it was not until his
                    retirement in 1956 that he could really devote himself to the Indiana book.</p>
            <p>The result, one regrets to say, is disappointing. The text is padded with long excerpts or summaries
                    of books which <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName>, sometimes on doubtful authority, credits Lincoln with having read, and with much
                    silly, unsupported tradition—which the author rejects, to be sure—that could
                    better have been omitted altogether. (Chapter XII, "Romance," is a case in point.)
                    In addition, there are far too many suppositious statements: "This book must have impressed
                    Abraham …" (p. 111), "As a boy Abe may have heard from his father the
                    tragic story of John Fitch …" (p. 148), "Apparently Abe had performed
                    his tasks <pb n="180" id="VAA4025-056-2-080"/> on the flatboat competently and after his return he
                    may have been employed in the store at intervals by Gentry" (p. 187).</p>
            <p>In treating two subjects long controversial Warren has abandoned all caution. Nancy Hanks, he says,
                    "was the only daughter of James and Lucy (Shipley) Hanks" (p. 6), and hence of
                    legitimate parentage. He may be right, but his case is not strong enough to justify a categorical
                    assertion. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> repeatedly credits Nancy Hanks Lincoln with the ability to read—with
                    teaching young Abraham his letters and reading the Bible to him—in spite of the fact that
                    the only contemporary document which bears her name is signed with her mark.</p>
            <p>While <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren</region>
                    </placeName> makes some corrections in the Indiana story, and has performed a useful service in
                    bringing together all that is known, the general picture established by William H. Herndon and
                    redrawn on better authority by Albert J. Beveridge remains unchanged. One must conclude that there
                    is simply no basis in existing historical sources for a different interpretation. If there were,
                    Louis A. Warren would have found it and used it well.</p>
            <p>Mr. Baringer's anthology needs only a few words. The Introduction—a polemic by
                    the general editor, C. A. Muses against the communistic dialectic-is completely irrelevant.
                    Baringer's definition of Lincoln's "philosophy" may be inferred
                    from his inclusion of items like the following: "Dr. Zacharie has operated on my feet with
                    great success, and considerable addition to my comfort" (p. 18); and "Today I
                    verbally told Colonel Worthington that I did not think him fit for a Colonel; and now, upon his <hi rend="i">urgent</hi> request, I put it in writing" (p. 21). The book lacks a subject
                    index, a fault which strips any compilation of this kind of most of its value.</p>

            <p>Professor Bell Irvin Wiley, author of the historical narrative for <hi rend="i">They Who Fought
                    Here</hi>, has produced an extremely interesting account of the life of the common soldier on both
                    sides during the Civil War. Emphasis is primarily upon the lot of infantrymen—and the
                    overwhelming preponderance of troops on both sides were in that group. The substantial similarity of
                    the life led by Billy Yanks and Johnny Rebs is frequently indicated. Attention is given to important
                    topics such as enlistments, rations, clothing and shelter, weapons, diversions, crime and <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-056-2-081"/> punishment, morals and religion, sickness and casualties, and
                    getting the infantry to the front. Most of the account is concerned with the life of common soldiers
                        <hi rend="i">between</hi> battles. Extensive use of quotations from letters of soldiers adds
                    desirable flavor and atmosphere, but unfortunately these and other quotations are seldom traceable.
                    Numerous pictures, for which Hirst D. Milhollen was responsible, illustrate the narrative, and
                    fortunately they are generally closely related to the immediate text. A careful reading of this
                    volume and a thoughtful viewing of its pictures are likely to leave many readers with an increased
                    feeling that the Civil War was possibly the greatest tragedy in American history.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">From the Cannon's Mouth</hi> consists chiefly of Civil War letters which
                    General Alpheus S. Williams wrote to his daughters—but with discussions of family matters
                    largely deleted. General Williams, who settled in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1836, served as a brigadier general in the Union army, 1861-1865. The value of
                    General Williams' comments about the war is enhanced by the fact that he was at such
                    important places as Second Bull Run, <placeName>

                            <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
               </placeName>, Savannah, etc. Normally reflecting
                    no bitterness toward friend or foe, these letters describe battles, ups and downs of the war,
                    problem of preparing for battles, the boredom and sacrifice of soldiers, the destruction wrought
                    upon the South, and political aspects of the war. This volume makes clear that generals as well as
                    privates faced problems, especially when they saw less experienced and less well-qualified men
                    promoted ahead of or over them.</p>
            <p>Presumably this is the last of numerous books, articles, documents, and reviews from the pen of Milo
                    M. Quaife. Dr. Quaife's death during the fall of 1959 in an automobile accident ended his
                    distinguished career as editor, teacher, and scholar. His influence is writ large in the development
                    of historical knowledge and interest in the American Middle West among adults as well as among
                    students. A general idea of Dr. Quaife's amazing contributions is indicated in <hi rend="i">Forty-six Years: The Published Writings of Milo M. Quaife, 1910-1955</hi>, edited by Joe L.

            <p>While the Civil War has long been of interest to the military writer and biographer in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> that struggle has also fired the attention of foreign military students and scholars.
                    In this superb work Mr. Luvaas traces the influence of the Civil War on European military literature
                    and thought from the reports of "on-the-spot" observers to post-World War I
                    writings. His general thesis is that although technological developments made during the Civil War
                    were noted by observers at the time of the conflict, and by military staffs and students in Europe
                    after the war, tactical and strategic lessons were disregarded because they conflicted with
                    prevailing military doctrine or more recent lessons derived from continental battlefields.</p>
            <p>In the case of the German General Staff, except for the idea of military use of railways, the Civil
                    War did not have an influence on official doctrine. In the years after the Franco-Prussian War the
                    Germans gave little official attention to the Civil War because the American experience did not give
                    the answer to the vital strategic problem of Moltke's successors: a two-front war and the
                    necessity for a quick victory. In the years before 1914, the French gave little serious study to the
                    epic struggle of the American Republic because of the pervasive Napoleonic influence and the
                    "cult of the offensive." In the case of Great Britain, we find more interest being
                    given to the study of the Civil War in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, mainly
                    through the efforts of the famed biographer of Stonewall Jackson and noted British military mentor,
                    G. F. R. Henderson. Luvaas, who has edited a volume of Henderson's writings on the Civil
                    War, claims that the latter did not leave his mark on any specific tactical or other military reform
                    but emphasized through his study of the Civil War a flexible approach to military thought in
                    general. Paradoxically, Henderson's flexible and inquisitive attitude became the agent of a
                    dogmatic approach to the study of the Civil War, and in the years after Henderson's death
                    in 1903 British military writers saw only what they wanted to see from the Civil War to prove their
                    particular point, and little emphasis was placed on objectivity toward military problems.</p>
            <p>With the holocaust of 1914-1918 "new lenses" were provided with which to view the
                    Civil War, and in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> enthusiasm for the war was more intense than before 1914. This was the result of the
                    work of J. F. C. Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart. These two brilliant military scholars gave attention
                    to the Western theater, the campaigns of Grant and Sherman, and stressed the constant factors of
                    warfare such as command, strategy, and psychology of leadership.</p>
            <p>The author has performed a prodigious task in his study of French, German, and British military
                    literature covering the years since 1861, and his work reflects his excellent knowledge of European
                    military developments during these years. This volume is a distinct contribution to recent works on
                    military affairs; in particular, the discussion of Henderson and his legacy to British military
                    thought is instructive for <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-056-2-083"/> the student of military history.
                    Luvaas' work is also a singular addition to Civil War historiography in the respect that
                    the author relates or connects the war with contemporary and subsequent military affairs in Europe.</p>
            <p>An excellent presentation of footnotes at the bottom of each page partially offsets the glaring
                    omission of a bibliography or even a bibliographical note.</p>

            <p>In this iconoclastic study Professor Sharkey explores many aspects of the financial history of the
                    Civil War and Reconstruction. He deals with the origin of the greenbacks and with their importance
                    as an expedient of war finance. He analyzes the political struggle over currency contraction and
                    inquiries into the economic rationale of bankers, manufacturers, laborers, and farmers.</p>
            <p>At the outset Professor Sharkey argues that one must not magnify the importance of the greenbacks as
                    a factor in financing the war, since the total net issues of legal tender notes in the years
                    1861-1865 accounted for less than one-sixth of the total cost of the war. Yet the author maintains
                    that the country desperately needed an adequate medium of exchange at this time. Thus, he concludes,
                    one can make a strong case for the "necessity" of the greenbacks.</p>
            <p>Continuing his well-documented assault upon orthodox conceptions, Professor Sharkey contends that
                    farmers were not duly concerned with fiscal matters in the period under consideration. He cites
                    statistics indicating farm prosperity in the immediate postwar era and concludes that this
                    prosperity is the reason that there is little evidence of economic discontent among farmers during
                    that period. He says that farm prosperity contributed to the Democratic defeat in 1868-that farmers
                    generally ignored the money question and voted Republican.</p>
            <p>This reviewer's colleague, Professor R. C. Buley, has often asserted that on few questions
                    is there a common business viewpoint. Professor Sharkey substantiates this position by demonstrating
                    that business interests differed sharply on fiscal matters during the Civil War and Reconstruction
                    era. He shows that spokesmen for manufacturers, such as Thaddeus Stevens, "Pig
                    Iron" Kelley, and Peter Cooper strongly opposed any attempt to contract the greenbacks,
                    while commercial and financial interests generally favored contraction.</p>
            <p>In his conclusion the author devotes considerable space to a strong criticism of the analysis of the
                    fiscal history of the Civil War and Reconstruction period which the Beards forwarded in <hi rend="i">The Rise of American Civilization.</hi> He believes that many misconceptions on the <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-056-2-084"/> subject are Beardian in origin. The criticism is well grounded. Yet the
                    Beards were presenting a synthesis covering the gamut of American history and were almost certain to
                    repeat the errors of those who had made more detailed studies of the period. <hi rend="i">The Rise
                        of American Civilization</hi> is a sixteen-hundred-page work and only a half-dozen or so of
                    those pages touch upon the fiscal history of the Civil War and Reconstruction era. Obviously the
                    Beards could not explore in detail each facet of history dealt with in their study. Doubtless
                    Professor Sharkey recognizes this, but he should have made the point clear and mitigated the sting
                    of his criticism accordingly.</p>
            <p>Summing up, this is an important study of a much misunderstood period of American history. The book
                    is the product of painstaking research, and it should result in the revision of a number of
                    erroneous ideas about that period. Of especial value to many students of Civil War and
                    Reconstruction history will be Professor Sharkey's bibliographical essay.</p>

            <p>Times were hard in 1877. Railroad workers, already underpaid, were faced with new wage cuts. Summer
                    came, and with it a tragic episode in American labor history.</p>
            <p>In great detail, the author describes the strike of the Trainmen's Union against the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> Central, and closely allied lines. The contempt of management for labor leaders; its
                    disregard for the unemployed, the aged, the poorly paid; its stubborn insistence on big dividends
                    alongside pay cuts—these are discussed at length.</p>
            <p>Management techniques in handling union members—the black list, prompt dismissal of
                    workers after participation in union activities, employment of Pinkerton detectives, and refusal to
                    bargain—are all illustrated with vigor. Almost without exception, the executive heads of
                    American railroads in 1877 are portrayed as enemies of the working-man, as reactionaries, and as
                    patronizing, yet firm, masters of certain mayors, governors, congressmen, and, by inference, some
                    officials on still higher levels.</p>
            <p>Interestingly and effectively the author presents an hour-by-hour account of vicious attacks on
                    private property by maddened men, women, and youths. With especial care he describes the horrors of
                    mob action at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Pittsburgh</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In each case, we are assured, the real damage was done by tramps and young hoodlums.
                    The author places little or no responsibility on bona fide railroad workers, but his argument is not
                    completely convincing.</p>
            <p>A major contribution of the book is its description of the pathetic efforts of third-party agitators,
                    especially those of the Workingmen's party, to unite the laboring class. Anyone whose
                    interpretation of <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-056-2-085"/> American labor movements has been influenced
                    by Selig Perlman's analysis is sure to see in the failure of the Workingmen's
                    party an excellent example of the tendency of workers to distrust any threat to freedom of
                    enterprise, even though the entrepreneurial group benefiting from working class disunity is at that
                    time opposed to any improvement in conditions, pay, or employee morale.</p>
            <p>A contribution of considerable significance is evidence indicating that the real reason for the
                    railway strike's failure was the clever use, by management, government officials, and the
                    conservative press, of charges that the whole uproar was inspired by Communists. This further
                    emphasizes the fact that public opinion in 1877 was characterized by fear of organized labor,
                    distrust of urban employees, and reverence for financial power.</p>
            <p>This reviewer has two complaints about Bruce's volume, the first of which is minor. The
                    author sets forth such a mass of detail that at times chronology becomes confused. Second, the
                    presentation of the notes is little short of useless. Notes are arranged at the end of the book by
                    page and by paragraph with no indication whatsoever as to which statement in the text the reference
                    supports. No footnote numbers are used in the text. Therefore, in a given paragraph there may be a
                    half-dozen facts worthy of footnotes, but there is no earthly way the reader can determine <hi rend="i">which</hi> facts are supported by <hi rend="i">which</hi> citations. The bibliography
                    gives ample evidence of the wide range of the author's studies.</p>

            <p>"No period in Southern history since the American Revolution is so poor in published
                    correspondence as this one," Vann Woodward (to whom these volumes are dedicated) has
                    written of the period from 1877 to 1900. Even more rare are published source materials on the
                    history of the Negro in America. Louis D. Rubin's work in editing that part of the
                    Rutherford B. Hayes Papers which deals with Hayes's work with the Slater Fund is a step in
                    filling both gaps.</p>
            <p>In setting up his million dollar fund in 1881, textile maker John F. Slater specified to the trustees
                    that he had in mind "the uplifting of the lately emancipated population of the Southern
                    States and their posterity, by conferring upon them the blessings of Christian education"
                    (p. xx). According to Professor Merton Coulter, he also had in mind equipping them mentally to evade
                    the clutches of a certain group of unscrupulous merchants. In any case, training Negroes as teachers
                    and giving financial encouragement to colleges which provided that training were suggested as the
                    best avenues for attaining the goal of the founder. The distinguished group of trustees were
                    empowered to dissolve the foundation at the end of thirty-three years and to use <pb n="186" id="VAA4025-056-2-086"/> the capital to establish subsidiary foundations at existing colleges.
                    But in fact the Slater Fund continued, at the election of its trustees, to operate until its
                    incorporation in 1937 in the Southern Educational Foundation.</p>
            <p>Editor Rubin has done a good job with his material. His introduction is comprehensive and gracefully
                    written; his notes are thorough and informative, but not obtrusive. Any faults of <hi rend="i">Teach
                        the Freeman</hi> should not be charged to his account. Criticism can, however, be directed
                    against the material with which he has worked. In 1951, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> State University Press made a significant contribution to published source materials in
                    Southern history with <hi rend="i">William Johnson's Natchez: The Diary of a Free
                    Negro.</hi> It would be gratifying to report that <hi rend="i">Teach the Freeman</hi> is in the same
                    tradition, but it is not. Where William Johnson was vivid, humorous, observant, sometimes poignant,
                    writers of the letters in these volumes were too often pious, sententious, and dull. Though the work
                    is subtitled <hi rend="i">The Correspondence of Rutherford B. Hayes</hi> …," it
                    actually contains but forty-four letters from Hayes in his capacity as president of the
                    fund's board of trustees. Far better represented is the tireless and devoted Atticus B.
                    Haygood, from whom the editor has included 138 letters and reports written during his tenure as fund
                    agent.</p>
            <p>Haygood's reports give a fairly accurate picture of the extent of his work for the fund, but
                    there is no life in them. A good and thoroughly honest man, he was so filled with a deep sense of
                    mission that he apparently saw almost nothing of the post-Reconstruction South in which he lived and
                    traveled so widely. Nor are the letters of others- trustees, college presidents, importuners for
                    funds—much livelier. There is a tantalizing glimpse of the young W. E. B. Dubois writing
                    for financial aid to finish his doctoral studies in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName>; but Dubois obviously was not the norm in the educational scheme of Hayes and Haygood,
                    who preferred to encourage industrial education rather than the classical learning that would
                    prepare students for the seminars of Berlin.</p>
            <p>As Adrienne Koch noted in a recent discussion of other projects of the National Historical
                    Manuscripts Commission, which extended its "co-operation and good offices" to this
                    project, the aim in publication of collections such as this is not to reach the best-seller list.
                    Still, with book budgets and library shelf-space what they are today, one cannot help wondering,
                    "Is this really needed?" And in two volumes, boxed, at that.</p>

            <p>As the title of this volume suggests its purpose, so the subtitle indicates the nature of its
                    contents. In compiling this work the editor has <pb n="187" id="VAA4025-056-2-087"/> reached back
                    into thirteenth-century English history for the Magna Carta and the Confirmatio Cartarum of 1297.
                    All other documents are taken from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These include
                    well-known English constitutional documents of the Stuart Age, four colonial charters, several
                    proprietary "Concessions" or "Frames," and a few of the pacts
                    and agreements conceived by the colonists themselves. The final third of the book consists of
                    declarations—assertions of rights—and constitutions of the Revolutionary and
                    Confederation periods. Slightly over one-half of the volume is devoted to the editor's
                    introductory remarks to each document.</p>
            <p>The American Bar Association is to be commended for its attempt to bring together the most
                    significant documents relating to the "sources of our liberties." It is possible
                    that too much has been attempted, especially in the editor's remarks, although his comments
                    could be defended in terms of the purposes for which the volume was published.</p>
            <p>Historians may object to the free use of secondary sources in the introductory essays to each
                    document, and especially to such antiquated sources as George Bancroft. More certainly they will
                    take issue with several statements which seem to reflect popular misconceptions. Thus, without
                    documentation, it is asserted that "the Quartering Act of 1765 was passed … to
                    aid the enforcement of the Stamp Act and the Revenue Act of 1764" (p. 72). Similarly,
                    section ninety-five of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName> Body of Liberties (1641) is interpreted to mean that "toleration in religious
                    worship was to be observed" (p. 146), when obviously all that was intended was to authorize
                    the formation of new congregations on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> model.</p>
            <p>In spite of such objections as those mentioned above, however, this work provides for the general
                    public and for the teacher of history a valuable manual for study of the growth of personal
                    liberties, containing not only the documents pertaining thereto, but also an account of the
                    historical forces which brought about their formulation.</p>

            <p>The fur trade is an exciting topic for writers to pursue, and Nathaniel C. Hale has presented <hi rend="i">Pelts and Palisades</hi>, a popularly written account of the fur trade and of the
                    rivalry for pelts in North America up to the French and Indian War. Presenting the story of the fur
                    trade in narrative form, Hale begins his account by telling of prehistoric man's quest for
                    fur. Quickly sketching the background of fur's economic value in the Dark Ages, he journeys
                    to North America with Leif Erickson and his followers, but returns quickly to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Following the voyages of discovery financed by the leading royal houses of Europe, the fur trade
                    remained in the background, for gold to the south and fish to the north received the primary
                    attention of early <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-056-2-088"/> colonists. Fishing barques from France came
                    to America's northern coast every year, and the mariners developed an ever increasing trade
                    in pelts with the Indians.</p>
            <p>England came of age and, with a penchant for commerce, soon engaged in colonizing activities in the
                    New World. The fur trade in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, according to Hale, opened a new source of revenue after the ventures for gold failed.
                    The Dutch also entered America during this period.</p>
            <p>Hale examines the three-way rivalry among the French, English, and Dutch in America, and adds an
                    interesting chapter on the Swedes' <placeName>

                    </placeName> colony, which is the most outstanding in the book. With over half the volume devoted to
                    the period when the early colonies were established, events move at a rapid pace until the French
                    and Indian War. <placeName>

                    </placeName> over the fur trade and emerged victorious; the fur frontier, however, quickly passed
                    beyond the colony. English encroachments, both from the north and south, spelled doom for the colony
                    of New Netherlands, which surrendered in 1664. The English colonies, now joined together from <placeName>

                    gives the earlier period. Furthermore, he could have added to the value of his work by including an
                    account of the actual mechanics of trapping. The absence of footnotes is to some extent
                    counterbalanced by a creditable bibliography.</p>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Oil on Stream</hi> is a history of the Interstate Oil Pipe Line Company from 1909 to
                    1959. The author was engaged by Interstate's president to write the history but was to be
                    free to use information furnished by the firm in any way he thought "proper to produce a
                    balanced objective study." The author states in his Preface that he was given absolute
                    freedom and there is no reason to doubt his statement.</p>
            <p>The account is well written and interesting, but unfortunately it is primarily an entertaining series
                    of stories concerning various aspects of company affairs. No attempt is made to evaluate critically
                    company policies or to analyze the impact of the pipe line on the industry. Thus, the book would be
                    useful as background or color, but of little value to a serious student of development economics
                    seeking data on trends and relationships.</p>
            <p>The book has eleven maps showing the location of company lines at different periods of time. It 81~
                    contains sixty-three illustrations <pb n="189" id="VAA4025-056-2-089"/> of construction activities,
                    pipe line equipment, and individuals connected with the company. On the whole, the photography is
                    good and the reproduction excellent. There seems to be little direct relation, however, between the
                    illustrations and the text.</p>
            <p>The narrative begins on "a hot muggy Sunday afternoon in June, 1909…."
                    and plunges immediately into the reasons for the decision to build a pipe line from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="oku">Oklahoma</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baton Rouge</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The author describes in some detail the construction techniques of fifty years ago and
                    devotes a considerable amount of space to the technical development of the pipe line industry.</p>
            <p>He writes equally well, however, about other aspects of company activities and includes material on
                    corporate structure, expansion, corporate finance, personnel problems, labor-management relations,
                    government regulation, the effect of war and depression, the statistics of operation, and winds up
                    with a prediction for the future.</p>
            <p>In the discussion of labor-management relations the author in every case is scrupulously careful to
                    summarize the position of the workers or the union. He also gives management's position and
                    the final outcome of the disagreement or problem. In discussing early labor problems he suggests
                    that pipe line construction workers were at times abused (pp. 22-23), but in the later disputes
                    judgement is withheld.</p>
            <p>Considerable attention is given to a running fight between the company and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> regulatory authorities. According to this account, the struggle reached a peak during
                    the 1920's under the Huey Long regime. The author clearly indicates his belief that the
                    company was in the right, although the state supreme court seems to have found both the state and
                    the company at fault. Since 1926, however, relations between the company and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="lau">Louisiana</region>
                    </placeName> Commission "have, virtually without exception, been entirely
                    amicable" (p. 99).</p>
            <p>The book ends with the following statement: "Regardless of the accuracy of these
                    prognostications, it can be predicted with complete assurance that, as long as Interstate continues
                    to provide its shippers good service at a reasonable cost without discrimination of any kind, and as
                    long as it meets the competition which is ever present in a free enterprise economy, it will not
                    only survive, but grow and prosper."</p>

                    who generally follows a chronological sequence, must alternate between communities and
                    personalities. The reader, however, is also made aware of the different pace and the different
                    stages of integration of the Jewish communities in the three cities with the communities at large.

                    </placeName>, Eastern European immigration after the Civil War led to social, religious, and even
                    geographical stratification among Jewish groups and greatly increased welfare problems. These
                    problems have always been met magnificently by Jews in all three cities, and particularly in <placeName>

                    portrayed through the work of leaders, particularly rabbis, such as Wechsler and Rypin, of Mount

                    American Jewish communal histories raises an old question, namely, how far does the accident of
                    state boundaries justify the state as a frame of reference for the history of an immigrant group.
                    There are no maps of the shifting Jewish neighborhoods in the Twin Cities and no pictures. This
                    reviewer also regrets what appears to be a concession to that vague nonenity, the popular
                    reader—the colorful but un-informative chapter headings and the short chapters which give
                    the book at least in its first part a kaleidoscopic character. This labor is too serious and the
                    subject too deserving for this type of handling. It is hoped that Rabbi Plaut can find time to
                    complete the task by writing the history of Jewish life in the Twin Cities during the middle of the
                    twentieth century.</p>

            <p>This excellent little book re-examines the interrelationships between Puritanism and democracy with
                    attention focused upon the chaplains of the New Model Army, "the Saints in Arms."
                    Professor Solt holds that "the relation of political thought to religious thought in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> Revolution turns on the question of why some groups were led to claim the privileges
                    and rule of the saints based upon God's Free Grace, whereas others preached the equality
                    and sovereignty of the people based upon natural law" (p. 4). Prevailing interpretations,
                    says the author, tend to play up "the first member of each of the following pairs of
                    politico-religious polarities: (1) liberty and authority, (2) unity and uniformity, (3) separatism
                    and millenarianism, (4) equality and sainthood, (5) covenant and grace, (6) elective polity and
                    anarchy, (7) fundamental law and power, (8) mixed government and policy, and (9) masses and
                    classes" (p. 4). Any play upon the second member of these polarities would be to establish
                    a case for "an authoritarian strain in Puritanism."</p>
            <p>The Introduction sets up the method which is, essentially, to establish the polarities. Six chapters
                    follow. Chapters I and II set forth the necessary historical and theological backgrounds, and
                    Chapters III-VI test the polarities as previously stated. A "Conclusion" reviews
                    the results. Of the nine pairs of politico-religious polarities Professor Solt finds that the
                    authoritarian tradition prevailed in six: "authority took precedence over liberty, power
                    over law, millenarianism over separatism, sainthood over equality, grace over covenant, and anarchy
                    over elective polity" (p. 99). Democratic sentiments prevailed in only three instances:
                    unity took precedence over uniformity, the masses over the classes, and mixed government over
                    policy. And by no means all of the "saints" were in complete agreement on all of
                    these items.</p>
            <p>Professor Solt has shown decisively that the Leveller precepts in the New Model Army must be
                    considered apart from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> chaplains' views on democracy. For many—though not for
                    all—this is a useful (and new) distinction. But one is led to question how far the views
                    of the New Model Army chaplains, which are as thoroughly reviewed in this volume as literary remains
                    will permit, can be accepted as representative of Puritanism in the large, even in its own time. AS
                    a whole, the army chaplains, as compared with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> spokesmen at large, were neither a sober nor a solid group of men. Some of them were,
                    in fact, on the "lunatic fringe." Moreover, they were caught up in the
                    supercharged atmosphere of civil war and a peculiar brand of Army-Parliament-King-Scots-Presbyterian
                    political issues. Can we safely accept the pronouncements of these men in these circumstances as
                    truly representative of <hi rend="i">
                        <placeName>

                        </placeName>
                    </hi> opinion? Or, did not the Army of Saints and its principal apologists (the chaplains) overreach
                    the Puritans as a whole both in politics and in theology? Was not this evident at the time, both in
                    Old <placeName>

                    </placeName> and in New? To accept the pronouncements of the army chaplains as representative of
                    anything <pb n="192" id="VAA4025-056-2-092"/> more than a segment of opinion within the New Model
                    Army itself seems to this reviewer to be a highly doubtful extension; and it is difficult for this
                    reviewer to ascertain how far this extension is implied in the present work. As a study of the
                    politics and theology (and their interrelationships) of the chaplains of the New Model Army
                    Professor Solt's volume is a splendid and thorough job.</p>

            <p>In the opening chapters of this volume Professor Wallace discusses Raleigh's education and
                    early years. Then, in tracing Raleigh's meteoric rise to prominence, the author illustrates
                    that his subject was a political opportunist, a monarchist, and an expansionist. Yet this
                    Elizabethan courtier, with all his lust for power and prestige, had <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s interest at heart. To him, the founding of colonies would enhance the glory
                    of Old <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and would at the same time strike indirectly at <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s perennial enemy, <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The chapter about <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> retells the pathetic story of Raleigh's "lost colony."
                    Raleigh learned from this tragic experience that an agrarian economy had to be emphasized if <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> were to establish a colony in the New World. Raleigh also realized that some of the
                    causes for his failure were inextricably bound to the complexities of international power politics.</p>
            <p>The complicated struggle between Anglican <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and Catholic Spain is painted upon a broad canvas. Raleigh is pictured as one of the
                        <geogName>Elizabethan Sea</geogName> Dogs who preyed upon Spanish shipping, a practice which
                    combined patriotism and good business. The defeat of the Spanish Armada is brought into proper
                    focus.</p>
            <p>While <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was enjoying one of her finest hours in history, Sir Walter was likewise basking in the
                    brilliancy of the Queen's Court. It took skill to maintain one's position at the
                    Court where the Queen's whims could not be predicted and where political machinations
                    prevailed. Raleigh "stubbed his toe" politically when he married Elizabeth
                    Throg-morton. His preference for another Elizabeth instead of Elizabeth Tudor was a heinous offense.
                    The penalty: confinement in the Tower of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> and then total banishment from the Court for five years. But during the last six years
                    of Elizabeth's reign, he was near his Queen again. With the coming of the Stuart James I,
                    Raleigh was stripped of his power, charged with opposing the new monarch, and arraigned for treason.</p>
            <p>The last third of the book discusses Raleigh's trial, his years of imprisonment, and his
                    voyage to the <geogName>Orinoco River</geogName>. This old Elizabethan was an obstacle thwarting the
                    new Stuart policy toward <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>; he became a sacrificial lamb upon the international altar of expediency. The end came
                    quickly. As one curious bystander at the execution solemnly remarked: " ‘We have
                    not another such head to be cut off!’" (p. 317).</p>
            <pb n="193" id="VAA4025-056-2-093"/>
            <p>Legal aspects of the trial, religious viewpoints, and psychological factors are scrutinized with deep
                    insight by Wallace. Not all readers will agree with the author's laudatory appraisal of
                    Raleigh's literary efforts. This reviewer wishes that more attention had been given to the
                    lesson <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> learned from early attempts at colonization by Raleigh and others—namely,
                    that the resources of a joint-stock company rather than those of an individual would be necessary
                    for the successful planting of colonies in America.</p>
            <p>The author, using recent historical evidence, has produced a well-documented and much-needed
                    reappraisal of the composite man. The scholarship and craftmanship displayed in this volume makes it
                    an exceedingly valuable biography for historians working in the fields of English and American
                    colonial history.</p>
