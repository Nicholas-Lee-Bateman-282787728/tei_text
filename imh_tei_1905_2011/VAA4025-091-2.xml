            </byline>
            <p>From 1939 until her retirement in 1973, Caroline Dunn helped guide the collection of rare volumes and
                    other material as librarian for the Indiana Historical Society's William Henry Smith
                    Memorial Library. Dunn's death on August 22, 1994, at her Greenwood, Indiana, residence
                    ends a long association between the Society and the Dunn family. In 1886 Caroline Dunn's
                    father, Jacob Piatt Dunn, Jr., along with William H. English and Daniel W. Howe, reorganized and
                    revitalized what had been a moribund institution—the IHS. For the next forty years, until
                    his death on June 7, 1924, Dunn served the Society as its secretary and during that time used his
                    bookish skills both to edit and produce publications for the statewide membership organization. The
                    Dunn family's service to Indiana's history is witnessed daily at the Society.
                    "The depth of the collection that was acquired by Miss Dunn for the IHS continues to
                    surprise people even today," said current Society library director Bruce L. Johnson.
                    "In most major areas of IHS collecting interest, such as travel literature related to
                    Indiana and the Old Northwest, her ability resulted in a collection that has few, if any,
                    significant gaps."<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    Elliott (Jones) Dunn. Caroline, along with her sister Eleanor, was brought up in a house at 915
                    North <placeName>

                    </placeName> wholesale firm of Jones, McKee &amp; Company. Nearly four years older than her
                    sister, Caroline looked fondly upon her younger sibling. In a paper she wrote for an English class
                    assignment while a student at <placeName>

                    </placeName> University, Caroline Dunn confessed that while growing up she preferred the
                    companionship of an imaginary friend, a "comrade in life" she dubbed Josephine,
                    over that of her baby sister. When the younger sister <list type="footnotes">

                    Josephine's place, and she has kept it ever since," noted Dunn.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At an early age the sisters inherited from their father, a versatile writer on numerous historical
                    subjects, an interest in the state's past. "Father had such an intense interest in
                    the Indiana history that my sister and I just grew up with it," said Caroline Dunn.
                    "I can remember him working on his books … but the thing that interested me most
                    was his study of the Indian languages."<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Her interest in her
                    father's work on the language of the Miami Indians might have been piqued by Jacob
                    Dunn's anointing each of his daughters with Miami names. Eleanor's Miami name,
                    Caroline Dunn recalled, was Pa-pin-djun-wa, which meant "always falling down."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> Caroline also fondly remembered her father's habit of taking her and
                    other children on walks in the country, during which Jacob Dunn often would indulge in his hobby of
                    mushroom collecting.</p>
            <p>Along with a love of Indiana history, Caroline Dunn inherited from her family an introduction to the
                    workings of libraries. Jacob Dunn served as state librarian from 1889 to 1893 and was an original
                    member of the Indiana Public Library Commission. Florence L. Jones, Caroline Dunn's aunt
                    who lived with the family for many years, was head of the school reference department for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library; Caroline Dunn followed in both their footsteps by also working at the
                    two institutions. After graduating from Shortridge High School, Dunn attended <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName> University in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, receiving her bachelor of arts degree in 1923. For the next four years she was
                    employed at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library as an assistant in the children's division.</p>
            <p>Dunn furthered her library career by obtaining in 1928 a bachelor of science degree in library
                    service from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbia</settlement>
                    </placeName> University's School of Library Service. While attending school in <placeName>

                    </placeName> during the winter of 1927-1928, Dunn looked to her future after graduation by writing

                    eastern Indiana town, Dunn settled into a job she would hold for the next eight years. Reminiscing

                    she was able to know, and was known by, everyone in town—from factory executive to
                    plumber. "I realized that I lived in a glass house, people knew a lot about me and
                    undoubtedly discussed me," said Dunn. "I never felt oppressed by it, however, as
                    one hears of many teachers in small towns."<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In December, 1936, Dunn left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and returned to <placeName>

                    </placeName> to take a position as reference librarian with the Indiana State Library's
                    Indiana Division. Although Dunn was one of only two nonpatronage employees at the ISL, a political
                    connection from her days in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Connersville</settlement>
                    </placeName> did aid her in gaining her new post; she later learned that a leading Democrat in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fayette County</region>
                    </placeName> had written a letter touting Dunn for the job.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> After three years
                    at the state library, Dunn was hired by an organization very well known to her and her family. With
                    the death of the William Henry Smith Memorial Library's first librarian, Florence Venn, in
                    August, 1939, the IHS hired Dunn to take over at an initial annual salary of $2,000. In
                    giving Dunn the job Christopher Coleman, director of both the IHS and the Indiana Historical Bureau,
                    offered the hope that the Society library "will be of constantly increasing importance and
                    value and that its development may well be regarded as a worthy life work."<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Dunn fully lived up to Coleman's high expectations, expending much effort over the
                    next thirty-four years to make the IHS library a gem among nonprofit research institutions.</p>
            <p>Dunn's tenure at the Society, according to Johnson, benefited from the "fortunate
                    convergence" of having an IHS library committee and board of trustees willing to support
                    significant library acquisitions and a rare books and manuscripts market regularly offering for sale
                    material of importance in documenting the history of Indiana and the Old Northwest. Of course the
                    library also possessed in Dunn a woman of "rare intelligence and energy who, to her eternal
                    credit and for the benefit of the IHS, took full advantage of these circumstances to help create a
                    remarkable library," Johnson added.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Along with browsing through
                    catalogues and talking with rare book dealers in hopes of finding rare volumes for the
                    library's collection, Dunn discovered that many of the library's
                    "choicest" materials came as gifts. "Sometimes we search them
                    out," she said, "sometimes they come to us. People will write and say they have an
                    ancestor who lived here and they feel something should come back for Indiana." These same
                    people often visited the <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Besides working to strengthen the IHS library's collection, Dunn corresponded with a wide
                    range of scholars, students, and others interested in the state's history. Ruth Dorrel, who
                    worked to catalog the Society library collection from 1969 to 1971 and who is now an IHS editor,
                    remembered that Dunn spent much of her time helping library patrons who wrote or came to do their
                    own research. It was not surprising that people who wanted to know about some aspect of
                    Indiana's past turned to Dunn, noted Dorrel, since she knew the whereabouts of almost every
                    item in the collection.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> During Dunn's years at the Society, countless
                    writers of scholarly works on the history of Indiana and the Old Northwest relied on her for
                    assistance. "One grateful author," recalled Gayle Thornbrough, former Society
                    director, "remarked on the unusual help she had received, calling Miss Dunn a heroine of

            <p>Although she retired from her work at the Society in January, 1973, Dunn maintained a strong presence
                    in the state's history circles by holding the position of secretary of the Society of
                    Indiana Pioneers (a post she held from 1940 to 1990), visiting the IHS and state library, and
                    attending Society conferences. In 1992 she donated back to the IHS an onyx clock and
                    candelabra—wedding presents given to her father and mother by the IHS more than a century
                    ago. After Dunn's death, the Society learned that the former librarian had left the
                    nonprofit, membership organization a substantial bequest. On January 26, 1995, the
                    Society's board of trustees decided that the bequest should be used for constructing a new
                    headquarters building now in its early planning stages. "It is most appropriate that the
                    first major gift toward the building comes from this source," said Peter T. Harstad, IHS
                    executive director. "Both Caroline and her father played positive roles in the growth and
                    development of the Society. Now, through this marvelous gift, the Dunns are also part of the

            <p>She scared the hell out of me. It was summer, 1969.I was interested in Indiana history and searching
                    for a Ph.D. dissertation topic. I knew nothing about primary sources except that I ought to have
                    some. A wise advisor suggested going to see Caroline Dunn.</p>
            <p>I walked up the grand stairs to the main floor of the Indiana State Library and Historical Building
                    and turned left to the large room that then was the William Henry Smith Memorial Library. I quickly
                    found Miss Dunn, since only one other person was in the room. She didn't smile and seemed
                    brusque and uninterested in me. Doubtless, I thought, she had seen lots of my type come and go. With
                    the intense Indiana humidity overpowering the un-air-conditioned room, I began to dread the thought
                    of spending even a day there. Perhaps it was time to seek a dissertation topic in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> history.</p>
            <p>But Miss Dunn—I never, never called her anything else—brought me the papers of
                    Samuel Merrill, the state's first treasurer. I began to read his letters. What a treasure
                    this woman kept. And as I finished one manuscript collection over the days and months and years to
                    come, she brought others. Only later did I realize that her choices were not random, that she was
                    introducing me to the primary sources of early nineteenth-century Indiana history with the skill and
                    knowledge of a professional. Only later did I understand how much she knew about Indiana's
                    history. Only much later did I see her smile.</p>
            <p>No index, finding aid, nor CD-ROM disk could ever do what Caroline Dunn did for me. She was a
                    manuscript librarian who knew her collections, knew how to use them for scholarly research, and even
                    knew how to introduce them to the uninitiated. Sometimes still when I open a Hollinger box
                    anticipating a bountiful harvest of letters, I think of Miss Dunn.</p>

                    Discussions about nationalism and multiculturalism have, in recent years, heightened the intensity
                    with which historians debate the value and function of American history in the college curriculum.
                    In the spring of 1994 two of the major journals for Americanists yielded riches indeed for those
                    concerned with teaching American history. In "Why the West Is Lost," James A.
                    Hijaya queried the structure of U. S. history classes which emphasize the eastern seaboard and the
                    British colonies to the neglect of the rest of the continent.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> John Higham, in
                    "The Future of American History," raised important questions about the continuing
                    centrality of the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and he urged colleagues to search for a cohesive and coherent national history.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Higham noted, however, that historians could similarly pursue a second
                    approach to American history: they could "prepare to follow another subject beyond national
                    lines, toward whatever periphery may help one define its center." He also observed that
                    American history was no longer told entirely as "a national story enclosed in a national
                    arena."’ Higham's eulogy for national histories, however, was unduly
                    premature. While scholarly monographs may offer comparative or transatlantic interpretations of

                    textbooks or syllabi. This article explores the presence of national borders in the teaching and
                    interpreting of American history and suggests that Americanists consider the value of shedding
                    altogether the twin encumbrances of national identity and modern national borders in their
                    conceptualization of the American past.</p>
            <p>Preoccupations with national identity and the rigidity with which historians cling to events within
                    the borders of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> seem particularly odd to those who study the colonial era. Historians interested in the
                    destruction of old societies and the creation of new ones in the Americas are best served by
                    considering the problems of new world societies in transnational contexts. The most valuable context
                    for understanding events in the Americas is an Atlantic one; it was the meeting of people and
                    pathogens from both sides of the Atlantic—from Europe, Africa, and the
                    Americas—that helped dictate patterns and practices of settlement from Tierra del Fuego
                    to Newfoundland.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> An appreciation of the Atlantic region as a coherent whole
                    explains the particular configurations of cultures in the Americas more satisfactorily than do
                    national histories, which obscure the extent to which processes of change were replicated in many
                    parts of the Americas.</p>
            <p>The devotion to national histories, however, is pervasive in the teaching of U.S. history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> today. Symbolic of the neglect of the Atlantic context in U.S. history classes is the
                    status of the Caribbean in history classes and texts. That a case even needs to be made for the
                    inclusion of the Caribbean may seem startling to some, outrageous to others: Latin Americanists
                    teaching in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> automatically include the Caribbean in their survey classes. How it transpired that the
                    Caribbean left North America and joined Latin America is an intriguing question which is closely
                    related to the way in which Americanists center their courses on anachronistic national borders.
                    This fact, combined with the non-participation of the <geogName>British island</geogName> colonies
                    in the American Revolution, resulted in the expulsion of the Caribbean from the history of the
                    continent and the denial of the real cultural, economic, and political connections between the West
                    Indies and North America.</p>
            <p>This article surveys the current place of Caribbean history in three different types of U.S. history
                    courses: the US. history survey (which remains the bread-and-butter course for Americanists); the
                    upper-level colonial survey; and the survey of the Revolutionary period. Discussion will then turn
                    to the historiographic conventions which continue to exclude the Caribbean and will conclude by
                    proposing an alternative approach to the study of colonial British <list type="footnotes">

            <p>Historians engaged in the teaching of North American history to American students confront the
                    problem of teaching history to students who are seeking their own heritage. In the words of David
                    Lowenthal, "History tells all who listen what supposedly happened, suggesting how things
                    came to be as they are. Heritage passes on exclusive myths of origin and continuity, endowing a
                    select group with power and prestige."<hi rend="sup">6</hi> A critical examination of a
                    distant past appeals to many students less than a search for answers to contemporary concerns.
                    Jingoistic American college students have an interest in history that is at times genealogical. They
                    are, with few exceptions, relentless Whig historians in that they would rather explore those aspects
                    of the past that endured into the present than consider the paths not taken. Students feel little
                    compunction in leaping across the centuries to announce that because a certain condition existed in
                    the seventeenth century it offers an exact explanation of a contemporary problem. One student noted
                    that the French introduction of alcohol to Indians in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> precisely explained the heavy rates of alcoholism on twentieth-century reservations in
                    the Dakotas. Particular contexts mattered little. Indeed, by the same logic, students in
                    introductory classes happily employ their modern stereotypes in their analysis of the past: one
                    student who contended that all English people are and have always been "extremely
                    snooty" found this observation to be a persuasive explanation for economic conditions in

                            letter for the necessary distance of the historian from the time period under study: the
                            historian, he observed, is always an outsider, a foreigner to the past.</item>

                            material covered in their survey classes, raises interesting questions about the tenacity of
                            popular cultural icons. Michael Frisch observed that students in his survey classes at
                            SUNY-Buffalo possessed a body of knowledge about American history almost entirely divorced
                            from material they had actually learned in high school or college. He published his findings
                            in an article entitled "American History and the Structures of Collective Memory: A
                            Modest Exercise in Empirical Iconography," <hi rend="i">Journal of American

                    eagerness with which students make such connections shows us that they find important meaning in the
                    patterns and stories of the past. In time, perhaps, the material we offer for their rumination might
                    encroach on and alter their myths of an American past.</p>
            <p>The students’ genealogical perspective often results in an intense study of their
                    country's history. This involvement can be a mixed blessing: while it is appealing to teach
                    a curious and engaged group of college students, the most frequently displayed consequence of their
                    personal interest is an anachronistic and partisan absorption in the past. A professor at the
                    University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> forbids his students to use the phrase "this great nation of ours" at
                    any point over the course of the semester—and this is in undergraduate courses which
                    never stray beyond the period of the Civil War. I do not, know a single Americanist who has not
                    found his students using the first person plural pronoun to refer to colonists’ behavior
                    in the period from 1763-1776, as in "why <hi rend="i">we</hi> dumped tea in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> Harbor," or the British infringement on "<hi rend="i">our</hi>" rights. Although in this decade of new age beliefs one should never rule out the
                    possibility of a student's reincarnation, it seems nonetheless imperative that teachers of
                    American history devise means to enable their students to shed their relentless parochialism,
                    disengage themselves from the patriotic zeal that mars their critical approach to the past, and open
                    themselves to the historical context in which events occurred.</p>
            <p>There are a number of solutions to this problem of partisan heritage versus detached history. One is
                    to approach the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from a world history perspective, in which students are encouraged to appreciate the
                    patterns of change that transcend modern national borders. This approach might help eliminate the
                    narcissistic sense students have of American exceptionalism. But to include the world in a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history survey is asking a lot of teachers already taxed to accommodate as many
                    perspectives as possible in a single semester. Even integrating the various component parts of the
                    Atlantic world in a responsible manner is a burden if the course description requires an instructor
                    to bring students to the Civil War by semester's end. A more viable alternative is to
                    incorporate a relevant and significant neighboring region, one that merits inclusion by virtue of
                    historical ties and regional proximity—the Caribbean. Culture, economy, politics, and
                    trade drew the Caribbean and North America together historically. The British West Indies in the
                    seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were hardly a sideshow to the history of the other British

                    is a general discussion of three different courses commonly taught in American colleges and
                    universities. Discussions with colleagues, reviews of the most popular textbooks, and shared syllabi

                    </placeName> offer upper-level classes for undergraduates on the colonial and Revolutionary periods.
                    These classes range in time periods and topics to reflect instructors’ interests and
                    areas of expertise. Courses on the colonial period might emphasize colonial British America, or
                    might take a comparative approach to the different colonial cultures in North America. They might
                    end in 1750 or continue through the Revolutionary war. Courses on the age of the American Revolution
                    reflect less variation in chronology—they tend to cover the period from 1750 to 1800 or
                    1816.</p>
            <p>In the case of the colonial survey it is difficult to imagine a course on colonial North America that
                    omits the Caribbean colonies. The Caribbean colonies were, after all, the most valuable in the
                    nascent British empire, and every colony hoped to replicate the financial windfall first

                    world, colonialist Timothy Breen dismissed the relevance of the eighteenth-century Caribbean
                    colonies even as he worked to craft an Atlantic approach to his topic. Breen, a highly regarded
                    scholar who has written widely on a variety of regions and periods in colonial America, asserted
                    that the island colonies were insignificant and had no settler societies, no press, no interest in a
                    discussion on natural rights that was carried on in every other part of the British empire. When

            <p>One colonial text makes a more forceful case for a continuing focus on the mainland. Now in its

                        America: Essays in Politics and Social Development</hi>, a book designed for undergraduate
                    colonial courses, stands as a reasonable litmus test of the interests of its editors (and
                    publisher). The first edition (1971) contained no articles that could be considered Atlantic in
                    scope: all twenty-two essays concerned events in the thirteen mainland colonies. The second edition
                    (1976) dropped ten of the original essays to make room for more attention to the different people of
                    early America but offered no conceptual shift in the organization of the volume. The third edition
                    (1983) added essays overall and made welcome additions in providing greater context for English

                    residents of all parts of the British empire. The inclusion of colonies that did not join the
                    Revolutionary enterprise offers students an understanding of the ways in which individuals made
                    choices and faced constraints on their behavior in the Revolutionary era. An appreciation of the
                    limitations on revolutionary thought and behavior clarifies the nature and meaning of the break with
                    Britain on the part of the thirteen mainland colonies. New and interesting scholarship on the
                    Caribbean is accessible to integrate all parts of the empire without returning to the anglocentric
                    approach of the imperial school.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> The imperial school was itself a
                    nineteenth-century reaction to parochial national histories, and it found one of its most expressive

                    reveals an exclusive emphasis on the mainland colonies. Indeed, the Loyalists who represented 20
                    percent of the mainland population are lucky to receive any attention at all. Edward

            <p>In history courses centered on colonial and Revolutionary America, the case for the Caribbean is
                    strong, and thus the absence of material is disturbing. The biggest problem in ascertaining the
                    place of Caribbean history or an Atlantic context in U.S. history courses lies in the traditional
                    two-part introductory American history survey. I will address below the typical first half of the
                    U.S. history survey which covers the period from 1607 to 1865 or 1877, a finishing date denoting
                    either the end of the Civil War or the end of radical Reconstruction. Teaching a history course
                    about a country which did not exist for a large portion of the time covered, of course, poses a
                    vexing problem, which most teachers and textbooks resolve by focusing only on the thirteen mainland
                    colonies who joined to fight against <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The starting date itself signals the anglocentric perspective of the survey class,
                    which in most schools commences with the founding of Jamestown. This approach centers on the
                    experience of the thirteen mainland colonies and explores the creation of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in an east-west trajectory. Such a perspective implies that the English invented
                    colonization from scratch: without an appreciation of' the earlier and simultaneous
                    colonial efforts of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, Portugal, the Netherlands, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, college students in American universities have little perspective in which to place
                    English colonial efforts. The anglocentric, Atlantic seaboard approach to the survey class,
                    furthermore, contributes to Americans' archaic misconception of' the bulk of North
                    America as empty land waiting for settlement. Inclusion of the Caribbean and the circum-Caribbean
                    might help students to appreciate the nexus of variables shaping settlement, the enduring patterns
                    of licit and illicit trade between rival powers, the varieties of coerced servitude, and the
                    alternatives to English colonial behavior on the mainland that, in the deterministic view of college
                    students, are foregone conclusions.</p>
            <p>Given the importance of the Caribbean, it is somewhat discouraging that so little attention seems to
                    be paid to the region. An informal survey of seven U.S. history textbooks yielded depressing results
                    for the current place of Caribbean history in the U.S. history survey. In the obligatory first

                    little hope for broadening the perspective of either teacher or student. Only a complete
                    reconceptualization of the function of the survey will overcome these biases. For example, given the
                    difficulty of teaching a history class about a country which does not yet exist, perhaps the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> survey course could be reconfigured as a study of the contest of cultures in North
                    America: an exploration of French, English, Spanish, Dutch, and Native American interactions in
                    North America and the Caribbean would provide a context for explaining later political and social
                    developments in North America at least as sufficient as the traditional thirteen colonies approach.
                    Ideally, however, I would propose a course not on the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> alone but on the Atlantic world as a whole, at least for the period through the age of
                    Revolution.</p>
            <p>The reasons posed above for the inclusion of the West Indies in U.S. courses have the unfortunate
                    effect of making the Caribbean seem like a sideshow, a corrective to American provincialism. In
                    fact, the intellectual reasons for including the Caribbean are far more compelling than the
                    pedagogical motives might be. Any discussion of British America that omits the West Indies renders
                    incomplete the portrayal of the British Atlantic world in the early modern period, and a parallel
                    argument could be made for Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and French America. A variety of
                    circumstances in the historiography of early America have contributed to the ease with which the
                    Caribbean is eliminated from North American studies.</p>

            <p>What makes the task of integration seem particularly daunting is, in part, the regional approach
                    historians employ in analyzing the colonial period. Anachronistic national and regional borders have
                    created pedagogical and scholarly conventions that stand in opposition to the vital economic,
                    political, and cultural ties across the ocean, from colony to colony, and among different European
                    powers. A study of the people involved in colonial ventures, as opposed to the specific sites of
                    those ventures, brings this point home forcefully. Those who ventured from <placeName>

                    </placeName> to the Americas did not see the colonial world in simple regional dichotomies. By
                    looking at people, not just places, it is possible to see a very different Atlantic sphere from that
                    depicted in U.S. history courses, a sphere in which participants in colonial experiments moved with
                    surprising alacrity from region to region, and one in which the Caribbean can be restored to its
                    rightful place in an appreciation of early modern Anglo-America.</p>
            <p>A regional emphasis is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the study of early American
                    history. Historians write monographs on single towns, counties, or colonies and, more importantly,
                    they use these regions as the primary lens through which to interpret early America.
                    Seventeenth-century colonial British America has been divided into four distinct areas of settlement
                    by scholars: New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the Chesapeake, the Middle Colonies, and the Caribbean. New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> was distinguished by its settlement in a period of twelve years, from 1630 to 1642, by
                    nuclear families who established stable political and religious institutions soon after their
                    arrival. The Chesapeake and the Caribbean, on the other hand, witnessed much greater political and
                    demographic instability as primarily young, male emigrant populations sought viable export crops to
                    market overseas. The Caribbean colonies, with the introduction of sugar, developed into elaborate
                    plantation societies with large slave populations, monoculture, and a small planter elite. The
                    Middle Colonies were characterized by heterogeneity: these colonies have often been heralded as
                    models of pluralist American society with their welter of religious groups, their variety of
                    European populations, and their standards of toleration. In monographs and articles, historians of
                    early America generally focus on one of these regions.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    In his cultural interpretation of the origins of American society, David Hackett Fischer has divided
                    colonial America into four different regions: New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the Chesapeake, the Middle Colonies, and the backcountry. Fischer's book,
                    Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America, explores twenty-four different categories
                    of folkways ("the normative structures of values, customs, and meanings that exist in any
                        culture").<hi rend="sup">20</hi> These folkways include patterns of childrearing,
                    childrearing, costume, housebuilding, speech, and understandings of liberty. Fischer traces
                    twenty-four different folkways in these four different regions to four corresponding regions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> culture, that is, was shaped entirely by the culture of East Anglia; Chesapeake society
                    was determined by the folkways of southern and western <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, and so on. Fischer's colonists transported intact, along with their
                    miscellaneous assortment of personal possessions, the folk practices of a particular region and had
                    no difficulty at all in exactly reproducing their culture in a new and vastly unfamiliar land
                    already inhabited by an indigenous population and soon to be peopled as well by Africans and other
                    non-English Europeans. In Fischer's world, all attributes of colonial society were defined
                    by local practices in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. His colonial societies do not evolve, they do not adapt, they simply parallel English
                    society.</p>
            <p>The regional focus has spawned another characteristic of early American historiography: the puzzling
                    inconsistency with which colonialists explore divergences and convergences between colonies and
                    metropole in the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Anglo-American world. Those historians who
                    study the seventeenth century draw on the regional schemes mentioned above to delineate the vast
                    divergences between different regions of the British Atlantic world. Colonialists call repeated
                    attention to the remarkable diversity of British colonization efforts as English men and women
                    cultivated their plantations of religion and plantations of trade. Historians who study the
                    eighteenth century, perhaps in their eagerness to account for the union of the thirteen mainland
                    colonies at the time of the American Revolution, emphasize the convergences between the different
                    regions of the Atlantic world. A variety of models have been put forth to consider the
                    eighteenth-century evolution of the British colonies, and it is particularly in the search for an
                    emerging and distinctive colonial identity that the British West Indies and <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> have confounded historians. The great irony is that at the very time British colonists
                    fought a Revolution, they are perceived by historians as most English, while in the century in which
                    most colonists were in fact English by birth, <list type="footnotes">

                    This type of analysis is unnecessarily complicated and cumbersome.</p>
            <p>What I would like to offer below is an exploration of these two related problems in the study of
                    early American history by focusing on the first century of British colonization in the Atlantic, a
                    time when participants who were primarily English by birth moved with ease from one region of
                    colonial America to another. Drawing on a collective biography of five thousand voyagers who
                    traveled from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> to all the English colonies in 1635, I propose below some new ways of considering the
                    first English Atlantic forays through the eyes of participants, who demonstrated through their
                    actions an appreciation of the opportunities and integrity of the Atlantic world and who saw, as
                    historians so rarely do today, the clear connections between the Caribbean colonies and the mainland
                    colonies. Over the course of the year 1635, these travelers left the port of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> on fifty-four different ships for the colonies of <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. When they reached their destinations, those who survived scattered again over the
                    course of three decades to other, new regions of the colonial world—the
                            <placeName>
                  <country reg="bf">Bahamas</country>, <region type="state" reg="nju">New

                        <country reg="jm">Jamaica</country>
                    </placeName>. Their names and ages were recorded by clerks at the port of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and the experiences of these individuals have been traced in colonial records on both
                    sides of the Atlantic. In their repeated journeys from colony to colony and from colony to
                    metropole, many of these voyagers signaled an understanding of a unified colonial world that offered
                    myriad compelling opportunities of different sorts, whether the pursuit of piety or the quest for
                    riches and status. The vignettes presented below are intended to represent the experiences of some
                    of these travelers, and to suggest broader themes of colonial development in the early modern
                        period.<hi rend="sup">21</hi>

            <p>Certainly, many immigrants chose their destinations with care. It was no accident that those of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Island in the 1630s. But even these godly planters debated their chosen destination:

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> exiles, many of whom also sought sanctuary in the Caribbean and Bermuda. All three
                    regions promised pious homes, and colony officers were acutely aware of the competition for souls.

            <p>But too many immigrants knew too little about their destinations to make the conscious decisions
                    about where their "type" might belong. The stories of three servants who traveled
                    overseas seem particularly revealing on this point. Indentured servitude brought most people to the
                    colonial world in the first part of the seventeenth century; probably as much as 75 percent of the
                    total number of immigrants to the British colonies traveled as servants whose time would be
                    purchased by men and women in the new world. As the examples attest, these servants chose and

                    does to those reading about the voyages. There was an extensive process of reshuffling in the
                    colonies that involved not only short-distance migration within a single colony or to an adjacent
                    colony but required much more elaborately planned relocations from <placeName>

            <p>Atlantic crossings themselves were uncomfortable endeavors. Voyages could last anywhere from six to
                    fourteen weeks, depending on destination and winds. Simply leaving the shores of <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> proved difficult for many ships. Richard Mather, a prominent New <placeName>

                    </placeName> minister, recorded in his diary the efforts of his ship, the <hi rend="i">James</hi>,

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>. The ship had been stranded in the Bristol harbor for six weeks while waiting for fair
                    winds to depart, and the unfortunate passengers got violently seasick as the ship waited at anchor.
                    When the wind seemed to blow in a favorable direction, Mather recorded, the captain and seamen were
                    never available to sail the ship. When the <hi rend="i">James</hi> finally sailed, the wind turned,
                    and the small convoy of New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>-bound ships tacked and sailed around in the Channel while everyone on board got

            <p>The servants who composed the majority of immigrants in the seventeenth century suffered particularly
                    during Atlantic voyages. They often boarded ships with only the clothes on their backs.
                    Undernourished, they were vulnerable to shipboard diseases. Thomas Rous described a gruesome voyage
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName> in 1638. Rous's letter captured the many problems in overseas travel:
                    unscrupulous merchants who shortchanged their passengers, poor weather, lack of adequate clothing,
                    contamination by passengers, and the initial diseases of the migrating population. Over 350 people
                    set off for <placeName>
                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName>, a number originally thought viable because of the "great bulk" of
                    the ship, "but," as Rous reported, "such a sort of people and soe many of
                    them togeather wth noe shift would soone grow nastye and infect one another having alsoe noe clothes
                    must keep below in cold weather and soe taint themselves and the ship." Two hundred people
                    were sick at one time, Rous lamented, and the crew "have throwen overboard two and three in
                    a day for many dayes togeather that in all we lost fourescoare of our people." Even the
                    wealthy were not protected: of the ten men in the "great cabin," who had thought
                    themselves better off, six had died after only three weeks at sea. In fact, the privileged men in
                    the cabin died at a greater rate than did the people crowded together below deck.<hi rend="sup">28</hi>

            <p>Despite the vast discomforts of Atlantic voyages, English men and women journeyed from colony to
                    colony and from <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> to various colonies with surprising ease. Some segments of the population were
                    disproportionately likely to move repeatedly. Ministers, for example, formed a significant
                    population of what we might consider the frequent fliers of the seventeenth century. John
                    Oxen-bridge offers a good example of such movement. Oxenbridge was a minister of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Puritan</settlement>
                    </placeName> leanings who traveled to Bermuda in 1635. Religious conflict on the
                    island—Oxenbridge was considered an overzealous catechizer—led to the
                    minister's departure for <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>

                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName> symbolized the aspirations of many Atlantic migrants who hoped similarly to benefit

                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName> sugar revolution. Bermudians Severin Vicars and Martin Welman, who had lived on the
                    island for twenty years, left Bermuda in the 1640s to purchase land in <placeName>
                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName> and maintained residences in both colonies.</p>
            <p>These men—ministers, planters, and merchants—rested at the top of the economic
                    hierarchy in the colonies. Yet movement was not restricted to the wealthy. People of all ranks moved
                    on: in fact, one could argue that economic misfortune was a major factor in determining a
                    colonist's decision to do so. Of the fifty travelers to Bermuda from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1635 for whom information survives 20 percent were actually returning home to
                    Bermuda in that trip, while another 20 percent subsequently moved off the island to settle in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the <placeName>

                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>What all this movement suggests is that the differences between regions that stand out so
                    dramatically in descriptions of the colonial world were differences that contemporaries may have
                    acknowledged, but they certainly were not distinctions that persuaded many English men and women
                    that they could not enjoy equal access to the possible wealth in newly settled lands. Any approach
                    to the colonial world which focuses on single regions within the diversity of British colonization
                    efforts in the Atlantic overlooks the important ways in which the colonial world was composed not of
                    isolated subcultures but of interlocking and overlapping communities. Furthermore, this movement
                    makes clear the extent to which oceans were not barriers but, rather, bridges, in this formative
                    period of colonial development. The movement of colonial residents and visitors should serve as an
                    important reminder to Americanists of the variables shaping new world societies, and it should above
                    all serve as a caution to those who would let the regional dichotomies cherished in early American
                    historiography blind them to the larger forces shaping settlement, colonization, and migration in
                    the Atlantic basin.</p>
            <p>The colonial world was one characterized by movement across the Atlantic and between colonies. The
                    circular tours these Atlantic migrants took of the colonial world reaffirmed their continuing ties
                    to <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and ensured frequent and meaningful contact with the values and expectations of
                    metropolitan society. The Atlantic migrants, furthermore, symbolize the dynamic nature of the early
                        <pb n="178" id="VAA4025-091-2-032"/> colonial world and, in moving from colony to colony,
                    suggest that we discard models of American development that emphasize the experience of any one
                    region. From the perspective of the immigrants themselves, this was truly an Atlantic world in which
                    many of those who were poor, desperate, or brave enough to cross the ocean once were undaunted by
                    the prospect of subsequent migrations by land or sea. Teachers of American history should take their
                    example to heart.</p>

                    </placeName> history? These are the two separate, if related, questions posed by Alison
                    Games's plea for a reorientation in the teaching of these courses. Similar kinds of
                    questions have been paramount in a larger and increasingly intense debate within the American
                    historical establishment over what ought to constitute "American"; that is (following our
                    traditional and parochial definition of that term), pre—<placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history. This debate has arisen out of two sources. First is the worldwide movement
                    among professional historians over the past generation toward a broader approach to the past, an
                    approach that considers both genders, all ages, all social and ethnic groups, all regions, and all
                    forms of human experience. Second is the related and increasingly powerful emphasis upon the
                    cultural diversity of the populations and regions of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Among historians of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, these two developments have together generated a widespread conviction that Americans
                    need a more inclusive national history that takes such diversity into account. What is principally
                    at issue at the moment is what form this history should take.</p>
            <p>The position that seems to be emerging as the dominant one is that American history ought to be the
                    history of all the peoples who have occupied the geographical area that became the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. These include not just the Europeans and their descendants who settled the thirteen
                    English colonies on the eastern seaboard, but also the many native groups of Amerindians on the
                    North American continent and Hawaiians in <placeName>

                    </placeName> who had long occupied their areas before the Europeans arrived. Such an approach also
                    includes the large numbers of Africans and their descendants, the vast majority of whom before 1865
                    worked as legally voiceless slaves; as well as other Europeans and their descendants—the

            <p>There is much to be said on behalf of this <hi rend="i">national state perspective.</hi> In
                    particular, in contrast to older approaches, it focuses attention upon not just the English but the
                    British, European, African, Amerindian, and Asian roots of American culture. The broader perspective
                    requires historians at last to try to analyze systematically the complex process by which American
                    culture became the product of an intricate and still continuing process of negotiation among groups
                    from related European cultures and from radically different non-western cultures. For those
                    historians who are mainly interested in the question of how we have gotten to where we are, and who
                    are principally concerned with understanding the <hi rend="i">national</hi> experience or with
                    creating a <hi rend="i">national</hi> past, this perspective may be sufficient. For those historians
                    who resist the conception of history as the history of national states and cultures or who regard
                    themselves as students of other entities, however, the national state perspective appears to be
                    limiting, anachronistic, and only slightly less parochial than the history it is replacing.</p>
            <p>Historians of Amerindians provide one important example. The history of aboriginal America, America
                    before the intensive penetration of Europeans and Africans, simply cannot be contained within
                    contemporary national boundaries. Like medieval and early modern Europe and Africa in the same
                    period, aboriginal America consisted of a large number and an enormously complex array of shifting
                    political and cultural entities that, in contrast to Europe and Africa, were spread over not one but
                    two huge continents and many adjacent islands. Each of these entities occupied a particular area
                    with cultural orientations and forms of economic, social, and political organizations that were, at
                    least to some extent, peculiar to it.</p>
            <p>The histories of those who always lived entirely within the boundaries of a single contemporary
                    national state presumably can be told within the parameters of the national history of that state,
                    but the histories of those many groups who were so inconsiderate of later geopolitical developments
                    as to occupy areas on both sides of a subsequent boundary between states cannot. Though the
                    histories of such groups are indivisible, the national state perspective can, if it remains true to
                    the logic that underlies it, exclude from the history of a state any segments of those groups that
                    remained in or fled to areas that never became part of that state.</p>
            <p>If such artificial and anachronistic divisions of the histories of particular Amerindian groups make
                    no sense from the perspective <pb n="181" id="VAA4025-091-2-035"/> of Amerindian historians, the
                    focus, characteristic of the national state perspective, on only those Amerindians who lived within
                    the boundaries of those states greatly inhibits understanding of the richness and diversity of
                    Amerindian cultures. To mention only one of the most striking examples, many different types of
                    Amerindian societies existed within the area that became the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, from relatively sedentary agricultural or marine societies to nomadic hunting and
                    gathering societies with various forms and levels of political organization appropriate to the ways
                    they sustained themselves. But there were no complex and sophisticated imperial states of the sort
                    that existed in central Mexico and the Andes. Obviously, a comprehension of the full variety and
                    range of the history of aboriginal America requires its practitioners to ignore modern national
                    boundaries and to look comparatively at societies throughout the Americas.</p>
            <p>Historians writing from a national perspective may use the work of Amerindian historians to encourage
                    an appreciation of those societies that have resided in the area of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and to provide the descendants of those Amerindian groups who survived their encounters
                    with Europeans a sense of their place in and continuing relevance to the national experience of the
                    country. These are laudable goals in themselves that enable historians to rewrite the history of the
                    country from the point of view of the conquered as well as the conquerors, to conceive of it not
                    only in the traditional sense of how the West was won but also (in the catchy course title used by
                    Amy Turner Bushnell for her course in Amerindian history) of' how the East was lost. Quite
                    apart from its relationship to the history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, however, Amerindian history has an integrity—and a
                    perspective—of its own, one that demands consideration of Amerindian groups in relation
                    to each other as well as to the European and African invaders who began to intrude upon their world
                    in the late fifteenth century. Amerindian history can best be written from not a national but a
                    continental or, preferably, hemispheric perspective.</p>
            <p>Similar kinds of observations can be made about the pre-national state histories of the activities of
                    European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. During the three-and-a-half centuries
                    following <placeName>

                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, managed to establish, initially almost always through the activities of individual
                    nationals with little state investment, their political and cultural hegemony over almost the whole
                    of the Americas. Even in the many places where Europeans and their descendants never predominated
                    numerically, this hegemony was always, in important but varying degrees, manifest in the
                    reconfiguration of American <pb n="182" id="VAA4025-091-2-036"/> social landscapes along European
                    lines and the emergence of European-style polities replete with European legal systems and
                    institutions.</p>
            <p>Both separately and as a whole the histories of the several European Americas can be, like the
                    history of aboriginal America, thoroughly understood only in terms of contemporary frames of
                    reference and comparison. In the case of colonial English or (after the union of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and <placeName>

                    </placeName> in 1707) British America, the contemporary frame of reference included more than the
                    thirteen colonies that the English established along the North American coast and that subsequently
                    formed the <placeName>

               </placeName>, and St. John, now Prince Edward Island). In addition colonial
                    British America included several long-established social entities that were in the process of
                    becoming colonies: permanent fishing settlements in Newfoundland; fur trading posts in Hudson Bay
                    and in the <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName> and <geogName>Ohio</geogName> and <geogName>Mississippi

                    </placeName> on the coast of Central America. In turn British America was part of an even larger
                    British imperial world that included not just the home kingdoms of <placeName>
                  <country reg="enk">England</country>, <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Historians have found it convenient to construct the history of colonial British America in terms of
                    several distinctive regions, each composed of two or more colonies and defined by the nature of the
                    ecological zones they occupied, the kinds of socioeconomic activities the inhabitants developed to
                    sustain themselves, and the sociocultural landscapes and demographic regimes they established in
                    pursuit of those activities. Each of these regions—the Chesapeake, New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>, the West Indies, the Middle Colonies, the Lower South, and the <geogName>Atlantic
                        island</geogName> colonies—was peculiar. Each region drew large numbers of immigrants
                    from Britain, but only in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> did English people constitute an overwhelming majority of the population. People of
                    African descent, present in significant numbers throughout colonial British America, were a <pb n="183" id="VAA4025-091-2-037"/> majority in the <geogName>Atlantic islands</geogName> and a
                    vast majority in the West Indies and the coastal areas of the Lower South. Staple agriculture and
                    slave labor were prominent in the economies of most of the colonies from the Chesapeake southward,
                    while mixed farming with family labor predominated in those of the Middle colonies and New <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these important differences, all of the regions formed part of the large cultural
                    complex that we now call colonial British America. Each colony in this complex was constitutionally
                    connected to Great Britain, and inhabitants of all the colonies were subjects of the British crown.
                    In form and substance the political institutions of each colony were British, and the vast majority
                    of the free governing population—members of families who were not slaves and whose male
                    members were entitled to participate in political life and enjoyed the benefit of existing
                    laws—was British, with strong claims to a British identity as people who lived in liberty
                    under a parliamentary government of laws to which the free inhabitants had given their consent.
                    Proud to be the heirs of British political traditions. they debated public issues in terms of
                    British political ideologies, made and enforced laws in a British style, and lived under a legal
                    system that, whatever peculiarities had developed in response to local conditions, was distinctively
                    British. Like Britons in the home islands, they were overwhelmingly Protestant in religion.</p>
            <p>Reinforcing these powerful political and cultural tics were equally strong economic links. Most
                    colonies looked to Britain as a major market—often the <hi rend="i">only</hi> overseas
                    market—for their products and as the principal source for the goods and skills they
                    needed to build societies in the New World. Within this expanded British world, trade goods,
                    information, correspondence, and people flowed freely and extensively back and forth across the
                    Atlantic and through the intercolonial trading and communications networks that increasingly bound
                    the colonies to each other as well as to Britain.</p>
            <p>Of the many parts of the vast cultural complex of colonial British America, the British political and
                    commercial establishment most valued the plantation colonies in the Chesapeake, the Lower South,
                    and, most especially, the West Indies. Both because of their proximity to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>'s wealthy American empire and because the Caribbean was the scene of the most
                    intense economic and naval competition among the British, French, and Spanish throughout the
                    colonial era, British officials regarded the West Indian colonies as the most strategically
                    significant of' the American colonies. Equally important, in terms of ‘their
                    economic worth to Britain, the West Indian colonies also enjoyed pride of place. <placeName>
                        <country reg="bb">Barbados</country>
                    </placeName>, earliest of the sugar colonies, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="jm">Jamaica</country>
                    </placeName>, largest of the British sugar colonies, were the most valued colonics in the eighteenth
                        <pb n="184" id="VAA4025-091-2-038"/> century. For the North American colonies, these and other
                    West Indian colonies were the source of sugar and molasses for a growing distilling industry and a
                    substantial market for fish, animals, cereal, lumber, and some manufactured products. A vigorous
                    exchange in such products, in slaves, in the free population, and in information closely linked the
                    continental colonies and the West Indies.</p>
            <p>Colonial Spanish America was even more extensive and culturally far richer and more complex than
                    colonial British America. Its principal centers were in New <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName> (now Mexico) and Peru, each of which had long been a viceroyalty with several
                    territorial audiencias under its jurisdiction. Other less important areas were organized into
                    captaincy generals. Within these various political entities, Spaniards and their creole
                    (American-born) descendants used Indian or imported African labor in mining, ranching, and
                    agricultural activities that supported elaborate societies and yielded extensive riches that were

                    </placeName>. In one form or another, colonial Spanish America reached from the eastern Caribbean to
                    the Pacific and from the southernmost point of South America north to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>

            <p>Other European powers also presided over similar, if less extensive, cultural complexes. Colonial

                    </placeName>, Surinam, New Netherlands, and several West <geogName>Indian islands</geogName>. By the
                    mid-eighteenth century, however, it was confined to a few Caribbean settlements, Surinam on the
                    mainland and Curacao and several smaller islands.</p>
            <p>These several colonial European Americas were in no sense self-contained worlds. Among adjacent
                    island colonies and along international borders between continental colonies, economic interaction
                    was constant and commercial and religious rivalry common. At these points of
                    interaction—between, for instance, Spanish <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="flu">Florida</region>
                    </placeName> and British Carolina and <placeName>

                    </placeName>—neighboring political entities directly interacted with one another. Their
                    exchanges revolved around competition for Amerindian goods, souls, and allegiance; struggles over
                    territory; disputes over runaway slaves; and clandestine trading. In these interactions, the
                    histories of these several colonial European Americas came together to form part of a larger story
                    of conflict and competition over America.</p>
            <pb n="185" id="VAA4025-091-2-039"/>
            <p>At the same time, however, the histories of such colonies must be understood principally in terms of
                    their relationship not to adjacent colonies belonging to another European America but to the
                    specific European America of which they formed a part and to which they were, in the deepest
                    cultural sense, intimately tied. To be fully comprehended within its contemporary context the
                    history of any segment of these European Americas thus must be placed within a framework provided by
                    the full range of experiences within the national cultural complex to which it belonged.</p>
            <p>A history of any one of these European Americas that does not include the histories of each of its
                    many component parts is incomplete. For that reason, a full appreciation of the history of colonial
                    British America cannot fail to include histories of the West Indian colonies. They represent an
                    important part of that history, and not only because <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName> authorities thought of them as the strategically and economically most significant part
                    of the British colonial world but also, and most importantly, because their experiences were an
                    integral part of the history of that world and represented a major variation within it.</p>
            <p>This broad pan-British perspective on colonial British America is scarcely a new one. During the
                    first half of the century, Charles M. Andrews and Leonard W. Labaree emphasized the unities between
                    those British colonies in America that became part of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and those that did not. They wrote about colonial political and constitutional
                    developments as if the histories of the West Indian and continental colonies in those areas were
                    interchangeable—as they were.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> In the early 1940s, Max Savelle

            <p>Among most historians of the subject, colonial British America has thus remained largely the history
                    of the minority of British colonies that revolted in 1776. Colonial history is nothing more than the

                    non-revolting colonies is at best peripheral. By taking such an approach, historians are
                    differentiating between separate parts of the same history merely because those parts did not wind
                    up—or so far have not wound up—as part of the same national state. In doing so
                    they condemn themselves to produce a history of colonial British America that is at once partial,
                    parochial, and anachronistic.</p>

                    or peripheries of the much larger Spanish and French American worlds that constituted their
                    contemporary frame of reference and to which they belonged.</p>
            <p>This is a major enterprise that can best be approached as an exercise not in national state history
                    but in comparative colonial history. My own advocacy of such a history goes back a long way: to my
                    study of colonial Latin American and Brazilian history as a graduate student, my teaching of
                    comparative colonial history at Western Reserve University in the early 1960s, and my unsuccessful
                    efforts, in collaboration with my colleague Charles Gibson, to form an institute for the comparative
                    study of the colonial histories of the Americas in association with the William L. Clements Library
                    at the University of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in the mid-1960s. My growing conviction that such a history could only be written from
                    a broad transatlantic perspective that comprehended European and African as well as American
                    developments informed the Atlantic History and Culture Program that my colleagues and I created at
                    Johns Hopkins University in the early 1970s. For more than a quarter century, this program has
                    encouraged graduate students to take a broad comparative Atlantic approach to the histories not just
                    of early modern American colonies but of societies and polities throughout the Atlantic world from
                    the fifteenth century to the present.</p>
            <p>But this approach is not typical of graduate programs in early, much less in later, American history,
                    and, for that reason alone, I <pb n="188" id="VAA4025-091-2-042"/> am skeptical that Professor Games
                    will get very far with her proposal to substitute a course with a broad Atlantic focus for the
                    present <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> survey with its national state perspective. Before that proposal could succeed,
                    historians who teach that survey would have to undergo a massive conversion involving a fundamental
                    reconception of the history American students ought to be taught. Still imprisoned within a national
                    state conception of the past, multiculturalists are unlikely to stimulate such a sweeping change.</p>
            <p>With regard to the sort of reorientation of colonial history courses Professor Games advocates, I am
                    somewhat more sanguine. As more historians of early modern British, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and
                    Dutch America come to understand that the integrity of their subjects requires them to move beyond a
                    conception of colonial history as nothing more than a prelude to national history, more colonial
                    history courses may come to resemble those taught by Professor Games and her mentor, Richard Dunn,
                    and by some of my former students and me. Additionally, the <hi rend="i">William and Mary
                    Quarterly</hi>, the principal journal for colonial history in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, may rise farther above the national state and parochial implications of its subtitle
                    as "A Magazine of Early American History and Culture"; textbooks for colonial history
                    courses may become more inclusive; and more comparative colonial or even early modern Atlantic
                    history courses may appear in college and university catalogues. Only if and when these developments
                    take place will the West Indian colonies once again hold the central place they occupied throughout
                    the long history of colonial British America during the early modern era.</p>

                    although no clear record remains as to which specific (and probably disreputable) qualities the
                    "hoosier" label referred, that nickname, like the others, was doubtless meant as a
                    form of sarcastic disparagement.</p>
            <p>But time smooths even rough frontier ways, and today the citizens of Indiana proudly proclaim
                    themselves "Hoosiers," even if they are not exactly sure what a
                    "Hoosier" originally was. Given Indiana's adoption of the term, it might
                    seem wiser not to inquire too deeply about the derivation of the nickname, but ever since the 1830s
                    Hoosiers have felt an irresistible urge to speculate on possible antecedents for their unusual
                    moniker.</p>
            <p>As early as 1848, John Russell Bartlett's <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Americanisms</hi>
                    presented an anecdotal etymology from a correspondent of the <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>, <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
               </placeName>, Journal,
                    who suggested that the word "hoosier" developed in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> from the western slang expression "husher," a ruffian whose deeds or
                    violence could silence his foes.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> But despite its relatively early provenance,
                    there are serious problems with this derivation. No historical evidence has ever been found of any
                    usage of the word "husher" except for this one account, whereas examples abound
                    for wide and common usage of the word "hoosier." Secondly, the change in both
                    vowel and consonant sounds between "husher" and "hoosher" is
                    considerable; why change the sound when the word "husher" makes its sense
                    precisely from its relation to the word "hush"? Not surprisingly, the
                    "husher" theory no longer claims many adherents.</p>

            <p>Bartlett's <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Americanisms</hi> added to its anecdotal discussion
                    the information that Kentuckians of the era favored a more comic etymology that suggested the term
                    evolved from a halloing of "Who's yere?" as strangers approached isolated
                    cabins on the Indiana frontier.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> This theory proved humorous enough to have
                    enjoyed generations of retelling, but since it, too, lacks evidence of usage and hardly seems a
                    likely way for guests to announce their arrival, few take it seriously.</p>
            <p>Neither of these first two speculations was particularly complimentary of early Indiana life, so some
                    state residents adopted more flattering explanations of Hoosier origin. Several argued that the word
                    "hoosier" derived from a mispronunciation of the European term
                    "hussar" attached to Hoosier boatmen in honor of their fighting hearts and manly
                    prowess. Others contended that high-spirited Indiana boatmen were termed
                    "hoosiers" because they liked to jump up and crack their heels together while
                    shouting "Huzza!" But neither the "hussars" theory nor its
                    "huzza" counterpart accounts for the derogatory way the term was actually used in
                    the early Southeast, and neither has ever been taken seriously as a likely etymology by students of
                    American usage.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an article published at the turn of the century by the Indiana Historical Society, Jacob Piatt
                    Dunn analyzed all these speculations and more in what has been the definitive study of the origins
                    of the word "hoosier."<hi rend="sup">4</hi> To the disappointment of his readers
                    Dunn found no convincing evidence that any of the state's favorite etymologies for
                    "Hoosier" were correct. He thought the way to solve the mystery was to begin by
                    noting that most of the proposed etymologies shared three common features. According to Dunn, <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>In Dunn's opinion, the impediment that had prevented a discovery of a correct derivation was
                    that one of those three important clues was a false lead. His own research showed that although the
                    term "hoosier" was, indeed, both derogatory and southern, it had never been
                    exclusively or uniquely applied to citizens of Indiana. Dunn noted that the word

                    was searching. Some thought there might be a vital clue in the term "Hoosieroon"

                    memorialized in his 1833 <placeName>

            <p>Charles G. Leland recalled, in the 1839 <hi rend="i">Dictionary of Slang, Jargon and Cant</hi>, that
                    in 1834 he had heard that Hoosiers were really "Hoosieroons" which could suggest,
                    he thought, a Spanish origin for the term.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Dunn concluded, however, that the
                    word in the poem was a humorous take-off on such racial terms as "quadroon" or
                    "octoroon" that were in common southern American usage.</p>
            <p>Another trail Dunn followed was the theory that Hoosier might have been the surname of a man who
                    hired Indiana laborers for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>

                    directories of a dozen of the region's major cities, he rejected the idea, adding that the
                    name "Hoosier" J. Durbin that had been found listed in the 1835 minutes of the
                    Indiana Methodist Conference was the result of a misspelling of the name "Hosier"
                    J. Durbin and therefore irrelevant.</p>
            <p>Having thus disposed of other theories, Dunn concluded that the term "hoosier" must
                    be from an old Anglo-Saxon word, even if the connections between the western frontier and the
                    original (and missing) old English slang term could not be found. As an addendum to his original
                    work he appended the supposition that the trans-Appalachian word "hoosier"
                    probably arrived with immigrants from <placeName>

                    "hoozer," "said of anything unusually large." There are,
                    however, four problems with this derivation: there is no evidence of an American usage of the
                    Cumberland word; "hoosiers" were never characterized as unusually large people;
                    the opening consonant sound of the second syllable of "hoozer" (hu-zer) sounds
                    quite different than that of "hoosier" (hoo-zher); and, most disconcerting of all,
                    the allegedly original term dates to at least a half-century later than its supposed successor.<hi rend="sup">8</hi>

            <p>Scholars wishing to explain idiosyncratic "southernisms" have long tended to fall
                    back on hypothetical Anglo-Saxon survivals isolated in the back country. But recent scholarship had
                    shown that a far more common source for many such local southern customs is the invisible heritage
                    of African-American tradition.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Interestingly, in the years when the term
                    "hoosier" was finding its first use on the Appalachian frontier, there was an
                    obvious African-American point of reference for the designation: the black evangelist Harry Hoosier
                    who accompanied the Reverend Francis Asbury and other Methodist preachers on their traveling rounds.</p>
            <p>Hoosier was illiterate when he took his name so that his surname has no definitive spelling.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> But the spellings his contemporaries gave it—Hoosier, Hosier,
                    Hossier, Hersure, Hoshure, Hosure, and Hoshur—suggest the phonetic character of what must
                    have been his own pronunciation.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> "Black Harry," as Hoosier

                            </placeName>. Gough, who was reportedly converted to Methodism by hearing the prayer of an
                            elderly slave, built a chapel at Perry Hall that became a favored stopping place for
                            intinerant Methodist preachers. Hoosier knew only the sound of his name, not the spelling.
                            How he chose his name is unknown. Neither of his masters seems to have been named Hoosier or
                            Hosier, although the name Hooser according to Jacob Piatt Dunn "is a rather common
                            family name in the South." See Dunn, "The Word
                            ‘Hoosier,’" 17. It has been suggested that Black Harry may
                            have gotten his name from the term "hoosier" rather than the other way
                            around. But there is no evidence the term existed at such an early date; moreover, it is
                            unlikely that, as a free man, the serious and devout Hoosier would have taken for his
                            surname a cognomen which meant a shiftless, ignorant bumpkin. Slaves might be given
                            derogatory first names, but a surname different from the master's was the choice of
                            the freedman who held it. The best source for information on Harry Hoosier is <placeName>

                    the turn of the century had become a well-known Methodist exhorter despite the disability his race
                    presented in that era and despite his own illiteracy. Small, very dark, physically powerful, and
                    keen-eyed, as well as an enthusiastic orator, Hoosier was nominally a servant to the white ministers
                    with whom he traveled. He usually preached at the meetings with them, however, and was generally
                    considered the most effective and popular speaker.<hi rend="sup">12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, Black Harry was such an impressive proselytizer that Benjamin Rush conceded that
                    "making allowances for his illiteracy he was the greatest orator in America," and
                    Thomas Coke contended his traveling companion was even more blessed, "one of the best
                    Preachers in the world."<hi rend="sup">13</hi> Before his death in 1806, Hoosier's
                    homiletical gifts had made him a renowned camp meeting exhorter, the most widely known black
                    preacher of his time, and arguably the greatest circuit rider of his day.</p>
            <p>Of course, not everyone in early America looked with favor upon illiterate black preachers who
                    preached to both white and black audiences, nor were more conservative southerners impressed with
                    the whites who would heed a Negro's admonitions on proper conduct and the way to salvation.
                    Hoosier was particularly disliked by Virginia Baptists for his preaching against the Calvinist
                    proposition that those who were once in grace would always remain in grace.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>

            <p>Throughout the southern frontier Methodists were not only slighted as unsophisticated and unlettered
                    but they were also denigrated for calling into question the virtues of racial slavery. The
                    promiscuous mixing of blacks and whites that took place at frontier camp meetings was just another
                    serious mark against both their breeding and good taste. Therefore, it does not seem at all unlikely
                    that Methodists and then other rustics of the backcountry could have been called
                    "Hoosiers"—disciples of the illiterate black exhorter Harry
                    Hoosier—as a term of opprobrium and derision. In fact, this would be the simplest
                    explanation of the derivation of the word and, on simplicity alone, the Harry Hoosier etymology is
                    worth serious consideration.</p>

            <p>It is likely that, as memories of the preacher "Black Harry" slipped away, and as
                    the white people of the frontier adopted the nickname Hoosier for themselves, the term lost its
                    original racial connotations (except perhaps for the implications of "Hoosieroon")

                    such evidence, the best that can be done for any of the theories is to develop a circumstantial
                    case. The etymology suggested here—that the word "hoosier" was used
                    sarcastically to characterize frontier backwoodsmen as primitive followers of Black Harry Hoosier
                    and his mixed-race, antislavery, Methodist frontier democrats—is admittedly as
                    circumstantial as all the other hypotheses. But at least the Harry Hoosier connection would explain
                    several problems that the other etymologies cannot.</p>
            <p>Only Dunn's speculation about the Cumberland "hoozer" and the new Harry

            <p>Early usage of the word "hoosier" in the North and West was less derisive than it
                    was in the Southeast. "Hoosier" was considered tar more disparaging in the areas

            <p>Of the two Appalachian theories the Harry Hoosier hypothesis best explains such clines of use. An
                    original antislavery and African-American reference in the term would explain why
                    "hoosier" was charged with more negative connotations in the South than it was in
                    the North and West and why the cognomen settled on the inhabitants of the free and more Methodist
                    territory of Indiana after passing lightly over similarly uncouth frontiersmen in <placeName>

                    </placeName> who were also often called "hoosiers." An implicit reference to Harry
                    Hoosier in the earliest use would also explain the dividing line between the usage of
                    "hoosier" and "cracker," for that line also marks the southern
                    limit of Harry Hoosier's preaching tours.</p>
            <p>In the end all the etymologies are circumstantial. But the best of the group in explaining how,
                    where, when, and why the term came into use is the theory that the word comes from a man's
                    name. Such an etymology would offer Indiana a plausible and worthy first
                    Hoosier—"Black Harry" Hoosier—the greatest preacher of his
                    day, a man who rejected slavery and stood up for morality and the common man. Indianans have always
                    been proud that through their own accomplishments they reshaped the definition of
                    "hoosier" into a title borne with pride: <quote rend="blockquote">

                  </p>

            <p>The letters William Allen Clark wrote between January 9 and June 27, 1863, continue with pleas for
                    stamps and for news of home but, most importantly, Clark expresses his fear that war might come to
                    Indiana. Sitting in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> and relying on camp rumors, the young soldier worries that the numbers of southern
                    sympathizers in Indiana will push his home state into secession. He dismisses his apprehension,
                    however, by saying he cannot conceive that Hoosiers would allow men unfamiliar with the effects of
                    war to lead Indiana away from the Union, nor can he believe reports that the Knights of the Golden
                    Circle are active in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clinton County</region>
                    </placeName>. Referring to camp life, he writes about dreading the field hospitals more than
                    marching. He hates foraging and at times stays in camp with the excuse of an illness rather than
                    confiscate goods from the local farmers. One can imagine he saw his parents in the faces of these
                    southern farmers and regretted taking their crops, animals, and stores. Religion and war do not mix,
                    he says, nor does the war and his love of the land. He never explicitly describes scenes of death;
                    perhaps out of respect for his parents or fear of censorship by his superiors, he only suggests the
                    horrors he has witnessed, especially after the Battle of <geogName>Stones River</geogName>.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Clark's letters contain special messages for his parents and his brother, George, and assert
                    his need to hear from them; writing and receiving letters are among his few pleasures. He finds
                    leading a moral life difficult in camp. Clark wants to come home but assures his parents that a
                    "french Furlough" (an absence without leave) is out of the question, especially
                    after having seen a fellow soldier branded and drummed out of the army. He celebrates becoming a
                    part of Wilder's famed Lightning Brigade, receiving a horse and a <placeName>

                    glorious profession, but one filled with disgust, ignorance, fear, and horror. On May 24, Clark
                    celebrates his nineteenth birthday hoping for a day without "butchery." He has
                    become a man. His political views remain consistent, and they deepen as he sees war firsthand. He
                    maintains his belief in the Union, despises both secessionists and abolitionists, dismisses the
                    black contrabands with offhand comments, and articulates his desire to see Indiana remain free of
                    battle.</p>

                        <p>You will perhaps be uneasy before you get this as it has been sometime since I have
                                    wrote to you. We have been marching all the time since Christmas. We went to <placeName>

                                    </placeName>, Ky. and laid there a day or two then put us in the [railroad] Cars and
                                    Brought us to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. Staid there one night then marched us 28 miles on the Road here. We
                                    came here yesterday. You have doubtless heard of the Slaughter that was made here.
                                    We were fortunate enough not to participate in it. The 86th Regt. was in hottest
                                    fire. Jethro Wilson is reported killed. Ben Ashabro wounded in the face but not
                                    fatal. I cant tell much about the Battle field as the fight has been over a week
                                    ago, and the dead are all Buried. The Enemy has a strong position and well
                                    fortified. There is various estimates as to our loss, from two to 7 thousand. The
                                    Enemies loss not much more. Henry Mohler is not hurt but fought Bravely.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                              <hi rend="sup">1</hi> William Allen Clark guided the following transcription
                                        of his correspondence by reminding his brother George, in a letter of January 9,
                                        1865, to place periods at the end of sentences and to capitalize proper names.
                                        Probably in part because of the difficult circumstances under which he wrote,
                                        Clark himself did not use apostrophes in his letters; his periods, commas, and
                                        pen pauses all resembled one another: and his capitalization was haphazard. In
                                        recognition of Clark's obvious knowledge of grammar, correct
                                        punctuation has been placed at the ends of sentences, commas have been added
                                        throughout the letters to facilitate reading, and words that begin sentences
                                        have been capitalized. In other instances Clark's capitalization,
                                        whenever clear, remains unchanged; in case of doubt, the rules of modern usage
                                        were followed. Some decisions regarding sentence divisions were necessarily
                                        arbitrary; and the letters have also been arbitrarily divided into paragraphs.
                                        The location and spacing of headings, salutations, and closings have been
                                        standardized. Clark's spelling, which was quite good, has been
                                        retained.</item>

                        <salute>Dear parents,</salute>
                        <p>I now attempt the pleasant task of writing to you. I am well and hope this will find
                                    you enjoying the same Blessing. I have been looking for a letter from you for some
                                    time But in vain. The last one that I received contained George's
                                    Miniature. We expect a mail this Evening. Capt. started home this morning on a lieve
                                    of absence for 20 days.</p>
                        <p>I want you to give me a history of Political affairs when you get this. The report is
                                    here that Indiana is on the verge of Secession. I read in the Cin. Commercial of the
                                    12th that there was 13,000 Voters in Ind. that was in favor of a North Western
                                    Confederacy. I want to know the truth of the matter. And if it is true, is the
                                    Sentiment confined to one State. We dont here any War news here, save what occurs
                                    here.</p>
                        <p>It is reported that we are to be mounted on mules.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> I hope the
                                    report is false. I saw Henry Mohler this Week. He is well, and has command of the

                        <p>We have been on 1/2 Rations for some time till now. We have full Rations for 4 days.
                                    We lived three days on rotten corn meal and Bacon and only half Rations of them.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                        <p>We have had some Big Rains lately, weather warm as May. We have not received our pay
                                    yet and no prospect of it.</p>
                        <p>This is the third letter that I have wrote to you this year. I have got several
                                    letters from female friends that I ought to answer, but have no stamps and I am not
                                    disposed to make them pay the toll.</p>
                        <p>There was 7 men reported sick from Co. K. this morning. This is more than has been
                                    sick for some time. The health is better when we are marching than when in camp.</p>

                                        that on January 1, 1863, Colonel John Thomas Wilder had ordered some men of the

                                        easily pursue Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, whose men rode horses. The
                                        attempt was a dismal failure, as mules bucked the men off their backs and into

                                    they have passed without hesitation. There is a large minority here opposed to the
                                    Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps a small majority in favor of the Supremacy of
                                    Military Power. For my part I am opposed to the military enforcement of the laws.
                                    There is a in my opinion a large majority that would be glad to hear of Peace on any

                                    in our Division today.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> It was a horrid sight. One that I never

                        <p>We have had a Rainy month but this is a beautiful day. We have not got our pay yet,

                                    along. I have not received a letter from you of a later date than Feb. 21st No. 6.
                                    Our Regt. went out on a scout last Friday with 10 days Rations. They were going to
                                    McMinville. I was unwell that morning and was excused from going. I had an attack of
                                    Dysentery, but I am all right now. I was pretty sick for three days. We are having
                                    very inclement weather. It has rained every night this week. There is a large amount
                                    of sickness on account of so much dampness.</p>

                        <p>It is with pleasure that I try to pen you a few lines to let you know my good health.
                                    This is a gloomy morning. The clouds indicate rain. The gloomy morning with the more
                                    gloomy appearance of our National dificulties makes me feel rather gloomy to write
                                    an interesting letter. I wrote you a letter last Sabbath morning, and received No. 6
                                    from you that afternoon. I have received 8 letters from you in ‘63. Vis.
                                    Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9. No. 1 is missing.</p>
                        <p>The health of our Co. is good. We have 53 men here now, and only 7 sick, which leaves
                                    44 able for duty, making a larger Company than we have had for 5 months. Capt.
                                    Collins is here now but will soon resign. By the way, I will tell you how him and me
                                    stands on the greenback question. When we were paid at Camp Chris Miller, they paid
                                    us $25 Bounty, and one month's pay and $2 premium. On
                                    the 25th of August, we got the $25. The next day we got $10 of
                                    the first month's dues, leaving three $ wages unpaid and the
                                    $2 premium, making $5 unpaid. The paymaster gave it to
                                    Captain, and he was to pay it to the boys, but he has forgot it I suppose. We <list type="footnotes">

                                    Relatives talk of Resistance, my advice is to them to come to Ky. or Tenn. and see
                                    what effect war has upon the Country and the people in the vicinity of those large

                                    perhaps he will come out right at the end of the Race. My political views are the

                        <p>The Regt. has gone on a wild goose chase. It has been out six days and will be out
                                    two more. I had a severe cold when they started and concluded it would be the best
                                    to stay in camp. I feel better now though my throat is some what sore.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing new to write. All quiet in <geogName>Stone River</geogName>. I have
                                    been highly favored with letters this week. I rec. No. 10 from you on Wednesday, 1
                                    from S. S., 1 from Henry Ewing, 1 from Frank <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                                    </placeName>. In fact I got 11 since last Sabbath, 1 from Alma <placeName>
                                        <country reg="jo">Jordan</country>
                                    </placeName>. They were all well. I wrote to Grand Mother to day. I ought to have
                                    done so sooner, but was afraid to.</p>
                        <p>I wrote to D. F. Clark last night and gave him to understand that we dident have much
                                    Sympathy for Rebels here. He is not posted about the hands his letters has to go
                                    through, or he would be more guarded in his expressions. Let me tell you a secret.
                                    These men that have been crying for peace and have been trying to Discourage their
                                    friends in the Army, have nearly all been to fast, and if the laws are strictly
                                    enforced, I am thinking it will go hard with them. You cant imagine the change that
                                    has taken place in the thinking part of the Army, here. About the first of Jan.
                                    there was a great deal of disaffection here, but the[re] is the most perfect union
                                    now. I will tell you the Reason of this change. We know what effect War has on a
                                    country, and this cant be settled without union in the Ranks and we dont want to
                                    hear of War in the north. We are not in favor of those at home that are doing all
                                    they can to Destroy what we Build up. It is foolish to kick up a dust against the
                                    Administration when it is backed by a million of Bayonets. We know where we are and
                                    it is no use for us to think of any thing but sticking to it. A man couldent get out
                                    of it if he was to try. I hope if this Draft is enforced that the Wendel
                                    Philipp's traitors will all be drafted. It wouldent be safe for them to say
                                    much here.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>

                        <p>This is a beautiful day. The peach trees are in Bloom. I am glad that Lauretta is out
                                    of the way, but I am afraid there wont be nary Pigeon left for poor Allen, when he
                                    gets home. I believe I will close for the present. Write soon but dont write
                                    Politics if you want to keep out of a mess. Good bye for the present.</p>

                  <hi rend="sup">25</hi> As Clark writes about his political opinions, he becomes worried about
                        writing contraband information. The reference to Wendell Phillips, a well-known abolitionist,
                        once again reveals Clark's opposition to the antislavery movement and reaffirms the
                        fact that Clark is fighting to keep the Union together, not to free the slaves.</item>

                        <salute>Dear Parents,</salute>
                        <p>After waiting till nearly night for the mail at last it came, But it Brought nothing
                                    for me. So I thought I would write anyhow. I havent heard from you for nearly two
                                    weeks. I am well as ever, but have a touch of the Spring fever.</p>
                        <p>Our Boys was on a scout last week. They was gone 8 days traveled 100 miles and got
                                    200 prisoner, 300 horses, and more Niggers than you ever seen at one sight. They
                                    fired two Rounds at the Rebs, and they surrendered. The Rebels captured two of our
                                    pickets, took them 4 miles then turned in to the woods. After getting a safe
                                    distance from the Road, they wrote out our Boys Paroles and gave to them. But
                                    instead of releasing them, they tied them to a tree and shot them, three shots in
                                    each man's head. They went away and left them tied up. But one of the boys
                                    was only wounded. He cut himself loose and come to camp. He is shot three times in
                                    the face. He is getting well but his tongue is wounded, so he cant talk. His
                                    comerade is still tied to the tree.</p>
                        <p>The Regt. started out again yesterday to catch a band of Guerrillas that capured a
                                    train of Cars at Lavergne. Our Boys went to <placeName>
                                        <country reg="le">Lebanon</country>
                                    </placeName> and I think they will burn the town. My horse is lame so I had to stay
                                    in camp—But I dont fancy such trips anyhow.</p>
                        <p>I got a letter from Rev. Moses Kerr yesterday, the best letter that I have yet
                                    received. I answered it this morning. We had had preaching to day, the first for two
                                    months. The preacher was an African. I soon became so disgusted that I went to my
                                    Bunk.</p>
                        <p>There is no news to write. I staid with Henry Mohler last Tuesday night. We had a
                                    good time. He is well. I wish you would send me something to read. We dont get any
                                    thing here to Read But Abolitionism and I am sick of it. I guess I will quit for the
                                    present. Write often, and send some stamps. No more at present.</p>

                        <trailer>I got a letter from I. N. on Friday. He is well. If any of the Boys should be
                                    conscripted, I want them to come to the 72nd. But I hope there will be no draft,
                                    although the prospect of Peace is poor. I want to hear from George once in a while.

                        <salute>Dear Parents,</salute>
                        <p>As I am in a writing way I will pen you a few lines to let you know that I am well. I
                                    have wrote to I. N. and Alf Miller to day and I want to write two more letters yet
                                    to day. It is Raining and has been all day. I was on guard last night and feel
                                    sleepy to day. We have got our horses now and they are famous horses. We are to <pb n="213" id="VAA4025-091-2-067"/> start on a 14 day scout in the morning. I think
                                    we will go to Bridgeport, Ala.</p>
                        <p>I havent heard from you since March. I havent heard from Clinton since my last to
                                    you. I dont know much news that would interest you. The only excitement here is from
                                    the circulation of monstrous stories about Copperheadism in the north. I heard a
                                    letter from a Discharged Soldier that lives in Clinton Co. He said that the
                                    Copperheads was hiding Ammunition in the woods, and that all the Democrats was
                                    K.G.C.S. For my part I cant believe all the goss that we hear, but this much I do
                                    know the Traitors are not all Democrats.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

                        <p>Henry Mohler is well. Tell them Brothers of mine to write to me and you must not be
                                    uneasy if I dont write as often as I have been doing, as we will be Scouting most of
                                    the time. Do you ever see any thing in the papers about Wilder's Brigade?</p>
                        <p>Our Chaplain has gone home. There was a Nigger preached last Sunday but I couldent
                                    stay to hear him through. It was more than I could Stomach. There is nearly 100

                                    &amp; hot. We was on a scout yesterday. We went 11 miles on the <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Manchester</settlement>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                                    </placeName>, drove the Reb Pickets, Killing 3 &amp; capuring 7. Our Skirmishes
                                    went in sight of the Fortifications but found the enemy in line ready for us. We
                                    come away without molesting them as we was only Reconoitering. Tomorrow is my Birth
                                    Day. If I had been certain of being in camp then, I would have waited till then to
                                    write this. We are under marching [orders] now &amp; before this reaches you,
                                    the papers will announce another Bloody Battle.</p>
                        <p>I sent a Box containing 2 over coats &amp; a pair of mittens to <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Lafayette</settlement>
                                    </placeName> addressed to D. C. Clark. The coat with the string around it is
                                    Wakeland's, also the mittens. He wants you to take or send them to his wife
                                    in Rossville in Granny Clark's house. You can get the Box by calling at the
                                    Express Office. The Freight is paid. There is a package of letters in my coat
                                    Pocket, which you will please put in my Box without Reading them. I did not intend
                                    to send them but they was in the Pocket &amp; Wakeland put the coat in the Box.
                                    We are not allowed but one suit of clothes now.</p>
                        <p>This may be the last that you will hear from me for sometime, for we will leave here
                                    in less than 48 hours. At least I think so. I hope we will have success &amp;
                                    not a Butchery.</p>
                        <p>I have received no letters since the 15th. I will close for this time as I wish to
                                    write several letters to day. I am not fearful, but the prospect of the next week
                                    fill my mind with serious thoughts. Man's life is not his own. It is
                                    uncertain. Please write soon &amp; often, and tell my Brothers to write. Dont
                                    forget the Stamps.</p>

                                    <pb n="217" id="VAA4025-091-2-071"/> Evening. My health is good with the exception
                                    of toothache, (a disagreeable Companion). As I am not on duty to day, I will try and
                                    write you a lengthy and I hope an interesting letter.</p>
                        <p>We had a fine Shower of Rain yesterday, and the Sun is shining brightly through the
                                    tear like rain drops that glitter in the Sunbeams. Brother, Nature is here in all
                                    her Beauty.</p>
                        <p>In my last letter home I predicted a forward movement, but my predictions were too
                                    hasty. Last Sabbath at two oclock, we mounted our gallent Steeds, and rode to
                                    Readersville (12 miles east of here). We went in camp on a <geogName>Rugged
                                    hill</geogName>, studded with Cedar &amp; Laurel Bushes. After doing ample
                                    justice to my Rations of hard tack,’: pork and coffee, I spread my
                                    Blankets under a cedar tree and in a few minutes was in the land of dreams, but
                                    after a time I waked up and was surprised to find a companion in my bed. I felt
                                    something cold cross my Breast, and found (horrible to tell) a Serpent nearly Six
                                    feet long, laying on my arm. You may bet that I beat a Retreat on quick time. It was
                                    a black Snake, but different from the Reptiles of Hoosierdom. I laid down again but
                                    it was but little that I slept, for our pickets was attacked just before daylight.</p>
                        <p>We started at daylight for parts unknown. We went to Wood-bury, the County seat of
                                    Cannon Co., having Skirmished with the Rebs, a distance of 7 miles. We captured
                                    their pickets there (7 in number). We separated here. The 17th and 18th Regts. went
                                    on the McMinville <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Pike</settlement>
                                    </placeName> and the 72nd with the 123rd Ill. took a byroad across the Mountains,
                                    for the purpose of surprising Gen. Breckenridge<hi rend="sup">36</hi> who was
                                    reported to be camped on <geogName>Duck River</geogName> 16 miles from Woodbury with
                                    4 Regts. We struck the pike two miles in their Rear, forced a Signal shot for the
                                    17th and 98th. We made a gallent Charge, but Lo, the bird had flown. Ol Breck, had
                                    anticipated our movements, and skedaddled to McMinville on double quick. We got
                                    nothing for our pains but a few lousy tents, and some sore backed horses.</p>
                        <p>We rested two hours and then came back to Readersville. We arrived there at 9 oclock
                                    P.M., having rode 50 miles in 15 hours. After Supper our Company was detailed for
                                    picket. We went out a mile on the Tallahoma Road. Was on duty till 4 oclock nexday.
                                    We then come on to camp.</p>
                        <p>When we came here I found 3 letters for me, one from you, 1 from Alma <placeName>

                        <p>This will inform you of my good health. Also, I am satisfied. When a man gets in a
                                    position that he cant get out of, it is his duty to make the best of it. I know by
                                    experience that a Soldier can make himself miserable by thinking of home, and
                                    associations of the past. For my part I am determined to be satisfied.</p>
                        <p>James L. Keys and me are the only ones in the Company now but what play Cards. There
                                    is 7 decks of cards in the Co. We have no Chaplain yet, and no prospect of any.
                                    Religion is littel thought of here. Morality is almost unknown here. There is
                                    several of the Boys that have quit writing home. I think from Remorseful feeling.
                                    There is 3 men in our company havent wrote or received the scratch of a pen since

                                    are ordered to march at a moment's warning with 5 days Rations. We get
                                    Rations of Potatoes now. I believe I never told you the list of Rations. It is 3/4
                                    of a pound of Crackers or 1 1/4 pound of Bread perday, 1 pound of pork or 1 1/4 lb.
                                    of Beef, 1 lb. of Beans or peas to eight men per day, 1/8 of a pound of Sugar, the
                                    same of Coffee perday, a bushel of potatoes to 50 men perday, a pound of soap and
                                    the same of Candles to eight men. There is no Regularity about Vinegar and Salt. 1
                                    gill of Whiskey to a man each morning. The Officers Drinks my share. Each private is
                                    allowed 57$ worth of Clothing in a year. I have been out nearly 10 months
                                    and have only $37 worth of clothing, and I think I have enough to last me
                                    till August.</p>
                        <p>I believe I have wrote all the news. Write as often as you can and please write
                                    longer letters. Did Mother get the letter that I sent her? I will close for the

                        <p>I seat myself to pen you a few lines to let you know that I am still alive and well
                                    and hope this will find you in the same state of health. I will make this brief as I
                                    am quite fatigued, having rode 30 miles since 7 oclock am. We came from Liberty [<placeName>
                                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                                    </placeName>] in 7 hours. We were not permitted to get out of our Saddle during that
                                    time. We was gone 4 days capured several horses and between 200 &amp; 300
                                    Prisoners. We had two of our Boys captured, and 1 killed also two or three wounded.
                                    Our last was in the Ill. Regt.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday there was 8 of our Camp with Sergt. Jack Ball to go after horses. I was one
                                    of the detail. We went 7 miles south of Liberty and rode over a high hill where we
                                    surprised 4 Rebs that were showing there steeds. We gave them chase Running them
                                    several miles but we caught them at last (three of them). The 4th one run his horse
                                    over a Rock 40 feet high. Broke his thigh, and killing his horse. We then mistrusted
                                    that we had got in a warm neighborhood, so we Broke for camp with 3 prisoners and 4
                                    horses (to leed). When we got to Camp we were told by Wilder that Wharton's
                                    Rebel Brigade‘!’ was at Woodbury, and we had been within three
                                    miles of there in our Rebel Chase. You had better think we was glad that we saved
                                    ourselves from a visit to <placeName>

                                    said she was in favor of abolishing Slavery, "Abolitionist." I
                                    also got one from Hen. Ewing, in which he gave of vivid description of the K.G.C.S.
                                    in Ross. It was highly exagerated, I suppose. At least I dont believe there is such

                        <p>I have absented myself from the camp, its noise, confusion and Bustle, for a few
                                    hours, in order to have a better chance to call my thoughts together. I have chosen
                                    my position on a huge pile of Rocks, shaded with Cedar &amp; gum trees, I
                                    received yours of the 3rd inst. on last Monday. It contained a fac. Simile of Mother
                                    and Father on a limited scale. It was a very agreeable Surprise. I hope I will be
                                    permitted to return it to you before next June with our Countries troubles so
                                    adjusted, that the exchange of miniatures, and letters between friend at home and
                                    those in the tented fields will be no more necessary.</p>
                        <p>We started out on a scout last Wednesday, and was gone till last night. There was
                                    only 160 of us (a detail of 16 men from a Company). Lieutenant Col. Kirkpatrick was
                                    in command. We went to Liberty and got in a muss with Allison's Guerillas,
                                    but routed them with out any loss on our part, except one horse killed. The enemies
                                    loss was 4 found dead on the field, one wounded and 5 captured. Their loss would
                                    have been greater had it been in a level Country, <list type="footnotes">

                                    mountains, where pursuit was almost impractacable, at least in the night and it was
                                    then getting dark.</p>
                        <p>We went from there to <placeName>

                                    first day. You must not be uneasy if you dont hear from me in the next 30 days. If
                                    all Rumors are true we will make an important Raid soon. It is Rumored that we are
                                    to draw 20 days rations tomorrow, and start out the next day. How true it is I cant
                                        tell.<hi rend="sup">41</hi>

                        <p>The war news is not of a cheering nature just now. Vicksburg and Port Hudson are both
                                    invested, but their Reduction progresses very slow, if it does any. Everything is
                                    quiet here again. All marching orders have been revoked. Henry Mohler, Selby Lewis,
                                    and Henry Smith was to our camp to day. They look hearty and are as full of fun as
                                    ever. Henry Mohler Keeps himself the cleanest of any soldier that I have yet seen.</p>
                        <p>Well Mother, you wish to know if I am as good a boy as I was at home. I fear that I
                                    am not. There is so many temptations here that a boy will be almost ruined before he
                                    is aware of the fact, and there's no Mother's influence or the
                                    least spark of morality to restrain the wayward, and I fear that Christianity and
                                    war are two things that are incompatible. They dont mix much in the Department of
                                    the Cumberland any how.</p>
                        <p>I have not got the scratch of a pen from Jonas since the 7th of January. Why it is, I
                                    cant tell. If he is my Brother I wish he would let me know it. I got a letter from
                                    Grand Mother not long since. She was as well as usual.</p>
                        <p>We have 48 men in our Co. now and they are all able for duty. We had general
                                    inspection to day, and the General said that our Company was the Cleanest and
                                    healthiest one in the Brigade. We have tidy Officers, and they make the Company help
                                    themselve in the right kind of style. When we are in camp we have to wash ourselves
                                    3 times a day and comb with fine comb. And we have to examine our Clothing each day
                                    to prevent vermin. We have to sun our Blankets every day and wash them every two
                                    weeks. The officers have to be this strict as some of the men would die with filth
                                    and vermin.</p>
                        <p>Do you take <hi rend="i">The Witness</hi> yet? If you do, I wish you would send me a
                                    copy. We get <hi rend="i">The Crescent</hi> every week. I see in <hi rend="i">The
                                        Crescent</hi> of June 5th that Capt. Cornelisson and the Republicans have had a
                                    falling out. I see that Tom &amp; George Major have been pitching in with their
                                    slang. I hope to hear of their pitching in to the Army before long as Conscripts.
                                    And if they have to carry 64 pound Knapsacks, and sixteen pound muskets 10 months,
                                    you take my word for it, they wont blame Cornelisson for getting a discharge at the
                                    earliest opportunity.</p>

                        <p>The People here are now in the midst of harvesting wheat. [It] looks Splendid, but
                                    the crop is limited. When we was out in the Country, we had plenty of Mulberries,
                                    and Cherries, and young potatoes.</p>
                        <p>I was sorry to hear of Sarah Carricks Death. It is wonderful to think of the changes
                                    that have taken place in that vicinity within one year. It looks as if all my school
                                    mates would be married or in the grave before this accursed War is ended. Please
                                    write soon, and often. No more at present but remain your son,</p>

                                    time to write, on account of fixing up in a comfortable manner. We are now camped
                                    north of town five (5) miles, near a large spring that issues from a beautiful cave,

                                    Regiments of Cavalry. We had only our Brigade, and 10 pieces of Artillery. To
                                    describe the battle would be an impossibility. We lay on the ground five hours. The

            <p>Last year saw the publication of two books concerned with visual representation in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana—one from the Indiana Historical Society commemorating the work of

                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> during roughly the same time period. The coincidence of publication makes obvious the
                    dichotomy between outsiders and insiders who made the original images. The artists from outside the
                    county differed from the local picture-man in motive, method, and clientele. Taken together, these
                    two books provide contrasts both informative and thought-provoking.</p>

                    </placeName> in 1883, Otto Ping spent his youth doing farm work and traveling local circuits as a
                    salesman, peddling pressure cookers and patent medicines. As a teenager Ping began to supplement his
                    income by taking photographic portraits, using the plain style favored by itinerant painters in
                    earlier generations. He also made mementos of special occasions such as baptisms, the laying-out of
                    corpses, birthday parties, and family reunions. Ping followed this trade sporadically for forty
                    years, adapting to changing technology until the need for such services faded away in the 1940s.</p>
            <p>By the 1960s Otto Ping was operating a commercial poultry farm in the hamlet of Stone Head, also in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, where he was visited by W. Douglas Hartley, an art professor at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> State University. Hartley was interviewing area residents as part of his research on a
                    nineteenth-century stonecarver, published as <hi rend="i">The Search for Henry</hi> Cross by the
                    Indiana Historical Society in 1966. The two men maintained their acquaintance, and not long before
                    his death in 1975 Ping showed Hartley his old photographs.</p>
            <p>Fifteen years later, in 1989, Hartley approached the Indiana Historical Society with a proposed
                    magazine article about Otto Ping. During the same month, in what the Society's curator of
                    visual collections Stephen J. Fletcher refers to as "a harmonic convergence," the
                    Society's offices in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> were visited by Otto Ping's daughter, looking for advice about conserving her
                    father's negatives. Before long Ping's descendants agreed to donate the collection
                        <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-091-2-081"/> of three hundred glass and film negatives, as well as
                    related paper documents, and a team of curators and writers got to work on the present book.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Otto Ping: Photographer of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> contains about eighty photographs with an introduction and comments on each
                    image by W. Douglas Hartley. This material is supplemented by "Otto Ping and Itinerant
                    Photography," a useful essay by art historian Anne E. Peterson, and by
                    "Significant Beyond Intent," a conclusion by Fletcher. Design elements and quality
                    of reproduction are impressive throughout. The photographs themselves are presented in complementary
                    pairs, one per facing page, and are carefully selected to show the range of subjects in the Ping
                    collection. Each negative is printed in a full-frame format, and not cropped as Ping would have done
                    in finishing an enlargement. This disclosure of the periphery beyond the backdrop reveals more of
                    the context of Ping's photographic efforts, often quite poignantly. As Stephen Fletcher
                    points out in his remarks, Ping was not unusual as a turn-of-the-century itinerant, but he was
                    singular to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>. For cultural historians interested in the larger region of the Upland South, this
                    tribute to Ping's life and times repays close scrutiny.</p>
            <p>Compared with Frank Hohenberger, the well-known newcomer to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> during the 1910s and 1920s, Otto Ping was not as encumbered with elaborate equipment,
                    nor with the ideology of romantic pastoralism. Although there is some overlap in choice of subjects,
                    the aesthetic effects of Hohenberger's photographs are strikingly dissimilar. Lyn
                    Letsinger-Miller includes Frank Hohenberger in <hi rend="i">The Artists of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Brown County</region>

            <p>Letsinger-Miller approaches her topic as a storyteller, relying as much on oral history interviews as
                    on research with primary documents. Her compendium offers to the public for the first time insights
                    into the personal lives of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> artists, allowing the reader to become lost in their intertwined experiences. Now that
                    the long out-of-date tonal impressionism is becoming somewhat acceptable again in the fashions of
                    the art world, the viewer may enjoy the beauty of the representative artworks without
                    self-recrimination. <hi rend="i">The Artists of <placeName>

            <p>Beyond her abilities as a writer Letsinger-Miller is obviously a talented organizer who has a gift
                    for bringing people and resources together. Early in her project she entered into a collaboration
                    with Rachel Perry, a curator at the T. C. Steele State Historic Site who recently put together the
                    "Strokes of Genius" exhibition at the Indiana State Museum in <placeName>

                    </placeName> shortly before her fiftieth birthday. Of the volume's more than one thousand
                    pages, some six hundred deal with the Indiana period between 1826, when Maclure and Fretageot were

                    opinionated individual utterly convinced that he has found the truths that would benefit all
                    humankind. Combining a cynical view of human nature with confidence in the eventual triumph of
                    man's rationality over his short-sighted greed, Maclure placed his hopes in the overthrow
                    of the "false education" of the past in favor of a Pestalozzian system of
                    practical learning. Especially through work-oriented schools. the laboring classes of the world
                    would eventually he empowered to overthrow the exploitative tyranny of a parasitic minority. Maclure
                    intended to bring special benefit to women not only by advancing their claims to equality but by
                    making them the leading participants in his system of education. He followed his dream through three
                    distinct worlds: first <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>
                    </placeName>, then the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. and finally Mexico. Of the three, he seemed to have the least confidence <pb n="229" id="VAA4025-091-2-083"/> in American society, treating it as a society spoiled by speculative
                    greed.</p>
            <p>Madame Fretageot emerges from these letters as the more practical of the two, maintaining her own
                    successful school before taking charge of the one that Maclure established at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>. After he left the village for Mexico, she managed his extensive
                    property—building fences, repairing buildings, and doing anything else to protect his
                    interests. while enduring a steady barrage of complaints, abuse, and pompous advice from her
                    departed friend. Through her eyes one can see the realities of post-Owen <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName>, of a village struggling toward a more permanent footing than its communistic past
                    provided.</p>
            <p>These letters provide insights into many of the leading figures in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> experiment, including Frances Wright. Thomas Say, Charles Lesueur, and Francis Neef as
                    well as Robert Owen and his sons. It is Robert Owen who of course, commands the most attention.
                    Initialy, both Maclure and Fretageot were awed by Owen's imagination and enthusiasm. but
                    exposure to his weaknesses soon led to radically revised opinions. Maclure especially concluded that
                    Owen was a fool and a fraud who had ruined his own experiment, particularly by his free spending
                    which had left most of his followers too dependent on him. If in the end no one emerges from these
                    letters as an appealing figure, at least all of the principals are interesting persons animated by
                    the excitement of ideas and ideals.</p>
            <p>The editor of this volume, Josephine Mirabella Elliott, has done a superb job. She only lightly
                    annotates each letter, avoiding a distracting mass of footnotes, but more than compensates by
                    providing substantial introductions to each of the seven sections into which she divides the book;
                    each introduction is a solid essay that gives real insights into the principals and their times. She
                    also includes numerous illustrations, especially of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> years, and appends a sizeable set of supporting documents.</p>
            <p>This is a good work. Indeed, the only criticism it invites is that the decision to publish its more
                    than 1,100 pages in a single mammoth volume has left it with a binding vulnerable to breakage,
                    especially unfortunate in that at least some copies are likely to be frequently used. In every other
                    respect, though, both Elliott and the Indiana Historical Society deserve thanks for a job well done.</p>

                    Pelican Publishing Company, 1993. Pp. 221. Illustrations, appendixes, bibliography, index.

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Johnny Gruelle: Creator of Raggedy Ann and Andy</hi>, Patricia Hall has crafted more
                    than a biography of the man who created one of America's most beloved dolls. Into the
                    fabric of early twentieth-century American cultural and political commentary, the author has woven a
                    pattern depicting a talented observer of the Hoosier scene. The book is a history of an Indiana
                    cartoonist, illustrator, and writer, a welcome resource on a person about whom little has heretofore
                    been written.</p>
            <p>John B. Gruelle was born December 24, 1880, in Arcola, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and moved at a very young age to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His father, landscape painter R. B. Gruelle, along with artists T. C. Steele, J. Ottis
                    Adams, William Forsyth, and Otto Stark, became known as the Hoosier Group of American
                    Impressionists. A regular visitor to the Gruelles’ home in what is now the Lockerbie
                    Street area was Indiana poet James Whitcomb Riley. "Riley's profound effect on
                    Johnny Gruelle would become apparent years later, when Gruelle began writing his own
                    stories" (p. 30).</p>
            <p>In 1903 Johnny Gruelle was selected to be the first assistant illustrator of the city's
                    newest newspaper, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Star. He left that newspaper briefly to work for the <hi rend="i">Daily Sentinel</hi>,
                    where his political cartoons became a daily feature. Gruelle returned to the Star where he once
                    again supplied the paper with sports cartoons, headline comics, and single-frame commentary cartoons
                    (p. 40).</p>
            <p>Gruelle's talent as a cartoonist led him to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Press and, upon winning a comic-drawing contest, to the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Herald. Relocating in Norwalk, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ctu">Connecticut</region>
                    </placeName>, Gruelle was also a freelance illustrator for women's magazines and a
                    satirical cartoonist for <hi rend="i">Judge</hi> magazine.</p>
            <p>Revealing a lifelong interest in folktales, Gruelle illustrated Margaret Hunt's 1914
                    translation of <hi rend="i">Grimm's Fairy Tales</hi> and later wrote and illustrated his
                    own book of fairy tales. Although the cartoonist incorporated rag doll characters in his
                    illustrations and comic drawings, he did not patent his "Raggedy Ann" doll design
                    until May, 1915. The doll was in many ways a three-dimensional cartoon (p. 105).</p>
            <p>The P. F. Volland Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> first published Gruelle's <hi rend="i">Raggedy Ann Stories</hi> in 1918. That
                    book's publication was followed in 1920 by a sequel, entitled <hi rend="i">Raggedy Andy
                        Stories.</hi> These stories revolved around dolls and toys who came alive and enjoyed a secret,
                    magical life when humans were away or asleep (p. 112).</p>
            <p>Combining the works of Hoosier illustrator Johnny Gruelle and Indiana poet James Whitcomb Riley, the
                    Bobbs-Merrill Company of <pb n="231" id="VAA4025-091-2-085"/>
                    <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> published Johnny Gruelle's <hi rend="i">Orphant Annie Story Book</hi>, which
                    was a series of stories and illustrations based on Riley's poem "Little Orphant
                    Annie." Johnny Gruelle died January 9, 1938.</p>
            <p>Although the title of the book identifies Gruelle as the creator of Raggedy Ann and Andy, Patricia
                    Hall rightly devotes half of her book to other significant contributions Gruelle made as an
                    illustrator, cartoonist, writer, and businessman. Hall provides an impressive list of published
                    books written and/or illustrated by Johnny Gruelle, a checklist of magazine and newspaper
                    appearances of his work, and a detailed bibliography of principal sources. The numerous
                    reproductions of photographs, cartoons, and drawings greatly enhance the biographical study of this
                    very talented Hoosier artist.</p>

            <p>The outlaw life is every child's fantasy, and what is an adult but a child writ large?
                    Hamlet considered it ("to take arms against a sea of troubles"); Don Quixote did
                    it. Storytellers from forgotten balladeers to today's crop of movie makers have catered to
                    a universal fascination with the individual who stands apart from society, flouting its rules,
                    defying its conventions, reaping its fruits without bearing its burdens, living life on his own
                    terms, writing his own code. There is something in everyone that responds to the idea of the
                    universal Robin Hood, the fleeting wish to chuck everyday responsibility and live life on the
                    outside, finally to check out in a blaze of glory, leaving behind a heroic memory.</p>
            <p>Outlaw legendry has permeated American culture for two centuries even though as Frank Richard Prassel
                    demonstrates in <hi rend="i">The Great American Outlaw</hi>, it is mostly the same story over and
                    over—the story older than Robin Hood (who may have been four people, or just one, or
                    nobody at all)—of the loner who defies everything society regards as decent and in the
                    process earns the reader's admiration and even affection. From Hereward the Wake, foe of
                    William the Conqueror, to Blackbeard the Pirate, Billy the Kid, Belle Starr the Bandit Queen, and
                    Jesse James, Sam Bass, John Dillinger, and Patty Hearst to the movie characters played by Charles
                    Bronson, Clint Eastwood, and David Janssen, the legend is the same: the <pb n="232" id="VAA4025-091-2-086"/> outlaw is a victim-turned-foe of a corrupt society, one who afflicts
                    the comfortable, comforts the afflicted, and lives and dies true to his or her own high code of
                    honor.</p>
            <p>As Prassel shows in case after case, the reality behind these hundreds of legends is, of course,
                    different from the legends themselves. Outlaws are mostly common thugs, living a life that is nasty,
                    brutish, and short. Still, the power of their legends will always override the reality of their
                    sociopathic careers. They are the criminals citizens want the government to suppress; at the same
                    time they are the heroes celebrated in song, story, book, and film. It is this split in the popular
                    American mind that Prassel explores with wit, good writing, and careful scholarship.</p>
            <p>In a mostly chronological history of outlawry, Prassel weaves fact and legend into a narrative that
                    is as informative as it is engaging, whether he addresses the legal basis of outlawry or the origins
                    of American ballads about outlaws (several of which are included in the appendix). The history of
                    legend is clearly as important to Prassel as the history of fact, so his book is refreshingly free
                    of ham-handed "debunking." Rather, he lets legend and reality stand beside each
                    other so that readers can draw their own comparisons. And as to why Americans repeatedly have turned
                    criminals into heroes, Prassel offers some interpretations, but he allows his readers to draw their
                    own conclusions based on the wealth of information he offers.</p>
            <p>Whether fact or legend, the record of criminals is an important part of American heritage. This is,
                    accordingly, a useful book despite many minor errors (especially some fractured etymologies), and it
                    is moreover a highly entertaining one for a work of careful scholarship supported by a large
                    bibliography.</p>
            <p>To Hoosiers, the most famous outlaw of the twentieth century was John Dillinger, the bad boy of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Mooresville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. G. Russell Girardin and William J. Helmer offer in <hi rend="i">Dillinger: The Untold
                        Story</hi> an excellent case study of the type Prassel has described, a detailed explication of
                    fact whose purpose is to demolish legend. Girardin first assembled his account in the 1930s, thanks
                    to his access to Dillinger's attorney, Louis Piquett, and gofer, Arthur O'Leary.
                    Fear of several underworld and political figures implicated in Dillinger's career kept the
                    manuscript in a drawer until the 1990s, when Helmer—biographer of the
                    tommygun—helped Girardin revise it. The result is perhaps the most comprehensive
                    biography of a famous criminal, expanded by Helmer's interesting parallels between the
                    careers of Dillinger and J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
            <p>All the "untold" details are here, from the truth behind the wooden gun used in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crown Point</settlement>
                    </placeName> jailbreak to the real story of the "woman in red." Thanks to
                    Helmer's expansions, the result is more than a record of a criminal's career; it
                    is a thoughtful exploration of Dillinger's place in American history and of his enormous
                        <pb n="233" id="VAA4025-091-2-087"/> influence on the development of modern law enforcement. It
                    should, therefore, appeal to a wide audience, drawing the attention of scholars as well as crime

            <p>In a history of relations with the Indians that is usually characterized as relatively harmonious and
                    tolerant, the French in eighteenth-century North America encountered three native groups that they
                    set out deliberately to destroy. The story of their efforts against two of them, the Natchez and the
                    Chickasaws, are relatively well known. The third confrontation, against the Mesquakies or Foxes of
                    the western <geogName>Great Lakes</geogName>, has not been fully studied and is the subject of this

                    scene of chaos, violence, and destruction and demonstrate that, in the history of Fox-French
                    relations from the 1680s to the 1730s, there was no "middle ground" of peaceful
                    accommodation.</p>

                    French trade goods and weapons while blocking French trade with the Sioux. French policy was to

                    and the French became mortal enemies.</p>
            <p>Edmunds and Peyser detail the ways in which intertribal relations became less chaotic by the early

                    foreign policy inhibited Fox action, and the emergence of warriors in positions of political
                    leadership isolated them from tribes that should have been supportive. During an extended battle in

                    the Senecas. Reduced to a handful of people, the Mesquakies found sanctuary among the Sauks. Thus
                    began a relationship that by the early nineteenth century was so close it appeared to the <placeName>

            <p>Sadly, Michael J. McTighe did not live to see this excellent piece of scholarship in print. Scholars
                    of religion and of antebellum America will benefit, however, from his careful and searching look
                    into the role Protestants played in shaping the public culture of the key commercial city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>. By focusing on the years 1836 to 1860, McTighe has given us a case study of the ways
                    in which religious leaders and ideas helped to form culture in an area and a period that has long
                    attracted special scholarly attention.</p>
            <p>While neither providing dramatic new theories nor challenging old ones, this work serves a useful
                    function by further refining ideas and assumptions common to studies of antebellum American society
                    and religion. For example, the author maintains that with the possible exception of the temperance
                    crusade, Protestants in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> fell somewhat short of forming the stereotypical "evangelical united
                    front." Neither did the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> temperance movement follow the expected path of moving from moral suasion to legal
                    coercion. (Instead, Protestants employed both methods at varying times with uneven results.) And
                    while Protestants certainly formed <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s social and economic elite, their "substantial presence" in
                    the city's public culture did not amount to actual dominance (p. 11).</p>
            <p>A "measure of success" then best expresses the author's assessment of
                    Protestant efforts to guide <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s moral development. Scholars thus may be somewhat surprised to learn that
                    evangelical Protestants failed to dominate the life of a growing city in the heart of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>'s Western Reserve. Yet, the author does stress that Protestants, enmeshed in
                    the city's commercial development, "anointed" the new economy while
                    making substantial concessions. And it may be true that Protestants successfully restricted the
                    harsher aspects of commercial development by insisting on a doctrine of "service and
                    stewardship" from society's more fortunate members. Still, the Protestant
                    churches' willingness to accommodate the commercial economy cannot but remind readers of
                    southern churches' willingness to "anoint" slavery. Selling of church
                    pews to the powerful was common to both North and South.</p>
            <p>Considering the recent scholarship on slavery's role in creating denominational disputes,
                    however, discussion of the slavery issue <pb n="235" id="VAA4025-091-2-089"/> is not a strength of
                    this work. While providing several key insights, the author's brief overview of this topic
                    may too quickly dismiss the role the slavery controversy played among <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Protestants. (Reference to antislavery activity being a
                    "hindrance" or a "diversion" seems especially unfortunate.) No
                    doubt antislavery sentiment ran more deeply in the Western Reserve's rural regions, but one
                    might also argue that Protestants successfully promoted anti-slavery views even in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, providing still further evidence of their role in the region's public
                    culture.</p>
            <p>By 1860 Protestantism's substantial presence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> was eroding, a fact due as much to the imperatives of economic development as to the
                    city's growing diversity. During the 1850s Protestants were not so prominent at the
                    city's public rituals, while immigrant opposition had weakened efforts to enforce both
                    temperance and the Sabbath. What had once been a relatively homogeneous Western Reserve community
                    had evolved into a modern commercial city. Ironically, as McTighe's forthright study makes
                    clear, Protestant willingness to embrace the new economy had helped to set the stage for their own
                    growing impotence. Yet Protestant influence, while fading, had certainly placed its imprint on the
                    city and its culture.</p>

            <p>In a real sense, the Confederate States of America lived in turmoil from birth to death. No
                    "Three Musketeers" quality marked southern efforts in secession, in war, or in
                    defeat. Perhaps the dichotomy of the Confederacy had its roots in the attempt to wage a national
                    revolution by constitutional means. This contradictory procedure—and fundamental
                    problem—boiled down to the question of how an embryonic nation was going to maintain a
                    conservative upheaval against a well-established political system.</p>
            <p>Also muddying the waters from the beginning, as George Rable shows in this highly provocative study,
                    was the not-so-subtle conflict between black slavery and white democracy. Confederate
                    constitution-makers agreed on securing the future of slavery, yet defining clearly the nature of a
                    slave republic proved quite difficult. "The balance of powers between the cotton states and
                    the rest of the South, not to mention the intricate connections of political stability, white
                    mobility, and class relations," were nagging issues that Confederate officials could not
                    overlook (p. 54).</p>
            <pb n="236" id="VAA4025-091-2-090"/>
            <p>Equally as fascinating was the wartime revolution that southerners levied against politics. This
                    trend began in the spring of 1861 when fire-eaters grew testy at the capital's being moved
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery</region>
                    </placeName> to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In their eyes, the transfer made it easier for Upper South conservatives to exert more
                    influence on appointments and policy.</p>
            <p>The southern nation had no "national" identity and many states' righters
                    were not interested in acquiring one. Other leaders south of the Potomac viewed centralized decision
                    making with alarm. After all, Federal usurpation of constitutional authority had forced the South
                    from what once had been an honorable Union. Thus the Confederate experiment became a constant
                    tug-of-war between political idealism and political practice. What southern leaders wanted never
                    materialized much beyond secession. Yet that did not stop politicians from trying to implement
                    dreams-even the unrealistic ones.</p>
            <p>At the heart of ultimate failure, Rable firmly believes, was the Confederacy's inability to
                    reconcile the tensions and the differences between unity and liberty. Jefferson Davis and Alexander
                    H. Stephens, the South's ranking wartime leaders, personified the ongoing battle between
                    unity and libertarianism; by the midway point of the Civil War the two men were not on speaking
                    terms.</p>
            <p>The failure to form political parties, where individuals could blow off steam without doing any
                    damage to governmental machinery, resulted as well in an administration that drifted with the winds
                    of fortune.</p>
            <p>As for Davis, his arrest and imprisonment in 1865 "began his slow transformation from an
                    all-purpose scapegoat to Lost Cause martyr Iand] made Davis seem more victim than villain"
                    (p. 299).</p>
            <p>Rable argues convincingly that in the end Confederate politics did more to strengthen the southern
                    nation than weaken it. If historians have wearied of underscoring the internal dissension rampant in
                    the Confederacy, Rable is quick to show that the arguing was commendable. After all, national unity
                    and personal liberty are among the highest goals to which men can aspire.</p>

            <p>Jack Conroy's literary reputation rests primarily on one novel and his editorship of three
                    short-lived, small-circulation, depression-era <pb n="237" id="VAA4025-091-2-091"/> magazines. In
                    terms of quantity, this output would hardly seem sufficient to justify such a massive biography. But
                    as Douglas Wixson argues, Conroy's importance far exceeds his specific literary production.
                    As editor of <hi rend="i">Rebel Poet, Anvil</hi>, and <hi rend="i">New Anvil</hi>, Conroy fostered
                    the growth and recognition of a wide range of midwestern and southern worker-writers, including
                    Erskine <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Caldwell</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Richard Wright, Meridel Le Sueur, and Nelson Algren. In his autobiographical
                    proletarian novel, <hi rend="i">The Disinherited</hi> (1933), Conroy drew on "the
                    subliterary traditions of orality and worker expression" (p. 341) to capture brilliantly
                    the working-class culture of midwestern mining communities and factories. Finally, Wixson
                    demonstrates the way in which Conroy symbolized a broad-based, midwestern radicalism that has been
                    largely overlooked by historians.</p>
            <p>In using the label "worker-writer," Wixson emphasizes that Conroy viewed his
                    literary career and proletarian labor experience as mutually reinforcing. Unlike most writers from
                    working-class backgrounds, Conroy did not see his talents as a means of escaping into the middle
                    class. Rather, he made a conscious decision to remain a worker and use his writing to convey
                    working-class experience. Conroy viewed literature as a weapon in the class struggle, necessary, as
                    Wixson says, "to reproduce from the fragmented evidence of a confused and broken reality a
                    coherent narrative that remains true to the heterogeneous cultural diversity and irregular textures
                    of the original experience" (p. 229).</p>
            <p>Drawing on recent literary theory, Wixson traces the wide range of influences on Conroy's
                    writing that enabled him to transform his personal experiences into the story of an entire class-the
                    economically dispossessed workers during the Depression. "In place of strong authorial
                    discourse and carefully delineated psychological characterizations," Wixson comments,
                    "Conroy's writing in this period explores the intertextual relations of his
                    experience and reading, crossing the line repeatedly between oral and literary, folk vision and
                    social history" (p. 347). This intimate familiarity with proletarian culture also made
                    Conroy an outstanding folklorist when he worked for the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Writers' Project in the late 1930s.</p>
            <p>The book's greatest strength is in the way it recaptures the socioliterary culture of
                    midwestern radicals in the 1920s and 1930s. Often ignored in histories of the American left,
                    midwestern radical thought tended to be much less ideological and more individualistic and eccentric
                    than the east coast variety. Wixson recaptures not only the spirit and character of this culture,
                    but also the processes by which it was disseminated. Because of the vast geographical distance
                    separating them, midwestern radical intellectuals often communicated through letters for years
                    before actually meeting. In this way, an extensive epistolary network was established, connecting
                    various isolated radicals into a grass-roots network. Out of this community of
                    correspondents—nearly all of whom, like Conroy, were
                    "worker-writers"—emerged the journals which Conroy edited. <pb n="238" id="VAA4025-091-2-092"/> Wixson also discusses in great detail the problematic relations between
                    this group of organic intellectuals and the Communist party, which always distrusted the
                    individualism of the midwesterners. But as Wixson makes clear in this fine biography, the same
                    elements that made Conroy such a suspect Communist—his belief in democracy,
                    decentralization, and grass—roots activism—made him an effective spokesperson
                    for the "disinherited."</p>

                    women in uniform, raising families, schooling, loved ones, and the end of the war.</p>
            <p>The most compelling reaction for many readers will be the immediacy of the war—the degree
                    to which these women fifty years later remember events, people, and feelings. Their recorded
                    memories constitute powerful testimony to the emotional power of oral history to make the past seem
                    real. The reader can feel the joy still persisting as these women recall with pride their
                    contributions-as in the case of Rose Kaminski, who learned to operate an industrial crane in just
                    three days, not the three weeks she was told it would take: "It just came to me: I loved
                    it" (p. 12). These memories include too the strong bonds that the war forged among women on
                    the home front—the kind of support groups that would come to life in more formal ways
                    three decades later. And there are the stories that capture the heavy hand of ethnic differences

                    one's ethnic neighborhood or community. In the end, many of these women comment on the ways
                    in which the war accelerated the pace of change and forced them to grow up more quickly.</p>

                    Compact disc. $39.95.)</head>
            <p>Cecelia Tichi first became interested in country music around 1987, when she moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName> to assume a position as an English professor at Vanderbilt University. She explains in
                    her preface: "This book arose from the discovery that my newfound music interest was linked
                    in profound ways to my area of professional knowledge, American literature. Country music, I
                    realized, is really about the <hi rend="i">country</hi>—the U.S.A.—as the
                    nation has been represented in its literature and its visual arts" (p. x).</p>
            <p>To prove her point, Tichi details the ways in which country music has focused on the same themes that
                    have attracted American writers and artists for nearly three centuries: the road, loneliness, the
                    American West, the spiritual quest, nature, and the importance of home.</p>
            <p>Tichi's "discovery" of the connection between country music and more elite
                    art forms will not startle anyone who is familiar with the traditional themes commonly found in rock
                    &amp; roll, movies, television shows, or almost any of the popular arts. Indeed, it would be
                    surprising if country music or any other popular art form did not share the same themes as American
                    literature and art, since they are all products of the same basic culture.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, Tichi sometimes stretches her argument beyond the point of credibility. A good example
                    is her attempt to link Steve Earle's raucous 1986 hit, "Guitar Town,"
                    with literature of the Revolutionary War era. It seems unlikely that inspiration for
                    Earle's honky tonk anthem really was Thomas Jefferson's <hi rend="i">Notes on the
                        State of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                        </placeName>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tichi's determination to treat country as simply an extension of literature or the visual
                    arts does a disservice to the music. Her elitist approach neglects the music's distinct
                    heritage and ignores country music's folk appeal. It does not analyze the relationship
                    between country music and its audience. Her approach also fails to explore the complex and often
                    contradictory messages contained in the music.</p>
            <p>Country music is not, furthermore, the monolith that Tichi portrays. By concentrating mostly on the
                    more sophisticated styles of performers such as Rodney Crowell and Emmylou Harris, Tichi gives short
                    shrift to the social and cultural significance of down-home performers like Loretta Lynn and Bill <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Monroe</region>
                    </placeName>, country pop singers such as Tim McGraw and Billy Ray Cyrus, or honky tonk heroes like
                    Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams, Jr.</p>
            <p>Despite these shortcomings, Tichi does succeed in calling scholarly attention to the historical
                    importance of country music, and by <pb n="240" id="VAA4025-091-2-094"/> extension to all forms of
                    popular culture. Her interviews and profiles of several country performers, especially Richard
                    Bennett, Mike Lawler, Kathy Chiavola, and Rodney Crowell, provide valuable insights into the
                    contemporary country music business. The University of <placeName>

            <p>Despite the seminal work of the late V. O. Key, Jr., on southern politics and state political
                    systems, there have been relatively few recent, comprehensive examinations of the government and

                    politics, some excellent books on intergovernmental relations, and occasional texts on the
                    government of particular states, most state polities have not received the same degree of attention
                    and careful study as has the national government.</p>

            <p>The framework for <hi rend="i">The Other Brahmins</hi> resembles that of numerous sociological
                    studies of black communities published between the 1930s and 1950s. In examining the black upper
                    class in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1950, Adelaide M. Cromwell seeks to determine whether this group was social,
                    economic, or political. A second question concerns the general American definition of upper class
                    and its usefulness in describing African-American experiences. The overall objective is to establish
                    the relationship between class and caste based on the experiences of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s black upper class.</p>
            <p>The conclusions of the primary research chapters are similar to conclusions of other studies as well.
                    For example, people identified as members of the black upper class in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1950 were primarily members of Episcopalian, Congregational, or Catholic churches;
                    born in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> area; and generally not college graduates. Although 86 percent of the women surveyed
                    were married, 25 percent had no children, and only 10 percent had more than three. Most owned the
                    houses in which they lived. The families took vacations, enrolled their children in music and dance
                    classes, participated in a variety of social clubs (some of them exclusive), and socialized
                    primarily in public (rather than in their homes as an earlier generation did). Predictably, they did
                    not base upper-class status on income or occupation, and they believed that color (complexion) was a
                    factor in individual opportunities. They did not identify with Africa, but they had strong opinions
                    supporting people of color around the world. And they were sharply divided on the question of
                    whether segregation retarded or enhanced African-American advancement.</p>

            <p>Although <hi rend="i">The Other Brahmins</hi> is similar in its specifics to other studies, this book
                    remains useful in many ways. First, it traces the evolution of the black upper class from the
                    mid-eighteenth century to 1950, showing and explaining the changes in its base. The chapters
                    focusing on the results of the questionnaires, interviews, and observations provide a unique primary
                    source for historians in that they concern women's perspectives. The ninety questionnaires
                    returned by white women and the forty returned by black women also provide the basis for a unique
                    comparison, not typical of the studies published around the time that this one was completed as a
                    dissertation. These factors alone make this an important study.</p>
            <p>Cromwell's major conclusions, however, tend to be predictable. The one exception seems
                    stunning. She notes that in 1950, the black upper class in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> constituted a "theoretically important" (p. 199) deviation compared
                    to conclusions of other studies. "Family membership, style of life, long-time local
                    residence, and shared memories of the past" were more important factors in determining
                    status than occupational achievement (p. 199). The implication is that Boston lagged far behind the
                    rest of the country in this post-New Deal, post-World War II period. More similar to other studies,
                    Cromwell concludes that over time, upper-class status for African Americans depended on the economic
                    and social opportunities available and was subject to change according to those factors. And
                    finally, although Cromwell never says so directly, the detailed history she provides indicates that
                    the black upper class in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName> operated as a social, political, and economic group over time.</p>
            <p>All these conclusions are useful if the following points are kept in mind. First, the earlier
                    historical chapters of the study focus on leadership, but the basis of the primary research is the
                    upper class. These two conditions are sometimes synonymous, but not always. And second, the earlier
                    chapters focus on men, while the primary research seems to come overwhelmingly from women. Given
                    that this book was published more than forty years after it was conceptualized and executed as a
                    dissertation, and that many other studies have provided similar conclusions over the decades (though
                    dealing with different locales), the details from the lives of these women might be the most
                    important contribution of this book. As a post-migration, pre—civil rights era primary
                    source on black, urban, upper-class women's lives, the core chapters of the book may be
                    invaluable.</p>

            <p>Louis Vasquez's autobiography includes a wealth of detail about life among Mexican-Americans
                    in northwest Indiana, about work at the Inland steel mill, and about amateur sports and Indiana
                    basketball. Among the experiences he describes are serving in the army in World War II, leading
                    church and veterans groups after the war, visiting relatives in Mexico, and running a
                    Spanish-language movie theater. <hi rend="i">Sarah McNair Vosmeier, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, IN 47138. In mid-July, 1863, Confederate General John Hunt Morgan deliberately
                    disobeyed instructions and led nearly 2,500 cavalrymen on a raid across southeastern Indiana and
                    through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. In this brief work, David L. Taylor chronicles the movements of Morgan's men
                    and describes Hoosier fear and excitement during the raid. Although Morgan's raid is more
                    fully recounted in longer monographs, Taylor uses anecdotes to enliven his account of
                    Morgan's men as they passed through southern Indiana towns. <hi rend="i">Matthew N.
