            Conditions of Travel Experienced by German Immigrants to 
                        Dubois County

            A German who desired to migrate to another country was required to go through a considerable amount
                    of formality before permission was granted to leave the village where he lived. First, a statement
                    from the tax collector had to be obtained, which indicated that all the taxes were paid; secondly, a
                    statement from the military commander was necessary, which showed his military status. With these
                    documents he appeared before the Landrath (district judge) and petitioned for a
                    pass, which, after much delay, was granted to him provided everything was satisfactory.1
            
            The following is a translation of a pass issued to Michael Schultheis of 
                        Feuerthal
                    , 
                        Germany
                    , who emigrated to Ferdinand, Indiana, in 1848:

                        By the decision of yesterday's police court Michael Schultheis, from Feuerthal and
                            of the same jurisdiction, born on December 27, 1801, as well as his legitimate son, Lampert
                            Schultheis, born on September 17, 1839, was granted permission to emigrate to North America,
                            and take his property, and is hereby released from Bavarian citizenship. Official Document

            The man with some means would also find it advisable to make a will, in the hope that disputes over
                    his worldly possessions might be avoided, in case he died on the journey to America. The will of the
                    above-mentioned Michael Schultheis is interesting because of several unusual features. It also
                    indicates that he was a devout Catholic.
            
                    Michael Schultheis, emigrant to North America according to the passport issued by the royal
                        government of Lower Franconia and Aschaffenburg of the kingdom of Bavaria on June 3, 1848, and
                        possessor of the same, hereby declares that in case he should meet with an accident and die
                        during the passage, but that his son Lampert Schultheis should remain living, as follows:
                    I demand of the captain of the ship and shall hold him accountable at the final judgment, to see
                        to it that my son Lampert, as the sole heir of the possessions which I have with me on this
                        journey, be taken along with these possessions to Michael Vierheilig in 
                            Mount Carmel
                        , 
                            Wabash County
                        , State of 
                            Illinois
                        , North America, and that this Michael Vierheilig, as his nearest friend, be
                        designated by the court of that locality as guardian and foster father of this my son. Should it
                        please God that both I and my son should die on this ocean trip, but that my money and valuables
                        be saved, in that case I demand, as already stated, that this money be returned to the district
                        court of Hammelburg, from which I am emigrating, as a gift for the establishment of a single
                            "Engelamt"4 of the church of Feuerthal; the remainder,
                        however, to be held in trust for the establishment of poor relief in the community of Feuerthal.
                    That this is my last will I affirm by my signature and I shall hold those accountable who violate
                        this my last will. This my last will I am having witnessed by the local administration and by
                        the Reverend Father of this community and confirmed by the district court of Hammelburg.
                    So done, at

                     5 Translated from the original will of Michael Schultheis, which is
                            now in the possession of his great-granddaughter, Mrs. Ira Rothrock of 
                                Mt. Vernon
                            , Indiana.
               
                     according to the financial status of a man. But because most of
                    the Germans who left their homes did so with the determination to make the new country of their
                    adoption their permanent home, everyone probably needed to make some provision for the disposal of
                    his possessions.6
            
            Since the distance to the seaboard was not great and the cost light, the journey to America was
                    within reach of those with limited funds. The steamship fare to America cost from nineteen to
                    twenty-five dollars, and thus it may be seen that many comparatively poor people were able to
                    attempt the journey to the New World.7
            
            A somewhat exaggerated description of what one might have seen occasionally on the Strassburg Road
                    pictures a group of Bavarian emigrants with carts, carrying small boxes, which contained the few
                    possessions of these people. The carts were drawn by starved, drooping beasts. On top of the boxes
                    sat women and children too exhausted to walk.8 Other emigrants relied on
                    dilapidated carriages, in which young and old, men, women, and children were crowded together with
                    the baggage and with tools of every description. They traveled slowly from station to station, and
                    from country to country, in filth and in misery; in the winter they froze, and in the summer they
                    suffocated. Without the proper food, medical attendance, or guidance, the hardships mounted higher
                    and higher. When they arrived at the port of embarkation, they were in a deplorable condition. Here
                    it was necessary for them to submit to long and tiresome formalities before they could sail.9
            
            Some ports of embarkation were more popular than others. From the table which follows it is apparent
                    that a large number of Germans who migrated to 
                        Dubois County
                     came from areas in the proximity of 
                        Bremen
                    .

            Many Germans, however, were cautious and did not emigrate blindly. Most of them knew where they were
                    going, what they expected to find, and how they would reach their destination. Their tickets usually
                    were issued directly to an inland point in America.11
                    
                        Bremen
                     was not only a popular part of embarkation for Germans, but also for other
                    nationalities. Among these were Polish emigrants who were going to America and did not understand
                    just where they were going, whether it was North or South America. To them it was all America. The
                    Germans, however, were well-supplied with maps and could point out to the casual inquirer exactly
                    the place of their several destinations. For instance, a German chair maker who planned to join his
                    brother in 
                        San Francisco
                     took delight in showing a prepaid ticket from 
                        Bremen
                     to that city.12
            
            The Germans had boxes, trunks, and chests nailed up, full of cherished possessions, but the Poles and
                    Bohemians had only what was on their backs. For example, in a group of twenty-four Poles the only
                    baggage that could be found was twenty-four pipes. If they did have baggage, their vivandiere carried it. The young men never gave this pack bearer a lift, but the poor
                    woman with bended back always brought up the rear.13
            
            Usually, several days before the emigrant sailed, he purchased his ticket from the ship company for
                    his passage to the 
                        United States
                     and, no doubt, agreed to abide by the conditions stipulated on it. Below is a copy of
                    the regulations printed on the back of a ticket issued in 1852.
            
               The cabins will be assigned by the Bureau of Chrystie, Heinrich & Co., and no one may
                        occupy a cabin alone. They are arranged to accommodate four people.

               If one or the other wants to change his cabin, this must be reported to the Bureau.
               The large trunks and boxes must be placed in the hold, as well as the potatoes, hard-tack, and
                        wine.
               While the ship is in the harbor, permission is not granted to go down to the hold. The same
                        will be opened on the ocean, in order that every passenger may bring up the necessary food.
               
                        The trunks, boxes, sacks, and barrels must be distinctly marked with the number of the
                            owner's cabin.
                        Arms must be handed over to the captain.
                        The passengers have to put their own luggage and food on board and take it off. The captain
                            is not responsible for it.
                        The passengers provide their own bedding and the necessary cooking utensils. The paillasses
                            have to be brought on board already filled.

               Those passengers who do not have the above-mentioned food on board twelve hours before the
                        departure of the ship, will be turned away and lose their passage.
               
                        Cleanliness in the strictest sense must be observed here in the harbor and particularly
                            daring the voyage in between decks, in order that no contagious diseases will arise.
                        It is the duty of everyone to keep his cabin and the space in front of it clean and neat, and
                            only if that is the case, will he be permitted to cook.
                        The fresh water may be used only for drinking and in the preparation of food.
                        Everyone is requested to provide himself with fresh drinking water for several days.
                    
               Nails, hooks, etc. may not be driven any where into the ship.
               Smoking, striking fire, and burning of lights is strictly forbidden as long as the ship is in
                        the harbor. When the ship is on the ocean, smoking will be permitted on deck only with covered
                        pipes, however.
               Only with the permission of the captain may a light be lighted in between decks, but never
                        without a lantern, and it is strictly forbidden to bring matches on board.
               
                        Disputes and quarrels are never permitted to take place either among the passengers or among
                            the crew.
                        Whoever has a complaint, is to go directly to the captain, to whose decision as well as to
                            that of the steersman everyone must willingly subordinate himself.
                    
               The captain retains the stern of the deck for himself.
               It is strictly forbidden to give wine, brandy, or other alcoholic drinks to the crew. Whoever
                        does that has to expect to have his liquors locked up until he arrives in America.
               
               The same thing will happen to him who becomes intoxicated and because of that causes disorder
                        on board.
               The passage money is payable the day before the date set for departure. Whoever is not on
                        board when the ship sails forfeits his passage. Every one is to be on board two hours before the
                        hour set for departure, especially the women and children, and everybody is to purchase bread
                        for five or six days.
               The passports are to be examined at the police headquarters. Whoever neglects to do that has
                        only himself to blame for the consequences.
               When the ship has departed from the harbor, all passengers must report on deck and assemble
                        there by families, likewise the holders of the same passage, and must stay together. Their names
                        will then be read from the passenger list; every one responds and should immediately go between
                        decks until the roll call is completed.
               All these arrangements are made solely for the best interests of the passengers, for their
                        safety, for their comfort, and health. Therefore the captain has a right to expect not to have
                        to be stern; he hopes to rely on the wisdom and love of order of the passengers, that the
                        present regulations of the ship will be adhered to in all its parts, especially in regard to No.
                        14, because through violation the worst consequences for all may be expected.14
               
            
            It took a healthy, stout body to survive the hardships of the sea voyage, and many fell victims to
                        disease.15 The "Leibnitz," sometimes referred to as the
                    "Fever Ship," has probably received more publicity than any other emigrant vessel.
                    It left Hamburg on November 2, 1867, with 544 German passengers and arrived in 
                        New York
                    , January 11, 1868, with only 436. Many of the emigrants were from Mecklenburg where an
                    epidemic of cholera had made its inroads, and consequently, these peasants carried the pestilence on
                    board the ship. The ocean became the resting place for many a body on this ship; a piece of
                    sailcloth formed the shroud and coffin. When the ship reached the 
                        United States
                    , the 
                        New York
                     Commissioners of Emigration ordered an investigation. The passengers were filthy, and
                    it was almost impossible to find a clean spot on the ladder or on the ropes. The scuppers were
                    chocked with rotten food, pieces of bread, buckets of beans, barley, and chunks of meat, all mingled
                    with straw and sweepings of refuse which had frozen. Lanterns

                            November, 1852. The Schmidt family of three adults embarked at 
                                Havre
                            , their destination in America was Buffalo, 
                                New York
                            . This ticket is in the possession of Robert Irrmann of

                     had been hung in the orlop deck, but on account of the foulness
                    of the air, they could scarcely burn. Provisions were short and partly rotten. The passengers never
                    received more than one-half pint of drinkable water per day, but by the laws of the 
                        United States
                     they were entitled to receive three quarts per day. The butter was rancid, and the food
                    so poorly cooked that, in spite of their hunger, the people threw it overboard. The emigrants were
                    treated more like beasts of burden than human beings. The findings of the committee which inspected
                    the ship reported that the deplorable conditions were due to the lack of good ventilation, filthy
                    habits of the emigrants, insufficient water, unwholesome food, overcrowding the vessel, and the
                    absence of a physician.16
            
            Twenty years before the "Leibnitz" docked, the arrival of cholera-infected
                    emigrants from Havre in December, 1848, at 
                        New Orleans
                    , had spread the epidemic along the 
                        Mississippi
                     and its tributaries, and in river towns one thousand miles distant from each other.17' In another instance when 9,872 Germans arrived in 
                        New York
                    , four hundred had to be taken to the hospital immediately, and one hundred died en
                    route. On the "Pontiac" were 230 emigrants and forty found their grave in the
                    ocean. Sixty-six Germans were on the ship, and forty-five had to be sent to the hospital as soon as
                    they landed; some died and others went insane. Many who were healthy when they left the ship soon
                    died because of homesickness, disease, or hunger.18
            
            Those who migrated to 
                        Dubois County
                     also encountered similar hardships. The Sang family came from 
                        Germany
                     in 1827. Eleven weeks were spent on the water. Just when land was in sight, a storm
                    arose which drove the vessel out to sea and shattered it. About five weeks were required to make the
                    port. For approximately a week, they were without water and provisions, and they were practically
                    starved when they finally reached land. When the Smith family emigrated

            The naturalization records indicate that between 1853 and 1869 
                        New Orleans
                     was the most popular port, but after 1869 
                        New York
                     took first place.
            The arrival of a German emigrant ship in the North River aroused excitement along the wharf as the
                    following vivid description shows: 
                        The long wharf is crowded full of trucks and carts, and drays, waiting for the passengers. As
                            you approach the end you come upon a noisy crowd of strange faces and stranger costumes.
                            Moustached peasants in Tyrolese hats are arguing in unintelligible English with
                            truckdrivers: runners from the German hotels are pulling the confused women hither and
                            thither; peasant girls with bare heads, and the rich-flushed, nut brown faces you never see
                            here, are carrying huge bundles to the heaps of baggage; children in doublets and hose, and
                            queer little caps, are mounted on the trunks, or swung off amid the laughter of the crowd
                            with ropes from the ship's sides. Some are just welcoming an old face, so dear in
                            the strange land, some are letting down the huge trunks, some swearing in very genuine low
                            Dutch, at the endless noise and distractions. They bear the plain marks of the Old World.
                            Healthy, stout frames, and low, degraded faces with many stamps of inferiority, dependences,
                            servitude on them; little graces of costume, too-a colored head-dress or a fringed
                            coat-which never could have originated here; and now and then a sweet face, with the rich
                            bloom and the dancing blue eyes, that seem to reflect the very glow and beauty of the vine

                    laboring in the fields.22
            
            When the Germans left their port of debarkation one of the following four routes brought most of them
                    into the interior. The first one was to 
                        Albany
                     on the steamboat and from there on the Erie Canal to Buffalo, and then on Lake Erie to
                            
                  Cleveland, Detroit
               , and Milwaukee. The second one was up the 
                        Mississippi
                     and its tributaries, the 
                        Missouri
                     or the 
                        Ohio
                    . The third one was to travel by canal and train through 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to the Ohio River. And the fourth one was from Quebec up the St.
                    Lawrence to Montreal, 
                        Toronto
                    , and Buffalo.23
            
            No doubt, the means of transportation was just as varied as some of the costumes that the emigrants
                    wore. For example, a German Lutheran minister and his family who were moving from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to the Big Miami used a horse and wagon. He rode on the horse smoking his pipe which
                    resembled a musical instrument called a serpent, and the wife and children walked along beside the
                        wagon.24
            
            Some of the Germans brought wagons along from their own country in order to proceed towards the West.
                    These, however, had not been built for the rough roads of the 
                        United States
                    , and many people abandoned them in favor of the American Conestoga wagon,25 frequently referred to as the land ship. These covered wagons could be seen along the
                    countryside loaded with from three to four tons-and since they were well-protected, sheltered the
                    immigrants and their property from inclement weather.26 Those who tried to
                    continue with their old wagons were frequently burdened with broken axles and wheels, or forced to
                    toil along with a dilapidated vehicle.27

                     on the 
                        Ohio
                    , some arrived with furniture, farming implements, and others with large families but
                    only a few worldly possessions.28 Many of these people who traveled to southern
                    Indiana made use of the flatboats down the Ohio River.29
                    These flatboats or arks were large and roomy enough so that the family household goods, horses,
                    hogs, cattle, and fowl could be brought on one boat. Some had comfortable and separate apartments
                    fitted with chairs, beds, tables, and stoves.30 Immigrants from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , if bound for Indiana, 
                        Illinois
                    , or 
                        Missouri
                     either built or purchased a flatboat. At times several families fitted up a large boat
                    in partnership and secured an 
                  
                            Ohio
                         Pilot, a book that professed to instruct them in the mysteries of the
                    navigation of the 
                        Ohio
                    .31
            
            No doubt, the journey down the river did become tiresome, and the boatmen often entertained with
                    river melodies such as the following: 
                        Here's to those that has old clothes, And never a wife to mend 'em; A
                            plague on those that has halfjoes, And has'n't a heart to spend
                                'em!32
                  
                    
                
            Later when steamships came into use on the river, economy apparently was the watchword of some
                    owners, much to the sorrow of their passengers. On one steamboat only one bedroom candlestick was to
                    be found, and it was handed from one to the other; one towel also made the rounds.33
            
            The regular steamboat fare including meals from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1836 was ten dollars and from

            From newspaper accounts, it is obvious that the route by way of 
                        Buffalo
                    , Lake Erie, and 
                        Detroit
                     was very popular in steamboat days. On October 7, 1834, four steamboats with with nine
                    hundred emigrants followed this route.35 The steamboats and schooners in 1835
                    were constantly crowded with people wending their way west by the route of Lake Erie.36 Between three and five boats went up the lake daily and were crowded to capacity.37 It has been asserted that approximately nine-tenths of the immigrants from
                    Europe traveled by water in the 1830's.38
            
            Immigrant travel to the West by train did not assume important proportions until the 1850's.
                    On Saturday, July 1, 1854, two great trains filled with eight hundred immigrants and their baggage
                    left 
                  Albany, New
                        York
               , for the West via the 
                        New York
                     Central Road, the largest number ever carried over this road in one day. The first
                    train was drawn by three locomotives, and it consisted of five baggage and twenty-one immigrant
                    cars; the second one was also drawn by three locomotives, and it included two baggage and fourteen
                    immigrant cars. Most of the immigrants were Germans, Hollanders, and Swiss.39
                    The immigrant trains that passed over the 
                        New York
                     and Erie Railroad in the 1850's also attracted attention as they rolled to the
                    West and, no doubt, were a curiosity. The windows of the cars were decorated with green vegetation,
                    and a large number of the passengers entertained themselves by smoking long German pipes and singing
                    German songs.40
            
            The furniture and belongings of the immigrants on steamships differed according to the origin of
                    their owner. Those of the Yankee were limited to a 
                        Dearborn
                     wagon, feather bed, a saddle and bridle, and some knickknacks. A glance at the property
                    of the Swiss and Germans convinced one of their

                     love for family relics. One might see a portrait of a
                    quaint-looking wagon among the illuminated letters of a vellum-bound edition of Virgil's
                        Bucolics. The wagon itself was also there, taking up precious space; it might
                    have been of some value in a museum, but it cost approximately five times its value to transport
                    across the ocean. Its interior was filled with beds, saddles, plows, shovels, chairs, clocks, and
                    carpets, and its sides were decorated with rusty pots, kettles, pans, iron candlesticks, old
                    horseshoes, and broken tobacco pipes.41
            
            A German who traveled in the 
                        United States
                     in 1842 commented on the means of transportation. The railroad cars were comfortable
                    and roomy, but the windows had to be kept down as sparks from the locomotive were apt to endanger
                    the passengers. The stagecoach had three benches for nine passengers, but one bounced around quite a
                    bit. The canalboats, drawn by horses., required much stooping because of the large number of low
                        bridges.42
            
            It is almost impossible to imagine the conditions of travel in Indiana before 1825. No railroad,
                    canal, or pike was to be found; and fallen trees, ripples, and bars made navigation impossible on
                    all her rivers except the 
                        Ohio
                    .43 There were, however, a number of trails; among the most
                    outstanding ones in southern Indiana were: Buffalo Trace,44 Red Banks Trace,
                    Yellow Banks Trace, 
                        Rome
                     Trail, Blue River Trace, Vallonia Trace, Salt Trace, and
                    Whetzel's Trace. These traces are shown on the accompanying map.45

               EARLY INDIANA TRAILS AND ROADS
            
            Routes which led into the interior of the state included the National Road, which was used by those
                    migrating from 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     A stage line ran from 
                        Madison
                     to the East Fork or Driftwood Branch of the White River, crossing
                    at the mouth of Flat Rock Creek. From 
                        Jeffersonville
                    
                     and 
                        New Albany
                     two routes led to the interior; one by way of 
                  Salem, Bedford
               , and 
                        Bloomington
                    , to the Wabash River at 
                        Lafayette
                    , and the other one led by way of Greenville, Paoli. Mt. Pleasant,
                    and Maysville to the Wabash River at 
                        Vincennes
                    . The 
                        Michigan
                     Road which began at 
                        Madison
                     and went north through 
                        Indianapolis
                    , no doubt, was also used by immigrants.45
            
            On February 1, 1834, by an act of the legislature of Indiana provision was made for a new state road
                    to connect 
                        Troy
                     and 
                        Jasper
                    . 47 The 
                        Princeton
                    -Fredonia Road previously constructed intersected it twelve miles south of 
                        Jasper
                    .48
            
            Buffalo Trace, as well as Indian trails and deer paths were among the first routes which admitted
                    white men to 
                        Dubois County
                    .49 A branch of Yellow Banks Trace led from near Gentryville to 
                        Jasper
                    , and the trail from 
                        Jasper
                     to near Otwell was a branch of Buffalo Trace, and from near Otwell to 
                        Vincennes
                     it was Buffalo Trace.50
            
            
               
                  Troy, Louisville
               , and 
                        Vincennes
                     served as gateways to 
                        Dubois County
                     from the outer world. It took approximately three days to make the journey from 
                        Troy
                    . The roads were in such poor condition that it was not unusual to see six or nine yoke
                    of oxen hitched to one wagon. Local roads were made by individuals in order to get to their
                    neighbor's house, store, church, graveyard, and mill. This may account for the fact that
                    old highways were made extremely winding in order to pass mills, graveyards, and churches. Stubs of
                    saplings sharpened like spears in these roads patiently waited to impale some unlucky traveler who
                    might be thrown upon them.51 A journey in the early stagecoaches was not a
                    pleasant undertaking. When the roads were dry, the passengers had to hold tightly on as the stage
                    bounced from rock to rock. When the roads were wet, the stage was apt to mire and turn over.52

               EARLY TRAILS AND ROADS IN DUBOIS COUNTY
            
            Some of the early pioneers in 
                        Dubois County
                     made use of the caleche as a means of transportation.53 The
                    flatboats built by native carpenters also served to provide a contact with the outer world. Not
                    until February 14, 1879, did a train arrive at 
                        Jasper
                    . A brass band answered the shrill whistle of the train, but no ceremonies took place
                    because of the cold weather.54

            The Germans who came to 
                        Dubois County
                     may have followed one of these traces, streams, or roads. A few examples will indicate
                    that various routes, as well as several means of transportation were used.
            The Gehlhausens traveled down the Ohio River from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to 
                        Troy
                    , Indiana, on a flatboat, which they had constructed. A number of Germans who settled in 
                        Dubois County
                     took this route; in some cases several families traveled together. Before continuing
                    the journey from 
                        Troy
                    , however, two emissaries were sent ahead on the 
                        Troy
                    -
                        Jasper
                     Road to view the land and report back to the group.55
            
            A few of the old Germans interviewed for this study gave a very enthusiastic description of how they
                    came to 
                        Dubois County
                    . Frederick Schumacher said he came to America in 1865, and from 
                        New York
                     he and his parents took the train to 
                        Evansville
                    . Upon their arrival in 
                        Evansville
                    , their relatives met them, and in a wagon they continued on their way. They settled in 
                        Pike County
                     but later Frederick came to 
                        Dubois County
                    . Mrs. Henry Lehmkuehler and her brother emigrated from 
                        Germany
                     in 1882 and joined relatives in 
                  New
                        Knoxville, Ohio
               . Their parents
                    also emigrated from 
                        Germany
                     in 1884, and from 
                        Ohio
                     they came on a flatboat down the Ohio River to Tell City, and
                    there obtained a wagon to complete their journey to 
                        Huntingburg
                    .56
            
            A large number of Germans settled in other states before making their permanent home in 
                        Dubois County
                    . By 1850 twenty-three families had migrated to 
                        Dubois County
                     from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , of which three families settled in 
                        Ohio
                     before coming to 
                        Dubois County
                    , one in 
                        Kentucky
                    , and one went from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to 
                        Virginia
                    , from 
                        Virginia
                     to 
                        Ohio
                    , and from 
                        Ohio
                     to 
                        Dubois County
                    . Forty-one families had come from 
                        Ohio
                    , one having gone to 
                        Kentucky
                     before coming to 
                        Dubois County
                    . One family came from 
                        Mississippi
                    , five from 
                        Virginia
                    ; one from 
                        Maryland
                    , and twelve from 
                        Kentucky
                    . One family which migrated from 
                        New Jersey
                     settled in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     before coming to 
                        Dubois County

                    . Twenty-three families had come from 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , and eight from 
                        Virginia
                    , of which three had settled in 
                        Kentucky
                     before coming to 
                        Dubois County
                    . One family had migrated from 
                        Maryland
                     to 
                        Ohio
                     and then to 
                        Dubois County
                    . One family left 
                        Germany
                     in 1835, was in 
                        France
                     in 1838, in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     in 1840, and in Indiana in 1846.58 A young man from Prussia,
                    twenty-two years of age, embarked at 
                        Liverpool
                     and arrived at 
                        Quebec
                     in September, 1870. From Quebec he went to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and from 
                        Cincinnati
                     to 
                        Dubois County
                    .59
            
            If the Germans were fortunate enough to have the means to emigrate and to secure official permission,
                    they left 
                        Germany
                    . Most likely, they embarked at 
                        Bremen
                     and came to 
                  New York, Baltimore
               , or 
                        New Orleans
                    . Many knew where they were going and came properly informed and supplied. Conditions on
                    board ship, in spite of strict rules, were often very bad, especially when contagious diseases
                    attacked the passengers. In the cities of the New World the immigrants aroused much interest before
                    they adopted American ways. The Erie Canal, the Mississippi River, the St.
                    Lawrence River, and the land route through 
                        Pennsylvania
                     to the Ohio River were the more common routes used to reach the
                    interior. Some brought wagons with them, and others acquired Cones-togas for the land portion of
                    their journey, while others used flatboats or steamboats on the rivers. Near the middle of the
                    century the railroads served those who could afford them. Travel in Indiana, especially in the early
                    days, was very difficult, because of the lack of roads. Many families lived in one or more states
                    before settling in 
                        Dubois County
                    . It might be anticipated that few would endure the hardships of the long journey from 
                        Germany
                     to Indiana, but there were more than twenty-eight thousand Germans living in Indiana by
                    1850, and of these sixteen hundred and three were to be found in 
                        Dubois County
                    . Surely, they must have been a hardy and determined people.

            MARTHA F. BELLINGER
            
            When 
                        Indianapolis
                     was founded in 1821, it was scarcely more than a pioneer outpost. It covered one square
                    mile, with a handful of inhabitants who battled with malaria and occasionally with Indians. Forty
                    years later the population reached 18,611. Railroad expansion brought an increase of trade and new
                    settlers. Steady growth continued, until in 1940 the citizenship numbered 455,357,2 while its area covered more than fifty-four square miles. Business and industry have
                    increased proportionally: factories, schools, hospitals, libraries, corporations, banking
                    facilities, and welfare organizations also give evidence of steady growth.
            Meanwhile, in this rich, progressive city, the arts have not been neglected; and, of all the arts
                    music was first to claim the attention of the inhabitants. While they built the factories and
                    established their shops, they took time to sing, to play the horn or melodeon, and to assemble their
                    church choirs.
            Roughly speaking, the musical growth of the city falls into three main divisions: first, the early
                    period of untrained and generally unorganized effort, ending about 1854; second, nearly a
                    half-century of choral unions, May festivals, and more or less spontaneous expression; and third,
                    since 1900, an extraordinary expansion in every department under exacting professional standards.
            
               
                  1 Facts have been gathered from a variety of sources, some of which have
                        been noted in the text. Personal interviews brought interesting events to light, and
                        questionnaires submitted to club and church officials were answered in many cases with fullness
                        and accuracy. Several of the more permanent organizations, such as the Matinee Musicale, the
                        Indianapolis Maennerchor, and the Roberts Park Choral Union, put at my disposal their
                        secretarial records and earlier historical sketches. The inception and growth of the existing
                        State Symphony Society has been well publicized, but the history of earlier heroic attempts at
                        founding a permanent local orchestra has had a tendency to escape the eye even of the
                        specialist. The whole story is assuredly not here, but antennae have been stretched, as it were,
                        into the past, in an effort to catch as much of the melody as possible. The occasional programs
                        given in the text have an importance, not en account of any singularity, but because they tell
                        us what the old-time directors chose for study, what the choristers liked to sing, and what the
                        citizens liked to hear, in short, what standards were in their mind.

            Most of the people who made the music during the first period made their living by carpentering,
                    shop-keeping, or some other utilitarian pursuit rather than by following music as a profession.
                    Nevertheless, the music teacher made an early appearance, as is shown by an advertisement stating
                    that instruction in church music could be had at reasonable terms.3 An "
                        Indianapolis
                     Handelian Society" was in existence in 18284 In 1831 James
                    Blake brought his new wife, Eliza Sproule of 
                        Baltimore
                    , to the city and with her a piano, the first in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .5 The choir of the First Baptist Church dates from 1822; and other
                    churches, as fast as they were organized, gave special attention to the choir loft. At the Second
                    Presbyterian Church, whose pastor from 1839 to 1847 was Henry Ward Beecher, the choir numbered from
                    forty to fifty. It gave public concerts and gained a state-wide celebrity. A. G. Willard, owner of
                    one of the earliest music stores, was at one time the director.6 As a theme song
                    or "signature," the choir at their public concerts used Man the
                        Lifeboat, Brother. Charles Beecher, a brother of the pastor, was one of the men who helped
                    train the choir, and also at times played the violin. He ordered "a new and magnificent
                    organ," which was pumped by hand, and which was placed at the back of the church.7
            
            Among the early teachers was William H. Currie, who offered lessons on the melodeon, organ or piano,
                    in voice, thorough bass, and harmony, and who would, on certain occasions, tune the piano. There
                    were, also Abraham Protzmann, who organized a band in 1841; George B. Downie; and Peter R. Pearsall,
                    who gathered the children together

                     for a "grand vocal and instrumental
                        concert."8 Pearsall was a veteran of the War of 1812, and from 1848
                    to 1854 he was the organist at the Beecher church and later at Christ Church. His last concert was
                    given in 1878, and it was marked by special ceremonies in recognition of his thirty years of
                    faithful service in the cause of music.9
            
            In 1843 a man named R. Parmelee set up a plant for the manufacture of pianos, but it soon failed, as
                    did another firm a few years later. Instruments, however, came into the state. According to Mrs.
                    Elizabeth E. Gunn Seebirt, Herman T. Spain of the Starr Piano Company was owner of one of the oldest
                    instruments in the city. It was built in 
                        Cincinnati
                     by Reuss with a walnut case and had six octaves.10 Lovers of
                    antiques would be interested in an historic piano now in the possession of the School of Music of
                    Indiana University. It was made about 1820 and brought to 
                        Bloomington
                     in 1823 by Professor Baynard R. Hall, the first teacher in Indiana Seminary, which
                    opened in 1824. The instrument came by wagon from 
                        Philadelphia
                     over the mountains, down the Ohio River in a flatboat, then
                    overland from 
                        Louisville
                     to Indiana. It was acquired by Joshua O. Howe in 1832 and remained in the Howe family
                    for eighty-nine years. In 1902 it was shipped to 
                        Vicksburg
                    , 
                        Mississippi
                    , where it was in the possession of Mrs. George Roberts, who bequeathed it to Indiana
                    University. It has one pedal, and the handmade case is of rosewood, decorated in gold, and inscribed
                    "New Patent, Gelb & Walker, No. 23, Maiden Lane, N.Y."11
            
            In the late forties and early fifties several brass bands came into existence—the German
                    Military, the Saxe Horn, and the Henry Hahn bands among them—with varying degrees of
                    longevity. For the fourth of July celebration, 1851, the Saxe Horn Band charged fifty dollars for
                    its services, a sum grudgingly paid by the city; and two years later

                     11 A second piano of a much later date, 1860, was purchased by the
                            father of Mrs. James A. Woodburn. It is an old-style square, Steinway and Sons makers, and
                            it was given to Indiana University by Professor Woodburn in 1912.
               
                     there was a state assembly of twelve bands, with prize banners
                    for the winning contestants. In 1857 there was the Dodsworth Band of ninety pieces, and the National
                    Guard Band, with John Philips as leader.12 About 1846-1847 a flute and string
                    "orchestra" was used as an assistance to the choir of the First Presbyterian
                    Church. It continued in existence for approximately five years.13
            
            Towards the end of this period, stars from the outside world began to make their appearance. Madame
                    Abla-movicz's program of March 16-18, 1852, included the now-unfamiliar titles of Rory O' More, Lass O' Gowrie, and Vale of
                    Avoca. Among the other stars who appeared were Miss Greenfield, known as the "Black
                    Swan"; Ole Bull with Maurice Strakosch as pianist and Adelina Patti, ten years of age, who
                    sang Comin' Thru' the Rye; and Madame Anna Bishop, the wife of
                    the composer of Home Sweet Home.14
                Musical taste was only in
                    the making, and such songs as Hell on the 
                            Wabash
                        
                and Leather Breeches were as popular then as is a Cole
                    Porter record of today; but the seeds of genuine musical culture had been planted.
            The second half of the century was to build upon these early foundations and to go on to greater
                    achievements. One of the minor but interesting indications of a desire for good music was a Music
                    Convention which took place in 1856. A committee of seven businessmen engaged George F. Root, then
                    one of the leading musicians of 
                        New York
                    , to come to 
                        Indianapolis
                     for a four-day period of instruction and discussion with a final grand concert. The
                    cost of the course was one dollar for ladies, and two dollars for men, which included books.15 Whatever immediate results were

                    remarkable for its time and place.
            The great popularity of choral unions was another sign of the abundance of talent, and the desire to
                    participate in the rendition of the more important musical compositions. As early as 1851, the
                    Handel and Haydn Society was flourishing with nearly a hundred members largely drawn from church
                    choirs. It was probably founded by Currie and Downie some years earlier. It reached the climax of
                    its career with the performance of The Creation and The Seasons
                    in 1871.16
            
            In 1867, James S. Black, an excellent musician born in 
                        Vermont
                     and educated in 
                        Boston
                    , settled in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and began teaching music and training choruses. He founded the Choral Union in 1870 and
                    has the distinction of having given the first 
                        Indianapolis
                     performance of The Messiah in 1874. The soloists on that occasion
                    were Mrs. H. M. Smith, Flora E. Barry, J. Nelson Varley, and Myron W. Whitney. In 1877 the Choral
                    Union gave Elijah, and The Creation in 1879, and the Harmonic
                    Society produced St. Cecilia's Day in the same year. During
                    Black's absence from the city, the Choral Union was conducted successively by Emil
                    Wulschner, Alexander Ernestinoff, and Henry Beissenherz.17
            
            In the meantime, other organizations similar to the Choral Union but of shorter life, had their hour
                    of glory. R. W. Seager assembled a group of singers, seventy adults and fifty children, in 1870 to
                    produce the oratorio of Esther; while the Harmonic Society founded in 1875, an
                    offshoot of the Choral Union, was directed by W. H. Clarke.18 Professors
                    Pearsall, Wegmann, and Leckner each led a troupe of singers; and in 1874 the first Musical Festival
                    held on June 2, 3 and 4, was organized jointly by the Choral Union and the Philharmonic Society,
                    with the 
                        Boston
                     Quartet assisting.19 The festival was a striking success; but the

                     second, held on May 17, 18, and 19, in 1875 when The Messiah and The Seasons were again given, resulted in considerable
                    financial loss to the guarantors.20 The festivals were allowed to lapse until
                    1886, when a Community Chorus and a Children's chorus, assisted by many of the German
                    singers, participated in the third Music Festival which opened on June 2, under the direction of
                    Carl Barus, then a resident of 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The great Lilli Lehmann was the soloist. Although she received eight hundred dollars,
                    the sum of five thousand dollars was cleared for the building of the Soldiers' Monument.21 Inspired by this success, music lovers of the city organized in January,
                    1889, the May Music Festival Association which was responsible for a series of annual festivals
                    until 1898 with one year's lapse, thus giving ten periods of exceptional programs. In 1890
                    Zelda Seguin-Wallace and Charles Holman Black, son of James S. Black, were the soloists. It was the
                    heyday of great singers, and in the following decade most of them came to the city. Local choruses
                    were on hand and in training for participation in the larger works, but their appearance suddenly
                    ceased. Emphasis was shifted to the star solo performances, and local talent gave place to outside
                        celebrities.22 The 
                        Chicago
                     Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Frederick Stock, and the 
                        New York
                     Symphony under Walter Damrosch, and many distinguished pianists and violinists also
                    were on the programs. At the last festival in 1898 choral works were given in which eight hundred
                    children took part.23
            
            It was a brilliant series of events, and the city owes much to the organizers and guarantors who made
                    the festivals possible. Enjoyment of music was accompanied by social fanfare, publicity campaigns
                    and also, no doubt, by some anxiety on the part of the guarantors, as the finances were always
                    hazardous. The deficit at the last festival was three thousand dollars.24

            Not long after the cessation of the annual May festivals, the role of impresario was taken over by
                    Mrs. On a B. Talbot, who managed star concerts for a number of years. Mrs. Talbot brought to the
                    city the 
                  Chicago, Boston, New York
               , and 
                        Pittsburgh
                     Symphony orchestras, the Kneisel Quartet, the Heermann Quartet, and many outstanding
                        soloists.25 Since Mrs. Talbot's departure from the city, the star
                    concerts have been carried on by Mrs. Maartens and Gladys Alwes.
            The German singing societies from the first had an organization and occupied a position somewhat
                    different from the other choral unions. Many of the men who came to the states following the
                    Revolution of 1848 were good singers, some of them well-trained musicians, familiar with classic
                    traditions. Wherever half a dozen Germans found themselves together, there was a
                    Maennerchor—male chorus—established as a matter of course. These small
                    societies struggled at first, as all amateur organizations must struggle with financial difficulties
                    and primitive conditions, but by the last quarter of the century, they had adopted a self-supporting
                    system asking for no guarantees outside of their own membership.
            The set-up of the German societies was practically the same all over the country. Good singers (at
                    first only men) formed the heart and core of the society; whatever else was added was secondary and
                    relatively unimportant, though many of the groups expanded until they embraced athletic contests,
                    mixed choruses and school facilities. Besides the active singers, the membership included associates
                    who were assessed yearly dues and in return were entitled to free admission to the concerts and,
                    when opportunity offered, to the use of the club quarters. In the very early years tickets for the
                    concerts were sold, but the custom was soon abolished. Their entertainments became a membership or
                    invitation privilege, independent of the box office. Each concert was followed by a dance and
                    supper. Four or five concerts a season was the rule, with New Year and Easter balls, Christmas
                    festivities, and summer picnics. Until the World War the conducting and singing were in German,
                        
                  
                     25 Some of the outstanding soloists were Alice Nielsen, Melba, Calve,
                            Schumann-Heink, Gadski, Busoni, and Paderewski. Dunn,

                     with well-paid, professional directors. Frequently an outside
                    soloist was engaged, but the pride of the club was in its own male chorus, or less important, its
                    mixed chorus. While the singers were mostly German or of German descent, the associate membership
                    included hundreds from every section of the city. The number of these societies, in Indiana and in
                    the neighboring states, was so large that annual three-day Saengerfests were held in
                            
                  Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Columbus
               , and other cities, when the various clubs
                    competed for the laurel wreath. Today the Saengerfests are seldom celebrated, and the singing, at
                    least in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , is in English.
            Eight German singing societies have existed in the city: the Maennerchor founded in 1854; the
                    Concordia, 1862; the Lyra, 1870; the Liederkranz; Harmonie; Frohsinn; Druid Maennerchor; and the
                    Musikverein, organized as a part of the German House in 1897.26

                        Indianapolis
                     Maennerchor, founded when the city had a population of about nine thousand, is among
                    the earliest male singing societies in the country. It was started by seven men,27 who had been in America only a few months, in the candle-lighted room of Eduard Longerich,
                    and they sang to the accompaniment of a guitar. In 1858 Longerich, and presumably his guitar, went
                    back to 
                        Germany
                    , and A. Despa then directed the group with the help of a flute and a melodeon. Adolph
                    Schellschmidt soon came to their assistance with his violin. The name "

                    and dance was given on May 28, 1855, in 
                        Washington
                     Hall at the northeast corner of 
                        Washington
                     and 
                        Alabama
                     streets. The following year the society sent twelve singers to take part in a Saenger
                    fest at 
                        Cincinnati
                    . In 1859 a Schiller Festival was staged. From the proceeds of this festival the society
                    bought a new melodeon for fifty-seven dollars. Garibaldi was honored with a special concert in 1861.
                    The society purchased a new Knabe piano in 1865 for four hundred and fifty dollars and gave a

                    Ladies Club was organized on October 17, 1897.28 In the meantime, the Saenger
                    fest had been held in the city, with Carl Barus of 
                        Cincinnati
                     conducting.
            During the Civil War, the Maennerchor continued to exist, although many of its members served in the
                    army. Two years after the end of the war, it brought to the city the North American Saengerbund
                    Festival, in which thirty-six choruses, with a thousand singers, participated. For this occasion the
                    city council appropriated fifteen hundred dollars towards the building of a special hall. This
                    amount was supplemented by contributions from the members amounting to eight hundred dollars, and
                    six hundred and thirty dollars raised by concerts which were given. The festival was a success,
                    showing a surplus of twenty-four hundred dollars, which sum was divided among the welfare agencies
                    of the city. In 1878 the Maennerchor rented and renovated the old City Hall at 337 
                        East Washington
                     Street, where it remained for twenty-nine years.29
            
            For its high musical standards the Maennerchor deserves praise. For its programs it drew from the
                    rich resources of German Lieder and the compositions of the masters. Max Leckner,
                    director from 1873 to 1880, and Alexander Ernest in off, from 1880 to 1882 and 1896 to 1897, raised
                    the singing well out of the amateur grade. With the coming of Carl Barus in 1882, its performances
                    took on not only added excellence, but they were widened in scope and popularity. Since Barus had
                    had wide experience as an opera director, and the Maennerchor had the singers, the result was
                    obvious. They undertook light operas and operettas, Martha, Stradella, and The Beggar Student, with such success that invitations came from neighboring towns
                    for a repetition. The society gave Haydn's The Creation in 1883 for the
                    benefit of the 
                        Ohio
                     flood sufferers, clearing the sum of $389. Each season their programs
                    offered compositions from Beethoven, Wagner, Mendelssohn, Schubert, and Schumann, interspersed with
                    shorter lovely lyrical selections for the male chorus.30

                        Maenner-chor.31
            
            The Lyra had a much longer life. It began in 1870 as a zither club with a double quartet, which in
                    time developed into a mixed chorus and orchestra. "The Lyra is an old and well-established
                    musical society of large membership and means, and has a fine hall in the building which has
                    replaced the old 
                        Washington
                     Hall, opposite the Masonic Hall. It is rather a rival of the Maennerchor."32 The orchestra of the Lyra was organized by Emil Wulschner.33 Under the direction of Alexander Ernest in off, the society gave some of the Gilbert and
                    Sullivan operas with success and assisted in the preparation for the May festivals.31
            
            There was a consolidation in 1897-1898 of several of the local German activities into a club called
                    the German House, with a fine building on 
                        East Michigan
                     Street. Alexander Ernest in off was installed as director of the musical section,
                    called the Musikvere in, consisting of a sixty-piece orchestra, a male and a mixed chorus.35
            
            No account of the German singing societies would be complete without special mention of the two
                    leading directors, Carl Barus and Alexander Ernest in off, whose combined services covered a period
                    of more than forty years. Both men were scholarly musicians with a heartfelt devotion to their art.

                     under Hans Richter and Adolph Hesse. The Revolution of 1848
                    drove him out of Europe. He came to 
                        Michigan
                     and later settled in 
                        Cincinnati
                    , where he was head of the German Theater, organist at St. Patrick's Church and
                    Temple Jeschurun, and also principal of the Music School in 
                        Wesleyan
                     College. The Cincinnati Maennerchor and other choral organizations came under his
                    baton, and for several years he was director of the Saengerfests of the North American Saengerbund.
                    He took over the leadership of the Indianapolis Maennerchor in 1882, and he was one of the most
                    important local figures in the May festivals. He conducted the ceremonies when Tomlinson Hall was
                        dedicated,36 and at the benefit for the Soldiers' Monument in 1886,
                    when General Sherman was a guest of the city. In 1896 he retired from active life.37
            
            Alexander Ernest in off was born in 
                        St. Petersburg
                    , 
                        Russia
                    , on January 14, 1853. At the age of sixteen he was an accomplished singer and pianist
                    and was conducting an orchestra. Among his teachers was the celebrated Anton Rubinstein. In America,
                    Ernest in off first settled in 
                        St. Louis
                    , where he conducted what is said to have been the first performance of Rienzi in this country. He came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     as director of the Maennerchor in 1880, and he was prominent in some of the May
                    festivals. From 1883 to 1888 he led the Lyra singers and orchestra, and by 1890 he had established
                    another orchestra and had produced several operas. The Amphion Club, which he organized and
                    directed, lasted only a few years, but the younger musicians whom he had been training were spread
                    throughout the city in other groups. In 1898 he became director of the German House orchestra and
                    Musikverein, which provided fine concerts and operas. In October, 1922, a benefit concert was given
                    for him by loyal pupils and friends, preceding a proposed journey to 
                        California

                    city have left their mark.38
            
            The first musical organization for women is said to have been the Rossini Club of
                            
                  Portland, Maine
               ; the second, the Matinee Musicale of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The enterprise dates from October 29, 1877, when a few women gathered at the home of
                    Mrs. A. G. Cox "for the purpose of mutual assistance in perfecting themselves …
                    in the history of music." At the third meeting the attendance had increased to twelve, and
                    the ladies decided to study the fifteenth century. Mrs. Fred W. Baggs and Mrs. Cox read aloud from
                        A General History of Music from the Earliest Times, and the secretary recorded
                    that "the listeners soon became almost bewildered" in trying to imagine the effect
                    of madrigals, motets, and masses as produced in that age. The bewilderment must have increased when,
                    at the same meeting, the members took a hasty look at 
                        Palestrina
                    , 
                        Giovanni
                    , 
                        Morenzio
                    , 
                        Adrian
                    , and 
                        Henry Isaacs
                    , not forgetting to mention that pedals were invented in the fourteenth century.39
            
            From that very human and ambitious beginning has grown one of the city's most beneficient
                    institutions. The members soon organized, elected officers, adopted their name, and appointed a
                    committee to lay out a program of study.40 The meetings, at first held in
                    private homes, soon moved to the Denison Hotel, from there to 
                        Plymouth
                     Church, and then in 1891 into their own quarters in the newly built Propylaeum. A
                    constitution adopted in 1879 has since been revised to incorporate the wider purposes of the club.
            While the first object, the study of the history of music, has not been neglected, yet, as the club
                    increased in numbers, the emphasis in the programs has shifted from the

                     annals of the past to the rendition of interesting music of any
                    age, including the present. Informal recitals by talented members soon took the place of readings
                    from history. So successful was this procedure that by the early 1890's the membership of
                    the club was divided into active and associate groups, the active members presenting the programs.
                    Then came the formation of choral classes. Student members were welcomed, men were admitted as
                    associate members, and a musical library was started.
            In its years of honorable achievement, the club has sponsored many worthy causes, talent has been
                    uncovered, an appreciative and discriminating audience has been created, and young artists have been
                    given the inestimable opportunity of testing their quality before a friendly, intelligent public.
            The city's first pipe organ, built in 
                  Springfield, Massachusetts
               ,
                    was installed in the First Baptist Church in 1863. In 1876 Horatio W. Clark began the manufacture of
                    organs, supplying the Roberts Park and 
                        Plymouth
                     churches, and in a few years the pipe organ was a regular feature of the choir loft.41 Nearly all the good singers starred in one church or another, besides
                    belonging to some one of the various choral unions. The names of most of the teachers and orchestral
                    directors, as well as the singers, are associated with the church choirs, whose performances
                    attained a high degree of excellence.
            During the early years of this period, the Beecher choir seems, to have set the standard, and its
                    popularity continued. At the First Baptist Church, William C. Smock became
                    "chorister" in 1870, and was prominent in the musical life of the city for
                    twenty-five years or more. The earliest anthems were taken from the Carmina-Sacra, The
                        Shawn, or Jubilate. Denominational hymnbooks came into use about 1876,
                    one of the best being The Chorus Choir compiled by Eben Tourjee. Three such books
                    were compiled by Smock for his own choir.42
            
            In the Fourth Presbyterian Church, J. K. Sharpe, a tenor, was choir leader, and John L. Ketcham sang
                    bass. E. C. Mayhew, boot and shoe merchant, led the Second Presbyterian choir, and Dr. D. L. Wood

                     Meridian Street Methodist Church, followed by Charles W. Stagg,
                    first shorthand reporter in the city and secretary to Governor Oliver P. Morton.
            One of the oddities of history lies in the fact that the trustees of Roberts Chapel (which stood on
                    the site of the present Lemcke Building and was the forerunner of the Roberts Park Church), passed a
                    set of resolutions forever barring instrumental or "choir music" from its services
                    and calling upon their successors to continue the prohibition. It was not until 1870 that the
                    Quarterly Conference gave its consent to the introduction of this important element in its church
                    ceremonies. The first director of music was W. L. Heiskell, but the organ was not installed until
                    1876, and Heiskell made use of a tuning fork—an article now treasured in the church
                    office. An elaborate musical entertainment was given in the church in June, 1875, with George
                    Springsteen as leader, and numbers on the program ranged from a quartet number entitled Come Holy Spirit to excerpts from Martha and a song by Pinsuti called I
                        Love Thine Eyes. The accompaniment was supplied by an orchestra consisting of
                    first and second violin, viola, bass, flute, clarinet, and cornet. There was also on the program an
                    overture by Auber called Die Stumme von Portici played by Professor Schellschmidt
                    and little Alfred. Presumably, the proceeds of this entertainment were to be used for the purchase
                    of an organ. A contract was at once given to William H. Clark and Company for an instrument costing
                    $10,500, to be delivered and ready for use by May, 1876. At the dedication of the organ
                    in June, 1876, the pastor Reverend J. W. Bayliss, sat in the balcony the better to judge the effect.
                    In May, 1879, the choir members contributed five hundred dollars towards the final payment for the
                    organ. In the meantime, the church officers had granted the use of the church and organ to the
                    members of the Harmonic Society for rehearsals, provided the members of the Roberts Park Choir were
                    admitted free of charge.
            This interesting organization flourished, and in 1897 the Roberts Park Choral Society was formally
                    organized with a constitution and by-laws, with Emil Wulschner as director and Mrs. Jennie Suffriens
                    as organist.43
            
            
               
                  43 Upon the death of Wulschner in 1900, the task of director went into the
                        hands of George Eckert, who was succeeded by Edward Taylor
            
            
            At the Central Christian Church, Ora Pearson was the leader for some years, with Mrs. John C. New and
                    Mrs. John R. Wilson among the singers. There was only one woman among the choir directors, Mrs.
                    Jeffrey Christian, at 
                        Plymouth
                    . Vested choirs were introduced into the Episcopal churches fairly early, but in other
                    Protestant "denominations the first appearance of the vested choir was under Franz
                    Bellinger at the Tabernacle when J. Cumming Smith was the pastor.
            In the Second Presbyterian Church, to whose choir Beecher had devoted much attention, volunteer
                    choruses and paid quartets alternated. The first organ in the old building was pumped by hand and
                    stood in the rear of the church, and the same arrangement was made when the present church was
                        erected.44
            
            The struggle to obtain systematic instruction in music in the public schools of the nation was fought
                    out in the East, notably in 
                        Boston
                     in the 1820's and was no longer an experiment open to suspicion when the idea
                    was adopted in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Nevertheless, the event marked an important step in the local development of the art.
                    George B. Loomis inaugurated the movement in 1866. Loomis' Progressive Music
                        Lessons were used not only in Indiana, but also in many neighboring states. The scheme of
                    the books was to lead the pupil step by step through the scales and at the same time develop the
                    sense of rhythm. The exercises were simple, with careful instructions for the help of the
                        teacher.45 Loomis was followed by Henry M. Butler and a Mrs. Wilkinson.
                    Toward the end of the century, the aim of the teaching began to shift from technique and the
                    alphabet of music to the enjoyment of music itself—the idea being that children could
                    learn to love it by making it themselves.
            At about the same time that music was making its way into the curriculum of the public school system,
                    professional schools began to appear. The first of these was 
                  in 1904. In 1911 Hugh McGibney became the leader, remaining at the post for twenty years.
                            McGibney was followed by Jane Johnson Burroughs, Dale Young, Lucille Pritchard, and Frank M.
                            Watkins, the present director. The first members of the Roberts Park Choral Society were
                            Mrs. Fred W. Baggs, the first president of the Matinee Musicale, and Grace Danforth, later
                            Mrs. Frank Levering, a pupil of James S. Black. Belle Krettron, Music for 121 Years,

                     established in 1890 by Clarence Forsythe, who opened the 
                        Indianapolis
                     School of Music on the Circle, later moving to the Surrey Apartments on Meridian
                        Street.46 Later this school was merged with another group to form the 
                        Indianapolis
                     College of Fine Arts. In 1895 came the Metropolitan School of Music.47
            
            The Indiana State Music Teachers' Association, made up of both private and public school
                    teachers, was organized in 1877, one year after the National Association came into existence. It was
                    modeled after the parent organization and had for its purpose the encouragement of the study of
                    music and the establishment of higher standards. At one time the membership numbered as many as
                    three hundred, and undoubtedly the society did much towards arousing favorable public interest at a
                    time when such interest was valuable. The association continued to exist until some time in the
                        twenties.48
            
            Instrumental music was not lacking in 
                        Indianapolis
                     even in the very early days, and many good players were trained in the small orchestral
                    groups which took part in the oratorio renditions and in the early festivals. When the Handel and
                    Haydn Society gave The Creation in 1851, with William H. Currie as organist and
                    probably as director, there was an orchestra consisting of the following pieces: two violins, three
                    guitars, one double bass viol, one cello, two flutes, and one saxe horn.49
            
            In 1862 the Philharmonic Society, which included both singers and instrumentalists, was under the
                    leadership of Max Leckner. In 1871 Bernard Vogt conducted an orchestra made up entirely of German
                        players.50 This group gave a benefit for the 
                        Chicago
                     fire sufferers and netted six hundred dollars. It continued to give concerts in 
                        Washington
                     Hall on Sunday afternoons. One of its visiting artists was the then-famous tenor
                    Tagliapetro, who received six hundred dollars for his performance. The Handel and Haydn oratorios,

                     50 Among the players were Adolph Schellschmidt, Henry Beis-senherz,
                            and Emil Zumpfe.
               
                     given by the Choral Union in the 1870's, were
                    accompanied by a local orchestra. In 1878 Ora Pearson was leading his own group of
                        instrumentalists.51
            
            At the English Opera House good music was provided during the intermission by a small group of
                    experienced players led by Hermann Arndt. The numerous opera performances by local talent naturally
                    depended much upon competent orchestral assistance. During the period of the May festivals in the
                    1890's, the home players were naturally rather hard put to it in holding their own, with
                    the great orchestras from 
                        Chicago
                     and the East coming to the city each season. It was not until the present century that
                    a full, modern orchestra was able to exist in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The humble brass band is a colorful addition to the musical resources of any city. It was in great
                    favor in the last century as it is today, not only for parades, but with boys as players as a means
                    of keeping a lively youth out of mischief while giving him a good time.
            The earlier bands, mentioned in a previous section, were dissolved or reformed at the outbreak of the
                    Civil War, when each regiment had its own contingent of players. Near the end of the war the
                    Dodsworth Band was merged into the National Guards Band under the leadership of John Philips, and it
                    became the City Band of 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The latter took part in the ceremonies when the body of Lincoln lay in state in the
                    city Capitol.52
            
            An experiment in boys' bands, partly for the sake of business and partly for morale, was
                    made about 1875 by Joseph Cameron of the When Clothing Store and sponsored by John T. Brush, a
                    former resident of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .53 The band was outfitted and supported by the When Clothing
                    Company, which had branch stores in neighboring towns to which the band made excursions for
                    advertising special Saturday sales in 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The rural shoppers came, did their errands, and thus were lured into the When Clothing
                    Store because they had to get their return tickets punched.

                             actress before her marriage. He moved to 
                                New York
                            , where he became the owner of the

                                    York, Cincinnati

                     Street from which the band gave Saturday night concerts during
                    the summer. The uniforms consisted of gay orange-colored coats with gold braid, white trousers,
                    patent leather leggings, and tall black hats with white plumes. The name WHEN was emblazoned on the
                    front of the hats. Henry D. Beissenherz was the first director and led the players in concerts at
                    state fairs, charity entertainments, picnics, Masonic conventions, weekly programs in the park (paid
                    for by the city), and Sunday concerts in 
                        Tomlinson
                     Hall. Among the members of the band was Herbert L. Clark, who at the age of nineteen,
                    received as a prize a gold baby cornet from Henry Distant, a visiting Englishman. Afterwards Clark
                    joined Sousa's Band, and later in 
                        California
                     he became the director of the Long Beach Band. Ernest Clark, brother of Herbert and
                    also a When-Band player, became the trombone soloist for Walter Damrosch. Ed Timmons, flutist, later
                    played with the 
                  Boston, Minneapolis
               , and 
                        New York
                     Symphony orchestras, and with the 
                        Chicago
                     Civic Opera Company. Bromar Kryl founded a band under his own name.54
            
            Obviously, marked improvements had occurred in the 
                        Indianapolis
                     world of music during the second half of the last century. These advances can best be
                    appreciated perhaps by noting the following developments: a spectacular rise of choral societies,
                    instrumental groups banded together in miniature orchestras, the founding of German singing
                    societies, the founding of the Matinee Musicale, well-schooled musicians came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to live, theater orchestras and opera companies appeared, music study was introduced
                    into the public schools, conservatories were established, music shops were opened, a factory for
                    making pipe organs had a temporary existence, pipe organs were installed in churches, first
                    renditions of The Messiah and other major works were made, and a series of May
                    festivals were held. It is evident from this survey that 
                        Indianapolis
                     music was emerging from its amateur status. Whether consciously or not, yet definitely,
                    came a widespread desire to acquire stricter and more professional methods, as well as to bring
                    music performances to a higher level.
            
               
                  54 Other members of the Kryl Band were W. A. Sweet man, Frank Carlin, Sam
                        Cool, Leslie Peck, W. Pink Hall, and Ed. Clark. The Clark boys were sons of the organist at the 
                            Plymouth
                         Church during the pastorate of the Reverend Oscar McCulloch.

            Humanizing A Court1
            
            JAMES A. COLLINS
            
            There began an agitation for a change in the method of handling juvenile offenders in 1900. John C.
                    Ruckelshaus was elected Prosecuting Attorney of the 
                        Marion County
                     Judicial Circuit, and upon taking office he appointed me his deputy in charge of the
                    Police Court. While serving in that capacity, I acquired a comprehensive knowledge of that class of
                    our citizenship that makes up the daily toll of police duty. This experience became of tremendous
                    value in my later years as a judicial officer.
            At the city election in 1901, George W. Stubbs was elected Judge of the Police Court. He had not been
                    in office very long when he expressed amazement at the growing number of boys and girls being
                    arrested for criminal offenses. The arrest of such boys and girls and sending them to the police
                    station and locking them up in the city prison was abhorent to his sense of justice. His first
                    effort to bring about a change in those conditions, was to secure the co-operation of George A.
                    Taffe, Superintendent of Police, and Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter in preventing the arrest of such
                    children and their detention in the city prison. With the assistance of these officials, a plan was
                    worked out under which boys and girls under sixteen years of age were taken to their home, and their
                    parents instructed to have them in Police Court on Friday afternoon at 2:00 o'clock, as
                    Judge Stubbs had set apart that afternoon for the trial of such cases. While this plan was only an
                    experiment, it was the means of attracting public attention to a needy and growing problem in the
                    large cities of the country.
            These Friday afternoon sessions were held in the Judge's chambers, and the punishment often
                    meted out, in aggravated cases, was whipping which took place in the basement of the station house
                    administered by the father in the presence of the arresting officer. "Squeals from the
                    basement" became frequent headlines in our local papers. The Judge's chambers soon
                    became inadequate for such hearings, and to remedy that situation the Board of Public Safety fitted
                    up an unused room on the third floor of the station house 
                  
                     1 This is part of an address delivered at the noon luncheon of the
                            Rotary Club of 
                                Indianapolis
                             on February 27, 1945.
               
                     and this embryo "Juvenile Court" held its
                    sessions there until the "Juvenile Court Law" was enacted at the legislative
                    session of 1903.
            While 
                        Chicago
                     is entitled to the credit of pioneering the Juvenile Court movement under the direction
                    of Richard S. Tuttle, Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court, to Indiana belongs the credit of
                    having established in this country the first separate court for the trial of juvenile offenders.
            The enactment of this legislation was largely due to the leadership of the late John H. Holliday and
                    a committee of citizens composed of Hugh T. Hanna, Thomas C. Day, Martin M. Hugg, Senator Charles N.
                    Thompson, Mrs. Julia Goodheart, the Reverend Allen B. Phillput, Father Gavisk, Judge Henry Clay
                    Allen, Judge Freemont Alford, and the author.
            On petition many of the best citizens of this city, Governor Durbin appointed Judge Stubbs as Judge
                    of the newly created court, who served until his tragic death in 1911. In its article on
                    Childrens' Courts, the Encyclopedia Britannica made this reference to the 
                        Marion County
                     Juvenile Court: "The Court in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , however, gained the reputation of being the most complete and perfect Court in the 
                        United States
                    ."2
            
            In the city election of 1909, I was elected Judge of the City Court, the name of the court having
                    been changed from Police Court to the "City Court of the City of 
                        Indianapolis
                    " at the legislative session of that year. In addition this act did away with
                    the single morning session by providing for all day sessions of the court. I had made the race for
                    the judgeship on a platform that, if elected, I would establish a system of probation in that court.
            Many persons are confused by the terms "Probation" and "Parole."
                    These are not synonomous terms. "Probation" relates to the offender who is
                    released by the court under the supervision of a probation officer, and "Parole"
                    relates to the person released from a penal institution at the expiration of his minimum term, or
                    when the action of paroling is exercised by the chief executive. In either instance, they are placed
                    under the supervision of a parole officer attached to the institution from. which they are released.
            
               
                  2 Arthur G. F. Griffiths, "Children's Courts,"
                            Encyclopedia Britannica (11th ed., 1910), VI, 140.
            
            
            The probation system of the city court contemplated the following in dealing with misdemeanants: (a)
                    payment of money fine on installments, (b) suspending sentence or withholding judgment as to first
                    offenders, (c) restitution instead of fines and costs in making good where there was injury to the
                    person or property, (d) drunkenness and the pledge system, (e) separate trials for women and girls.
            This was a new departure in the administration of justice. The old method not only in 
                        Indianapolis
                     but in the large cities of the country, required the offender at the time of his
                    conviction to pay his fine or have some person become replevin bail, or be committed to the jail or
                    workhouse. This hard and fast rule of the law was always a source of great hardship to the poor. To
                    me it seemed unreasonable to expect a common laborer arrested late at night and convicted in the
                    morning to be able to settle with the state. Such persons, convicted under those circumstances, were
                    sent to the jail or workhouse not because the court had given them a term of imprisonment, but
                    because they were poor, smacking of the old "Marshallsea Prison" of
                    Dickens' day and so graphically described in his story of "Little
                    Dorritt."
            If any of you could have witnessed the scenes that I have of women and children crowding the
                    corridors of the court, pleading with attaches of the court to say a word to the judge in behalf of
                    a husband and father, you would have felt as I did that this system should be abolished, and some
                    more humane method evolved to relieve that deplorable situation.
            During my term of four years, those released under this new plan paid into the court
                    $34,014 without a scratch of a pen for security. Of the 3,832 persons to whom were given
                    this opportunity, only 143 said "Good Morning" and "Good Night."
                    Occasionally, I would find one of those absentees on the prisoner's bench even though he
                    was there, as the old colored woman said: "under a consumed name." This system
                    worked to the benefit of the individual in several ways-it saved his job-it relieved his family of
                    the humiliation and disgrace incident to imprisonment-but more than all, it saved his self-respect.
                    It is my opinion, this proved to be one of the most helpful reforms ever  instituted in this type of court and is now general throughout the
                    country. I am sure, you would be interested to know how this plan had its beginning. It came about
                    in this way: At twelve o'clock noon I was sworn in and held my first session at two
                    o'clock. A group of ten young colored men were before me charged with indulging in that
                    "national" sport known as "African Golf," but technically under
                    the law Gaming. As I looked at them over the bench 1 could not help feeling that Solomon in all his
                    glory was not arrayed like one of these-"shirts" that the 
                        New York
                     Central might easily have appropriated in illustrating their four track route and
                    "socks" so loud you could have heard them the length of Indiana Avenue.
            The first nine were promptly disposed of by assessing fines of five dollars and costs, which meant
                    pay, stay, or lay it out. The tenth one stood there trembling in his shoes. I said, "Are
                    you married or single?" He said "Yes, sir." I asked him "What
                    does your family consist of?" He said, "Washin' and
                    ironin'." I then said, "You don't look like a crap shooter to
                    me, and I am going to treat you differently from these others." "You will receive
                    the same fine and costs, but will be given an opportunity to pay the same on installments."
                    He was released on his own recognizance and turned over to Sergeant Gaddis, a probation officer,
                    with instruction to pay his fine and costs on a weekly basis. The next day at luncheon Howard
                    Stanton, a well-known member of the Bar met me and said, "Judge, you had our janitor before
                    you yesterday. He is the best man we ever had in our building. He is a conscientious worker, and his
                    wife is a hard working woman and takes in washings and ironings, besides doing her own household
                    duties, and with their joint savings, they are supporting a boy and girl in a high school in 
                        Louisville
                     where they are receiving special training for social work among the Negroes of the
                    South. If it is not too late, I would be pleased if you could show him some consideration."
                    I said, "Howard, send him to me, and I will suspend the fine and costs, and they may send
                    it to the boy and girl in 
                        Louisville
                    ."
            That first offenders should be saved from imprisonment either in the jail of workhouse became a
                    cardinal principle of this new system. This rule was laid down in the establishment of probation
                    upon the theory that if a boy  was worth saving the place to
                    save him was in the courtroom, and not after he had served a term in a penal institution. This
                    system was not perfect, and it took great patience to deal with such offenders, but those who did
                    appreciate what the court was trying to do for them were in the majority and made good.
            More than thirty years have passed since leaving that court and I often meet grown men holding good
                    positions who laughingly remind me of being prisoners before me in the city court, and how kindly
                    treatment gave them an entirely new outlook on life. Charles L. Chute, head of the National
                    Probation Association, while on a visit here, told me that the records of this court showed a
                    smaller percentage of failures than any similar court in the 
                        United States
                    .
            Restitution was another departure from the old method of handling that class of offenders charged
                    with offenses growing out of personal injuries or property damages. Instead of being convicted at
                    the time of the trial, they were placed on probation, and when it was reported that full and
                    complete restitution had been made, for the injury or damages, the court would withhold judgment
                    during good behavior. To illustrate: A group of seven or eight boys smashed the windows in a vacant
                    house doing fifty or sixty dollars worth or damage; the property was owned by a widow who could
                    hardly afford to meet such a loss. Released on their own recognizance to their parents, these boys
                    paid into the probation department every dollar of the damage done. Restitution so made ran into
                    thousands of dollars.
            The accidental and occasional drunk was never incarcerated. In those cases where they had church
                    affiliations, I would send them to their pastor with instructions that if they would take the pledge
                    for six months, I would suspend the fine and costs. This they did, and with the cooperation of the
                    clergy, more than fifty per cent made good. The chronic drunk presented a serious problem. There was
                    little to work on, but I was astonished at the number that were helped through the kindly assistance
                    of friends and relatives. One of the most helpful men who ever lived in this city was the late
                    William Wheeler, founder of the Wheeler Rescue Mission. He was able to help the friendless  and homeless through his mission and made a record of practical
                    Christianity seldom equaled in this or any other city.
            One of the most interesting cases was that of Pearl. …. … …,a
                    whiskey and morphine fiend, whom I got rather tired of trying to help. It just seemed that she had
                    reached that stage where she was beyond any help and the court was powerless to change her fixed
                    habits. I sentenced her to the correctional department of the Woman's Prison to serve
                    thirty days and pay a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. About two weeks after she had been
                    committed to the institution, Mrs. Hopkins, our probation officer, in charge of women, came to me
                    and informed me that she had just received a letter from Pearl's mother, who was the widow
                    of a physician and resided in 
                  Richmond, Virginia
               . She said Pearl was a graduate trained
                    nurse and had been the wife of a physician, but that they had been separated for a number of years.
                    She could not say that this separation was responsible for her downfall, but it, at least, was a
                    contributing influence and pleaded for her release. Mrs. Hopkins replied to this letter telling the
                    mother all that we had done for her daughter but without any success. Later on she received an
                    answer to that letter, in which was enclosed a draft for one hundred and twenty-five dollars,
                    pleading with Mrs. Hopkins to secure her release and to use the money to pay for her treatment at
                    the Keeley Institute, then located at 
                        Plainfield
                    , Indiana. Mrs. Hopkins laid this letter before me, and I told her that I would release
                    Pearl upon two conditions. First, that she would take the Keeley cure, and second, that when
                    released from the Keeley Institute she would go back to her mother in 
                  Richmond, Virginia
               . Pearl agreed to this, and upon completion of the course of
                    treatment, returned to her home in 
                        Richmond
                    . We did not hear from her until a year later. One morning Mrs. Hopkins came to me
                    holding a letter in her hand, and said, "Judge, I have just received a letter from Pearl,
                    and please let me read it to you." She read the letter. In it Pearl, told of going home,
                    and after re-establishing herself among friends and relatives, she went out to a tract of land lying
                    between the James River and 
                        Virginia
                     Penitentiary, known as "Penitentiary Bottoms," and peopled by poor
                    blacks and whites. There she opened a mission, and  was doing a
                    similar work to the Rescue Mission in 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            Then, there was a traveling salesman who had spent a whole day trying to reduce our liquor supply.
                    The police caught up with him in the early evening and sent him in. When he appeared before the
                    court he had a pretty good hangover. He was well-dressed and had all the appearance of a good
                    businessman. I asked him where he lived and he told me 
                        St. Louis
                     was his home, and he traveled for a prominent shoe firm. I accepted his plea of guilty,
                    but continued the case for a couple of days committing him to the county jail, so that he would get
                    rid of the hangover. When he was brought back to the court on the date set for the disposal of the
                    case, I informed him that on his plea of guilty the fine and costs would be eleven dollars. He said,
                    "Judge, that is all I have on me, and it will pay my fare back to 
                        St. Louis
                    ." I then told him to place the money with Sergeant Gaddis, and if he promised
                    me that he would go straight home, I would suspend the fine and costs. To this he agreed. I then
                    instructed the Sergeant to take him to the Union Station, place him on the train and give the ticket
                    to the conductor.
            About ten or twelve years later a man came to the Criminal Court where I was then presiding,
                    introduced himself, and he told me of the incident of his arrest and how the money that would have
                    paid his fine and costs bought his ticket to 
                        St. Louis
                    . He then told me that upon his return home he became converted, and he was now the
                    Superintendent of the Industrial Division of a large and successful rescue mission in 
                        Brooklyn
                    . I chatted with him for almost an hour and learned of the great work being done in 
                        Brooklyn
                     by this agency in the uplift "of the down-and-outer," and closed his
                    visit by saying: "Judge, that beats getting a hangover."
            On another occasion I had a Negro boy charged with grand larceny, specifically, stealing three gold
                    rings, with diamond settings. Just as the arresting officer introduced the rings in evidence, the
                    proceedings were interrupted by the Clerk of Detectives, who held a telegram in his hand, which had
                    been sent to the detective department by Major Peyton, Superintendent of the Reformatory at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     and read: "If the State has a good case against Dan Barrett, hold him, and I
                    will send for him." When I examined the  rings I could
                    not tell whether they came from Kresge's or Woolworth's, but when a young lady of
                    dusky hue took the stand to establish their ownership and value, I was almost convinced that they
                    must have come from Tiffany in 
                        New York
                    . I asked him how long he had been on parole, and he replied about nine months. I then
                    asked him how long he had served in the Reformatory, and he replied, "five years."
                    I said, "five years, what crime did you commit?" Then he told me his story. He was
                    a bell boy in the Wescott Hotel at 
                        Richmond
                    , Indiana, and one morning a traveling salesman complained that someone had stolen
                    twenty-five dollars from his room. The bell boy was suspected, and the money was found on him. He
                    was promptly convicted in the Circuit Court and sentenced to one to fourteen years in the
                    reformatory. He became very efficient in his work and as no one was interested in him he was held
                    for five years, although entitled to parole at the end of his minimum sentence. So I said,
                    "You have served five years for stealing twenty-five dollars, which is more time than
                    anyone ever served at 
                        Fort Leavenworth
                     for wrecking a national bank." Then I asked, in a general way, if there was
                    anyone in the court room who knew the defendant. A gentleman came forward in response to my question
                    whom I recognized as Adjutant General Ward of our state militia. He said, "Yes, I know Dan,
                    and our acquaintance began under these circumstances. During the Spanish-American War our regiment,
                    the 161st, Indiana Volunteers, was on its way to 
                        Cuba
                    , and we were held up for several hours at 
                  Atlanta, Georgia
               , and while we were
                    waiting for orders to move, one of our regimental officers picked up this young man for a mess boy,
                    and he remained with us until the regiment was disbanded. We took an interest in him and found him
                    employment but I never learned that he was in the reformatory until I heard that telegram read this
                    morning. If I had, I would have gone to Governor Durbin, who was the Colonel of our regiment and
                    made an appeal for his release. During the time he was attached to our regiment he was honest,
                    conscientious and upright, and it is for that reason I am here today to say a word in his
                    behalf." I proceeded with the evidence which disclosed that he was rooming at the home of
                    the prosecuting witness whose testimony showed that she had taken her rings off in the bathroom and
                    carelessly left them there, where Dan found them, and putting 
                    them in his pocket went on to his work. In the meantime, the girl missed her rings, and reported the
                    alleged theft to the police. After hearing his story and the interesting statement of General Ward,
                    I decided to probation him to the general and withheld judgment until employment could be secured.
                    Then I instructed the Clerk of Detectives to wire Major Peyton that the evidence was insufficient to
                    hold him as a parole violator. A year later he came to the court to ask my permission if he might go
                    to 
                        Chicago
                     where friends had secured him a position with the Pullman Company. As he had been fully
                    discharged from his parole, I told him he was at liberty to go there, or to any other place where
                    employment could be obtained. As the tears rolled down his face in gratitude for the help given him,
                    I am sure that you would have had the same feeling of satisfaction that I had, that he had been
                    saved from being made a victim of the reformatory.
            Another reform established while I was judge of the city court was a separate session for the trial
                    of women. It seemed to me unfair to see women wedged in between drunks, thieves and murderers on the
                    prisoner's bench; that whatever their offenses were, they should be tried separately and
                    apart from the male offenders. So the court work was arranged and Wednesday afternoon was set apart
                    for the trial of all cases involving women defendants. The results justified the change. Out of it
                    grew an amusing incident. One of our local papers quoted an excerpt from the 
                  
                            Boston
                         Post in which it said: "Judge Collins of 
                        Indianapolis
                     has established ‘Ladies’ Day' in the City
                    Court." From that time until the close of my term, no colored female was brought in the
                    court that she did not request that her case be postponed until "Ladies'
                    Day."
            One morning Sergeant Jessie Streit came to me and told me that he had just slated a young woman under
                    circumstances that were peculiar, and he asked me to question her, and, if possible, try to find out
                    where she was from, and to have the court matron get in touch with her parents. He told me that in
                    making his rounds, the keeper of a house of prostitution in the west end, had called him into the
                    house, where she had been detaining a girl. The girl had come to the house and asked if she could
                    become an inmate, that she was from out-of-town and had no friends or relatives. She  brought the girl into the room, and she was questioned, but she gave
                    such evasive answers that no headway could be made with her. Then the Sergeant told her she would
                    have to go with him, and he took her to the police matron, where she was being held. I told the
                    Sergeant to bring the girl into court and I would interrogate her. She appeared to be about eighteen
                    or nineteen years of age, well-dressed, and of a good appearance. I asked her where her home was,
                    and she said, "Peru." I asked her what her father did, and she replied, that he
                    was an "engineer." Her answers to other questions convinced me that she was not
                    telling the truth. I then called Mrs. Hopkins, our court matron, and directed her to place the girl
                    in the Faith Home and to hold her there until the Wednesday session of the women's court.
                    The following morning the court bailiff brought a man to the judge's room saying that he
                    was from out-of-town and would like to talk with me. I asked him what I could do for him, and taking
                    a copy of the Star out of his pocket, he pointed to a paragraph in the column
                    called "City Briefs" which said, "Unusually attractive girl brought into
                    City Court is held for investigation." Then he said, "Mother and I read that item
                    and somehow we believe it is our daughter. She has been living here, but we have not heard from her
                    for several weeks." I looked at him and thought there was something in his features that
                    favored the girl. I sent for the court matron and told her to take the man out to the Faith Home,
                    and if it was his daughter, they were to release her to him as no charge had been filed against her.
                    Later, Mrs. Hopkins told me that the girl threw her arms around her father, and they both cried like
                    babies. Then she learned that the father was a substantial farmer, and that they lived about two
                    counties southeast of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , that he had a large farm and splendid home, and there was no occasion for her going
                    through the experience that was told to him. She concluded by saying that it was the old story of
                    the lure of the city to a country girl. Parks and entertainment seemed so attractive that it looked
                    as though life in the "big" city was one grand, sweet song.
            She had been unfortunate in her employment and lost several jobs, and when out of work she was
                    ashamed to tell her people of her predicament, that she had no means to tide her over until she
                    could get employment, and in a fit of dis-couragment, after walking the streets for three nights
                    with  no place to lay her head she was confronted with the urge
                    to commit suicide or the alternative of going to the house where she was found and there to sell her
                    body and soul.
            Thirty years ago the city of 
                        Indianapolis
                     had a population of approximately three hundred thousand, including a Negro population
                    of fifty thousand. During World War I large groups of Negroes were attracted to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to meet the demands for labor in the large industrial plants. At the close of the war
                    many of those who came as temporary residents decided to make 
                        Indianapolis
                     their permanent home, increasing the Negro population by a large percentage.
            Early in the 1920's, I realized that in order to do effective work among the growing colored
                    population, probation should be extended to cover them and be under the supervision of one of their
                    own race. The problem of appointing competent persons as probation officers was solved at the
                    legislative session of 1927 of the General Assembly, which enacted a law granting to the judges of
                    circuit, criminal, municipal, and city courts in cities of the second class, the power to appoint
                    probation officers, defining their duties and fixing the salaries of such appointees.3 At first blush it looked as though the legislature had made provision for a lot of new
                    jobs for the political "faithful," but those who thought that "politics
                    is politics" met with a rude awakening. The socially-minded men and women interested in the
                    enactment of this legislation, promptly announced in the public press that all applicants would have
                    to pass examinations to be eligible for appointment. With the approval of the various judges, a
                    committee was formed, composed of Homer Borst of the Community Fund; Howard Jensen, Professor of
                    Sociology, 
                        Butler
                     University (and now at Duke University); Eugene C. Foster, Director of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Foundation; Reverend Lynn A. Tripp, of the Church Federation of 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            The definite purpose of the judges and the committee was to secure the best talent obtainable for
                    these positions. This committee was successful in securing the services of Charles L. Chute of 
                        New York City
                    , Secretary of the National Probation Association in preparing questions for the
                    examinations. The form of examination as prepared by him has become the standard for Indiana.

            Among the applicants taking the first examination under the statute, above referred to, was the
                    Reverend John L. Coleman, who was serving as pastor of a Presbyterian mission in this city. He was a
                    graduate of McCormick Theological Seminary in 
                        Chicago
                    , and with a fine scholastic background had no difficulty in securing a high mark at the
                    examination and was immediately assigned to the Criminal Court. He served in the Criminal Court for
                    a period of three years which covered the last of my term in that court. Coleman made an excellent
                    probation officer. Of the hundreds of cases referred to him, where probation was ordered, he had a
                    minimum of failures. He made a remarkable record. He left such a good impression that the three
                    judges who have succeeded me as judge of the Criminal Court each appointed a high grade man to that
                    place. Before Coleman left the court, he informed me that he was the first full-time colored
                    salaried probation officer to be appointed in the 
                        United States
                    . Within two years after leaving the Criminal Court, he received a call, which he
                    accepted, to serve as pastor of the Lombard Central Presbyterian Church of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , having one of the largest colored congregations in this country.
            In closing my twenty years of service on the bench, the records show that I passed on more than one
                    hundred thousand cases, that in the probation department of the Criminal Court alone, there was
                    collected in money fines and costs seventy-five thousand dollars, restitution was made in the sum of
                    eighty thousand dollars, and that deserted wives and children received more than seventy thousand
                    dollars. The interesting fact about these items just presented is that this was all done without any
                    specific legislation on any of the subjects. Notwithstanding the large volume of business in these
                    courts, through our probation department we were able to assist ten thousand men and women to stand
                    on their feet and get a start toward a new and better life. The inspiration to be of help to men
                    which was the underlying influence was beautifully expressed by the poet Foley in these lines:
                        
                        I don't set up to be a judge of right or wrong in men; I've lost the trail
                            myself and may get lost again; So, when I see a man who looks as though he'd gone
                            astray; I want to shove my hand in his and help him find the way.
                    
                
         
         
         
            Indiana—Hell Bent For Election1
            Some Notes on Hoosier Politics
            Harvey L. Carter
            
            My grandmother Carter was always a good talker and in her old age I was her best listener. She was a
                    native Hoosier, born in 
                        Clinton County
                     in 1840 when the county itself was only ten years old. She could tell some good snake
                    stories, for snakes were plentiful in her childhood when the land was first being brought under
                    cultivation. There were rattlers and red bellies, black snakes, and blue racers, but the most hated
                    of all snakes was the copperhead. This has a connection with politics, because her father, John Dow,
                    was troubled during the Civil War by neighbors who accused him of being a Copperhead, that is, a
                    Southern sympathizer, treacherous to the Union. My grandmother always resented this accusation. Her
                    father was a Democrat, to be sure, but a good Union man. She rather laid it up against President
                    Lincoln in a personal way that he would allow such an injustice. She was Scotch on both sides and
                    knew how to hold a grudge.
            My grandfather, though a Virginian born, was a lifelong Republican from the foundation of that party.
                    But my grandmother was the more intellectual of the two, in fact, 
                  
                     1 There are more suggestive ideas per square inch for historical
                            studies to be found in the writings of Frederick J. Turner than anywhere else. It seems
                            probable that the original impetus for studies of the sort represented by this article
                            derives from him. For some of his reflections on the subject of mapping and analyzing the
                            vote see Frederick J. Turner, The Significance of Sections in American
                            History (

                            by Arthur N. Holcombe, The Political Parties of To-day (

                     she was what was commonly called a strong-minded woman. She was
                    a good Methodist, an ardent temperance worker, a strong advocate of women's
                    rights—but above all she was a loyal Democrat. If there was any inconsistency in these
                    various beliefs, it did not bother her.
            Hugh McCulloch, the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     banker and Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln and Johnson, made an interesting
                    observation concerning Hoosier politics in his Men and Measures of Half a
                        Century.
               2 It was his belief that the Methodists of Indiana supported
                    the Republican party more strongly, in the 1860's and after, than any other church group.
                    He attributed this to the fact that the episcopal form of church government enabled the bishops to
                    impose antislavery views upon the laity. An investigation, however, shows that the Methodists were
                    only a slight Republican factor, much less strong than Quakers, Congregationalists, Episcopalians,
                    or Presbyterians. And certain it is that, although my grandmother always made it a point to provide
                    a visiting bishop or presiding elder with fried chicken and a feather bed, and although she welcomed
                    an opportunity for a good theological discussion, she would have resented it if one had attempted to
                    direct her into the Republican fold.
            Likewise, she was a deadly foe of liquor, although I have heard her admit that the Democratic party
                    was always the jug party. She proposed to fight Demon Rum from the inside of the Democratic party
                    not from the outside. Her ideas were dominant in her family. I do not say that her descendants are
                    all Methodists, or even that they are all good church people, but most of them are. Her temperance
                    influence was stronger, although a good many of her more remote descendants have probably reverted
                    to the Carter type. After all, she had a great deal to overcome in this respect. But in politics,
                    all her children were brought up to be Democrats, and most of her grandchildren and
                    great-grandchildren will be found voting that ticket today.
            In 1920 she was eighty years old and women at last had the vote. She liked to talk about politics
                    that year, and how she might vote this or that way. But the matter was never really open to
                    question. She came back from the polls looking well pleased with herself. As she laid her black silk
                    reticule 
                  
                     2 Hugh McCulloch, Men and Measures of Half a Century (
                                New York
                            , 1888), 75.
               
                     on the table, she clicked her upper plate very audibly, and
                    announced that she had voted the straight Democratic ticket. I don't believe the issues of
                    1920 were much in her mind. I think she felt that at last she had settled an old score. She had
                    evened an ancient grudge against Abe Lincoln.
            Indiana is often taken as the average state and Hoosiers are even considered to be the best
                    candidates for that mythical conception, the average American. Thus, Mark Sullivan, sitting down to
                    compose the first chapter of Our Times in 1925 says almost at once that
                    "the typical American of 1900 had possibly more points of identity with the typical
                    inhabitant of an Indiana community than with most other persons in other backgrounds."3 Apparently, the Lynds in choosing an Indiana city for their famous
                    sociological surveys of the 1920's and 1930's felt that this was still true at
                    those times.
            It is certainly true in the realm of politics. Before the Civil War Indiana displayed a strong
                    two-party tradition. But the Democrats generally had the edge on the Whigs. This was true of the 
                        United States
                     as a nation in those days. Since the Civil War, Indiana has continued her two-party
                    tradition. But the Republicans usually manage to hold a slight preponderance over the Democrats.
                    Again this characterizes our national political behavior, as well as that of Indiana.
            There are 92 counties in Indiana. In the whole period of party warfare between Democrats and
                    Republicans, that is, the twenty-three presidential elections from 1856 to 1944, what has been the
                    voting record of these counties? There are 32 counties that may be classed as Republican, having
                    gone Democratic from 0 to 6 times. There are 28 that are Democratic counties, on the same basis.
                    This leaves 32 doubtful counties of which 15 show a Republican bias, 11 lean toward the Democrats,
                    and 6 are so uncertain as to have gone 12 times for one party and 11 times for the other.
            Summing up the total Hoosier vote for president over the years 1856 to 1944, it will be found that
                    Indiana had an excess of Republican over Democratic vote of 2.4%, having increased from
                    2.1% since 1936. This is a pretty tight political record. Only three other states showed
                    a narrower margin between the parties over this period. They were 
                  West Virginia, California
               , and 
                        Colorado
                    . 
                        New York
                     stood with 
                  
                     3 Mark Sullivan, Our Times, The 
                                    United States
                                , 1900-1925 (6 vols., 
                                New York

                     Indiana with 2.4% Republican excess. No other state
                    had an excess of one party over the other of less than 4%. Third-party votes were
                    disregarded in this computation.
            At the other end of the scale will be found 
                        Vermont
                     with a Republican excess of nearly 40% and 
                        Mississippi
                     with a Democratic excess of almost 57%. It is not surprising that 
                        Mississippi
                     stands last in voter participation or that 
                        Vermont
                     stands about two-thirds of the way down the list. One-party domination does not
                    encourage voters to come out. But Indiana leads the list in voter participation over the period
                    under consideration. Before woman suffrage her voter participation stood at about 225 per thousand
                    of population and since women have voted, it stands at 450 per thousand. This is one respect in
                    which Indiana is not an average state. In fact, the Hoosiers, men and women alike, are hell bent for
                    election and always have been.
            Generally speaking, northern Indiana is the more Republican and southern Indiana is the more
                    Democratic section of the state. But just the same you will find strong Democratic counties in the
                    north and strong Republican counties in the south. You could not walk across the state from 
                        Ohio
                     to 
                        Illinois
                     without getting on doubtful territory politically. On the other hand, there is one, but
                    only one, means of traversing the state from 
                        Kentucky
                     to 
                        Michigan
                     and at the same time remaining on strong Republican soil. This means that the political
                    pattern of Indiana is a very complicated thing. It was formed a long while ago, and it has persisted
                    remarkably well.
            Three counties have never gone Democratic. They are Porter, which borders Lake
                    Michigan; 
                        Wabash
                    , at the most northerly point of the Wabash River; and 
                        Randolph
                    , midway up the 
                        Ohio
                     line. Porter is most regular of all in its Republicanism because it was the only county
                    to survive both 1912 and 1932 with its tradition unbroken. 
                        Randolph
                     and 
                        Wabash
                     could not be carried by the Democrats but went Progressive in 1912. Two other counties, 
                        Steuben
                    , in the northeastern corner and 
                        Warren
                    , a prairie country along the 
                        Illinois
                     line, have a greater Republican excess over Democratic votes, 29.4% and
                    28.4% respectively, than Porter, 
                        Randolph
                    , or 
                        Wabash
                    , but their record for regularity was marred by their going for the New Deal in 1932.
                    LaGrange and 
                        Elkhart
                     went over to the Democrats only in 1932, and 
                        Hamilton
                     and Hendricks  only in 1912. These are the
                    Republican stalwarts, but a round dozen more have gone Democratic only twice in all their history.
            Two counties there are that have never been Republican. Dubois, down in "the pocket of the
                    State," and 
                        Brown
                    , famous for its poor but picturesque hills. Wells, only a few miles south of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , in the northeast, went Republican for the first time in its history in 1944. Until
                    1940 there was another Democratic county with an unsullied record, 
                        Franklin
                    , in the Whitewater Valley in the southeast, but Franklin was carried by Willkie in 1940
                    and by Dewey in 1944. Sullivan refused to accept Al Smith in 1928 but this has been its only lapse.
                    Three others, 
                        Jackson
                    , 
                        Washington
                    , and 
                        Scott
                    , all southern counties, like 
                        Franklin
                    , have defaulted but twice. There are a larger number of moderately strong Democratic
                    counties than there are moderates in the Republican ranks.
            There are also records of instability as well as of stability. Five counties, 
                        Ripley
                    , pulled both ways by stalwarts of opposite persuasion on all sides; Gibson, in
                    "the pocket," always unpredictable from first to last; 
                        Pike
                     and 
                        Daviess
                    , old Southern Whig counties before the Civil War that could never decide whether to
                    become Democratic or Republican after the war; and my native Clinton, centrally located at the
                    meeting place of the tides of migration from the North and South, all have been Republican 12 times
                    and Democratic 11 times. Clinton stood number 46 of the 92 counties, ranked by political intensity
                    in 1944, almost a perfect pivot at dead center over the 88 years.
            The 
                        
                            Franklin
                        
                     (county) Repository for July 5, 1828, contains a report of a committee of
                    Jackson men, who after a mass meeting drew up certain resolutions concerning the presidential
                    candidates of that year, Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams, to be presented to the citizens.
                    Against President Adams the following eleven charges were brought.4
            
            
               He has held many appointive offices but few elective ones.
               He has received half a million dollars in public salaries.
               He will not trust the people.
               He has imbibed the ideas of his father (Federalist) and was educated abroad.
               He said the representative should not hold himself palsied by the will of his constituents.
                            
                     
                        4 I have condensed them to some extent.
                  
               
               
               He slandered Jefferson.
               He is hostile to the West.
               He wants to usurp the power of the Senate.
               He threatened to use force on a sovereign state.
               He sends his clerks out to deceive the people.
               He has ordered our ministers abroad to wear small swords, gold laced coats, and feathered
                        hats.
            
            In favor of their own candidate, General Jackson, they drew up eight laudatory statements.
            
               He is a friend of the people.
               He fought while Adams danced at foreign courts.
               He has never been corrupted by patronage or power.
               He was a poor orphan who has risen from the ranks.
               He is faithful in friendship and just to his enemies.
               He would make a good constitutional President.
               He would scatter the Harpies that feed upon the Treasury.
               He will not profane the temple of Freedom.
            
            To anyone versed in the politics of that period or acquainted with the careers of Jackson or Adams
                    these statements will be extremely interesting, all the more because of various inconsistencies. In
                    connection with this article, however, the report merely serves the purpose of illustrating how the
                    lines of battle were being drawn up between the two parties at this early time, lines which have
                    been maintained with a minimum of change ever since. Jackson carried 
                        Franklin County
                     and the Democrats carried it regularly every four years from that time till 1940.
            In 1841 Andrew Kennedy, a Democrat, was elected to Congress to represent the east central Indiana
                    district containing the counties of 
                  Wayne, Randolph
               , 
                        Henry
                    , 
                  Delaware, Fayette
               , and Union. He boasted that "Whiggery was burnt
                    out" in that district as badly as 
                        Pittsburgh
                     which had recently suffered a disastrous fire. The name stuck. You will still hear this
                    area referred to as "the burnt district," though the number of the district and
                    some of the counties have changed. Not one of these counties has been won more than three times by a
                    Democratic president, but only three Democrats since Kennedy have ever represented the district in
                    Congress. Here exists Republicanism, "rock ribbed and ancient as the sun."
            These instances show the steadfast character of party allegiance. They also show a continuity of
                    political preference from before the Civil War. Of the 32 Republican counties  of Indiana, 21 were steadily Whig before the Civil War, 10 were
                    formerly Democratic, but became Republican in 1856 or 1860 and continued so, and one, 
                        Marion
                    , containing the Hoosier capital, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , was a doubtful county before the Civil War but has become moderately Republican since
                        then.5
            
            Taking the 28 Democratic counties, we find 21 of them have always been Democratic, 6 were Whig
                    counties of southern Indiana that became Democratic in 1856 and one, Cass, was divided prior to the
                    Civil War but has become moderately Democratic since, though operating on a very small margin. Of
                    the 32 doubtful counties, 10 have always been doubtful, 16 were formerly Democratic in their trend
                    and 6 had formerly a Whig bias. To add to the uncertainty of Hoosier politics, there are 10 counties
                    showing an excess of votes for the party opposite to the one to which they are attached.
            It takes a real earthquake to shake a Hoosier loose from his political moorings. Exactly half of
                    Indiana's 92 counties continued their Democratic habits, on the one hand, or their
                    Whig-Republican attachments, on the other, undisturbed or only temporarily molested by the whole
                    slavery controversy culminating in the Civil War. Add in the 9 with whom political uncertainty was
                    an unalterable habit and you have left only 40% of the counties of the state that revised
                    their political preference in response to the greatest political issue ever before the American
                    electorate.
            Bryan's free silver crusade frightened a few of the Democratic counties, especially if they
                    contained county towns with a sizeable business element. But it was a temporary aberration.
                    Republican prosperity in the twenties pulled some of the old Democratic counties out of line but the
                    New Deal saw most of them back in line again. The New Deal apparently cut deeply enough to render
                    several hitherto Republican strongholds rather doubtful. In a few cases it may even have effected a
                    permanent change, particularly in labor strongholds such as 
                        Lake County
                     (Gary and the rest of the Calumet region) and 
                        Vigo County
                     (
                        Terre Haute
                    ). To a lesser extent 
                        Delaware
                    , 
                        Howard
                    , and 
                        Vermillion
                     counties have been affected. This is counterbalanced by heavy losses on the part of
                    conservative Democratic counties, especially Allen (
                        Fort Wayne
                    ) and most of those with a largely rural population, to the Republicans in the 1940
                    election. This was increased 
                  
                     5 See map and chart, pages 386-387 below.
               
                     in 1944, so that it may be that the trend will acquire a
                    permanent character. It is safe to say that some modifications of the Hoosier political pattern are
                    in the making. Only 4 Democratic counties showed an increase of any consequence in their Democratic
                    excess as a result of the elections of 1940 and 1944, whereas 16 Democratic counties showed sizeable
                    losses. On the other hand, 10 Republican counties had their Republican excess notably diminished as
                    a result of these elections, including Lake and 
                        St. Joseph
                     which changed a Republican for a Democratic excess.
            To state the facts as they appear from the political record of past elections is one thing. To
                    explain why the record is thus and not otherwise is another matter. It can be explained but at the
                    risk of becoming statistical in a rather alarming manner.
            There is an anecdote that is told concerning a Democratic rally in 
                        Terre Haute
                     in the 1870's. A barbecue was being planned and the day selected was Friday.
                    But an objection arose from a red-headed member who said, "Gintlemen, I wud just be afther
                    remindin' yez that the great heft av the Dimmycratic party don't ate mate av a
                    Friday." The date was forthwith changed.
            Statistical evidence gives the color of truth to the remark. It will be found that in 1850 immigrants
                    from Europe formed 2.8% of the population of the 32 Republican counties, 5.3%
                    in the 32 doubtful counties, and 7.8% in the 28 Democratic counties. Not only the Irish
                    but the Germans, and they were the more numerous in Indiana, were a decided Democratic factor from
                    the outset and, on the whole, have continued so. Native-born Hoosiers of 1850 are strongest in the
                    Republican group; Ohioans are strongest in the doubtful group and after that in the Republican; the
                    same is true for the Middle States migrants; Southerners on the other hand, are strongest in the
                    Democratic group and weakest in the Republican. New Englanders were too few in Indiana to count for
                    much politically, so that even northern Indiana lacked this strong Republican factor, so manifest in
                    other mid-western states. Democratic counties like 
                  Franklin, Dearborn
               , Allen, Wells, and
                    Knox show a considerable German element in the population. 
                        Dubois County
                    , the strongest Democratic county outside the solid South was 25.35% German
                    in 1850 and shows a Democratic excess of 37.2% over 
                    the Republican vote from 1856 to 1944. This excess was reduced from 42.6% in 1936.
            The religious statistics are equally striking. Roman Catholic churches in 1860 formed 6%
                    of all churches in the Democratic counties and only 2.5% in the Republican group;
                    Lutherans were more numerous in the Democratic group; so were Baptists and Campbellites. On the
                    other hand, Presbyterians and Methodists were slightly more prevalent in the Republican group and
                    Quakers were found to form 7.5% of the churches in the Republican counties while in the
                    Democratic group they formed but .5%. That the Quakers were the spearhead of the
                    antislavery movement round which the Republican party was formed is well known. Quakers were a
                    powerful factor in such Republican counties as 
                        Wayne
                     (
                        Richmond
                    ), 
                        Henry
                    , 
                        Randolph
                    , and 
                        Hamilton
                    . Another faction in the early Republican party was the Know-Nothings or native
                    Americans. They were antiforeigner, especially anti-Catholic, so that it is not remarkable that
                    foreigners generally, and Catholics in particular, affiliated with the Democratic party.
            Other evidence is available to show that industrial centers tended to exert a Republican influence in
                    the days of Republican dominance and prosperity, that the size of farms tended to be somewhat larger
                    in the Republican counties, and that the formerly Democratic counties which became Republican at the
                    time of the Civil War have increased more rapidly in population than any other group.
            The Republican counties show an excess of 11.4% Republican over Democratic vote from 1856
                    to 1940; the Democratic group yields a Democratic excess of 9.6%. The doubtful group has
                    given the Republican 50.3% of its total vote and 49.7% to the Democrats for a
                    Republican excess of .6% over eighty-four years. The Republican percentages were
                    undoubtedly increased slightly by the election of 1944.
            All this adds up to the fact that in an election year Indiana is a mighty doubtful state. True, the
                    Republicans have a slight edge. The Republican counties stand pat with slightly greater regularity
                    than the Democratic counties, and they are a little more intense in their Republicanism than the
                    Democratic counties are in their Democracy. Both parties know that Indiana can be wooed and won. The
                    Democrats, too, know they are handicapped at the start and so they have been a little more ardent in
                    their wooing.
            
            Indiana does not carry enough electoral votes to warrant first place on the ticket very often. The
                    Republicans won and lost with Benjamin Harrison; they won and lost the state as well as the country.
                    Wendell Willkie played up to Indiana as a native son in 1940 and carried the state.
            But the Hoosier woods have yielded a lot of vice-presidential timber. Schuyler Colfax and Charles W.
                    Fairbanks (twice) ran for the Republicans. Thomas A. Hendricks (twice), William G. English, John W.
                    Kern, and Thomas R. Marshall (twice) made the race for the Democrats. Altogether Indiana has had a
                    place on a major party ticket a dozen times.
            The 
                        United States
                     has elected a Republican president 14 times and 9 times has chosen a Democrat since
                    1856. Indiana's record over the same period is 16 times Republican to 7 times Democratic.
                    She has not always picked a winner. Tilden got her vote in 1876, Hughes, in 1916, Willkie, in 1940,
                    and Dewey, in 1944. Nor is there any Indiana county that has invariably been on the winning side.
                    Nevertheless, as a political barometer the Hoosier state is about as good as any.
            In any election year, come hell or high water, the Hoosiers will turn out just about 101%
                    on election day. It is a well-established and time-honored habit. That has been about the only safe
                    bet to make where Indiana is concerned.

            Crime and Crinoline
            BESSIE K. ROBERTS
            
            Knives attached to finger rings were among the devices used to pick pockets in hoop skirts during the
                    crime wave of the 1860's. In its years of growth from frontier fort to modern city, 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , Indiana, saw crime reach an all-time peak during the two post bellum years, 1865 to
                    1867.
            The Civil War was over, but the spirit of adventure was still in the air. Young sports who had
                    mastered poker, cassino, chuck-a-luck, while sitting in on the game by torchlight on the skirmish
                    line, were still just as reckless as upon the eve of battle.
            It was during these years that 
                        Fort Wayne
                     became noted as a gambling town and headquarters for as desperate and skillful a gang
                    of three-card monte men, pickpockets, and confidence men, as could be found in the country. Outside
                    of the members of the gang, nobody knew more about their rise and fall—especially their
                    fall, which was sudden—than the railroad men. The local press also gave enthusiastic
                    support to the final purge.
            
               
                        Fort Wayne
                    , an important railroad town, had become a natural rendezvous for slickers coming from
                    all directions—
                  New York, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, St.
                    Louis
               , 
                        Indianapapolis
                    , 
                        Cleveland
                    , and 
                        Canada
                    . Some of the largest gambling games in the 
                        United States
                     were maintained there. One of the saloons kept its faro game in full blast so that
                    thousands of dollars sometimes changed hands in one night, a lot of money in any man's
                    town!
            Another resort, the keno rooms of Tim McCarthy, billiard champion of Indiana, netted about twenty
                    thousand dollars during the three years of its existence. Many prominent local men were said to be
                    patrons of the place. For keno, the experts say, is not a gambler's game, but one played
                    mostly by amateurs with no chance to win.
            
               
                        Fort Wayne
                     proved to be a paradise for these adventurers. Times were flush, money was plentiful
                    and the spirit of speculation was keen. One notorious gambler, who had paid twenty-five dollars to
                    learn a card trick from Johnny White, an expert sport, in Snake Creek Gap, 
                        Georgia
                    , made 
                        Fort Wayne
                     his headquarters. Years later when he was converted in a great temperance rally at the
                    Princess Rink, he told all,  to the great surprise and
                    consternation of many of his friends and neighbors. The next day, the saloonkeepers—to a
                    man—cut him dead on the street. Much of the information about these lush days of crime in
                    the sixties comes from this ex-gambler's shocking revelations.
            As a gambling center, 
                        Fort Wayne
                     drew its gang, thoroughly organized and numbering about thirty operators, from the
                    ranks of the most expert in the 
                        United States
                    . Ed Ryan, leader of the underworld, and king of confidence men, was tall, blonde, and
                    terrific with the ladies. During the years when he and his gang carried on in this vicinity, they
                    exerted a potent influence in local politics and were feared by politicians. They even gained tacit
                    support from many merchants and businessmen who profited by their lavish patronage.
            If the politicians were indifferent, the press was not. The 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Gazette carried a report on an incident in 
                        Chicago
                     which should have proved a warning to all unwary travelers.
            
                    PICKPOCKETS AT RAILWAY DEPOTS—Besides the hordes of confidence men who swarm at our
                        railway depots on the arrival, f trains from the country, members of the light-fingered gentry
                        can be found who ply their nefarious business with more or less success. No sooner do the
                        passengers alight from the cars than a rush is made by the pickpockets into the midst of the
                        crowd and, while apparently in search of a friend or hurriedly making inquiries, are in reality
                        sounding the depths and contents of people's pockets. Passengers should invariably
                        avoid these busy-looking gentlemen and give them a wide berth. A few evenings ago, Conductor, J.
                        P. Ames arrived with his train at the 
                            Pittsburg
                         and 
                            Fort Wayne
                         depot in 
                            Chicago
                        . The passengers stepped to the platform and in an instant some half-dozen
                        well-dressed young men who had been awaiting the train's advent, "mixed
                        up" with them and elbowed their way here and there, creating great confusion. Ames
                        spotted them at once as pickpockets, and made a jump for the one nearest him, whom he saw thrust
                        his hand into a lady's pocketbook. The thief struggled desperately, and in the
                        encounter cut the conductor's hand very severely with a ring on which is affixed a
                        small sharp spring blade, an instrument used by professional pickpockets with which they slit
                        dresses, coats, etc. so as to gain access to pockets. Ames was so badly injured that he was
                        compelled to let the fellow escape.1
               
                
            In spite of the unfavorable publicity, conditions at railroad depots continued to get no better.
            The gang operated for the most part on the 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and 
                        Chicago
                     Railroad, between 
                        Valparaiso
                     and

                            , Indiana, Gazette, December 12, 1867.
               
                     Lima, and the 
                        Wabash
                     Railroad between 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and Peru. Their headquarters were a saloon near the depot in 
                        Fort Wayne
                    . Secret trap doors made this hide-out a veritable inferno where many a poor victim is
                    said to have been drugged, and robbed of his last penny. The crooks resorted to all sorts of
                    expedients to "raise the wind," from the simple process of picking pockets, up to
                    the most cleverly contrived and skillfully executed confidence games.
            The fall of 1865 netted these operators an especially rich harvest. The State Fair, attended by
                    twenty thousand people was held in 
                        Fort Wayne
                     that year. Many of these visitors fell into the hands of the cunning thieves and were
                    robbed. When a train arrived, several would jump into the cars and begin picking pockets. As fast as
                    they had finished with a man, they would chalk a cross on his coat, so that the
                    "boys" would waste no time on him. He was picked clean. The accomplices would then
                    "skin the leathers"—that is, take the money from the
                    wallets—and throw the empty purses on the roof of a shed at the rear of the
                    robbers' saloon. So successful were they, that at the end of the Fair week, these
                    pocket-books when gathered and buried by the "understrapper," or accomplice, were
                    found to fill a bushel basket. Upon examination, the fellow found sixty dollars overlooked by the
                    crooks, who were not even interested in such small change. For them it had been more than a
                    "Fair" week!2
            
            Now Ed Ryan, according to my informant—the converted gambler—claimed a monopoly
                    in his line. But as in every paradise, the serpent eventually raises its ugly head, Ryan's
                    paradise was no exception. Rival crooks began to muscle in. At one time, the gang leader was
                    considerably put out by the arrival of Dennis Marks, notorious confidence man and city slicker from 
                        Chicago
                    . Marks came with a flock of birds-of-a-feather to feed in the field Ryan claimed as his
                    own. Ryan resorted to a common stratagem to drive his rival vulture from the field. The scarecrow he
                    set up was an accomplice known to the initiated as Hoosier Brown.
            One winter afternoon, the rival gangster was taken for a ride in a sleigh. The pair drove toward the
                    county asylum—or poor farm—and on the way they met with a battered 
                  
                     2 Mason Long, The Life of Mason Long, the Converted
                                Gambler (
                                Fort Wayne
                            , Indiana, 1583), 56-57. The account of the story related here follows the
                            longer narrative of the book.
               
                     old customer carrying a caved-in satchel. An artful old
                    hayseed, chin whiskers and all!
            "Here comes a good bloke!" whispered the 
                        Chicago
                     sharper. "Let's tackle him!"
            They stopped the sleigh and accosted the pedestrian.
            "Hallo stranger, where d'ye come from?"
            "Wall, I cum from down yonder where I jes sold my farm, 'nI kind thought
                    I'd go north of town a few miles and buy me another one, sence I got the cash money right
                    yhere in this yhere satchel to pay fer it."
            Marks' eyes glistened as the fellow tapped his satchel. Since making up with strangers on
                    the road was a good old Hoosier custom, the farmer was invited to jump right in the cutter and ride
                    to town. The three went to a saloon and the drinks were passed. Then Marks attempted to swindle the
                    greenhorn with the old-fashioned lock game. He bet the stranger one thousand three hundred dollars
                    he couldn't unlock it. After appropriate hesitation, the fellow took the bet, and the money
                    was placed in the bartender's hands. The victim then opened the lock with ease, grabbed the
                    two thousand six hundred dollars and started for the door.
            "Stop that bloke, he's got my sugar," shouted the villain, thus foiled.
            Whereupon Hoosier Brown, for as they say in the melodrama, "it was he," drew a
                    revolver, pointed it at the head of the 
                        Chicago
                     thief, and said with appropriate gestures, "That money's mine. I won
                    it and I propose to keep it."
            The native Hoosier sharpers thus found themselves in sole possession of the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     area. In time, however, public sentiment was aroused. For one thing, the railroads
                    passing through 
                        Fort Wayne
                     experienced a heavy falling off in passenger travel. Detectives were employed, but they
                    did no good. The gang was too much for the big 
                        Chicago
                     crooks; how could a small town detective hope to cope with it? The 
                        Fort Wayne
                    
                    Gazette carried the following story: 
                        ROBBERY, PURSUIT OF THE THIEF, GREAT EXCITEMENT. The most exciting event of the winter, at
                            least in the line of accident or adventure, occurred this morning at the depot. The parties
                            to the affair were Mr. Tucker, a citizen of 
                                Whitley County
                            , and Ed Ryan, the notorious blackleg of this city. Mr. Tucker was in the city
                            on business collecting money. He went to the depot this morning to take the early train for 
                                Columbia City
                             and while going into his car, was stopped by some fellows of the baser sort who
                            told him the car he was  about to enter was a
                            ladies' car, and he could not go in. They crowded round him and in the confusion
                            Ryan (so says Mr. Tucker) put his hand over his (Tucker's) shoulder from behind,
                            and quickly jerked from his vest pocket his pocket-book. Mr. Tucker instantly turned, caught
                            Ryan and demanded his money. But the latter broke away and ran for Carey's saloon
                            north of the depot. Tucker followed in hot pursuit, firing at him twice, with a revolver,
                            once as they passed the office of the express company, and again as Ryan neared the door of
                            the saloon, the shot passing through the window and within two inches of Ryan's
                            head. In the saloon, Ryan had a few seconds of rest, during which as reported by a boy
                            subsequently arrested, he took out the money and burned the pocket-book. Meanwhile Tucker
                            passed round to the corner or rear of the saloon and when Ryan chased by policemen and
                            citizens, came out of the back door, took after him again, firing twice as before, one shot
                            cutting a hole through his clothes and the other taking effect in the neck. Ryan fell and
                            while getting up or attempting to do so, his pursurer gained on him and took another deadly
                            aim, but failed to shoot, as the weapon missed fire. By this time policemen interfered so
                            that further shooting was impossible. The ball from the last shot lodged in the neck,
                            checked in its force some by a large button. Ryan was immediately brought down to the
                            lockup, accompanied by Mr. Tucker. The ball was extracted from his neck by Drs. Meyers and
                            Thacker. The excitement at the depot was intense, a strong disposition being manifested to
                            lynch Ryan on the spot. The blacklegs evidently waked up the wrong passenger this time. Mr.
                            Tucker is a plainly dressed man of about fifty-five, a prominent citizen and once sheriff of 
                                Whitley County
                            . He is neither a coward nor a greenhorn. Ryan will be tried tomorrow before a
                            Justice of the Peace. We understand he offers to compromise the case by the payment of
                            $600. The stolen pocket-book contained about $400. We have no room
                            today for comment.3
                  
                    
                
            The rest of the story gathered between six o'clock that night and the morning after, was
                    continued in the next week's issue of the Gazette. Four or five hundred 
                        Pennsylvania
                     shopmen gathered in force. First, they went to Carey's saloon and told Haynes,
                    the saloonkeeper, to move his family and furniture before night as the building was not likely to
                    stand until morning. Haynes was arrested and lodged in jail as an accomplice. The family was
                    removed, and somehow, nobody knew quite how it happened, the building just took fire. Two steamers
                    and a hand engine and a hook and ladder truck went up to be ready for emergencies. But none
                    occurred. The building was allowed to burn down amid the cheers of the populace. In spite of a high
                    wind, the building was the only one destroyed by fire. It is said that other members of the 
                  
                     3
                            
                                Fort Wayne
                            , Indiana, Gazette, February 19, 1867.
               
                     gang were warned by a "committee." At any
                    rate, no thieves were about there that evening. They were as scarce as blackbirds in January,
                    according to the Gazette. It was as safe in that vicinity as a kirkyard, the
                    account continued, and stated further that they certainly caught a Tartar in Mr. Tucker of 
                        Whitley County
                    .4
            
            The hastily organized vigilance committee met at the courthouse that night to see that their powers
                    were rightly used. It was a good thing for the gangster that his cell was well-guarded. The trial of
                    Ryan was so well-attended that the benches broke under the weight of the spectators. Pale and
                    haggard, Ryan spoke in his own defense. Had he ever harmed a citizen of 
                        Fort Wayne
                    ? Had he not given freely to charitable enterprises, supported widows and orphans?
                    Groans and hisses from the crowd greeted his speech. Then the defendant continued in a more
                    practical vein. Besides, he said, the reported theft of three hundred dollars was too small to cause
                    such a fuss. Not fewer than four hundred spectators witnessed the final scenes when the
                    verdict—Guilty!—was received with hearty cheers. Ryan took it rather badly
                    they say. Bail to the tune of five thousand dollars was provided. But when the next day dawned,
                    Ryan's cell was empty. The bird had flown the coop, or rather ridden on horseback, with his
                    spurs going jingle, jangle, jingle, and leaving behind him a trail of broken hearts.5
            
            On August 6, 1867, news reports stated that Ed Ryan, the fugitive, was heartily sick of his residence
                    in 
                        Canada
                    . He was tired of waiting and watching, and he wanted to go home so badly that, rather
                    than remain an exile in the Queen's Dominions, he declared "if convinced the
                    authorities at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     would not give him more than two years' penitentiary service, he would come
                    over and give himself up."6
            
            After several arrests and escapes, Ryan was brought to 
                        Fort Wayne
                    , secured a change of venue and was tried in 
                        Wabash
                    . Tradition states that he served but two of his fourteen

            EARLY CLARKSVILLE
            A little corner of Indiana's history that will bear further study is Clarksville. It was
                    founded before 
                        Marietta
                    , 
                        Ohio
                    , and because of the residence of George Rogers Clark it was quite well known. It
                    belongs to those early communities that formed their own governments such as 
                        Watauga
                    , 
                        Nashville
                    , Transylvania, and Westsylvania. It was, however, soon overshadowed by 
                        Louisville
                     across the 
                        Ohio
                    , and even by neighboring towns on the Indiana shore. It apparently had a continuous
                    organized existence through the years.
            The following selections illustrate some of the early features of its history. In addition the
                    Indiana Room of the Indiana State Library has an interesting manuscript volume, "Minute
                    Book No 1, Board of Trustees, Town of Clarksville, Indiana, 1784-1889." It began with the
                    second meeting of the board in 1784, no record of the first meeting having been kept. The last
                    meeting recorded in this volume was dated October 21, 1889. William H. English, Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio, 1778-1783
                    … (2 vols., 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, l896), II, 833, 836, quotes from another record for Clark's Grant,
                    but the above is for Clarksville.
            Additional study may not yield any startling discoveries or conclusions, for the subject is
                    admittedly small, but it is surprising that Indiana should have neglected this earliest of American
                    settlements in the Old Northwest. It has possibilties as a shrine to the frontier s$oLldiers and
                    settlers and among them was the illustrious figure of George Rogers Clark.
            
                    AN ACT PASSED FOR ESTABLISHING CLARKSVILLE, OCTOBER, 1873.
                    II. And be it further enacted, That a plat of the said one thousand acres of
                        land laid off for a town, shall be returned by the surveyor to the court of the county of
                        Jefferson, to be by the clerk thereof recorded, and thereupon the same shall be, and is hereby
                        vested in William Fleming, John Edwards, John Campbell, Walker Daniel, George Rogers Clark, John
                        Montgomery, Abraham Chaplin, John Bailey, Robert Todd, and William Clark, gentlemen, trustees,
                        to be by them, or any five of them, laid off into lots of half an acre each, with convenient
                        streets and public lots, which shall be and the same is hereby established a town by the name of
                        Clarksville. That  after the said lands shall be laid off
                        into lots and streets, the said trustees, or any five of them, shall proceed to sell the same,
                        or so many as they shall judge expedient, at public auction, for the best price that can be had,
                        the time and place of sale being previously advertised two months at the court-houses of the
                        adjacent counties; the purchasers respectively to hold their said lots, subject to the condition
                        of building on each a dwelling-house twenty feet by eighteen at least, with a brick or stone
                        chimney, to be finished within three years from the day of sale; and the said trustees, or any
                        five of them, are hereby empowered to convey the said lots to the purchasers thereof in fee
                        simple, subject to the condition aforesaid; and the money arising from such sale shall be
                        applied by the said trustees in such manner as they may judge most beneficial for the
                        inhabitants of the said town; that the said trustees, or the major part of them, shall have
                        power from time to time to settle and determine all disputes concerning the bounds of the said
                        lots, and to settle such rules and orders for the regular building thereon as to them shall seem
                        best and most convenient; and in case of the death, removal out of the county, or other legal
                        disability, of any of the said trustees, the remaining trustees shall supply such vacancies by
                        electing others from time to time, who shall be vested with the same powers as those
                        particularly nominated in this act.—The purchasers of the said lots, so soon as they
                        shall have saved the same according to their respective deeds of conveyance, shall have and
                        enjoy all the rights, privileges, and immunities which the freeholders and inhabitants of other
                        towns in this state, not incorporated, hold and enjoy. If the purchaser of any lot shall fail to
                        build thereon within the time before limited, the said trustees, or a major part of them, may
                        thereupon enter into such lot, and may either sell the same again and apply the money towards
                        repairing the streets, or in any other way for the benefit of the said town, or appropriate such
                        lot to the public use of the inhabitants of the said town.1

                    Clarksville, (Indiana), 1788
                    J'ai été de l$aG $aG Carleville. L'on a bien dit la
                        beauté de la jolie ville. Il n'y a $aG présent que sept ou huit
                        maisons ce qui est surprenant. L'air y est plus sec qu'$aG 
                            Louisville
                        . L'on m'a assuré que l'on y est exempt de
                        fièvres. Le situation est agréable et il y a quatre ans que la
                        première maison fut b$aCtie. Les terres y sont délicieuses et m$eCme
                        surprenantes pour la bonté, mais personne n'y vient; je ne saurais en donner
                        d'autre raison si ce n'est que les homes veulent aller o$uG il y a des
                            homes.3
               
                    I went from there to Clarksville (Carlqueville). Much has been said of the beauty of the little
                        town. There are at present only seven or eight houses, which is surprising. The air is drier
                        there than at 
                            Louisville
                        . They assure me they are free from fevers. The situation is fine and it is only
                        four years since the first house was built. The lands there are splendid and even amazing in
                        goodness, but no one goes there. I can give no other reason for this unless it be that men wish
                        to go where there are men.4

                    At the lower end of the falls is the deserted village of Clarks-burgh, in which General Clark
                        himself resides. I had the pleasure of seeing this celebrated warrior, at his lonely cottage
                        seated on Clark's point, This point is situated at the upper end of the village and
                        opposite the lower rapid, commanding a full and delightful view of the falls, particularly the
                            zigzag channel which is only navigated at low water. The General has not
                        taken much pains to improve this commanding and beautiful spot, having only raised a small
                        cabin, but it is capable of being made one of the handsomest seats in the world.5

               Indiana Public Opinion and the World War, 1914-1917. By Cedric C. Cummins.
                    (Volume XXVIII of the Indiana Historical Collections, Indiana Historical Bureau, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana, 1945, pp. xvii, 292. $2.00.)
            Accepting the theses that Indiana is an average state and that the general public was responsible in
                    part for the participation of the 
                        United States
                     in World War I, Professor Cummins undertakes "to trace the changing attitudes
                    of the ‘average’ group, the Indiana citizens, as they traveled the road to
                    war." The monograph, which is exceptionally well documented, includes a bibliography
                    consisting of 119 Hoosier newspapers, 11 
                        Chicago
                     and 
                        Louisville
                     newspapers, some 90 periodicals, and an assortment of books, articles, pamphlets,
                    public documents, and some manuscripts. The author has succeeded admirably in attaining his
                    objective, scholars will not find his conclusions startling, since they tend to substantiate and
                    supplement the published views of specialists in this field. On the other hand, the author discounts
                    one theory which has been advanced in recent years— the imminence of a rupture with Great
                    Britain in 1916. He gives Wilson's foreign policy more praise than it is accorded by some
                    writers, e.g., C. Hartley Grattan, Alice M. Morrissey, and Thomas A. Bailey. Professor Cummins has
                    done an excellent piece of research and he gives promise of becoming one of the best writers among
                    the younger historians.
            The outbreak of hostilities came as a surprise to Hoosiers. Editors contrasted unfavorably the
                    jingoism and "precipitate action of various European chancelories" with
                    Bryan's "grape-fruit diplomacy" and the policy toward Mexico of
                    "watchful waiting." In the ten-day period following the entrance of Great Britain
                    into the struggle, "public opinion … was more pronounced and more united against
                    the Central Powers than it was to be again until the sinking of the Lusitania." There was "unstinted sympathy for 
                        Belgium
                    " but no suggestion of American intervention, it being commonly assumed that
                    the war would be short and result in an Allied victory.
            Propaganda activities of German-Americans, Hungarians, and Irish, along with the entry of 
                        Russia
                     and 
                        Japan
                     on the side of the Allies and the reappearance of old-time  antipathy toward Great Britain, started a short-lived swing in favor of 
                        Germany
                     which reached its apex the third week of August. Gradually, however, public opinion
                    became stabilized in favor of the Allies. The author lists four factors which brought about this
                    situation: attention was focused on Western Europe; German sympathizers proved poor apologists (this
                    point is emphasized repeatedly); the bulk of the foreign news reached the 
                        United States
                     on cables subjected to British censorship; and the justification of German treatment of 
                        Belgium
                     on the basis of military necessity did not square with the belief that the Central
                    Powers had not started the war. By the end of 1914, "not less than two-thirds and not more
                    than three-fourths of the people favored the Allied nations." Only one
                    "Lilliputian step toward war" had been taken—the support which some
                    Hoosiers gave Theodore Roosevelt's criticism of the Administration for failing to enter a
                    strong diplomatic protest against the invasion of 
                        Belgium
                    . Professor Cummins concludes that as long as antagonism toward 
                        Germany
                     rested on humanitarian, rather than patriotic, grounds, "there would be no
                    serious war sentiment in the Midwest."
            The author delineates skillfully the part played by minority groups in influencing the opinion of the
                    "old stock" Hoosiers, who "tended to be Anglo-Saxon, Protestant,
                    nativistic, and positive; they voted a straight ticket and took calomel in man-sized
                    quantities." They might be swayed by sentiment, propaganda, and ideological arguments,
                    "but a direct challenge to their nationalism would be necessary to make them
                    prowar." Indiana churches took divergent positions, only five remaining consistently
                    pacifist, as national origins greatly influenced the others. The Methodists, Presbyterians,
                    Baptists, and Christians took a middle position between the peace churches and the pro-English
                    Episcopalians. Although the ministers ordinarily were "more partisan than the lay
                    members," they worked against whiskey, Sunday movies, dancing, and card playing rather than
                    crusading for a holy war.
            During the early stages there was little difference in the attitudes of the Democratic and Republican
                    politicians, but the war proved a disruptive force for the Progressives and Socialists. The former
                    split into two wings, the nationalists echoing Roosevelt's bellicose strictures, while the
                         internationalists followed Jane Addams. The Socialists
                    likewise had internal difficulties but united on a program of opposition to American preparedness
                    and involvement as a belligerent. It is a "gross misapprehension to assume that merchants
                    and industrialists were seeking war," although they did take the lead in advocating
                    preparedness. Farmers and laborers were less positive in their support of the Allies than were the
                    professional classes. Many newspapers and practically all magazines and books read by Hoosiers
                    "carried a pro-Allied message."
            In the early months of 1915, a movement to place an embargo on the shipment of arms was sponsored by
                    German sympathizers and given at least passive support by the Socialists and the peace groups.
                    Hoosiers in general, however, saw no reason for changing the rules during hostilities, the net
                    results of which would have been an unneutral act favoring the Central Powers and financial loss to
                    manufacturers, retail merchants, laborers and farmers. The controversy served mainly to place
                    hyphenates who advocated the embargo under suspicion of being anti-American. British Orders in
                    Council aroused resentment, but there was a general attitude of tolerance toward illegal commercial
                    practices of all belligerents as long as there was no loss of life. By opposing an embargo and by
                    failing to insist on a reasonable adherence to international law from the traditional American
                    viewpoint, "honest testimonials for peace" could not obscure the fact, however,
                    that "the people of Indiana had helped to lay the foundation for conflict with 
                        Germany
                    ."
            The sinking of the "Lusitania" and the "Arabic" became the most
                    consequential factor in "conditioning America's relation to the European war in
                    1915," deepening humanitarian antipathy toward 
                        Germany
                     and adding a nationalistic antagonism as well. The majority of Indianans favored
                    neither the pugnacious methods urged by Roosevelt nor the concessions advocated by Bryan which led
                    to his resignation from the cabinet. "Despite … jests concerning illimitable
                    note writing, the Administration's handling of the submarine issue reflected the sentiments
                    of the people with singular accuracy."
            In a chapter entitled "Factors for War and Peace," such subjects are discussed as
                    the status of Armenian Christians, the execution of Edith Cavell, sabotage incidents, the floating
                         of foreign war loans in the 
                        United States
                    , and war prosperity. Next the author deals with "Pacifism and
                    Nationalism," being concerned with the activities of David Starr Jordan, May Wright Sewall,
                    William Dudley Foulke, et al., and the influence of such books as Maxim's
                        Defenseless America. In commenting upon the contradictory aspects of prewar
                    opinion, Professor Cummins raises the query as to which type of newspaper was more responsible for
                    final American belligerency—one like the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News, which was pro-Allied but against excessive preparedness and jingoism; or one
                    like the 
                        Chicago
                    
                    Tribune, which "advocated concessions to 
                        Germany
                     but preached universal military training and chauvinism." Quoting from a
                    militaristic sermon delivered by Billy Sunday in the spring of 1916, the author remarks that
                    "at some indiscernible point back along the road public opinion had crossed a
                    watershed."
            As the German note of May 4, 1916, eased the tension resulting from the "Sussex"
                    incident, more attention was now given to British and French irregularities and the depredations of
                    Francisco Villa. The rising spirit of nationalism and the military inadequacies which the Mexican
                    imbroglio demonstrated "added material support to the preparedness movement, which in turn
                    had its effect on the state of mind with which Americans would view the European
                    belligerents." The author classifies Hoosiers into seven groups about the middle of 1916 as
                    regards the "country's exact mission with respect to the great war."
                    Recognizing many shades of opinion between the extremists, he declares that on one point there was
                    essential agreement—"the nation's rights and honor must be
                    upheld." Although the war was more of an issue in the election of 1916 than it had been two
                    years previously, the Republicans carried Indiana by a narrow margin "for reasons of local
                    origin, as was demonstrated by the fact that their state and local candidates ran ahead of those on
                    the Federal ticket."
            The severing of diplomatic relations in February, 1917, as a result of the initiation of unrestricted
                    submarine warfare was soon followed by overt acts resulting in a declaration of war which had the
                    unanimous support of Indiana Congressmen, all but four of whom were Republicans. Thus two and
                    one-half years of uncertainty came to an end. Professor Cummins concludes that the submarine dispute
                    was  the most important of six factors in bringing about the
                    decision. He asserts that Allied propaganda accentuated many of these factors, but that it would not
                    have borne fruit without receptive soil. Unfortunately, except for the thought to the relation of
                    belligerency and American foreign policy. "Their failure was of little consequence in the
                    prosecution of the war, for they agreed well enough on the immediate target. But what was
                    unessential in war might be crucial in making peace."

            With the appearance of this volume a new co-operative economic history is introduced. The series is
                    to contain nine volumes. The period before 1815 will be described in two general volumes, the years
                    from 1815 to 1860 will be treated in a volume devoted to agriculture and another to industry, the
                    period from 1860 to 1897 will also be covered in this manner, while the present century will be
                    described in three general volumes. If the others meet the high standards set by this one, history
                    will be enriched by a significant and thorough treatment of the economic development of the 
                        United States
                    . The absence of a work of this type has been a notable defect of historical literature.
            This volume is first of all a comprehensive account of agricultural developments from the beginning
                    of the Civil War to the end of the century. It also summarizes in the excellent footnote citations
                    and in the final bibliographical chapter the scholarly literature and much of the source material
                    concerning the subject. Occasionally one fails to find an important work included, but that is
                    rarely true. It sets forth conclusions and interpretations at variance with older works particularly
                    in relation to the national land policy.
            After noting that the fundamental basis of the farmers' difficulties on the Last Frontier
                    were the differences of soil, climate, and distance, the author described the rapid settlement which
                    was often influenced by artificial stimulants  supplied by the
                    railroads, states, and land companies. The corporations, railroads, cattle and lumber barons, and
                    land companies were the chief beneficiaries of the land laws according to the author's
                    analysis. His judgments are reflected in a group of quotations. "In its operations the
                    Homestead Act could hardly have defeated the hopes of the enthusiasts of 1840-1860 more completely
                    if the makers had actually drafted it with that purpose uppermost in mind [p. 54]."
                    "It tempted settlers out to the arid stretches where a quarter section was barely enough
                    for the grazing of two or three cattle [p. 57]." "The [railroad] companies were
                    not only given their railroads—they were given a bonus [usually land] to accept them [p.
                    67]." "Some $200,000,000 were paid to Indian tribes to quiet their
                    claims, and then the land was turned over to speculators at less than cost [p. 69]."
            The agricultural reorganization of the South after 1865 with its labor system of tenant farmers and
                    share croppers and its credit system of crop mortgages is also critically examined. "The
                    outright confiscation of large parts of estates created by slave labor, to make farms for freedmen,
                    would in the long run have created more prosperity for the section than the growth of land
                    monopolization that took place instead, and the simultaneous establishment of a system of quasi
                    serfdom that left the toilers without ambition and the landlord with ruined soils and finances [pp.
                    79-80]." The classes of the South where the crop-lien system predominated were
                    "the landlord-merchant-banker-capitalist group, numbering approximately a sixth of the
                    total population and having all the political power; [and] … the bulk of field workers,
                    living from enfeebled hand to empty mouth [p. 99]."
            Even in the North Central states "a remarkable growth in tenancy" occurred which
                    was not checked by the mechanization of the farms. The expansion of prairie agriculture in the Great
                    Plains led to the plowing of the grass lands that should have been reserved for grazing. Both the
                    "little fellow" and the "bonanza farmer" often failed. The
                    livestock frontier was another story of injustice and special privilege, and the cowboy was far less
                    romantic than usually pictured. Problems of the West are discussed in the light of the agrarian
                    revolt and the co-operative movement which are also described sympathetically. Eastern adjustments,
                    the declining position of the farmers in the nation, and his 
                    social life are not overlooked in completing the story.
            Perhaps some views of the author have been overemphasized, but one can scarcely avoid the feeling
                    that he has offered a few judgments that are somewhat extreme in his treatment of the Great Plains
                    and the South. His analysis is skillful and scholarly and the total picture may not be overdrawn.
                    The illustrations and charts are excellent. The binding of the textbook edition is not attractive
                    and is so light in color that it will soil readily and become less attractive. Although much of the
                    volume is not concerned with the Middle West, it presents the background for understanding the
                    agricultural development of this region.

               War, Peace, and Nonresistance. By Guy Franklin Hershberger. (The Herald Press, 
                        Scottdale
                    , 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , 1944, pp. xv, 415. $2.50.)
            The history of nonresistance and the scriptural and doctrinal teachings upon which it is founded form
                    the subject of this volume. Its preparation was undertaken some years ago as a commission from the
                    Peace Problems Committee of the Mennonite Church. Its purposes were to clarify the position of the
                    church from its beginning to the present war and to strengthen the members in maintaining that
                    position as individuals. The author is professor of history and sociology at 
                        Goshen
                     College, a Mennonite college at 
                        Goshen
                    , Indiana.
            The work is significant to the historian as an historical account of the Mennonites'
                    reaction against war from the sixteenth century to the present, and as a resume of other important
                    pacifist attitudes, but more especially as a means of understanding the Mennonites and their unique
                    position in Indiana and in other states and nations.
            Some historical material is included in the first four chapters which give the doctrinal basis of
                    nonresistance. These chapters review "war in history," "peace and war in
                    the Old Testament," "nonresistance in the New Testament," and peace and
                    war and the church. The Mennonites trace their origin to the Anabaptists in 
                        Switzerland
                     in 1525. From here they spread to 
                        Holland
                    , 
                  Germany, France
               , and Russia, often fleeing from persecution. Those most interested in
                    preserving the nonresident way of life came to America, 
                    especially to 
                        Pennsylvania
                    . They had their difficulties, however, during the Revolution and the Civil War. They
                    were less well-prepared for the First World War because they had become scattered into distant
                    communities and had experienced peace for so long that they hoped it might prevail. As a result some
                    of their members gave up their unique position and the public was uninformed as to what to expect.
            The Mennonites have endeavored to do their share in providing relief during and after the wars. In
                    several instances the position of their fellow churchmen in foreign countries had changed and,
                    rather than perish for their faith, they emigrated to the New World. Mennonites more fortunately
                    situated raised large sums of money for their assistance. Many moved from 
                        Canada
                     to Mexico and Paraguay, and others from Russia to 
                        Canada
                    . The large migration was from Russia beginning about 1870. Northern Indiana has become
                    an important center of the church but others are found in 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Kansas
                    .
            Before the outbreak of the present World War, the Mennonites, as was true of other peace churchs,
                    made preparation through periodicals, pamphlets, and books to educate their people to maintain their
                    faith. Consequently, there was less difficulty with the government and less failure on their part
                    than in the preceding war. They will obey the government very carefully and dependably except where
                    the command conflicts with the will of God. War to them is murder and they will not murder. They
                    will support nonwar activities of the government, but not war or those involving violence. They will
                    not participate in labor conflicts. The army, however, put some of them to death during the first
                    World War, largely because they were not understood.
            The work is brought to an end in a series of chapters showing the relation of nonresistance to modern
                    life, modern pacifism, industrial conflict, society, and the need for keeping the faith. Although
                    recognizing its good quality, the historian will be disappointed because there is not more history
                    in the work. It is to be hoped that the author will find time for a history of the Mennonites in
                    this country.

            THE CALEDONIA CHURCH AND CEMETERY
            MRS. EFFA M. DANNER
            
            In a grove beside a little glen on a ridge extending back from the Ohio River is
                    the Caledonia Church. With its large auditorium, Sunday School rooms, study, basement, furnace, and
                    electric lights, it would grace a city, but it is the center of a rural community, several miles
                    from any village, on the boundary between 
                        Jefferson
                     and 
                        Switzerland counties
                    .
            The Caledonia United Presbyterian Church, a Scotch organization, is an old institution dating back to
                    early pioneer days. The first family from 
                        Scotland
                     settled in this neighborhood in 1816: others rapidly followed until there were thirty
                    families in all, directly from 
                        Scotland
                    , composing the first congregation. They were: Welch, Morton, Weir, Culbertson,
                    Witherspoon, Glen, Dalglish, Brown, Scott, Dow, Sterritt, Tait, Anderson, Shaw, Ralston, Crawford,
                    Gray, Jamison, Wilkie, Imire, Irvine, Bell, Storie, Stevenson, Spier, Thompson, Kirkwood, McKeand,
                    Graham, Gunnion. The present congregation is composed principally of the descendants of these
                    families.
            In 1818 a praying society was organized and met in the cabin homes. A log church or
                    "kirk" was built in 1819 or 1820. Across the road in 
                        Jefferson County
                    , a stone church was built in 1827. A third church., made of brick molded and kilned on
                    the premises, was built in 1872, a few feet northwest of the stone building. The present church was
                    erected in 1920-1921, at a cost of twenty-five thousand dollars; it is back over the county line in 
                        Switzerland County
                    . In the history of the congregation, there have been only twelve pastors in 118 years.
                    Now in its 129th year as a congregation, its church building is recognized as one of the most
                    beautiful country churches in the state, an ideal spot for quiet, restful contemplation of the
                    things of the spirit.
            A walk through the near-by cemetery reveals the names of some of the founders of the church: 
                        Mary Culbertson, native of 
                                Argileshire
                            , 
                                Scotland
                            , died 1821, aged 74.
                        William Culbertson, native of 
                                Agileshire
                            , 
                                Scotland
                            , died 1836, aged 74.
                        Agnes Graham, consort of Alex Graham, native of 
                                Edinburgshire
                            , 
                                Scotland
                            , died Sep. 22, 1836, aged 58.
                        
                        Alexander Graham, native of 
                                Scotland
                            , born Mar. 17, 1776; died June 9, 1860, aged 84 yrs. 2 mos. 21 days.
                    
                
            On vine-covered sides of a rather imposing monument are these inscriptions: S. F. Morton died and was
                    buried here July 27, 1856, aged 25. Ann Morton, consort of Andrew, died December 1843, aged 54 (what
                    became of Andrew is left to the imagination). On another side, one reads: "Susan, and all
                    her father's pride, lies buried here." Other inscriptions in the cemetery read:
                        
                        Marrion Robertson, native of County Renfrew in 
                                Scotland
                            , and wife of Robert Spiers, died 1839, age 39.
                        Jane, consort of Hugh Stevenson, native of 
                                Ayrshire
                            , 
                                Scotland
                            , died May 24, 1829, aged 42 yrs, 8 mos.
                        Agnes, wife of Thomas Thompson, native of 
                                West Gaiter
                            , 
                                Scotland
                            , died 1848, aged 43.
                        William Wilkie, native of Queen's Ferry, 
                                Scotland
                            , died Nov. 28, 1831, aged 42.
                        Hellen Morris, native of Leith, 
                                Scotland
                            , wife of William Wilkie, died Dec. 21, 1832, aged 46.
