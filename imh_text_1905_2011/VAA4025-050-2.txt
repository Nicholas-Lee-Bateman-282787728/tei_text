            A Long, Long Pull:
            Cummins Diesel's Early Years
            Richard H. Gemmecke∗
            In 1939, the president of a 
                        Columbus
                    , Indiana, manufacturing concern, in a memorandum addressed to five of his executives,
                    set forth his understanding of the three aims for which his company had striven in its twenty years
                    of existence: first, the building of the most nearly perfect product possible; second, the training
                    of the manpower of the community, not only to be good mechanics, but also to be Godfearing and
                    useful citizens; third, a non-paternal but very earnest interest in the welfare of the workers, with
                    a management so concerned about men that the company would never thrust out upon society its broken
                    and its aged.1 The secondary aims relating to the size to be attained, quality
                    of staff, and line of development to be pursued need not be considered here. His memorandum was
                    submitted to the banker who had done more than anyone else to keep the company alive during its
                    early struggles. The word came back that the sentiments expressed were exactly correct.2
            
            The Cummins Diesel Engine was an outgrowth of the faith which these two men had in one another. One,
                    William G. Irwin, was banker, industrialist, patron of a small university, and associate of the high
                    and mighty within the national councils of the Republican Party, the 
                        United States
                     Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers. The other, Clessie
                    L. Cummins, ingenious

                     mechanic with a grade school education, rose to be a
                    vice-president of the Society of Automotive Engineers, intimate friend of automotive magnates here
                    and in Europe, and inventor of the distinctive features of the leading high-speed diesel engine in
                    America.
            As early as 1908, Clessie Cummins, then twenty years old, began to drive the Irwin automobiles during
                    the seasons when the roads were good. He had an intense interest in anything mechanical, and by 1913
                    had determined to go into the automobile repair business. William Irwin entered into an agreement by
                    which Cummins was to have the use of a part of the garage plus wages of $30.00 per month.
                    He was to keep the family cars in operating condition and to serve as chauffeur whenever asked by
                    any member of the family. He also agreed to keep the elevator and other mechanical devices about the
                    house in order. Clessie was to use the space allotted him in the garage for his repair work. Irwin
                    agreed to buy the necessary tools.3 The auto repair business flourished. By
                    1916, Clessie was making close to $150.00 a week, and had four men working with him.
            With the outbreak of war in Europe, Cummins secured orders for small parts for British munitions,
                    thanks to the willingness of Irwin to write many letters soliciting business.4
                    Then came the day of which 
                        Columbus
                     folk still like to talk. In the fall of 1917, Irwin, his sister, Mrs. Linnie I.
                    Sweeney, and Linnie's family returned from their summer home in 
                        Canada
                     to find the family cars stored in a public garage and Clessie's shop running
                    twenty-four hours a day, manufacturing hubs for American army wagons. The shop was promptly moved
                    out into a larger building and the automobiles were returned to the home garage.5
            
            Entry of the 
                        United States
                     into the war temporarily halted the experimentation with gasoline and oil engines which
                    had engaged much of Cummins' spare time since 1912 or 1913. In the spring of 1918, however,
                    he heard of the Hvid engine.6 This was a four cycle engine, developed in the

                        Netherlands
                     under the name of Brons. It had a cup or small cell adjoining the combustion
                        chamber.7 During the suction stroke of the piston the proper amount of fuel
                    was delivered into the small cup. On the compression stroke, combustion occurred first in the cup
                    and then continued in the main chamber. This engine represented an attempt to eliminate the air
                    injection of fuel found in most diesels of that period. Since the Hvid engine provided a means of
                    using a less expensive fuel than gasoline, Cummins became interested. He learned that the engine
                    could be manufactured under a license plan. The license fee was $2500.00 and the royalty
                    was $5.00 per engine.8
            
            Later in 1918 Cummins' salesmanship won out over Irwin, who agreed to furnish support. The
                    Cummins Engine Company was incorporated in February, 1919, and a license was obtained from the Hvid
                        Company.9 Some twenty of Cummins' friends signed the original stock
                    subscription. By April of 1919 the first Cummins engine was finished. Of a single cylinder, it was
                    rated six horsepower at 600 rpm. Leading diesel authorities in 
                        Germany
                     had held for some time that 600 rpm was the maximum speed at which fuel oil could be
                    injected and burned. Therefore, the Cummins Company was derided at the start of its operations for
                    having built an extreme design.10 Several hundreds of these one cylinder engines
                    were made and sold, some going as far as 
                        India
                     and 
                        Australia
                    . The first model was, within the same year, followed by a 11/2 h.p. and a 3 h.p.
                    design. Both of these smaller engines ran at 900 rpm in defiance of the experts.
            Before the end of 1919, big business seemed assured for Cummins and associates, though they scarcely
                    realized that trouble lay ahead. A contract was signed with Sears, Roebuck and Company by which
                    Cummins would manufacture 4500 engines of the three sizes.11 Since no service
                    was available, the engines had to be sold on Sears' rigid money-back

                     guarantee. Production of engines was stepped up to a peak of
                    fifteen per day. But they were poorly designed and contained some defective parts. Soon engines
                    began to arrive at the freight station. On some days, fifteen new engines were shipped and ten to
                    twelve were returned.12 The company fell far behind in its orders. A Sears
                    representative visited 
                        Columbus
                     in September, 1920, and reported plenty of trouble: piston ring failures, inability to
                    secure parts, and operational breakdowns. By then the company was able to average only slightly
                    better than four engines per day. He wrote: "Mr. Cummins is gradually building up an
                    organization, but I don't believe he realizes the importance of the position he is in as he
                    is holding some 400 of our orders, the oldest of which dates back to the 14th of January and yet
                    this condition does not seem to worry him in the least."13 In spite of
                    improved output and price reductions which practically wiped out the profit, the engines were not
                    successful, and in 1922 the contract was cancelled, after some 3000 of the 4500 units had been
                    delivered to Sears.14 The future appeared to be dark. Several hundred thousand
                    dollars were lost in the three years, and little was left. There were, however, two rays of light to
                    comfort Clessie Cummins. In the first place, the experience was valuable from the standpoint of
                    engineering, management, and production. Cummins later wrote: "We learned a great many of
                    the things that must not be done or could not be done." Further, much had been learned
                    about company organization and managerial policies from the great mail-order firm. When it was
                    finally decided that the engine contract was hopeless, "both parties took the financial
                    beating which naturally had resulted and called the whole deal off, and parted the best of
                        friends."15
            
            A second source of comfort to Cummins was the attitude taken by his principal supporter, Irwin. When
                    Cummins, in 1921 or 1922, went to Irwin and told him that the engine was not a success and that it
                    appeared that all the money invested was lost, Irwin asked if there were no hope of salvaging
                    something from the wreck. Cummins replied that there

                     was nothing but an idea. As Irwin related it afterward,
                    "He tried to explain the idea to me with the result that when he told me that it would cost
                    $10,000 to prove the idea, I told him I would furnish the money. The idea turned out to
                    be an improvement, but it was not good enough; so he got another idea and another $10,000
                    and these ideas and the 10,000s continued for quite a period until he made a discovery for which he
                    was granted basic patent protection."16
            
            As Cummins expressed it several years ago, "All down the line of developments, we were
                    usually able to ‘pull a rabbit out of the hat’ about the time that we were out
                    of money and offer him sufficient encouragement to carry on a little further."17
            
            In 1922, with the cancellation of the Sears contract, Cummins also cancelled the Hvid agreement. It
                    was not until 1926 that a settlement was reached with Hvid, and it cost the Cummins Company
                        $13,200.00.18
            
            A comment is in order as to the method by which the company was kept alive during the trying days of
                    the 1920's. Though personally willing to lend thousands of dollars, Irwin refused to do
                    this in a way which would obligate the stockholders. Therefore he and Cummins, as joint
                    stockholders, organized the Oil Engine Development Company, with a capitalization of but
                    $20,000.00. It was Cummins' hope that $10,000.00 would suffice to pay
                    for the development work. Actually, the Development Company alone absorbed approximately
                    $100,000.00. The Development Company paid the Engine Company in full, with cash, for all
                    labor, material, and overhead expended for the Development Company by the Engine Company. The
                    Development Company licensed the other company to build engines, without a license fee, but for a
                    nominal royalty on each engine. All patents applied for by Clessie Cummins were to be the property
                    of the Development Company. Thus a means was found by which the Irwin money could be poured into the
                    development of the engine and the manufacturing company was able to survive.19

                     Engine Development Company was not absorbed by the Engine
                    Company until 1941.20
            
            After the wreckage had been cleared away, following the Sears, Roebuck debacle, Irwin insisted that
                    Clessie's engine company try to sell no more engines until they were proved commercially
                    practical and sound. Therefore, there was no factory production worthy of the name for at least six
                    years, though engines of great significance in the Cummins story were being developed and were being
                    sold to widely scattered customers. Cummins was convinced by 1922 that better engines could be
                    produced only by increasing speed and horsepower and at the same time decreasing the weight per
                        horsepower.21 Out of some of the parts of the Hvid 6 h.p. engine Cummins
                    built a single cylinder engine in late 1922. He was able to sell an engine to a shrimp packer in 
                        New Orleans
                    ; rather, Clessie Cummins virtually pressured the customer into letting him install the
                    unit on a trawler. After much opposition from the shrimp fishermen, the engine performed well and
                    about half a dozen more engines were sold. Cummins spent about six months in the 
                        Louisiana

                        Mississippi
                     fishing fleets. Finally, the engines began to fly apart, and by the end of 1923 Cummins
                    had to stop and plan a new attack upon the problem of the high-speed diesel.22
            
            This second set-back confirmed Clessie's belief in an idea that he had been nursing for many
                    months: that the critical part of the diesel engine was the fuel injection apparatus. Differences in
                    engine temperatures, in fuel volatility, and in compression caused ignition to occur at a point
                    varying over many degrees of crankshaft rotation. The result of poor timing in the ignition was high
                    pressures which caused broken parts and high cylinder wear. Furthermore, the individual measuring of
                    the fuel to each cylinder was not desirable because of the difficulty of synchronizing perfectly.
                    Cummins and his engineers began to hunt for a method of metering the fuel which would be absolutely
                    fool-proof and would send an equal charge to every cylinder. The second major task which Cummins
                    undertook was to find a means of heating

                     the fuel before injection into each cylinder. Between 1923 and
                    1927 some 3,000 separate injection methods were tried. Engines were being sold during this period,
                    though until 1925 or 1926 every conceivable kind of difficulty was encountered. In 1926, practically
                    all the engines being built were going for marine use: to private owners, to fishing fleets, the
                    Shipping Board, the Lighthouse Service, and the Coast Guard.23
            
            By 1925 it was clear to Irwin that Cummins' business would probably increase. He wrote a
                    friend: "I am trying to plan now for a real plant for economical operation. Clessie
                    approves the location I have chosen for it, but we are both agreed that there will be no moving
                    until we are absolutely crowded out of where we now are. There is not going to be any money put into
                    bricks and mortar until we just cannot get along without putting it in. We may not make quite so
                    much in the beginning by following this plan, but I believe in the end we will be further along and
                    then we will know better what we need."24
            
            In the fall of 1925 the payroll at the plant was running $1400.00 per week, and production
                    averaged two 4-cylinder engines per week.25
            
            That same year, Clessie had another idea. He began talking to Irwin about putting an engine into an
                    automobile, for publicity purposes, and driving the car from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                        New York
                    . He estimated at the time that the fuel cost would not exceed sixty cents. Irwin
                    exulted: "We can have a bit of front page advertising free with that kind of a
                        performance."26
            
            With the very small capacity of the plant, however, and with a few orders coming in every week,
                    Clessie was kept so busy that he could find no time to work on the automotive engine. But a time was
                    soon to come when business declined and the work was taken up.27
            
            In 1927 came what appeared to be a real opportunity.

                     A contract was signed with a large concern manufacturing
                    shovels and earth-moving equipment. Probably 100 4-cylinder engines were sold before it was
                    discovered that the dirt and dust of shovel operations were too much for the engine, which had many
                    of its moving parts outside the engine. The result was the introduction, in 1928, of the
                    world's first completely enclosed diesel. Not a single moving part was exposed. Not a
                    single paft was hand lubricated. This was also the first diesel to be rated at 1000 rpm.
            By 1929 the fuel injection problem was practically solved, but that of metering the fuel took a few
                    years longer. The result of the research was the Cummins system, which is a distributor-type pump
                    very similar in principle to the distrib- utor mechanism in the electrical system of every gasoline
                    automotive engine.28
            
            When the depression struck, in 1929, the company's busi- ness was chiefly in the marine
                    engine field. A large proportion of the engines were going into pleasure boats. The market suddenly
                        disappeared.29 Cummins, Irwin, and their engineers decided to enter the
                    automotive and industrial fields. This necessitated the development of a new engine, lighter in
                    weight and of a higher rpm.
            The greater part of the American public was completely unaware that such a thing as a diesel existed.
                    Clessie was the one who could wake them up. He launched upon what he has called the "Barnum
                    and Bailey days." For about five years Cummins put on a three ring circus of racing,
                    transcon- tinental runs, bus and truck records, and assorted stunts. Ringmaster was Clessie Cummins,
                    though he was ably assisted by certain other genial daredevils. When the circus days ended, the
                    American public was wide awake to the significance of the diesel.
            In November, 1929, Clessie and his chief engineer purchased "a big old Packard limousine
                    sedan" in 
                        Indianapolis
                     and drove it back home. The work of installing the engine began. The men used the model
                    U, the one developed in 1928, which has already been described as the first completely en- closed
                    diesel. It was impossible to put the engine in place

                     without removing the steering gear, or to install the steering
                    gear after the engine was in place. The Cummins crew finally hoisted the car and lowered it over the
                        engine.30 There were only three-eighths of an inch between the engine and
                    the radiator, therefore no fan could be used. The axle gear ratio had to be changed because of the
                    slower diesel speed. Otherwise, the Packard was not changed. Irwin was thoroughly surprised when
                    Clessie drove the car to the Irwin home on Christmas, 1929. He was soon as excited as was
                        Clessie.31 Within a few days, Clessie left for 
                        New York City
                     to attend the Auto Show. This was the famous run in which the fuel cost was
                    $1.38. From 
                        New York
                    , Cummins drove to 
                        Detroit
                     where the annual meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers was held. Here he was
                    invited out to the Ford shops. This was the first of several meetings with Henry Ford and his son
                    Edsel. They must have enjoyed one another's company, for in 1930 Irwin was writing with
                    great delight:"They undoubtedly got very well acquainted. Clessie, among other things, told
                    him that ‘with my money and your brains I think we can get pretty far.’
                        "32
            
            After the first automobile run to 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Detroit
                    , in early 1930, Irwin was sure that Clessie "had something." A
                    competent engineer was brought in to survey the set-up and to make recommendations. As a result,
                    design of a new automotive engine was begun. Meanwhile, the old engine was being put into a Packard
                    roadster chassis. In March, 1930, Cummins and cronies set an official mark of better than 80 miles
                    per hour at Daytona Beach. The old marine engine, built for 800 to 1000 rpm, was pushed as high as
                    1900 rpm, but it held together.33 Fuel for the 2120-mile round trip cost
                        $3.50.34
            
            In February, 1931, the same marine engine—now in a Duesenberg racer—set a mark
                    of better than 100 mph.35 After much discussion, the Speedway officials created
                    a new classification

                    70 mph in the trial runs. The Cummins entry accomplished what no other car had ever done before: it
                    made the 500 miles nonstop, and this at an average speed of better than 86 mph.36 Next test for the engine came in August, when, installed in an Indiana chassis, it went
                    from 
                        New York
                     to 
                        Los Angeles
                     in a total elapsed time of 971/2 hours and at a fuel cost of $11.22.37 This truck trip is the real beginning of interest in diesels as the motive
                    power in the trucking industry.
            In December, 1931, appeared the automotive diesel engine on which development had
                    been in process for about two years. It was immediately placed in an Indiana truck and driven 14,600
                    miles nonstop in exactly two weeks. This new record was also hung up on the Speedway.38
            
            Irwin and Cummins, in the spring of 1932, took the diesel-powered racer to Europe. They demonstrated
                    the car to the diesel experts of 
                  France, Italy, Germany
               , and 
                        England
                    . They drove 5,000 miles at a fuel cost of $8.00.39
            
            An old Mack bus equipped with the new automotive diesel made the coast-to-coast trip in November,
                    1932. The old vehicle grossed approximately eleven tons, but it made the run in 91 hours at a fuel
                    cost of $21.90.40
            
            The dramatic tests of 1930, 1931, and 1932 aroused plenty of interest. Financiers offered assistance
                    in enlarging the capital structure; manufacturers hinted that they were willing to buy out the
                    company. Ford, Studebaker, Hupmobile, and others were clearly excited about the opportunity to use
                    the Cummins diesel or a competitive product.41 By now the Cummins people were
                    convinced that the truck and bus field was wide open for them. And yet, it was one thing to interest
                    the trucking lines and quite another thing to interest the manufacturers of trucks. When the
                    automotive engine was brought out, in 1931, and commercially in 1932, it was impossible

                     to find a single truck manufacturer who would consider using
                    the Cummins product. In 1932, the first truck customer, a grocery chain on the Pacific Coast,
                    managed to persuade a manufacturer to sell a truck minus the engine. A Cummins engine was installed,
                    but the truck manufacturer refused to do the work. When the first diesel truck continued to roll
                    smoothly and efficiently, other trucking firms became interested. They soon learned that the only
                    practical way of getting Cummins engines was to remove worn-out gasoline engines from trucks and
                    replace them with diesels.42 Then, finally, a number of truck manufacturers
                    arranged to install Cummins engines in new trucks.
            The diesel engines in the heavy trucks on the Pacific Coast were so efficient that within a short
                    time the engine company was bustling with activity. Incidentally, the diesel industry was one of the
                    few industries that gained ground during the depression, especially from 1933 on. This is easily
                    explained: diesel power provided an effective means of lowering costs.
            Records of the Cummins Company show that from 1919 to 1937 no profit was made, though the company
                    broke even from 1933 on. From 1919 to 1928 was a period of testing and trial, of experimentation and
                    heavy losses. From 1928 to 1932 was a period of struggle to gain recognition, to establish a
                    business, and to live down the failures of the past. From 1932 the company was concerned with the
                    problems of growth, not all of them pleasant.
            In September, 1933, William Irwin wrote his sister, Linnie. Clessie had been in to see him to get
                    approval for the purchase of more machinery. They had called the bank, and to their surprise had

                    was no longer losing money. Irwin continued: "It has been a long, long pull. During the
                    past ten years, I have had to have constantly in my mind the thought that I would have to provide
                    money for his use at almost any time. If business can continue as it is now, and grow gradually, it
                    seems to me now that we may get through without having to put up more money. This does not mean that
                    we are going to be getting any money out of

                     the business for the reason that the increase in business will
                    demand practically all the profits to take care of the additional requirements, but there will come
                    a time later on when something can be taken out. I don't know that I have ever told you
                    there has already been put into the proposition at least $1,000,000. It is a tremendous
                    amount to have risked and I hope there will never come a time when it will not be
                        appreciated."43
            
            As long as the human values for which William G. Irwin and Clessie L. Cummins stood are reflected in
                    the hearts of those who guide the destinies of this concern, so long will 
                        Columbus
                     appreciate the contributions made in those early years.

            The Fine Arts in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , 1875-1880
            Eva Draegert∗
            During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, America began to make some serious contribution to
                    the art of the world. The greatest artistic achievement of the century was the creation of the
                    modern landscape. In 
                        France
                     the outstanding exponents of nineteenth century art were members of the Barbizon
                    school. Following these were the Impressionists. Both had important effects on American painters,
                    specifically upon the Hoosier artists. The Centennial Exposition of 1876, at 
                        Philadelphia
                    , showed to many Americans for the first time the really great art of the world; and
                    shortly after, the return of American students from the studios of 
                        Paris
                     and Munich added new perspective to artistic thought and expression of this country.
                    Among those students returning from European studios after 1876 were a number of Indianians who made
                    a valuable contribution to the American school of art which was developing at that time.
            The early 1870's found 
                        Indianapolis
                     with no art school, though there were a few individual artists with established
                    studios. Jacob Cox had been the principal painter since 1844, and after 1860 he found enough
                    patronage to enable him to turn from his tinner's trade and devote his time wholly to
                        painting.1 Other artists in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the early seventies were mostly pupils of Cox; one of the most prominent of them was
                    Mrs. Lottie Guffin. Though Cox had painted some landscapes at that time, there was greater demand
                    for portraits.
            There have been several sculptors in Indiana, but 
                        Indianapolis
                     can claim few of them. The earliest sculpture by an Indianapolitan was the statue of
                    Benjamin 
                        Franklin
                     by John Mahoney, erected in 1874 above the front doorway of the 
                        Franklin
                     Insurance Company building in the southeast segment of the Circle.2

            There was more demand for the work of architects by the early seventies than for any other branch of
                    art. Post-Civil War prosperity in 
                        Indianapolis
                     partially expressed itself in the pretentious mansions of wealthy industrialists who
                    followed the precedents set by the period's elaborate public buildings-Mansard roofs,
                    cupolas, high ceilings, and elaborate ornamentation were characteristic of the Victorian homes to be
                    found in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1875. D. A. Bohlen, Joseph Curzon, Isaac Hodgson, and Edwin May were some of the
                    well-known architects with offices in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at the time.3
            
            Joseph Curzon, resident of 
                        Indianapolis
                     since 1851, had designed the Union Railway Station, the first union station in the 
                        United States
                     (1852), the Second Presbyterian Church which still stands at 
                        Vermont
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     streets (1864-1870), and the old Vajen residence (1862) at 
                        New York
                     and 
                        Meridian
                     streets, where the Telephone Building now stands. Francis Costigan, who had died by
                    1865, was the designer of several of the most outstanding public buildings in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , as well as a few large residences. The classical style was typical of these Costigan
                    buildings: Institute for the Blind on North Street, buildings for the deaf and dumb, Hospital for
                    the Insane, and Odd Fellows building. He was said also to have been the architect for the old Bates
                    House.∗ He designed the Lewis Hasselman residence,5 which was wrecked
                    to make way for the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Athletic Club, and very probably the Vinton-Pierce house,6 which
                    was removed to make room for a used car lot at Fourteenth and 
                        Meridian
                     streets. William Tinsley's Gothic-style Christ Church of the early
                    1850's, remains on the Circle, one of the few landmarks to remind the observer of the
                    artistic taste of an earlier day.
            But for a few isolated examples, the architecture of 1875 in 
                        Indianapolis
                     has disappeared. In the short space of seventy-five years, approximately two
                    generations, the face of the city has almost entirely changed. Few now living will remember that
                    young riders raced their ponies madly up and down 
                        Meridian
                     Street when it was not in use as a ball park; that residents of the University Park

                     streets nightly to drive home the family cow for milking; that every family raised its
                    own chickens; that almost every house had a soft water tank under the roof, which was regularly
                    filled by pumping water from the cistern; that front yards, in which reposed iron dogs, deer, and
                    flower urns, were commonly surrounded by iron fences, and back yards, by high board fences; that
                    there were no paved streets as we think of them, and 
                        Meridian
                     Street was often a sea of mud.7
            
            Though writers at the turn of the century and after— Tarkington, Nicholson, and
                    others—wrote nostalgically of the beauty of 
                        Indianapolis
                     in this earlier period, the city taken as a whole was probably not exceedingly
                    beautiful by architectural standards. There was commonly little city planning in this period,
                    individual architects being responsible only for individual buildings, resulting in a
                    "disorderly urban mass." A progressive industrial civilization had no need for
                    art; therefore, one need not expect the factories to be beautiful.8 Values were
                    uncertain, and the quantitative standard governed. Thus, fine architecture was a matter of size and
                    expense, while the common buildings possessed no human standards, becoming cheap, niggardly, and
                    cramped. What architectural style there was indicated a mixture of early baroque with the
                    traditional medieval.9
            
            Art in 
                        Indianapolis
                     had been encouraged and promoted, as already noted, by Jacob Cox, who for years was
                    almost the only artist in the city. Starting business there as a tinsmith, he later found enough
                    demand for his portraits and landscapes that he could devote his entire time to painting. A writer
                    in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News referred to Cox as the "Nestor of painting in Indiana."10 When Cox came to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , only a few homes displayed the commonest of prints. By the seventies, Cox's
                    paintings hung in at least three hundred homes in the Hoosier capital. Many of these pictures
                    portrayed local scenes, for, as Cox said, material at home was as good as could be found anywhere,
                    nature was familiar, and the public more sympathetic.11 Thus was set the trend
                    for art

                     County artists, capitalized on the local scene, though some of the Hoosier Group had to
                    go to Munich to learn this important lesson.
            Dull times which had followed the panic of 1873 affected artists' sales, but Cox continued
                    to paint his landscapes and figure pieces. In 1875 portrait painting was improving, and by 1877, in
                    addition to that of Cox, studios were maintained by ten or twelve professional artists, among them
                    Dewey Bates, John Love, Mrs. Lottie Guffin, and T. C. Steele. But as the oldest of them, Cox was
                    said to be "as much an 
                        Indianapolis
                     institution as the Circle Park," for he had "maintained alone all the
                    repute our city could claim in an esthetic way."12 Though not highly
                    regarded as a teacher, he rendered valuable assistance to William Miller, Joseph 0. Eaton, John
                    Niemeyer, and William M. Chase, the latter in turn assisting Barton S. Hayes.13
                    On the basis of Cox's teaching, his daughter, Julia, was able to enter directly the life
                    class in the 
                        Philadelphia
                     Academy of Design without going through the usual year's preparatory work.
                    During the late seventies he had a valuable co-worker in Mrs. Guffin, who painted many portraits. A 
                        Boston
                     artist declared she had more vigor and masterly control of color than any woman he ever
                    saw—in fact, she painted more like a man.14
            
            Probably the greatest single cultural influence in the country during the seventies was the
                    World's Fair in 
                        Philadelphia
                     in 1876. Arts of the western world were shown in their fullness and perfection as never
                        before,15 and soon after, the people of America began to awaken to a
                    realization of the importance of art to the nation. Many American artists were returning from study
                    abroad, most of them settling in the East. Among these returnees were James F. Gookins and John W.
                        Love.16 In March, 1876, W. M. R. French, art critic for the

                     it was reported that considerable interest was stirred
                    up." In January, 1877, the Fourth Presbyterian Church held an entertainment where
                    stereopticon views of scenes from nature and art were shown.18 A few weeks
                    later, William Parsons, a noted English essayist, gave a lecture at the Masonic Hall on
                    Michelangelo, and it was reported that a "large and intelligent audience" was
                    present and that the lecture was "highly appreciated by all who heard it."19 Early in 1877, the artists of the city formed an art association and placed
                    their own pictures on exhibit. Only a few over twenty pictures were shown, but it was hoped that
                    this small collection would become the "nucleus of what would some day be a splendid annual
                        display."20
            
            On July 12, 1877, the prospectus of the State School of Design was issued by James F. Gookins and
                    John W. Love. It was proposed to establish a joint stock corporation with a capital of
                    $10,000.00, shares to sell at $50.00 each. Tuition for the school was set at
                    $10.00 per month, and courses would be offered in portrait and landscape painting;
                    engraving on wood, stone, and steel; architectural drawing; modeling in clay and wax; and various
                    forms of sculpture. The location of the school would be in Fletcher and Sharpe's block at
                    the southwest corner of 
                        Washington
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     streets.21 There were eleven rooms, well-lighted and well-equipped,
                    and here the first art school opened, October 15, 1877, under what appeared to be the most favorable
                        auspices.22
            
            The initial exhibit of the school was a grand display of art work spanning 2,000 years, including,
                    according to the newspaper account, "European paintings, the Pompeiian bronzes and
                    water-color drawings belonging to the collections of Mr. R. L. McOuat and Mr. Albert
                    Fletcher" of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , as well as some Gookins landscapes which had been saved from the 
                        Chicago
                     fire.23 The attendance was gratifying and the Art School was off to

                     in December another exhibit was held including paintings from 
                        Cincinnati
                     and other neighboring cities, as well as bronzes from 
                        Naples
                    . Pupils of the Indiana School of Art were working hard for the $50.00 prize
                    that had been announced.25 Gookins and Love then announced another prize
                    calculated to spur young artists to greater achievement. Two years' maintenance in Europe
                    would be offered to the pupil in a class of not less than fifteen who made the most progress in one
                    year of study in the Indiana School of Art. Tuition, the public was reminded, would be
                    $100.00 for the year (a saving of $20.00 if paid by the year).26
            
            The second exhibition of the school got under way January, 1878, including the latest and best works
                    of home artists, among them the work of Cox, Steele, Dewey Bates, and A. E. Sinks, together with
                    work of prominent painters from other cities. The bust of Oliver P. Morton by John Mahoney, and
                    crayon work of pupils of the art school were also displayed.27 Judges of the
                    students' work were Dr. W. B. Fletcher, T. C. Steele, and H. Lieber.28
                    Other art exhibits followed at intervals, lending some aspect of permanence to the new art school.
                    At least two characteristics may be observed which emphasize the nature of public regard for art in
                    this period: admission was charged, usually twenty-five cents per person, and the exhibits were
                    always opened with some sort of popular program, usually including refreshments. This entertainment,
                    for such it was intended to be, would be one of popular appeal, including music. 
                        Indianapolis
                     society would turn out in large numbers, in full dress, to see and be seen. Today,
                    small intimate teas or dinners for members of a salon inaugurate a new exhibit, and admission is
                    free during the entire showing; but at that time the art association needed both money and patronage
                    and a bit of fanfare was both appropriate and desirable. Though these affairs became social events,
                    still some basis for taste in art was being built up in the public mind. The entertainment feature
                    thus seemed prominent in the shows of the Art Association; but when such affairs were

                     held by some other group, they were scoffed at. In April, 1877,
                    the Y. M. C. A. opened an art loan exhibition, following a suggestion of the News.
                    But this was said to be no real art exhibition at all, for its stated purpose was to make money to
                    furnish the organization's social club rooms. Thus, the Y. M. C. A. was said to care only
                    for money and to care nothing for art, which should be for all to enjoy, for the benefit of all.29 It would seem, however, that if enough popular regard for art existed that an
                    exhibition could be expected to net enough for the purpose announced, the public taste was to be
                    complimented for its cultural attainment.
            An exhibit was held in April, 1878, one in May, and another in July. In May it was reported that the
                    opening of the exhibition was a "crushing success," for the halls were jammed. The
                    band performed, and it was "an event in the history of the city." About two
                    hundred paintings and numerous sketches and casts were shown, but a critical view of them was
                    impossible due to the crowds. "
                        Indianapolis
                     has never looked upon such a display," wrote a reporter. "Gookins and
                    Love have an art gallery in all the term implies. Not a Vatican, Louvre, or Dresden gallery, but it
                    is kith and kin with them as an assemblage of objects of real art, and judging from last night the
                    people of this city are well aware of it and will avail themselves of it."30
            
            But with all this fine beginning, the school was doomed to financial failure. Public interest was not
                    yet widespread enough to insure sound financial backing for such an enterprise. Gookins resigned
                    first, and Love, no business manager, struggled for a time; but finally Love was forced to give it
                    up in November, 1879. He died shortly after.31
            
            During the period of this first Indiana School of Art, there were other influences operating to
                    increase the taste for art; yet there seemed to be no united, concentrated effort of any group, and
                    so it appeared that Gookins and Love were working more or less alone in their effort to make art a
                    paying profession. In May, 1878, a Professor Waugh exhibited some views of Italian works of art.32 In January, 1879, a

                     Professor Cromwell brought a display of art illustrations to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , and it was reported that the audience was one of the best in point of quality that the
                    city could turn out.33
            
            Enrollment had fallen off, however, and the school was forced to close. Almost at once several
                    interested persons met to devise a plan to create a permanent patronage for artists, and means
                    whereby 
                        Indianapolis
                     children and others might have the advantage of art instruction. It was proposed to
                    organize a corporation to be called the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Academy of Art and Mechanics Institute, and that instruction in all branches of
                    artistic education be free to 
                        Indianapolis
                     pupils, "foreign" students to be charged a certain sum per month. The
                    balance of money needed was to be raised by solicitation. All this was to be done under the law
                    regulating voluntary associations. Rev. S. M. Vernon, J. W. Love, George P. Anderson, Rev. N. A.
                    Hyde, W. A. Ketcham, John A. Finch, L. A. Kiefer, Rev. O. C. McCulloch, and John C. New were chosen
                    to serve as directors until the first meeting of the stockholders.34 Thus was
                    demonstrated a deep and abiding interest in the arts. Love and Gookins had given 
                        Indianapolis
                     a taste of what art activities might mean to the cultural life of the city and it would
                    be only a matter of time until a permanent organization would arise.
            The yeoman service rendered by the H. Lieber store in this field should not be overlooked. Selling
                    artists' supplies as well as pictures themselves, Herman Lieber had a practical as well as
                    an esthetic interest in the art school and also in the welfare of individual artists. It is
                    well-known that Lieber lent a friendly hand to T. C. Steele, perhaps even to the extent of financial
                    assistance to enable him to go to Munich to study art at the Royal Academy.35
                    Lieber had opened a stationery and bookbinding shop in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in 1854, later expanding it into a retail art store with a factory for picture frames
                    and other art necessities. He had chosen to establish this art store in a period when much more
                    practical things were a necessity, and often found it difficult to keep his business going. But he
                    no doubt realized that his encouragement of the young artists and the appreciation of their work

                    other times he would show foreign art works or copies of famous paintings.37
            
            Thus painting began to flourish in 
                        Indianapolis
                     as an art which could be taken up as a profession, and which might be expected to
                    furnish at least a modest living for its devotee. As for sculpture, there were probably no sculptors
                    in 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the seventies except John Mahoney whose bust of Governor Morton was shown at the art
                    exhibition in January, 1878. Though sculptural works were not produced locally, there was no lack of
                    taste for them in the homes of the time. We find the John Rogers groups prominently displayed in
                    most of the better homes. "To Americans of the second half of the nineteenth century one
                    mark of artistic, social, and financial respectability was the possession of one of the small pieces
                    of statuary known as Rogers Groups. These figurines occupied a post of honor in many a parlor,
                    placed on a table, a whatnot, or more frequently, on a pedestal in the bay window."38 These groups were extremely popular, being available also in stereoscopic
                    views, magic lantern slides, albums of photographs, and even amateur performances of
                    "living statues," posed by actors in white make-up and white costumes against a
                    black background.39 John Rogers had made many of his original
                    "copies" of statuary from living models dressed in costumes of the day, and so
                    they have value historically as well as being illustrative of the popular artistic taste.
            Equally popular at the entrances or on the lawns of homes of people of good taste of the period, were
                    cast iron figures of animals and birds. The entrances to the Hasselman house on North 
                        Meridian
                     Street between 
                        Vermont
                     and 
                        New York
                     streets, and the Vinton-Pierce house at Fourteenth and 
                        Meridian
                     streets, were guarded by iron lions. Those at the former residence were a pair, two
                    figures exactly alike, somewhat

                     less than life size.40 Those at the
                    Vinton-Pierce house, the work of Isidore Bonheur, brother of the famous painter of animals, Rosa
                    Bonheur, were perhaps larger, and showed unusually life-like creatures surrounded by young lion
                        cubs.41 One might see a cast iron deer or stork, or perhaps an iron urn for
                    planting flowers, on many front lawns. Still standing are most of the statues in Woodruff Place
                    which were typical of this decade. There were fountains on many lawns, and those constructed by
                    James O. Woodruff may still be seen in the driveways of that community.
            Whether people of the period had a genuine feeling for this form of art, or whether they placed the
                    statuary so as to create the popular impression they wished the community to have concerning them,
                    is a moot point, as it must be in considering the true cultural values demonstrated by the patronage
                    of any form of art. There was no doubt considerable imitation and copying of the prevailing
                    fashions.
            Construction of both public and private buildings was apparently not affected by the panic until
                    1876. In 1874, architects of the city announced that improvements under way or projected for the
                    season totalled $1,500,000.00.42 In 1875 some of the building permits
                    published in the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    News amounted to well over $1,000,000.00. There is no way to estimate
                    the number of dwellings this represents, nor is it likely that this indicates all the permits
                    issued. With prices as low as they were then, this would seem to indicate no curtailment in the
                    building trades and would be some reflection of the prosperity still present in other types of
                    business. Some of the buildings to be erected in 1875 included about seventy-five houses to be built
                    by William H. English on or near English Avenue,43 the Lilly warehouse and
                    factory, the Alvord Brick and Iron Works, the A. E. Fletcher dwelling,44 and the

            In February, 1876, it was stated that prospects for building were not so promising as in the
                    preceding year due to hard times, and that capitalists hesitated to invest in business blocks or
                    costly manufacturing enterprises. Still, plans were announced for the building of at least three
                    churches and three business blocks. Lewis Shively planned the construction of a brick residence on
                    North 
                        Meridian
                    , the design to be Renaissance architecture, two stories high, with a mansard roof.46
            
            In 1876 it was announced that the panic had caused so much financial embarrassment to J. O. Woodruff
                    that he was unable to complete plans for Woodruff Place before that time. Woodruff was no doubt
                    something of a visionary, and the Place was too great a distance from the business district to
                    attract many persons, since transportation was neither swift nor convenient enough to make commuting
                    desirable at that time. Therefore, Woodruff's real estate project languished and it became
                    necessary for him to offer lots for sale at a great sacrifice in order that he might realize
                    something on his investment.47
            
            Building materials of this period were chiefly brick and wood, with somewhat limited use of stone.
                    Iron was sometimes used for the facade of business buildings, but a destructive fire which occurred
                    in 1874 caused some architects and businessmen to question the wisdom of using such material. The
                    Exchange Block on the west side of 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Street between Market and 
                        Ohio
                    , was turned into smoking ruins, probably by an incendiarist. Not completed, but well
                    under way, the building was four stories high, partly of brick, with an iron facade which was
                    supposed to give added support to the wall. As the flames roared up, the iron became red-hot,
                    buckled, and brought down whatever of the wall remained standing. The intense heat remained in the
                    iron work for some time, preventing any immediate examination of the ruins to determine the cause of
                    the fire. Some declared themselves to be disgusted with iron fronts and said future buildings must
                    be entirely of brick or stone which would withstand heat.48 The owners lost
                    heavily from this fire, for the loss was estimated at $255,000.00, only
                    $85,000.00 of which was

                     covered by insurance.49 Yet, a business
                    building on North 
                        Pennsylvania
                     Street, the Bates Block, begun later that year and completed the next, at a cost of
                    $100,000.00, had its entire front constructed of iron "which would not be
                    affected by fire." Evidently there were two diverse schools of thought regarding the
                    advantages of iron used in building construction. Edwin May designed this building in "the
                    French style of architecture"; it was thought to be the introduction of the style into the 
                        United States
                    .50
            
            Public buildings of this period included the Circle House with eighty-six rooms, "elegantly
                    frescoed and furnished with all modern improvements."51 The Grand
                    Hotel, at its opening in 1875 said to be "one of the most magnificent in the
                    country," occupied one-fourth of a block at the corner of 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Illinois
                     streets and was built of brick and Ellettsville stone. It was five stories high with a
                    broad marble stairway and a steam-powered elevator.52 The Denison Hotel at 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania
                     streets was to be completed and open for business October 1, 1879. Constructed in three
                    wings connected by a front facade, it had 135 guest rooms all equipped with water, and all but four
                    equipped with mantels and grates. Other comforts to be found there were steam heat and water
                    closets. The dining room was lighted by ten chandeliers with as many side lights, and under each
                    window was installed a coil for heating purposes.53
            
            The two most prominent public buildings in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , the State House and the Marion County Court House, date back to this decade. The Court
                    House, designed by Isaac Hodgson, who came to 
                        Indianapolis
                     to work on the buildings of the 
                        United States
                     Arsenal, was finished in 1876. Designed in the style of French architecture of the
                    Third Empire, it was done in the grand manner, and was more for show than use. Its red granite
                    columns came from 
                        Scotland
                    , and Italian decorators were brought from the East for finishing the interior. (Lewis
                    Hasselman had brought Italian workmen to 
                        Indianapolis
                     for a similar purpose for the construction of his 
                        Meridian
                     Street house a decade earlier.) The mansard roof, cupolas, high ceilings, and elaborate
                    ornamentation of the Court House established a precedent for many of the pretentious homes of the
                    period. The architect, Hodgson, designed

            The State House, its cornerstone laid in 1880, was built during the next eight years, but plans were
                    made and approved in the seventies. Edwin May's plans were chosen, but he was later
                    replaced by his draftsman, Adolf Scherrer, who executed the plans.55 The
                    opposition to May apparently stemmed from disappointed architects living outside the city, and from
                    those who objected to the building of any sort of new State House, which they felt would be a
                    needless expense.56 The old State House, built at a cost of
                    $60,000.00, had begun its service with the 1835 session of the state legislature. There
                    seems no doubt that there was need for a new State House, if we may believe a contemporary newspaper
                    item. It says that the old State House, when new, was "really rather a handsome and
                    impressive structure, except as to its dome, which was a misfit in style and a mistake in
                    proportion. But the stucco didn't stick, and the Bluff slate in the basement rotted like
                    buckeye chunks in a swamp, and the plaster never would look like stone, and the zinc roof peeled off
                    in a tornado, and the ladder up the dome rotted and broke, and the vault in the house hall fell in,
                    and when the whole affair came down it showed that brick-work was not done more honestly then, nor
                    with better material, than now."57
            
            In spite of petty bickering and indignation sessions of competitors whose plans were not chosen,58 work moved forward. In 1879 a scaled model of the State House, made by H. A.
                    Garvey, complete in every detail except for statuary and bas-relief work, was exhibited at Circle
                    and Market streets, and caused considerable comment. Illuminated at night it created a grand
                        spectacle.59
            
            Private homes were usually somewhat ornamental, the degree depending on the wealth of the owner. Most
                    of the houses were likely to exhibit such features as porches, porticoes, pillars, projections,
                    off-sets, bay windows, and ornamental woodwork.60 The fashion of ebonizing wood
                    was becoming

                     popular and ebony and gold furniture was much in vogue.61
            
            "The perfect house" of the period was that of George D. Emery on North 
                        Delaware
                     Street, designed by R. P. Daggett It was most unusual, and its features seem remarkably
                    modern. Built in Queen Anne style, of Ellettsville stone, pressed brick and red mortar, it was
                    without the usual gingerbread decoration, being all plain and massive with only one piece of carved
                    stone in the whole exterior—the window cap. The interior was finished throughout in solid
                    woods native to Indiana, except for maple from 
                        Connecticut
                    . Each room was finished in a different wood, such as black walnut, cherry, or mahogany,
                    with furniture made to order of the same type of wood. Emery, owner of a lumber yard, had been
                    selecting these choice woods from his stock for a half dozen years. Ceilings displayed oak rafters,
                    and walls were papered with "East Lake" paper. No nails were visible anywhere in
                    the construction. Its completeness was evidenced by such features as electrical communication, a
                    burglar alarm, speaking tubes, large closets, cedar chests, linen presses, store rooms, and bath
                    rooms, while in the cellar was a laundry complete with soapstone tubs and a drying room. House walls
                    were double, making a cushion of air between the inside and outside, giving excellent insulation.
                    Each room possessed a register for the hot air furnace, and a fireplace with andirons. Sliding doors
                    and deadened carpeted floors gave an air of quiet dignity to the whole. Outside the house, asphalt
                    carriage drives led to a complete stable at the rear of the house.62
            
            Both painting and architecture had progressed much in the past twenty-five years. Though Cox was once
                    the only painter in 
                        Indianapolis
                    , several more were kept busy in their studios to supply the steady demand for work from
                    their brushes.63 T. C. Steele, Mrs. Guffin, B. S. Hays, A. E. Sinks, Thomas B.
                    Glessing, and J. W. Love were among those who maintained studios. Architecture also gave employment
                    to many who were able to maintain regular offices. The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Directory for 1875 listed eighteen architects, and in 1876 five new names were added to
                    the list. Prominent among these were D. Bohlen, Joseph Curzon, R. P. Daggett, Isaac Hodgson, and
                    Edwin May.

            "Don't be angry, merely astonished," Clemens Vonnegut frequently
                    exclaimed, when things went wrong.1 This bit of wisdom, which long years of
                    service in the interest of education had no doubt impressed upon him, is well worth bearing in mind
                    while following the course of 
                        German
                     instruction in the public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     from its faint stirrings in the fifties and its legal entrance in 1869 through to its
                    abrupt decline in 1918 and its equally legal exit one year later. Vital years those of more than
                    half a century, in which men both on the 
                        Indianapolis
                     School Board, and off, strove ceaselessly, even in the face of defeat, to bring about
                    the fruition of 
                        German
                     instruction in the 
                        Indianapolis

                    no small part in determining its progress.3
            
            Prior to the opening of the free public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , April 25, 1853,4 there were already

                             in 1851 and who was on the Board of School Commissioners for twenty-seven years
                            from April, 1865, to April, 1869, and again from June, 1871, to June, 1894, when his son 
                                Franklin
                             was elected, is said (according to his nephew Alex Vonnegut) to have made this
                            comment frequently in

                     3 The Täglicher Telegraph was established
                            in 1864. In 1907 it was combined with the Tribune and continued under the
                            name of Telegraph und Tribune until May, 1918.
                  
                     4 At the first meeting of the Trustees of the Common Schools, on
                            Saturday evening, March 18, 1853, it was ordered on motion "that the Ward Schools
                            of the city will be opened Monday, April 25, as free schools." The first trustees
                            of the common schools, H. P. Coburn, Calvin Fletcher, and H. F. West, had been selected on
                            January 10, 1853, by the City Council of 
                                Indianapolis
                            . Ten years later, May 5, 1863, the trustees, one representative from each of
                            the nine wards, were elected directly by the citizens of 
                                Indianapolis
                             and took office on May 16 of that year. Two years after this, however, April 3,
                            1865, the city reverted to the earlier plan of having the school trustees chosen by the
                            common council and at the same time reduced the number from nine to three.
               
                     as English private schools in existence within the city.5 Since not all of the 
                        German
                     citizens of 
                        Indianapolis
                     could afford to send their children to such private schools, it is not surprising
                    therefore to find a resolution offered as early as December 1, 1856, in the regular session of the 
                        Indianapolis City
                     Council to the effect "that a portion of the school fund be appropriated to
                    educate the 
                        German
                     children of the city in their own language, or for the employment of a 
                        German
                     teacher for their instruction, and that the school trustees be instructed to make the
                    necessary investigation and examination into the expenditure consequent upon the same."6 Apparently the school trustees were not as predisposed to the appropriation of
                    school funds for the education of 
                        German
                     children as the council had been, for they reported back to the council by asking three
                    important questions: one, whether such a school came within the contemplated reach of the common
                    school system; two, whether it was practical, financially, to establish such an institution; and
                    three, if it were in the spirit of the school system to educate a portion of the city children in
                    two languages, while the majority was taught in but one. The chief objection, furthermore, as named
                    in the school trustees' report, was the lack of means on the part of the city in its
                    present condition to establish such a school when new school houses were needed and the school
                    treasury was empty. The report was ordered tabled.7 Several months later, a
                    second 
                  In 1871 the legislature passed an act which provided for a general system of common
                            schools in all cities of thirty thousand or more inhabitants and also for the election of a
                            board of school commissioners in such cities. After this act the board in 
                                Indianapolis
                             was once more made up of nine representatives, one from each ward. The minutes
                            of the board of trustees for the early days concerned themselves primarily with financial
                            matters; then, in so far as 
                                German
                             is concerned, they recorded appointments and duties of teachers and directors,
                            made due note of petitions and reports, and set down controversial matters, sometimes
                            briefly, sometimes in detail. There are no minutes for the period (between April 18, 1857,
                            and May 20, 1858. (This reference to the manuscript-minutes of the Board of School Trustees
                            will henceforth be cited as Minutes.)
                  
                     5 This is evidenced by an editorial in the Freie
                            Presse (founded September 3, 1853, by Theodore Hielscher) of December 17, 1853, which
                            stated that a new 
                                German
                             school was being opened, but that the editor had not yet had the opportunity
                            "uns durch persönliche Anschauung von dem Zustande der
                                hiesigen deutschen Schulen [italics mine] zu unterrichten."

                     and stronger resolution was offered in the council:
                    "That the school trustees be instructed to employ suitable 
                        German
                     teachers in the 9th and 6th wards to teach those scholars whose parents desire to have
                    instructed in the 
                        German
                     language."8 This was again referred to the trustees, but
                    it also came to naught.
            In the meantime another private school, Die deutsche-englische Schule, opened its
                    doors on May 18, 1857.9 Free from sectarianism, it seems to have been an
                    outstanding private school and to have exerted an influence for thoroughness and high standards
                    throughout the twenty-five years of its existence (1857-1882). As a matter of fact it was not until
                    the public schools themselves were worthy competitors that its own attendance dwindled and it was
                    forced to close. Die deutsche-englische Schule took care of the young sons and
                    daughters, six to fourteen years of age, of a certain per cent of the 
                        German
                     population, but it did not provide instruction for those children whose parents were
                    unable to pay tuition in addition to taxes.
            After the law which allowed local taxation for educational purposes was declared unconstitutional,
                    there were no free public schools during the year 1859, and only limited terms of from eighteen to
                    twenty-two weeks during the years 1860 through 1862.10 Inasmuch as the existing
                    private schools could not absorb all of the pupils, additional 
                        German
                     and English schools sprang up. When the school trustees offered to rent some of the
                    public school rooms for private use, in order to make a little money, 
                        German
                     citizens were among the first to avail themselves of this opportunity.11 The 
                        German
                     Methodists went even further and erected their own school building. The

                            "Permission having been given heretofore to certain Germans maintaining a School in
                            the 7th Ward, to occupy the old School House in that Ward until they shall have erected a
                            building of their own, it was on motion Resolved that $3.00 per month be charged
                            for the occupancy of the same, while so used."
               
                     knowledge of the 
                        German
                     language is important to everyone— American or 
                        German
                    —and a 
                        German
                     education is all the more valuable."12 By 1863 the
                    trustees found the financial situation improved, and from then on the public schools continued to
                    forge ahead.
            One Saturday evening, May 16, 1863, to be exact, "the attention of the Board of School
                    Trustees was called to the practicability of employing 
                        German
                     teachers to teach the 
                        German
                     language in the Public Schools."13 A committee, appointed
                    to investigate the matter, reported on August 1 and recommended "the appointment of two
                    male teachers, who were familiar with both the 
                        German
                     and English language, one for the 8th and one for the 9th Ward Schools as soon as a
                    building could be procured in said Wards for said purpose, and when the next School
                        commenced."14 The report was held over for the next meeting, when
                    curiously enough it was amended to read, "to authorize the employment of two teachers, one
                    in the 8th Ward and one in the 9th Ward to instruct in the 
                        German
                     language," and then voted down!15
            
            Not until two years later, on Tuesday, October 24, 1865, was there an order in the minutes of the
                    board of trustees authorizing the superintendent to procure a teacher of 
                        German
                     to teach in the Ninth Ward.16 The minutes do not show that an
                    appointment was made, but in his Annual Report for the year ending September 1,
                    1866, Thomas B. Elliot, president of the school board, said: "In addition to the local
                    teachers in the several grades, there are two instructors, whose services are rendered in common to
                    all schools, visiting each in order (vocal music, gymnastics); one who devotes all her time to
                    giving instruction in the primary schools; and a fourth who gives half his time to teaching the 
                        German
                     language." And again: "During the last two years … no male
                    teachers have been connected with the schools except the Principal of the High School, and the
                    teachers of Music and 
                        German

                     This would seem to indicate that some male instructor had been
                    engaged, even though in the minutes of June 19, 1866, the secretary of the board did not fill in
                    either name or salary for a teacher of 
                        German
                    .18 When, however, on August 28, the appointments were made for the
                    ensuing year, the name of Mr. H. Deppee was listed as such a teacher in the Ninth Ward.19
            
            After ten years of effort, 
                        German
                     was at length taught in a public school of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but—strange anomaly!—it was taught in English in accordance with
                    the prescription of the school law, yet three-fourths of the Ninth Ward was 
                        German
                     !20 The school house in this ward was a temporary one with four
                    rooms, in one of which, containing from thirty-five to forty pupils, Deppee began his work; began it
                    only, however, since for some reason not stated, he resigned early in November. A Rev.
                    Küster, who applied for the position, was not immediately considered. Instead, Clemens
                    Vonnegut, as a trustee, was instructed by the board "to correspond with Miss Lindenmooth in 
                        Cincinnati
                     with a view to securing her services or that of some other accomplished female
                    instructor in 
                        German
                    ."21 There is no record of what happened next; evidently
                    Küster was employed, but may not have been successful, to judge by the discussion of the
                    board of school trustees on March 19, 1867, "with regard to the teaching of 
                        German
                     in the 9th Ward, pending the resignation of the Rev. Mr. Küster."
                    That he did resign is indicated by the subsequent appointment of Miss Amelia Baldanff.22 With 
                        German
                     taught in English and with three teachers within one year the advent of 
                        German
                     instruction does not seem to have been too auspicious.
            The year 1867 was one in which the legislature met and, as such, was important to the Germans not
                    only of 
                        Indianapolis
                    , but of all Indiana. Early in January the 
                        German
                     newspapers in the state began to stress the urgent need for an amendment to the state
                    school law. Der tägliche Telegraph attacked the subject first of all
                    from the standpoint of immigration. On

                            Ibid., March 19, 1867. Miss Baldanff's salary was $500
                            a year.
               
                     January 3, it printed an editorial in English on
                    "Indiana and the Immigration Question," in which it set forth, first, that Indiana
                    had not had its share of immigrants, that they went to 
                        Illinois
                     and 
                        Missouri
                    ; second, that Indiana had a bad name, as it was generally believed that the Germans in
                    Indiana were not being treated in a liberal, generous, and cosmopolitan spirit; third, that the
                    legislature should consider measures to counteract the above two points, both by authorizing that
                    the laws, the proceedings of the legislature, and the educational and agricultural reports be
                    published in the 
                        German
                     language, and by permitting instruction in the 
                        German
                     language to be introduced into the public schools in such school districts in which a
                    number of voters, said number to be fixed by the legislature, might demand it; and fourth, that the
                    laws concerning the puritanical observance of the Sabbath be revised.23 On the
                    following day there appeared a short article to the effect that the above editorial had received
                    favorable comment in American newspapers, and that the ball had been set rolling.24 On January 10, another English editorial reiterated the pleasure of the Telegraph in having its editorial on immigration so well received and its recommendations
                    on some points so unanimously approved. However, it begged to correct an error of understanding on
                    the part of the 
                        Indianapolis
                    
                    Journal, which had said: "It may be well also to authorize the 
                        German
                     language to be taught in our Public Schools in connection with the English. This would
                    benefit the native born, who might desire to become conversant with the 
                        German
                     tongue, and would relieve 
                        German
                     children of the difficulty of mastering lessons written in a language to which they are
                    strangers, but we think that the 
                        German
                     should not be taught exclusively in any of the Public Schools, but that pains should be
                    taken to instruct 
                        German
                     children in the language of the country of their adoption, which it is as necessary for
                    them to understand, as it would be for American children to learn the 
                        German

                    spoken, but that what it had stated, and what it wanted was simply this: "Let the
                    legislature in an amendment to the school law order the 
                        German
                     language to be taught in the Public Schools of such districts or townships in which a
                    certain number of the citizens (the number to be specified by law) petition for it. This would not
                    transform the schools in which the 
                        German
                     language would be taught, into 
                        German
                     schools, all the other branches of study remaining the same as heretofore. Nor would
                    the tuition in 
                        German
                     in such schools be an exclusive advantage to the children of 
                        German
                     birth, but the other pupils would equally profit by it."26
            
            Again on January 26 an English editorial appeared in the Telegraph, this time on
                    "The Germans and the Legislature." The editor stated that the General Assembly
                    should ascertain the views and wishes of its 
                        German
                     constituents in relation to the measures and questions to be settled. His concluding
                    remarks were: "Finally, the Germans take the liveliest interest in the promotion of
                    immigration, and the legislature could do nothing more welcome to them than to pass the most liberal
                    measures in regard to this important question. By providing for the largest possible circulation of
                    pamphlets describing the unequaled resources of our State, by introducing instruction in the 
                        German
                     language into such of our Public Schools in which it will be desired by a stated number
                    of citizens; … by all these measures our state authorities will be able to attract to 
                        Indianapolis
                     in the course of a few years over one hundred thousand industrious and thrifty 
                        German
                     immigrants who will take up our wild lands, till our rich soil, help us in developing
                    our manufactures and working our mines, and increase our general wealth and prosperity."27 A 
                        German
                     editorial on January 29, also addressed to the legislature, stressed the same
                        subject.28
            
            To provide an interlude, a paragraph in the Telegraph called attention to the need
                    for improvement in the public schools of 
                        Indianapolis
                     and recommended that parents of those pupils attending the 
                        German
                    -English Freischule visit the public schools on the occasion of their
                    semi-annual examinations and ascertain for themselves that the 
                        German
                    -English 
                  
                     26
                            Telegraph, January 10, 1867.
                  
                     27
                            Ibid., January 26, 1867.
                  
                     28
                            Ibid., January 29, 1867.
               
                    
                    Freischule was accomplishing much more than the public schools. It was the opinion
                    of the Telegraph that pedagogs would be convinced, by looking over the
                    examinations of the Freischule, that public education in Indiana still left much
                    to be desired.29
            
            The editorials bore fruit; among the bills introduced into the house at the afternoon session of the
                    legislature, February 11, was one, No. 265, by William E. McLean of 
                        Terre Haute
                    , pertaining to the introduction of the 
                        German
                     language into the elementary schools of the state.30 While the bill
                    was pending, the editor of the Telegraph continued his series of discussions on
                    the subject of the introduction of the 
                        German
                     language into the public schools. In these he reviewed the origin of the 
                        German
                     language, took up its relation to other European languages and to English, emphasized
                    its inmost connection with the spirit and culture of the 
                        German
                     people, and extolled its vigor and beauty. Even though much that he said was addressed
                    to the educated class, and no doubt was over the heads of some of the subscribers to the Telegraph, the articles show the tenacity with which the Germans held on to their
                    language and give an insight into the fight which they were willing to wage in order to have their
                    children continue the study of their native tongue.31
            
            Before the series was completed, an unexpected blow fell. The bill to amend the school law had been
                    handed over to the Committee on Schools and Education of which McLean was chairman, and Emil Bischof
                    of 
                        Evansville
                     was a member. In addition to Bischof there were two other 
                        German
                     representatives in the assembly, all three of whom were opposed to the bill as they
                    said for two reasons: they wanted only the English language taught to the youth of the country and
                    they considered the present law sufficient for all practical purposes.32 Most of
                    the blame for the opposition fell upon Bischof, who openly confessed that he was against the McLean
                    bill, because he considered the present law adequate.33 Bischof maintained that
                    according to the Superintendent 
                  
                     29

                            Ibid., February 24, 1867.
                  
                     33 The law reads: "The Common Schools of the State shall be
                            taught in the English language, and the Trustee shall provide to have taught 
               
                     of Schools at 
                        Evansville
                    , a man who was also a lawyer, nothing stood in the way of the introduction of 
                        German
                     into the common schools.34 He added that in his opinion this
                    present law was better than the one in 
                        Ohio
                    , a remark not quite accurate, for the 
                        Ohio
                     law allowed the school board to provide for 
                        German
                     instruction.35 Bischof went on to say that McLean's bill,
                    even if passed, would have little success, unless the law about the school examiner, about the
                    rights and duties of the trustees with regard to appointments, salaries, teachers, etc., were
                    amended at the same time. He added that he himself was a friend of education and of the introduction
                    of 
                        German
                     into the public schools, having been instrumental in its introduction into the schools
                    of 
                        Evansville
                     seven years prior, a statement refuted on March 5 by the 
                        Evansville
                    
                    Demokrat.
               36
            
            From now on the Telegraph was merciless in its criticism of Bischof, charging
                    breach of faith. The paper claimed that it had an understanding with him that by means of an
                    amendment the trustee would have to introduce 
                        German
                     into a school when a specified number of parents demanded it.37 In
                    letters signed "Mehrere Schulfreunde" the accusation was made that Bischof had
                    obstructed rather than furthered 
                        German
                     instruction in the public schools.38 The
                    "Schulfreunde" called attention to the fact that two years ago the situation for
                    special legislation in behalf of 
                        German
                     instruction had been very unfavorable, that petitions and personal interviews had been
                    of no avail, while now the Americans themselves were inclined to give Germans in Indiana the same
                    rights with respect to the school question that their fellow countrymen 
                  in them Orthography, Reading, Writing, Geography, Arithmetic, English Grammar and good
                            behavior, and such other branches of learning, and other languages, as the advancement of
                            pupils may require … and the tuition in said school shall be without
                            charge." "An Act to provide for a general system of Common Schools

                        German
                     newspapers over the state joined the Telegraph in its stand against
                    Bischof. An editorial in the Telegraph of March 9, 1867, ran thus:
                    "Letters are pouring in upon us from all sides, expressive of the profound indignation felt
                    by the Germans of Indiana at the outrageous conduct of Emil Bischof with regard to the immigration
                    question and especially to the amendment to the school law. It is no wonder that our countrymen
                    should be so highly incensed at him. For several years past there has been entire unanimity among
                    the Germans of Indiana as to the necessity, of promoting immigration to the state by the most
                    vigorous measures, and of so amending the school law to give our public schools their full value in
                    the eyes of the 
                        German
                     population. With regard to these two questions there has been no difference of opinion
                    among 
                        German
                     Democrats and Republicans, and we know that no 
                        German
                     in Indiana would have deemed it possible that one of their own number, when trusted
                    with a seat in the legislature, should so degrade himself as to frustrate the to him well-known
                    wishes of the entire body of his countrymen. We know further, that every 
                        German
                     in Indiana almost without exception regarded it as a matter of course that the Germans
                    elected to the legislature would deem it their bounden duty, nay an honorable task of theirs, to
                    stand up for their countrymen, and to be the special advocates of their just and moderate
                        wishes."39
            
            The present school law, Bischof to the contrary, did not meet the needs of the Germans in the state,
                    primarily for two reasons: first, because it explicitly stated that all subjects had to be taught in
                    English, and therefore 
                        German
                     children would have to learn their mother tongue in English; and second, it did not
                    assure the introduction of 
                        German
                    , because the introduction of languages other than English was directly dependent upon
                    the Trustee. There might be time, money, and space for Latin and Greek, for instance, but not for 
                        German
                    .40 The paper jibed at the idea of persuading a native trustee that 
                        German
                     ought to be taught.41 A minority of 150,000 Germans in the state,
                    one-seventh of the population,

                     felt that it had certain rights, particularly when more liberal
                    laws would induce other 
                        German
                     immigrants to settle in Indiana.42 It considered its wishes modest
                    with regard to education.
            In 
                  Indianapolis, German
                leaders felt that something would have to be done about 
                        German
                     instruction in the city, and so once again a resolution was presented from the common
                    council to the board of trustees to the effect that the city school board introduce "joint
                    instruction in English and 
                        German
                    " in one of the wards.43 After due consideration it was
                    ordered by the board of trustees: "That whereas the trustees of the Schools concur with the
                    Common Council in the importance and expediency of the most thorough study of the 
                        German
                     language in the Schools, therefore, Resolved. That Messrs. Vonnegut and Shortridge at
                    the earliest practicable period visit 
                        Cincinnati
                    , examine the process of 
                        German
                     instruction there and report on the best methods of continuing the teaching of the
                    language in the new ninth ward school." This was on April 1.44 One
                    month later, Vonnegut and Shortridge reported that they had duly journeyed to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and had there selected three teachers of 
                        German
                     for "the new 9th Ward building."45
                    Der tägliche Telegraph now urged the Germans to send their children to
                    the Ninth Ward school, since future success for the cause of 
                        German
                     instruction hinged upon the use which the Germans made of the opportunity presented in
                    the Ninth Ward.46
            
            The future position of 
                        German
                     in the schools came up at the May 7 and June 4 meetings of the board, but no action was
                        taken.47 On July 13, the exceptional salaries

                        German
                     were considered.48 The discussion was carried over to the next
                    meeting on October 1, when it was decided that the salaries of the 
                        German
                     teachers should be made uniform with those of a similar grade at "the earliest
                    practicable period."49 At the very next meeting Vonnegut protested
                    formally, but consideration of his protest was postponed.50
            
            In January, 1868, upon the resignation of one of the 
                        German
                     teachers, Vonnegut and Shortridge had to take immediate measures to fill the vacancy,
                    and again 
                        Cincinnati
                     was the city to which Shortridge journeyed, this time alone, however, to find a
                    competent teacher.51 During May and June the board, along with other matters,
                    considered the question of introducing 
                        German
                     into the Sixth Ward. There seem to have been serious difficulties in the grading of the 
                        German
                     language and adapting it to the proper classification in the English branches,
                    consequently a committee which included the superintendent was appointed to examine further into the
                        matter.52
            
            At the end of the school year, the 
                        German
                     and English results in the Ninth Ward were carefully compared from examination papers.
                    It appeared from these that "the English branches had suffered detriment, as compared with
                    the same studies and grades in the other wards, and that the number of pupils who passed on
                    examination to other grades was relatively much smaller than in the other wards. Mr. Shortridge from
                    the committee appointed to report on introduction of 
                        German
                    , reported at length verbally and recommended in

                            Ibid., July 13, 1867. The initial salary apparently was not settled, but
                            there was to be an annual increase of $50.00 until the salary amounted to
                            $750.00.

                            Ibid., October 1, 1867. At this meeting it was ordered "that
                            three of the teachers of 
                                German
                             be paid $570 for the current year and Miss Lindenmooth
                            $600 according to contract made by the Superintendent and Mr.
                            Shortridge;" and "that the above exceptional salaries be con tinued only
                            during the present school year; and that the beginning of the next year the Board will
                            expect that the expense of tuition in the 
                                German
                             language will not exceed that of the same grades in the English
                            language… ."

                            31, 1869, p. 125, under Rules and Regulations, Section 29, specifies a lower salary:
                            "Teachers of 
                                German
                             shall be appointed at $400 per annum which sum may be increased
                            $50 annually until the annual salary shall amount to $550."

                     conclusion that 
                        German
                     be taught independently of classification in the grades."88
            
            Vonnegut's protest on salaries seems to have been heeded, for in the minutes of July 27,
                    1868, it was ordered that the salaries of the four 
                        German
                     teachers, three in the Ninth Ward, and one for the Sixth Ward, be increased.54
            
            When the new school year opened, the board ordered that "notice be published in the daily
                    papers advising parents that their children who desire it can be instructed in the 
                        German
                     language by proper transfer on application at the school office."55 More than a few parents must have taken advantage of this opportunity, for on
                    September 30, 
                        German
                     in the Sixth Ward had to be discussed by the board. There were "640 pupils in
                    the building, of whom 540 could take 
                        German
                    , and of whom over 400 actually did take it."56 The going
                    to the recitation rooms was inconvenient, and therefore the superintendent recommended that a more
                    efficient organization be effected. The novelty of learning 
                        German
                     in school no doubt appealed to many children, who, however, tired of it within a short
                    time, and wanted to withdraw. On November 11, the board decreed that "all children who
                    enter the 
                        German
                     classes and remain in them two weeks, must remain in the study at least thirteen weeks
                    and they can only be excused by written request of parents."57 Two of
                    the 
                        German
                     teachers resigned before the end of the year to the great regret of the board and had
                    to be replaced.58
            
            How the 
                        German
                     instruction was carried out at this date is not clear. Some small idea may be gained
                    from the following, taken from the minutes of the board of trustees on January 6, 1869:
                    "The Superintendent represented to the Board that under the present organization of the
                    Ninth Ward school where in the Primary rooms the English and 
                        German
                     teachers alternate each half day, that is, the 
                        German
                     teacher occupying each forenoon a particular room in giving instruction in 
                        German
                     exclusively and occupying another in the afternoon in the same manner while the English
                    studies were pursued only 
                  
                     53
                            Ibid., June 29, 1868.

                            Ibid., July 27, 1868. The salaries were increased to $600.00;
                            most of the grade teachers at this time were getting from $400.00 to
                            $550.00.

                            Ibid., September 7, 1868.

                            Ibid., September 30, 1868.

                     58
                            Ibid., November 4, December 7, 1868.
               
                     during the half day not thus occupied; that owing to the fact
                    that many pupils did not study 
                        German
                     at all and were consequently obliged to sit one half day without being required or
                    allowed to recite there was much dissatisfaction among the parents. It was ordered that as soon as
                    rooms could be prepared for the purpose that 
                        German
                     instruction be given in the 9th Ward as in the 6th. To wit: by assigning an English
                    teacher to every study room in the building and requiring the 
                        German
                     to be taught in recitation rooms."59 Thus, halting as it
                    was, some progress was nevertheless being made under a superintendent, Shortridge, who had the good
                    of the public schools at heart, and under the instigation of Vonnegut on the board who was tireless
                    in his efforts to further the study of 
                        German
                     in the grades.
            And now the time was drawing near for another session of the legislature. Just before the old year
                    ended, on December 30, 1868, the Telegraph, not unmindful of its duty, ran an
                    editorial which voiced the wishes of Germans with regard to 
                        German
                     instruction, and again gave reasons.60 On January 11, 1869, a
                    letter to the editor called for action in the matter of the Schulfrage and
                    suggested the following: 1. a mass meeting for the purpose of discussing ways and means; 2.
                    petitions with many signatures to be circulated setting forth clearly the wishes of the citizens; 3.
                    a call to certain Germans over the state to join this movement and influence the legislature with
                    petitions. The letter concluded that if the legislature were convinced that a majority of the
                    Germans demanded it, the amendment to the school laws could be put through.61
            
            Three days later on January 14, a group of 
                        German
                     citizens elected a chairman and a secretary and appointed a committee which was to
                    begin work at once to bring in suggestions for an amendment to the school law.62
                    On January 15, a mass meeting was held.63 The committee was augmented and
                    instructed to send a memorial immediately to the legislature containing an amendment to section 147
                    of the school law. That was Friday, and on the following Wednesday a petition

                    wherever forty parents or guardians demanded the teaching of 
                        German
                     in a township, town, or city, that it be the duty of the trustee in that respective
                    place to provide suitable teachers for the introduction of 
                        German
                     into said schools.64

                        Indianapolis
                     had been sent to the legislature, John R. Coffroth introduced the amendment into the
                    house as Bill No. 62 in almost the same form in which the committee of Germans had presented it,
                    except that the number forty was reduced to twenty-five.65 After the first
                    reading, the bill was referred to the Committee on Education.66 It was called up
                    for discussion in the house on the afternoon of February 8, 1869.67 The
                    principal arguments against the bill were: that it would cost too much; that it would favor Germans
                    above other nationalities; that the Germans ought to be Americanized as soon as possible after
                    coming to this country; that it was not the will of the majority of the inhabitants in the state and
                    the majority ought to rule; that it would open the door for the introduction of all kinds of
                    subjects; that it would allow religious sects to make demands upon the curriculum; that it
                    endangered the public weal; and that a terrible jargon, such as was to be found in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , would be the result. The arguments for the passage were: that it would be a distinct
                    advantage to American as well as to 
                        German
                     children to learn two languages instead of one; that it would attract immigrants to the
                    state; that it would be valuable to clerks and businessmen as well as to those who wanted to read 
                        German
                     literature and science in the original; that it would hasten the Americanization of

                     the Germans, for if 
                        German
                     were taught in the public schools, the Germans would send their children to those
                    schools instead of to the private ones; that it was only just to the Germans of the state, because
                    they paid more taxes than any other minority group; that the additional expense entailed was not
                    enough to warrant the defeat of so desirable a measure. A motion to refer the bill back to committee
                    with instructions to include the clause "if no extra expense is entailed" was
                    voted down. One proviso only was added, namely that the petition for 
                        German
                     instruction be handed in before a teacher was employed. The bill passed the second
                    reading, and was ordered engrossed for a third reading "on the morrow at 10
                    o'clock" (February 9, 1869). The Telegraph, in the same issue,
                    carried the announcement of this in its local news, and urged all those interested to be present.
                    The next day, however, when the bill was called up for the third reading, it was postponed until
                    Friday morning, February 12, at ten o'clock because of other unfinished business.68 When it came up for the third reading, one of the former opponents who had a
                    change of mind, spoke in favor of the bill.69 There was no debate, and the bill
                    passed the house with a vote of 77 to 7. This strong majority gave hopes that it would also pass the
                        senate.70
            
            At this point, however, a new and unexpected incident occurred to delay further action. The amendment
                    to the Constitution of the 
                        United States
                     that granted equal suffrage to Negroes was up for ratification by the states. The
                    Democrats were afraid that the Republican majority in both the House of Representatives and in the
                    Senate would pass the amendment; therefore, in order to prevent this, seventeen Democratic senators,
                    and thirty-seven Democratic representatives resigned on March 4, the day that Grant took office, in
                    order to prevent a quorum.71 Governor Baker accepted their resignations, and on
                    March 6, directed the sheriff in each

                            learned … that the bill would have practical operation in but few counties of the
                            state, less than a dozen perhaps, and then only in townships with a large

                     county from which the representatives came, to order special
                    elections within fifteen days.72 Fortunately for the 
                        German
                     bill, the appropriations for the state budget had not been made, hence a special
                    session was necessary. By proclamation this was called for April 8.73
            
            It was not possible however to obtain a quorum in the special session of the legislature until April
                        12.74 On April 24, the Telegraph complained that the
                    special session was half over and nothing had as yet been done about the amendment to the school
                    law. The editorial called attention to the fact that 2,000 children in 
                        Indianapolis
                     were attending privately supported 
                        German
                     schools; that their parents, mostly artisans and craftsmen, could ill afford the double
                    school tax; that they paid it nevertheless, because they felt duty-bound to give their children a
                    knowledge of the 
                        German
                     language so essential to them; that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been paid into
                    the public treasury by these Germans and yet their petitions over the years had been ignored; and
                    that now their proposed amendment for changing the school law was asleep in the archives of the
                    senate. The Telegraph thought it time for the Germans to awaken.75
            
            This editorial brought about the desired action, for in a letter to the Telegraph
                    published April 26, 1869, it was agreed by a committee to meet promptly the next morning, Tuesday,
                    at 9 o'clock in 
                        Washington
                     Hall and proceed from there to the senate chamber.76 All Germans
                    interested in the amendment were urged to come, regardless of party. The next morning, promptly at 9
                    o'clock, Germans from all parts of town, from all social circles, from all churches and all
                    political parties, arrived to take part in the demonstration in the senate chamber. They were united
                    and firmly determined. The members of the Cabinet Makers Union had considered the matter of such
                    vital importance that they had left their work and were assembled in the hall. At nine-thirty the
                    assembly, organized under a committee of three, Vonnegut,

                     Seidensticker, and Köhne, who had been chosen by
                    those present, all marched to the senate chamber. According to the newspaper accounts, the
                    habitués of the State House were dumfounded at the flood of Germans. The senate was not
                    yet organized for business. The purpose of the delegation was explained to several senators. Hastily
                    the senate convened and, after a vote of suspension of rules, the school bill was third on the
                    agenda. The two other bills were read and discussed; there were messages; also pages running back
                    and forth; but the 
                        German
                     delegation had said it would not leave the place until the bill had been voted upon.
                    Finally it was in order. It was read and the battle started. There was much debate. Amendments were
                    introduced, relative to teachers, to having a majority of parents of the pupils petition instead of
                    but twenty-five, to having French and Spanish included, etc. The arguments for the bill seemed to be
                    more forceful, however, than those against it, and so it came to a vote and as the Telegraph expressed it "many a Saul became a Paul." Thirty-seven votes
                    were cast in favor of the bill and only three against it. The members of the 
                        German
                     delegation waved their hats and congratulated each other. None among them, they agreed,
                    had ever spent a morning to a better purpose.77
            
            The bill had passed safely through the two branches of the legislature, but it still needed the
                    signature of the governor. The Telegraph counseled continued vigilance.78 All went well; the governor received the bill on the fifth, signed it on the
                    sixth, and the following amendment was incorporated into the laws of the state of Indiana:
                    "Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of
                    Indiana, that section one hundred and forty seven … be amended to read as follows:
                    … and that whenever the parents or guardians of twenty-five or more children in
                    attendance at any school of a township, town, or city shall so demand, it shall be the duty of the
                    School Trustee or Trustees of said township, town, or city, to procure efficient teachers and
                    introduce the 
                        German
                     language as a branch of study into such schools; and the tuition in said schools shall
                    be without charge: Provided,

                     such demand is made before the teacher for said district is
                        employed."79
            
            Commenting on the passage of the bill, the Telegraph expressed pride in the part it
                    had played and rejoiced that in no other state the law now offered 
                        German
                     immigrants such advantages for the education of their children.80
            
            The situation in 
                        German
                     instruction in 
                        Indianapolis
                     at the time of the passage of the amendment to the school law can be summed up in the
                    report which the superintendent, Shortridge, made to the school board for the year ending August 31,
                    1869. Pupils living north of 
                        Washington
                     Street, who desired 
                        German
                     instruction, had been sent to the Ninth Ward, those living south of 
                        Washington
                    , to the Sixth Ward. A total of 866 pupils had received instruction, 327 in the ninth,
                    539 in the sixth. "The average number who continued the study through the entire year was,
                    in the Sixth, 350; in the Ninth, 292; and in both, 642. Four teachers had been employed full time
                    for this purpose; they labored hard, and as a class were second to no others in the
                    schools." In concluding his report the superintendent said: "It affords me
                    pleasure to report the comparatively prosperous condition of this department of our school system.
                    We have already done much, and I am satisfied that, with the experience of the past year, we shall
                    do much more next, toward putting it on an efficient and permanent basis, as a part of the public
                    school system of the city."81
            
            In the high school, which had been reorganized in 1864, 
                        German
                     had been included in the curriculum from 1868 on, as a choice between 
                        German
                     and Latin.82 The school board had discussed the question of

            The French at French Lick:
            Fact or Fiction?
            Joseph S. Karol, S. J.∗
            For over a hundred years, since William Bowles built the first French Lick Springs Hotel in 1840,
                    French Lick, Indiana, has been a mecca for thousands of seekers of health and pleasure. Few of
                    these, however, know the history associated with this famous valley in southern Indiana. The early
                    Indians, George Rogers Clark, the pioneers, the War of 1812, William Bowles and the Knights of the
                    Golden Circle, and, in a later era, national business and political conventions—all have
                    made this playground of society a microcosm of American history.
            An interesting aspect of the history of French Lick is that which deals with the origins of its name.
                    When or how it received the name French Lick has not been established; a clue exists, however, which
                    may indicate that the place was known by that name in 1786.
            On September 19, 1786, a group of soldiers clad in buckskin moved along a woodland trail. Some of the
                    men rode horses, but most were on foot. At the head of this small army was General George Rogers
                    Clark, the hero of 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Kaskaskia
                    . The soldiers with him this time, however, were not those who had followed him through
                    flooded river bottoms to capture 
                        Vincennes
                     from the British in 1779; this army of 1786 was composed for the most part of drafted
                    and unwilling 
                        Kentucky
                     militiamen. Clark was leading them from the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                    , in order to attack the Indians of the upper 
                        Wabash
                    , who, aroused by the Yankee settlers' activities and high-handed ways, were
                    threatening to wipe out the post of 
                        Vincennes
                    . Early in the expedition, trouble began among the troops.1 An
                    incident which occurred on the march was described years later in a letter written by Captain B.
                    Gaines, commander of the volunteer troops of horse from 
                        Fayette
                    ,

                            Mary's College, Saint Marys,

                     1 Though Clark eventually arrived at 
                                Vincennes
                             and started up the 
                                Wabash
                            , a great many of his men deserted before they made contact with the Indians,
                            and were soon hastening back to 
                                Kentucky
                             the way they had come. Leonard G. Helderman, "The Wabash Expedition of
                            1786,"

                    . In 1833, Gaines wrote: "During the march at a place called French Lick there
                    was a Mutiny of the whole of Col. James Barnet's command respecting a horse which had been
                    taken for the Adjutant-General to Ride. The Whole of them fired off their guns, in defiance of the
                    orders of the Genl, by which the horse had been taken; the Colonel however was arrested tried and
                    Repremanded, which delayed us for a few hours; we then marched on… .,"2
            
            The place Gaines mentioned in this letter was probably what is now French Lick, Indiana, for it is
                    situated near the site of the ancient overland trail that Clark and his army were following, about
                    midway between Clarksville, at the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    , and 
                        Vincennes
                    . Still, this does not prove that the place was actually called French Lick in 1786,
                    when the incident of which Gaines wrote occurred there. Perhaps Gaines, writing years later, used
                    the name that was in well-established use by 1833, when he wrote his account.8
            
            How did this famous resort town, nestled among the rugged hills of southern Indiana, get its name?
                    The term "lick" comes from the fact that long before the advent of the white man
                    to the area, wild animals, especially deer and buffalo, came in great numbers to what is now the
                    French Lick Valley, attracted by the same springs that were one day to bring thousands of
                    health-seekers to the famous hotels in the valley. "Pluto" and
                    "Sprudel," with their high salt content, gushed out of the earth and spread over
                    the rocks and ground surrounding the springs. The mineral waters evaporated, leaving the salt
                    encrusted on the ground; this deposit the animals licked—thus the area was called a
                    "lick."
            The buffalo that frequented the springs were part of the great herds of buffalo that roamed the
                    territory east of the 
                        Mississippi
                     before 1800. Thousands of the shaggy beasts spent the summer pasturing in the prairies
                    of 
                        Illinois
                    . By fall the pasture was exhausted and the cold was coming on, so the

                     3 Gaines, elsewhere in his letter of 1833, writes that he has been
                            fifty years "in 
                                Kentucky
                             and

                     herds migrated to warmer climates. They crossed the Wabash
                    where the city of 
                        Vincennes
                     now stands, pounded in an almost straight line across southern Indiana past French
                    Lick, and forded the 
                        Ohio
                     River at the place where the bridge now stands between New 
                        Albany
                    , Indiana, and 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               . They then went on to the Big Bone
                    Lick, Blue Licks, and other licks and pasture lands of the Bluegrass Country in 
                        Kentucky
                    .
            In the spring, the herds, now accompanied by the newborn calves, made their way back to the 
                        Illinois
                     prairies along the same route by which they had gone in the fall, stopping at the
                    southern Indiana lick for salt and for rest. They stayed in the vicinity of the lick for several
                    days or more, while satisfying their need for salt, and their bellows reverberated in the very hills
                    and hollows where now are West Baden and French Lick.
            Many of the first roads used by the pioneer settlers in the French Lick vicinity were buffalo trails.
                    Whether the numerous trails through the hills near the lick were also made by the buffalo who came
                    to the springs, has not been positively determined. Yet it is quite likely that they were; for these
                    trails were here, worn deep into the ground, when the first settlers came.4
            
            Some early travelers recorded their impressions of the lick. When General Josiah Harmar, Commander of
                    the Army of the 
                        Ohio
                    , passed this way on a march from 
                        Vincennes
                     to the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     in October, 1787, he wrote in his diary for October 4: "march'd to
                    the Lick about 16 miles where we Encamped. Great Quantity of 
                        Buffalo
                     at this Lick—"5
            
            
               
                  4 In the course of their semi-annual migrations, the buffalo beat out a
                        path from ten to twelve feet wide, which came to be called a variety of names after those who
                        followed it. Thus, it was known as Clark's Trace and the General Harrison Trail; but it
                        is now most commonly called the 
                            Buffalo
                         Trace or Trail after its makers. The main 
                            Buffalo
                         Trace can still be seen in many places running east and west through the fields and
                        forests of Dubois, 
                            Orange
                        , and Harrison counties. The main trace, which runs south of French Lick, has
                        definitely been mapped and identified as a buffalo trail. This trail, made by the buffalo in
                        their migrations, became the highway over which the conquerers and the settlers of the Midwest
                        were to come. The buffalo were last seen at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when a
                        terrible winter combined with destructive slaughter by the white man wiped out forever the great
                        herds east of the

                        journal, mentioned French Lick as a great resort for deer and buffalo. However, no mention of
                        French Lick can be found in Clark's
            
            
            Major Ebenezer Denny, who was in the same group, in his "Journal" wrote:
                    "[October] 4th.—Reached the Great Lick, … Fourth day's
                    march, passed over a great deal of good land, particularly near the Great Lick, which is not far
                    distant from the road. When within a few miles of the Lick, our hunters had leave to go ahead.
                    Presently heard the report of both their guns, and in a few minutes five buffaloes made their
                    appearance, bearing furiously toward the head of the column. When within fifty paces, the men in
                    front were permitted to fire; this turned the heads of the animals; they passed along and received
                    the fire of the whole line. Three only were shot down, near the rear, where they approached within
                    twenty paces."6

                     Trace and left a description of the lick was John Heckewelder, a Moravian missionary.
                    In 1792 he went from 
                        Vincennes
                     to the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     with a party of Indians. The group left 
                        Vincennes
                     on October 6. The next day, near the east fork of the White River, the members of the
                    party shot an eight hundred pound buffalo. "On the 9th we reached the socalled 
                        Buffalo
                     Salt Lick where it is said 500 buffaloes may sometimes be seen at one time, especially
                    during the months of June, July and August." Shortly after, the hunters fired into a herd
                    of buffalo that bore down on them; they killed one animal and wounded another. In the evening the
                    party encamped to feast on buffalo meat. Heckewelder wrote that the "salt spot, several
                    acres in size, is so much trodden down and grubbed up, that not a blade of grass can grow and the
                    entire woods are for miles around quite bare. Many heads and skeletons of these animals are to be
                    found which were either shot from time to time, or had died there. From here a great many buffalo
                    trails lead out.…"7
            
            The question of why the lick came to be called "French Lick" remains. Were the
                    French ever in fact at the place?

                     Local tradition takes their presence for granted. Local
                    historians repeat the story. Booklets advertising the hotels and the mineral waters always try to
                    bring in some mention of the French. But a search into the matter reveals a strange array of legend,
                    tradition, and sheer imagination. Snatches of the story in local history turn out, upon
                    investigation, to be repetitions of long-accepted tradition, completely lacking any supporting
                    evidence.
            According to tradition, it was from 
                        Vincennes
                     that the first white people came to French Lick. In 1732, Sieur Francois Marie de 
                        Vincennes
                     of the French colonial army came down the Wabash River from Ouiatenon, site of the
                    present 
                        Lafayette
                    , Indiana, and at the place where the 
                        Buffalo
                     Trace crossed the 
                        Wabash
                    , founded the military and trading post which was to bear his name.8
                    The French who supposedly came out to the lick from 
                        Vincennes
                     are said to have been salt hunters. At 
                        Vincennes
                    , however, there is no record that a group of settlers from that town went at any time
                    into the interior to make salt.9 Still the French Lick local legend maintains
                    that a group of French came out from 
                        Vincennes
                     late in the eighteenth century to make salt and set up their camp near the lick, on or
                    near the spot where the French Lick Springs Hotel now stands.10
            
            There is reason to believe that the French at one time owned the area in which the lick was located.
                    While the 
                        United States
                     government was settling land claims in Indiana in 1794, the French living at 
                        Vincennes
                     laid claim to an area of 1,600,000 acres surrounding their town. The north-south lines
                    of the tract proved to be forty miles long and the east-west lines seventy-two. The northeast corner
                    of the district was near present-day Orleans, fifty-seven miles due east of 
                        Vincennes
                    . The eastern boundary of the claim included French Lick. The French claimed this land
                    on the grounds that it had been given to the first settlers at 
                        Vincennes
                     by the Piankeshaws. The traditional date of the Indian grant is said to have been
                        1742.11

            Among people around French Lick the tradition has been that the French were driven out of the lick by
                    hostile Indians and that the last of the fleeing French threw a large number of kettles and other
                    articles into the river. It has been said that search was several times made for these kettles by
                    the first settlers. But there is no reliable account of this story.12
            
            A discovery made on the site of the French Lick Springs Hotel some years ago caused quite a flurry of
                    excitement locally and added the detail of a French and Indian battle to the legend. Foundations for
                    a new section of the hotel were being dug about 1900. On the spot where the bathhouse now stands,
                    the workmen found some skeletons in the ground. At once someone deduced that these skeletons were
                    the remains of the French and Indians who had fought in the "Battle of French
                    Lick." This detail was part of the legend until investigation showed that the workmen had
                    merely broken into a pioneer cemetery which had been located near the Ranger fort, built at the lick
                    as a protection for frontier settlers.
            Thus, the reason the principal lick in Indiana, called variously the "Great Lick,"
                    and the "
                        Buffalo
                     Salt Lick," came to be known as French Lick still has not been established.
                    The origins of the name remain a patchwork of tradition and circumstantial evidence. Until more
                    substantial evidence is found, the question of whether the French were ever at French Lick must
                    remain unanswered.13

                        me with some material, but neither it nor the University of Notre Dame Archives has any original

                        Natalia M. Belting, any mention of a salt lick would probably be made in village records. If
                        mention were made at all, it would probably be more or less of a parenthetical matter. No
                        references to French Lick are to be found in the Survey index, and Miss Belting thinks the
                        possibility of finding anything of this sort is highly unlikely.

            Reaching for the Hinterland
            Victor M. Bogle∗
            Promoters of early New 
                        Albany
                     realized that if their town's initial growth were to be continued and
                    accelerated, the advantages of its favorable river position would have to be exploited to full
                    measure. This they knew could best be accomplished by establishing a commercial interdependence
                    between the town proper and the areas beyond its immediate geographic boundaries. No one knew what
                    the limits of this hinterland were, or what they were to become. The merchants of New 
                        Albany
                    , like those of dozens of other infant communities, set their ambitions as far as the
                    most optimistic eye could penetrate, and then reached out to fulfill those ambitions. Every young
                    settlement in Indiana could not become a 
                        Cincinnati
                    , a 
                        Louisville
                    , or a 
                        Chicago
                    . But in 1830, the race toward urbanization was open to all comers, and it was believed
                    that the degree of greatness achieved by a town depended largely on the alertness and enthusiasm of
                    its promoters.
            Expansion meant movement, and movement could take place only if there were facilities to channelize
                    and direct it. A rich farm country was of little benefit to a town without adequate means for
                    interchange between the two. Thus a keynote of New 
                        Albany
                    's history from 1830 till after the Civil War was its persistent effort to
                    establish railroads and turnpikes to the north, the east, and the west, in order to round out its
                    pattern of transportation which naturally pivoted on the river. A few successes, more failures, and
                    the frequent upsurges of rivalry with other similarly ambitious communities marked this stormy
                    period of New 
                        Albany
                    's attempt to make a reality of its commercial dreams.
            The first really organized effort of the many towns in the state to reach out for the wealth of the
                    countryside was the elaborate internal improvements project of 1836, the pretentious scale of which
                    eventually bankrupted the state treasury and gave Indiana an unsavory reputation throughout the
                    Union. The legislative maneuvering and log rolling exemplified in the enactment of this internal
                    improvements

                    projects prescribed by the bill, New 
                        Albany
                     was to be directly benefited by two: the 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , New 
                        Albany
                    , and 
                        Crawfordsville
                     Railroad, and the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Vincennes
                     Turnpike.2 A third, the New 
                        Albany
                     and Mount Carmel (
                        Illinois
                    ) Railroad, was given legislative sanction as a privately sponsored enterprise.3
            
            The Mount Carmel Railroad was proposed to undertake something a railroad was not yet able to do: to
                    run almost parallel to the 
                        Ohio
                     River in direct competition with the steamboat. The idea of the projectors was to
                    connect the 
                        Ohio
                     Falls with the city of 
                        St. Louis
                    . The eastern branch, of which New 
                        Albany
                     was to be the terminus, was to be built to join its 
                        Illinois
                     counterpart, which ran from 
                        St. Louis
                    . Since state funds were unavailable, a memorial was sent to Congress, "praying
                    for a grant or a pre-emption to 500,000 acres of land."4 But the grant
                    was never forthcoming, and New 
                        Albany
                    's enthusiasm for the project began to wane.5 Partly
                    because of the lethargy of the New 
                        Albany
                     citizens, the Indiana branch of the 
                        St. Louis
                     to 
                        Ohio
                     Falls railroad was not to become a reality for another forty-five years.
            The railroad that gave New 
                        Albany
                     its most notable boost as a mart for the interchange of town and country products was
                    the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                    . This road was not completed between the two towns until 1851, but initial plans for
                    its building go back to the 1836 improvements bill.6 This bill authorized a
                    state-built railroad to run from 
                        Jeffersonville
                    ,

                        Albany
                    , and then northwestward 150 miles to the town of 
                        Crawfordsville
                    . 
                        Crawfordsville
                     was strictly an interior town, and this early plan to have it serve as the northern
                    terminus is an example of how early transportation projects were allowed to wander out in the rural
                    spaces. The extension to Lake 
                        Michigan
                    , a natural terminus for the railroad, was not included in the immediate plans of the
                    projectors.
            In carrying out this venture, $1,300,000.00 was to be spent, "if
                        practicable."7 It turned out not to be
                    "practicable," and when Indiana's lofty improvements structure began to
                    crumble, the unbuilt 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , New 
                        Albany
                    , and 
                        Crawfordsville
                     Railroad suffered as did most of the other projects throughout the state. But in 1847,
                    New 
                        Albany
                     merchants, along with those of other towns which would be benefited by a revival of the
                    old project, raised their voices anew to have at least part of the original plans carried out.
            This time the railroad project began almost exclusively as a southern Indiana enterprise. The
                    principal idea behind the new scheme was to furnish a thoroughfare from New 
                        Albany
                     to the rich farming country of 
                        Washington
                     County. 
                        Salem
                    , the seat of justice for this county, was to be the northern terminus of the road, and
                    the money was to come chiefly from interested parties in the two terminal towns. An extension of the
                    road on beyond 
                        Salem
                    , along the route outlined in the old surveys, was contemplated; but extensions were to
                    come only as each town on the proposed line expressed its desire to be joined by pledging its share
                    of the building cost.8
            
            The first president of the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad was James Brooks, a New 
                        Albany
                     merchant who stepped from his customary role to take the reins of the new project. His
                    personal interest and individual administrative talents were responsible for much of the success
                    that came to the road in its initial years. He succeeded in obtaining an amendment to the original
                    charter that authorized the company to extend its road "to such point or points as the good
                    of the company might seem to require."9
            
            There was a question as to just where the road should go after it had reached 
                        Salem
                    : some thought northeast to

                        Salem
                     rambled on in a general northwesterly direction. Its eventual goal was still to be 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , where it was to meet a line coming down from 
                        Lafayette
                    . Apparently there was thought to be no harm in covering as much ground as possible
                    before getting there.
            Cars began to run on each stretch of the track as soon as it was laid down. By June, 1850, the
                    company was operating two passenger cars on the ten-mile completed section, for the "ladies
                    and gentlemen, who appeared delighted with the short railroad excursion."11

                    Ledger was among the first to try out the new conveyance which he had been
                    energetically publicizing. About his first ride he wrote: "An event of this kind is one of
                    the memorable passages in the history of New 
                        Albany
                     improvements, and large numbers of our citizens have taken their first railroad ride
                    within the last week. Great curiosity of course exists all along the line to see the snorting
                    ‘iron horse’ as he passes along. At every door might be seen good dames
                    surrounded by troops of youngsters, which tell in unmistakable language of the fruitfulness of our
                    soil in the animal as well as the vegetable kingdom. Ever and anon from humble and we might even say
                    ugly tenements, might be seen fair and handsome faces peering modestly out from behind doors and
                    windows to take a peep at the much talked of stranger ‘Locomotive,’ with his
                    ‘train’ almost as long as those worn by the ladies of Old 
                        England
                     in the days of ‘Good Queen Bess.’ The horses pricked up their
                    ears and stretched forth their arched backs in wonderment, and perhaps were lamenting that their
                    valuable services would be sadly depreciated in the eyes of their owners, when contrasted with the
                    powerful rival which dashed by them in such hot haste. The dogs barked wistfully at the impudent
                    intruder and made desperate efforts to overtake him, but, alas! were compelled to give up the race
                    in utter despair. The legs of cows, calves, pigs, sheep, etc., were never put to such excellent use
                    as when scampering off from a too close proximity with the locomotive. But this state of things will
                    not be of long

            Fourth of July, 1850, was celebrated with a big barbecue at 
                        Providence
                     (Borden, Indiana), not so much to commemorate the deeds of patriotic ancestors as to
                    celebrate the arrival of the first cars at that town, fifteen miles up the line from New 
                        Albany
                    . Six cars were used that day to accommodate the thousands from surrounding counties who
                    participated in the grand festivities.13 By January of the next year the road
                    had been completed to 
                        Salem
                    , and the first train there, after "taking in passengers at almost every
                    farm," was welcomed by "the ringing of bells, the roaring of cannon, and the
                    shouts of thousands of people of all ages, colors, and conditions of Adam's race."
                    Lengthy speeches and sumptuous dinners were the order of the day.14
            
            Accidents on the new road were frequent. Besides the constant danger of explosions, head-on
                    collisions, and fire from the flying sparks, there were other inconveniences for the passengers of

                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                    . Spring freshets played havoc with the crude roadbed, and when a washout occurred the
                    passengers had no alternative but to walk ten or twelve miles to the nearest village.15 All traffic on the road was held up until repairs could be made, and on one occasion
                    this took two weeks.16 New 
                        Albany
                     passengers going north had the choice of a train leaving about 4:30 A.M., or a more
                    crowded one leaving around noon. Keeping pace with the ever-changing schedule was a job in itself;
                    but there were times when the trains were so late that an hour or two didn't make much
                    difference anyway. By January, 1855, even the genial editor of the Ledger was
                    disturbed by the failure of the cars to make their schedule: "This concern is getting to be
                    one of the greatest humbugs of the age. The cars occasionally arrive within ten
                    hours of the time they are due, but are more frequently from twenty-four to forty-eight hours
                        behind."17

                     state's chief north-south thoroughfare became
                    established. Going northwest from 
                        Bedford
                     and 
                        Bloomington
                    , it went to 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , joined with the branch coming south from 
                        Lafayette
                    , and then headed directly north to 
                        Michigan
                     City on the lake. The completion of its 287-mile course in 1854 made it the longest
                    railroad in the state.18
            
            Developing beyond the confines of a local project, the outward prosperity of the road daily
                    increased. Its business boomed as the increasing farm output sought its market in the many villages
                    scattered along the line. And at the bottom of this funnel was the town of New 
                        Albany
                    , ready to catch in its markets the biggest portion of the trade that was to be drained
                    down this artery from the north. The effect that the railroad had on the commercial prosperity of
                    New 
                        Albany
                     cannot be readily measured by statistics, but it is clear that coincidental with the
                    building of the road the importance of the town as a wholesale and forwarding center was
                    established. This was in part but an acceleration of a trend that had begun years earlier; but the
                    extent to which the commercial activity increased in the first few years after the establishment of
                    the road lends credence to the contention that the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     was largely responsible. It was that vital link to the hinterland that the merchants of
                    New 
                        Albany
                     had sought. At no time did the hopes of what the town might some day become rise so
                    high as in the early 1850's.19
            
            After reaching 
                        Michigan
                     City in 1854, the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     joined with the 
                        Michigan
                     Central at that point and then went some thirty miles westward to 
                        Chicago
                    . By this date 
                        Chicago
                    's importance was universally recognized, and a rail connection from the 
                        Ohio
                     River to this new city on the lake was an important event in Midwestern railroad
                        development.20 The combined river-railroad route was publicized as

                     19 Paragraphs like the following were very common in the daily Ledger at this period: "The time has not arrived when we can
                            properly estimate the importance of the New 
                                Albany

                            should be, we have no fear but our population will be doubled, and the wealth of the city
                            trebled, in five years." Ibid., June 28, 1850.

                    at present quite a number of families preparing to emigrate to the ‘Far West’
                    from this country, permit me through your paper to give them a hint as to which is the best route
                    from 
                        Pittsburgh
                     to 
                        Chicago
                    . I would advise them to go by the 
                        Ohio
                     River to New 
                        Albany

                     to New 
                        Albany

                    $7, and from thence by railroad for $8—making in all
                    $15—while by other routes the fare is from $18 to $20.
            "In the second place, furniture shipped by the, river has to be reshipped only once from

                        Albany
                    ) while by other routes it must be reshipped from five to seven times …

                        Salem
                     came to have still a greater part in the travel westward when it made its connection
                    with the newly-laid 
                        Ohio

                        Mississippi
                     Railroad in 1857. This road ran between 
                        Cincinnati
                     and 
                        St. Louis

                        Salem

                        Mitchell
                    . Travelers leaving New 
                        Albany
                     at 10:30 A.M. were scheduled to reach 
                        St. Louis

                        Albany
                     was not only the terminus of the railroad, but it was also the seat of the general
                    offices and machine shops.23 From the former came prestige, from the latter a
                    tangible contribution to the town's economy in the form of wages to at least 150 employees.
                    As New 
                        Albany
                     came to figure less and less in the calculations of the railroad managers, there was a
                    growing fear that the shops would be moved from the town to a more centrally-located point. When the
                    threat seemed greatest it was aggravated by a fire which swept through the New 
                        Albany
                     shops, destroying a large part of the buildings and rolling stock. But the people of

                     donated enough money to the company to encourage them to rebuild in the town, and thus
                    retained for New 
                        Albany
                     this important share in the railroad.24
            
            New 
                        Albany
                    's stake in the railroad was more than sentimental from the first years of its
                    building. Even the "laborers and mechanics" of the town had been urged to
                    contribute what they could to start the grandiose project on its way; but the town's chief
                    financial contribution was in the form of a $100,000.00 purchase of stock, this amount to
                    be raised by increasing the general tax rate.25 By 1856, when the line had been
                    completed to 
                        Michigan
                     City, the railroad corporation was worth about six million dollars, and New 
                        Albany
                    's original share had diminished in proportion.26
            
            It took but a few years for the people of New 
                        Albany
                     to see that this growing child which they had fathered and thought to be their own, did
                    not entirely reciprocate their benevolent feelings. There had to be two ends to a railroad, and the
                    funnel was open at both ends. Too, dozens of in-between towns awakened by the new railroad began to
                    share in commercial activities that a short while before had been handled at a few larger places
                    like New 
                        Albany
                    .
            A puzzling thing to the people of New 
                        Albany
                     was how the railroad could be so prosperous and yet be so poor. The receipts of the
                    road for the year 1855 were $645,827.00, and for the following year
                    $739,704.00. During the first six months of 1856, the road received
                    $150,405.00 for freight, $170,699.00 for passengers, and $16,275.00
                    for mail. Yet, the company reported that "the earnings have not been sufficient to enable
                    the directors to go on with the necessary improvements, and have sufficient left to meet existing
                    engagements." The solution recommended by the directors was: "$500,000
                    of income bonds to be issued, secured by a mortgage on the rolling stock of the company and such
                    other property as had not before been pledged, and propose to the holders of the second and third
                    mortgage bonds to receive these bonds instead of cash, for two and a half year's interest;
                    and the holders of the first mortgage bonds to receive them for one year's
                        interest."27

            It is not surprising that New 
                        Albany
                    's "laborers and mechanics" shook their heads and wondered
                    what had happened to "their railroad."28
            
            In 1857, the old managers of the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     were accused of paying off the floating debt at the expense of the stockholders, and
                    further dissension brought a complete reorganization in 1858. James Brooks, the president, came back
                    to New 
                        Albany
                     to resume his grocery business.29
            
            What happened the following year held even more significance for New 
                        Albany
                     and "its railroad." The title of the road was changed from the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     Railroad to the 
                        Louisville
                    , New 
                        Albany
                    , and 
                        Chicago
                     Railroad.30 The change was to some degree appropriate, for 
                        Salem
                     had long since been passed by as the terminus of the road. But placing 
                        Louisville
                     in the title was ominous.
            The initial prosperity that came to New 
                        Albany
                     with the building of the railroad to the northwest inspired citizens of the town to
                    look around for possible railroad projects in other directions. From 1853 there were at least three
                    railroad proposals that came under serious consideration, none of which was carried to completion.
                    These were the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                    ; the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Fort Wayne
                    ; and the New 
                        Albany
                     and Sandusky City Junction Railroad.
            Everything in the form of a railroad proposal that came their way the New Albanyians grasped and
                    attempted to turn into a reality. When they had the various propositions down on paper and had
                    translated their ambitions into dollars and cents sacrifices, they were forced to make choices. The
                    New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                     Railroad was the victim of one of these choices. This road, which was to stretch about
                    120 miles along the 
                        Ohio
                     River, was abandoned in the proposal stage in August, 1853, because New 
                        Albany
                    's pledge of $400,000.00 to the more attractive 
                        Fort Wayne
                     road was as much as the town could handle.31 Shortly after, the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     project was given

                            bankers," Brooks was serenaded by over a hundred local employees of the railroad at
                            his Main Street residence.

                     up so that efforts could be concentrated on the Sandusky.
                    Though the Sandusky was never completed, it was to leave its mark on the city treasury.
            Merchants of New 
                        Albany
                     acknowledged that the proximity of their town to the Falls "barrier"
                    brought them certain advantages which they could not otherwise enjoy. On the other hand, when
                    receiving cargoes from the east they were confronted with the same Falls transshipment problem that
                    plagued mercantile people in all the down-river towns. And when a merchant or other resident of New 
                        Albany
                     went eastward, he had to begin his journey by hiring a wagon to carry him and his
                    baggage to 
                        Louisville
                     to catch an up-river boat or train. For years such inconveniences had been taken in
                    stride and excited little comment. But by 1850 the tenor of thinking had changed. "How much
                    longer shall this state of things continue?" asked the editor of the Ledger. "Why should not our merchants have their goods delivered from the cars to
                    their own city, and when they wish to make a journey, jump into the cars at their own door instead
                    of being compelled to wade through mud and cold, or scorching heat, to avail themselves of the
                    facilities for travel which neighboring cities provide?"32
            
            The planned solution to these problems was the New 
                        Albany
                     and Sandusky City Junction Railroad. This railroad was to begin at Sandusky, 
                        Ohio
                    , on Lake 
                        Erie
                    , go southwest-ward across 
                        Ohio
                    , and continue in this direction across Indiana until it terminated at New 
                        Albany
                    . Not only would this railroad supply a more convenient means for New 
                        Albany
                     merchants in receiving their eastern shipments; but it would place the town of New 
                        Albany
                     in a key position on what might become a major east-west thoroughfare.33
            
            To carry out its campaign to gain New 
                        Albany
                    's financial support, in 1853 the Sandusky corporation set up its main office
                    in the town.34 The directors contracted with an 
                        Ohio
                     concern to begin the building of the road just as soon as New 
                        Albany
                     made good its pledge of $100,000.00 in cash and 
                  
                     32
                            Ibid., June 1, 1854.
                  
                     33 This potential throughfare would by-pass 
                                Louisville
                             completely—a very practical consideration for New Albanyians at this
                            time. Through- travelers coming from the East via the railroad could continue their journey
                            by steamboat from New 
                                Albany
                            .

                     $200,000.00 in real estate. The money was to come
                    from local residents in the form of individual stock purchases.35 As in the case
                    of the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                    , this was a lot of money to be raised from private investors, and shortly it was
                    obvious that the subscriptions were not going to be adequate. On June 1, 1854, the worried editor of
                    the Ledger admonished his readers: "Remember, citizens of New 
                        Albany
                    , if we do not secure the terminus of the Sandusky road, some of our neighbors and
                    rivals will. There is bound to be a Railroad from the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                     to Lake 
                        Erie
                    . If our road is built, other projects will probably be abandoned; if ours is abandoned,
                    theirs will go ahead."36
            
            Private enterprise having failed to reach the goal, the city council received a petition signed by a
                    majority of the voters authorizing it to pledge the city of New 
                        Albany
                     to 8,000 shares of the Sandusky's stock. This made New 
                        Albany
                    's share in the project $400,000.00—four times its stake
                    in the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                    . The amount was to be raised by the sale of "hundred dollar city
                    bonds" in 
                        New York
                    .37 Thus, New 
                        Albany
                     was prepared to gamble to the extent of $400,000.00 that the road would be
                    built, and it would be a paying road. The whole subscription list of the company outside of the New 
                        Albany
                     shares amounted to only $353,000.00.S8
            
            During these negotiations the Indiana supreme court brought forth a decision which prevented
                    municipal governments from investing to the extent that New 
                        Albany
                     had planned.39 The delay from this respite gave time for a local
                    anti-railroad group to organize. The group claimed that New

                     37 This was the financial agreement made between New 
                                Albany
                             and the railroad: "The New 
                                Albany
                             and Sandusky City Junction Railroad Co., shall pay to the city of New 
                                Albany
                            , in stock in said company, an amount thereof equal at its par value to the
                            amount of interest on the bonds of said city, issued under the provisions of this ordinance
                            for the first three years after the date thereof, deducting therefrom any dividends that may
                            be paid by said railroad company to be issued at such times as the said interest may become
                            due. After which time the company assumes and will pay the interest on said city bonds to
                            the holders thereof, thereby relieving the city from such payment of interest on her stocks,
                            [and the city] will receive her dividends on the net proceeds of the earnings of the road as
                            other stockholders." Ibid., March 1, 1855.

                        Albany
                     was going beyond its means in supplying its stated share to the railroad, particularly
                    since the real estate pledged from other sources was actually worth only a small fraction of its
                    stated value.40 But the protest failed to swerve the city council from its
                    position, and when a new bill was passed in the state legislature nullifying the supreme court
                    restriction, the council went ahead with its plan to subscribe the $400,000.00.41
            
            Actual work on laying out the railroad was begun, but the confusion resulting from New 
                        Albany
                    's contested subscription was one of the prime factors that prevented it from
                    ever being completed. In the spring election of 1855 the Know Nothing Party gained control of the
                    New 
                        Albany
                     government, and one of its objectives was to kill the Sandusky railroad project. The
                    new mayor and council proceeded to do this by levying an "enormous and unnecessary tax,
                    nominally for railroad purposes but really, as was generally understood, to apply a portion of the
                    railroad tax to ordinary city purposes." This served the purpose of discrediting the whole
                    Sandusky affair, and shortly there was a movement afoot to repudiate New 
                        Albany
                    's pledge altogether. Friends of the railroad proposed a compromise whereby the
                    $400,000.00 pledge would be reduced to $250,000.00, and the repudiators were
                    temporarily silenced.42
            
            As a further token of the railroad's intention to get the road built as quickly as possible,
                    the contractor took up his residence in New 
                        Albany
                    . The road received a right-of-way through the town, and some of the work was commenced
                    on the grading.43 This was as far as the project got. Money paid into the
                    company's treasury was dissipated in the preliminary activities, and there is no record of
                    a track of this road ever approaching New 
                        Albany
                    . But the townspeople were given something by which to remember it: as late as 1865 they
                    were taxed to pay for a railroad which was never built44

                     growing need of communication with these sections. In the
                    decades preceding the Civil War there was constant urging on the part of the New 
                        Albany
                     mercantile interests to keep the old roads in a passable condition and build new ones
                    to the areas that the merchants considered part of their natural sphere of operations. Some action
                    was taken to make the roads more nearly adequate, but most of the improvements turned out to be but
                    temporary remedies. After much effort and money were spent to get a road built or improved, within a
                    few years it was declared impassable. Public and private enterprise alike, or the combination of
                    both, failed to achieve the success in road building and maintenance that merchants and farmers in
                    the New 
                        Albany
                     area demanded.
            The most ambitious road project with which New 
                        Albany
                     was concerned in the pre-Civil War years was the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Vincennes
                     Turnpike. The plans for this project included improvements on the old roadbed
                    commensurate with its importance as a major east-west highway. The volume of travel on this road, at
                    least in the 1830's, was greater than that on any other road crossing Indiana.45 New 
                        Albany
                    's interest in the route was two-fold: first, as noted before, the merchants of
                    the town needed it to reach the agricultural area to the northwest; second, it was necessary to
                    preserve New 
                        Albany
                    's status as a key point on one of the most popular river-land routes to the
                    West. This second factor became ever more important in the 1840's and 1850's as
                    throngs of emigrants searched for the shortest and easiest way to the undeveloped regions to the
                    northwest. Hundreds came down the 
                        Ohio
                     River as far as practicable, then branched off at some convenient point to continue the
                    journey by land. The Falls made New 
                        Albany
                     one of these convenient points, but its position could be maintained only if the road
                    connecting the town to the northwestern country were kept in a passable condition.46
            
            The state legislature of 1835-1836 decided that this road

                     should be made to pay for its own improvement by its conversion
                    into a state-operated turnpike. More than a million and a half dollars were prescribed by the
                    "improvements legislature" to complete the work, but this road too was the victim
                    of the financial vicissitudes which came shortly after.47 Instead of building
                    the road the full 105 miles between New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Vincennes
                    , it was decided first to construct the forty-one mile section from New 
                        Albany
                     to Paoli. For this the state spent almost seven hundred thousand dollars before it was
                    forced to abandon the work in the early 1840's to a private concern. The road was
                    macadamized, but only a few years passed before planks were laid down in an attempt to preserve its
                    passability. The $9,000.00 annual toll was not enough for the turnpike corporation to pay
                    the cost of upkeep, let alone the initial outlay. But whatever its economic status or its physical
                    condition, the 
                        Vincennes
                     road did serve as a valuable "feeder" from the farm country to New 
                        Albany
                    .48
            
            The idea of restoring roads by "planking" them became unusually popular in the late
                    1840's and 1850's.49 Building or improving plank roads was
                    customarily taken over by private turnpike corporations, which appealed to merchants and farmers
                    along the routes to lend their aid by subscribing stock. The campaign for funds was customarily
                    initiated by a series of meetings, not only in the larger towns concerned, but in most of the
                    villages in between.50
            
            The plank roads that excited most attention from New 
                        Albany
                     citizens were the ones leading to Corydon and to 
                        Jeffersonville
                    : the one to Corydon because it gave access to a valuable farm district; the one to 
                        Jeffersonville
                     because it served to link the two towns in a united effort to bring river shipping to
                    the Indiana shore.
            In May, 1851, a mass meeting was held at the "Hoosier" fire house in New 
                        Albany
                     to bring home to the people the importance of contributing money to the Corydon plank
                    road.

                             end of the road did not receive its share of improvement for many years. As
                            late as 1851 the people of that town petitioned the Indiana legislature to "divorce
                            itself from the road and place it in the hands of a private company." Ibid., January 28, 1851.
                  
                     49 Robert Dale Owen was one of the chief proponents of this method. He
                            paid New 
                                Albany
                             at least one visit to advise its people on "the construction of Plank

                     The editor of the Ledger advised a large
                    attendance, for this was to be "a road of incalculable benefit to our city and to the
                    county of Harrison, and no one who has the means to spare should neglect to take stock in it when
                    the books are opened."51 By September, 1853, eleven miles of the
                    twenty-mile road had been completed at a cost of $75,000.00. As in the case of the 
                        Vincennes
                     road, the real advantages did not come from profits from the tolls; for the road was
                    again ready for a complete overhaul long before the seven or eight thousand dollars annually
                    collected in tolls had paid off the initial building cost.52
            
            The proposed plank road to 
                        Jeffersonville
                     drew special attention when the 
                        Jeffersonville
                    -
                        Columbus
                     Railroad neared completion (1850). It was thought that if the wagon route were
                    sufficiently improved, this railroad northward would serve almost as conveniently as if it were New 
                        Albany
                    's own. In addition to up-river freight which halted at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to be transshipped on down the river, freight coming down from the central portion of
                    the state to 
                        Jeffersonville
                     by rail could be hauled by wagon over the plank road to New 
                        Albany
                    , and then be loaded on boats at the New 
                        Albany
                     wharf for further conveyance down the river.53
            
            In 1851 the New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                     Plank Road was completed and was declared by local observers to be one of the most
                    excellent roads in the West.54 But, like the others, its improved condition was
                    shortlived. By 1857, the 
                        Jeffersonville
                     wharfmaster refused to accept cargo destined for New 
                        Albany
                     because "the road from that place to this is in such a shocking condition that
                    goods cannot be wagoned down."55
            
            Throughout this period, many shorter, less important roads were also contemplated; some of them were
                    carried to completion. Roads stretching only a few miles into the countryside, as the ones to 
                        Georgetown
                     and to 
                        Hamburg
                    , received all the attention due projects of a much vaster scale.56
                    But even the shortest roads were vital to the farmers immediately served by them, and on their
                    maintenance depended much of New 
                        Albany
                    's commercial prosperity.

            The rivalry between New 
                        Albany
                     and other places in Indiana which were considered its serious competitors is one of the
                    most conspicuous features of the town's history from about 1830 to the last quarter of the
                    century. This rivalry was most manifest in the writings of the newspapers, but the industry and zeal
                    with which the editors applied their talents to this subject indicates that they were concerned with
                    the economic preservation of their home towns. Places whose interests could be pursued in
                    conjunction with New 
                        Albany
                    's were usually accepted as allies; among those were 
                  Salem, Crawfordsville
               , Corydon, and 
                        Lafayette
                    . Consistent with the "balance of power" pattern, some, such as 
                        Jeffersonville
                    , at times were friends, at other times opponents. Still others were almost always
                        "enemies."57
            
            
               
                        Jeffersonville
                     was New 
                        Albany
                    's nearest Indiana neighbor, and the relationship of these two towns varied
                    according to the immediate circumstances. If it were a question of combining the assets of 
                        Jeffersonville
                     with those of New 
                        Albany
                     to compete with some other town in the state, or with 
                        Louisville
                     across the river, New 
                        Albany
                     was unusually civil and appreciative. But one fact the New Albanyians wanted
                    understood: their own town was supreme on the Indiana side of the river, and "our dear
                    little sister on the other side of the falls" could serve best by conforming.68
            
            As a rule New 
                        Albany
                     maintained a benign attitude toward 
                        Jeffersonville
                     because always alive was the hope that the two would sometime be joined to form one
                    great commercial and industrial metropolis. 
                        Jeffersonville
                     had its own network of roads into the interior, and after 1850 it had its very valuable
                    railroad to the north. An enterprising and imaginative promoter of New 
                        Albany
                     could see how his town benefited from the proximity of 
                        Jeffersonville
                    . The major problem was to prevent the advantages from going to waste, or falling to 
                        Louisville
                    .
            That 
                        Jeffersonville
                     resented this "little sister" role can be seen in the manner in which
                    it occasionally followed its 
                  
                     57 Such expressions as the following were common in the New 
                                Albany
                             papers all through this period, and they left little doubt as to what the
                            town's ambition was: "With its present affluence and advantages
                            … the ultimate destiny of New 
                                Albany
                             cannot be mistaken—she must triumph over every competitor, and
                            become the great commercial and literary center of the State." New 
                                Albany

                     own course. An early example is how 
                        Jeffersonville
                     fought the conversion of the old 
                        Crawfordsville
                     turnpike into a railroad for New 
                        Albany
                    . Since the original wagon road terminated at 
                        Jeffersonville
                     instead of New 
                  Albany, Jeffersonville
                merchants saw that an alteration of the
                    southern terminus would make it easier for the farmers in the back countries to bring their produce
                    to New 
                        Albany
                     markets.59
                    
                        Jeffersonville
                     lost out in this particular contest, but in another important issue it chose to throw
                    benefits to the common rival, 
                        Louisville
                    , rather than to sacrifice for the sake of New 
                        Albany
                    .
            The major question in this 1853 issue was where to make the terminus of the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and Southern Railroad. This road was to begin at 
                        Fort Wayne
                     in the northeastern corner of Indiana, pass southward through the eastern counties of
                    the state, and end at one of the Falls towns.60 Both New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                     wanted to be the terminus of the road, but New 
                        Albany
                    's attention at this time was centered on the Sandusky road. Since New 
                        Albany
                     could not afford to subscribe stock to both ventures, it had to give up the idea of
                    becoming the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     terminus, and thus allowed 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to have this distinction. Following this condescension on the part of New 
                        Albany
                     promoters, their opposition took another form; the object was to prevent the depot of
                    the new railroad from being placed at 
                        Jeffersonville
                    's river front where freight could too easily be placed on ferries to 
                        Louisville
                    .61
            
            Such controversy over whether a railroad station should be located by the river or a mile from it may
                    appear somewhat incredible today, but not so in the 1850's. A few years before this
                    episode, the managers of the 
                        Jeffersonville
                    -
                        Columbus
                     Railroad had tried to place their station by the river, and the town of 
                        Jeffersonville
                     had prevented the step by taking the question to the state legislature.62 In this earlier affair,

                            projected railroads were not standardized. When New 
                                Albany
                             was negotiating for a part in the 
                                Fort Wayne
                             and Southern, the editor of the Ledger usually referred to it
                            as the "New 
                                Albany
                             and 
                                Fort Wayne
                            ."

                            Ibid., August 20, 1853. Attempts of the Indiana towns to keep their
                            railroad stations some distance from the river front were motivated by their desire to be
                            true railroad terminals. In the light of later events, this stand may appear naive, for 
                                Louisville
                             was destined to become more and more the focal point for trade in the Falls
                            area.
               
                    
                    
                        Jeffersonville
                     had called on New 
                        Albany
                     for support, and the fact that in an identical situation 
                        Jeffersonville
                     was ready to play into the hands of the 
                        Louisville
                     rival greatly disturbed its New 
                        Albany
                     ally. But the editor of the 
                        Jeffersonville
                    
                    Times thought the people of New 
                        Albany
                     had nobody but themselves to blame, for in the most "disgraceful proceeding
                    … perpetrated in broad day light by men calling themselves honorable," New 
                        Albany
                     had withdrawn its financial pledge to aid in the building of the 
                        Fort Wayne
                     and Southern.63
                    
                        Jeffersonville
                     preferred having its road benefit 
                        Louisville
                     to not having it built at all.
            This railroad was eventually completed, and years later a branch was built down to New 
                        Albany
                    .64 But the refusal of New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Jeffersonville
                     to make this a joint project to bind themselves together redounded in another
                    unsolicited favor to 
                        Louisville
                    . Little by little, New 
                        Albany
                    's natural partner was lost to the common rival on the 
                        Kentucky
                     side of the river.
            
               
                        Evansville
                    , the natural river outlet for the southwestern section of Indiana, occasionally
                    prompted attention of the New 
                        Albany
                     editor as a potential rival, but in the 1850's it was still not large enough,
                    nor its commercial sphere close enough, to warrant consistent attacks. It was occasionally necessary
                    to call attention of those who would pursue boatbuilding at 
                        Evansville
                     that New 
                        Albany
                     was the most qualified place for this important river enterprise. Other towns that were
                    sometime to dwarf New 
                        Albany
                    , as 
                        Terre Haute
                     and 
                        South Bend
                    , came in for a blast or two, but there was no serious attempt at this time on the part
                    of New 
                        Albany
                     to stem their potential threat.65 As for the Queen City, 
                        Cincinnati
                    , New 
                        Albany
                     was on occasion even ready to line up with 
                        Louisville
                     when it became evident that the 
                        Ohio
                     city made overtures to cut into the trading pattern of the Falls region. But 
                        Cincinnati
                     was ever respected as the city which "has set us a most excellent example, and
                    one which we intend to follow."66

            Anyone checking the population figures of Indiana's cities today would not be likely to
                    choose 
                        Madison
                     as a onetime claimant to population and commercial honors in the state. Yet, it was 
                        Madison
                     that came closest to rivaling New 
                        Albany
                     through most of the years when town rivalry was at its height. 
                        Madison
                     had the good fortune of having been established earlier than New 
                        Albany
                    , and as a river port it had succeeded in becoming the commercial mart for a large
                    section of southern Indiana. By 1830, the two towns were nearly equal in population, but 
                        Madison
                    's edge in trade, milling, meat packing, and manufacturing was to be maintained
                    for at least two more decades.67
            
            Both New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Madison
                     were scheduled to receive railroads in the internal improvements bill of 1836, but
                    unlike New 
                        Albany
                    's proposed road to 
                        Crawfordsville
                    , the 
                        Madison
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     Railroad was not allowed to become the victim of the wholesale scrapping of the
                    legislature's improvements program.68 In just a few years this railroad
                    had reached forty miles to 
                        Columbus
                    , giving 
                        Madison
                     a decided advantage in reaping the benefits that came with having a rail attachment to
                    one of the state's richest farm districts. This was the state's first railroad,
                    and the increased trade that came to 
                        Madison
                     as a result of its building marked this town as Indiana's most eligible
                    commercial point on the 
                        Ohio
                     River.
            As early as 1836, there was a movement within the state legislature to bring a branch of this road
                    down to New 
                        Albany
                    , but "the 
                        Madison
                     interests seemed to be aware of this," and the "unwearied and
                    persevering effort of her representatives" prevented the extension.69

                     eventually got its own railroad headed toward the interior (the New

                        Madison
                     attempted to extend its railroad westward from 
                        Columbus
                     to stem the influence of the New

                        Madison
                     with the competition of two railroads, whereas a few years previously the 
                        Madison
                     road was the only one to penetrate the southeastern counties. The editor of the New 
                        Albany
                    
                    Ledger was on hand to pass his 
                        Madison
                     friends some soothing advice: "Don't fret, gentlemen, there will be
                    enough for all. Remember the fate of the greedy dog in the fable, who while swimming over the stream
                    in grabbing at the shadow of the meat let go and lost forever the delicious morsel
                        itself."71
            
            It was about the year 1850 when the editorial debate between New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Madison
                     editors reached its most heated stage. Any "fuel" on hand was tossed
                    in to brighten the flame of rivalry. The population figures from the 1850 census were one of the
                    most inflammable items at the New 
                        Albany
                     editor's disposal, for his "contemporaries" in 
                        Madison
                     had promised that the population count would settle once and for all how 
                        Madison
                     had outstripped all her rivals. The official count for 
                        Madison
                     was 8,012; for New 
                        Albany
                    , 8,181.72 The margin of difference was slight, but it meant victory
                    for New 
                        Albany
                    . "Why don't the 
                        Madison
                     editors publish the returns of the census of that town?" chided the editor of
                    the Ledger. "They have had a good deal to say about the tremendous
                    increase in population, and one of them boasted a few days ago that it would go considerably over
                    10,000. Come, gentlemen, out with it. We know it will hurt a little for a while, but you will feel
                    better after the first pangs of disappointment are over."73
            
            Making 
                        Madison
                     "eat crow" over the population figures did nothing to abate the
                    verbal campaign on either side. When the singer Jenny Lind gave a concert at 
                        Madison
                     to something short of a full house, the editor of the New 
                        Albany
                    
                    Ledger thought this a good opportunity to attack the rival town's
                    cultural pretensions, and wrote: "Nothing would do, but these enterprising citizens must
                    have a concert from Jenny Lind. Agents were dispatched to Barnum and negotiations set on foot for a
                    grand concert. ‘

                        Madison
                    ?’ and he pulled out his pocket edition of the map of the 
                        United States
                    , and at length descried

                    , his own and her fortune would be made …. But Barnum was not altogether
                    satisfied; he said he thought he had looked over the census tables and had ‘stuck a
                    pin’ in all the big cities, but he didn't find 
                        Madison
                     at all."74
            
            No feature of either town was immune from the exchange of sarcasm. 
                        Madison
                    's boast that it already had municipal waterworks, while New 
                        Albany
                     had none, was countered with the Ledger's defense that the
                    construction of such facilities would be ridiculous in a city growing as fast as New 
                        Albany
                    , for the work would just have to be done all over within five or ten
                    years when the population had doubled. New 
                        Albany
                    's excellent brass band was contrasted to the poverty of music in 
                        Madison
                    , "save that which ascends from the slaughter house during the hog killing
                    season." The greater number of delinquent letters in the 
                        Madison
                     post office was offered as proof by the editor of the 
                        Madison
                    
                    Tribune that his town was a far busier place than New 
                        Albany
                    . The editor of the Ledger replied: "We suppose the next
                    proof will be that their jail is three times as large … that there are more illegitimate
                    children born there; more rapes and seductions committed …. Such is 
                        Madison
                    's greatness, from which … ‘Good Lord deliver
                    us.’ "75
            
            So on and on went the duel between the editors. The rivalry supplied them with a good topic on which
                    to express their talents for satire, and, no doubt, made entertaining copy for readers in both
                    towns. The vigorous campaign of the Ledger editor might have contributed to the
                    retarding of this most immediate rival, but 
                        Madison
                    's inferior geographic position doubtlessly had something to do with its losing
                    out in the race.
            During this preoccupation with 
                        Madison
                    , another town rose almost unobserved which was to put both of these places sadly in the
                    shade of its own advance. This was 
                        Indianapolis
                    , of which the editor of the Ledger had written in 1850: "We
                    of New 
                        Albany
                     certainly have no cause to be jealous or envious of her prosperity. The interests of
                    the two places do not in the least come in contact."76
            
            The interests of the two places did come in contact, for it was the inherent interest of both to be
                    the largest city in the state of Indiana. 
                        Indianapolis
                    ' growing commercial supremacy

                     76
                            Ibid., May 8, 1860.
               
                     resulted in large part from this town's capturing of
                    the interior trade that surveyors of the early commercial pattern thought would invariably find its
                    outlet at points along the river. Railroads brought a revolutionary shift in this orthodox
                    conception, and soon 
                        Indianapolis
                     was to become one of the best examples of how a town with almost no water connections
                    could become a great transportation and trade center.77
            
            The realization that 
                        Indianapolis
                     might be pulling away from its competitors was not completely absent in New 
                        Albany
                    . The Ledger boasted as late as 1852 that "New 
                        Albany
                     is considerably the largest city in Indiana," but in giving a second thought
                    to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , cautiously added, "or we are greatly mistaken." In 1853 the Ledger editor expressed his hope that 
                        Indianapolis
                     might grow and prosper, for "she has exhibited enterprise and untiring energy
                    in making herself the focus of so many railroads and she deserves the reward." But in 1857,
                    three years before the new census figures placed 
                        Indianapolis
                     appreciably ahead of New 
                        Albany
                    , this editor was less sympathetic. "Unquestionably, 
                        Indianapolis
                     will lose much of her prestige at no very remote period. Heretofore people have passed
                    through that city … from necessity rather than choice." He reasoned that the
                    opening of the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     Railroad considerably south of 
                        Indianapolis
                     would remove from that town much of the trade it had built up in the past few years.
                    The New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Salem
                     with its new connection to 
                        Chicago
                     would swerve the northeasterly traffic to the right of it. And most important of all:
                    "The example of great cities being built up off from regular water courses are so extremely
                    rare that we hardly believe she will form an exception. No one can suppose that steamers will ever
                    be supplanted by railroads in carrying freights."78
            
            Arguments that the New 
                        Albany
                     spokesman arrayed against the continued advance of 
                        Indianapolis
                     proved to be so much whistling in the dark. What no one could suppose would happen, did
                    happen. By 1860 what contest there had been between New 
                        Albany
                     and 
                        Indianapolis
                     was virtually over: 
                        Indianapolis
                    ' population was 18,611, against New 
                        Albany
                    's 12,647.79 The margin in population, as well as in trade
                    and industry, was to be speedily multiplied within the next few decades.
            
               
                  77 A few of the smaller steamboats did reach 
                            Indianapolis
                         by way of the White River, but it was not an important river port.

            Opening of the Cherokee Outlet
            Louis A. Mossier∗
            As the 
                        United States
                     government purchased territory in western 
                        Oklahoma
                     from the Indian tribes who held it, it was opened for settlement to the pioneer white
                    settler by runs for land, in which the settlers, starting on a signal, raced to find land to their
                    liking and staked claims to it. The first of these races for homesteads took place in 1889. Each
                    opening of territory in 
                        Oklahoma
                     brought from all over the country a new influx of people, eager to claim land and
                    establish homes and farms. On September 16, 1893, the Federal government opened the Cherokee Outlet,
                    including the Tonkawa and Pawnee reservations. A native Hoosier, Louis A. Mossier, born in Corydon,
                    Indiana, in 1862, went from Indiana to participate in that great race, choose farm land, and take up
                    residence in the West. Mr. Mossier here describes his part in the historic run:
            "In this account of the opening of the Cherokee Strip in 
                        Oklahoma
                     to settlement September 16, 1893, I shall begin with my leaving my home near Corydon,
                    Indiana, about September 1. Accompanying me on this trip were Mrs. J. T. Pfrimmer and children Pearl
                    and Frank, who lived at Crescent, 
                        Oklahoma
                    . Also in the party were four Pfrimmer boys, my wife's brothers, George, Elias,
                    John, and Marian, who were also planning to make the run for homesteads. Upon our arrival we made
                    our headquarters at Jesse Pfrimmers' who had a home in what was known as Old 
                        Oklahoma
                    .
            The boys had previously procured their horses so the first thing for me to do upon arrival was to
                    find a suitable one; was fortunate in finding a $900 cow pony that had previously run two
                    races, knew the game, and was as hard as nails. A period of training and gaiting our five horses
                    together was the next order of business. For the next ten days we put them through intensive
                    training and had them in excellent shape for the race.
            
               
                  ∗ Louis A. Mossier lives in Stillwater, 
                            Oklahoma
                        . This paper was edited by his daughter, Mrs. Grace Mossier Smith, of Stillwater,
                        and submitted for publication by his great-nephew, David Haviland, 
                            Indianapolis
                        .
            
            
            On Wednesday of the second week we started for 
                  Orlando, Oklahoma
               , where the
                    land office was located. Arriving there about 3:00 P.M. we found a company site, and watered and fed
                    the horses. We found the land office located on a strip of land set apart by the government. It was
                    a part of the first quarter section which ran the length of the 300 mile strip on the south. A
                    similar strip ran along the north side of the area opened to settlement.
            On arriving at the land office we found many others there ahead of us. Three lines had been formed,
                    two for men and one for women, about 175 people being in each line. However, during the night two
                    more lines were formed and more registrars added to the force; so that the sight that greeted our
                    eyes at dawn were five lines of eager, expectant men and women, despite the fact that they had been
                    in line all night. In spite of the great crowd which was hourly being increased, it was an orderly,
                    serious-minded group of people assembled.
            Elias Pfrimmer narrowly escaped serious injury when his horse ran over a seven wire fence, breaking
                    three ribs and almost breaking his neck. Since Elias was so sore he could scarcely sit up, a bed was
                    made in the wagon for him. To get him through the lines for registration was a problem, but by
                    arranging with a company directly behind us to take one of his brother's place, the feat of
                    registration was accomplished. But to make the race on horseback was a bigger problem to be reckoned
                    with.
            After registration we returned to camp Thursday evening. Friday evening we made final preparation for
                    the run and turned in early. We were up at dawn Saturday morning, finishing breakfast just as the
                    sun was coming over the horizon. I think I have never seen such a beautiful sunrise. Saddling our
                    horses and making last minute preparations, we decided to ride around and find a more advantageous
                    position—a place where people were fewer.
            After riding several miles during which time we crossed several small streams, and noticing fresh
                    tracks into the strip, we decided to go back and start from our camp site. After giving our horses
                    their noon meal, which consisted of oats and a small drink of water, we still had fifteen minutes to
                    wait.
            
            By this time the whole company was in a hustle and bustle getting placed in line. People on
                    horseback, in vehicles of every kind and description were milling about, lining up, edging this way
                    and that, seeking a better position.
            About five minutes before 12:00 o'clock, when a pistol was to be fired by a soldier as a
                    signal to start, we noticed the lines to the west of us moving, not leisurely but at full speed.
                    Someone shouted to the soldier to let us go, but before he did someone gave a whoop and away the
                    crowd dashed, taking everyone along. Just as we passed the soldier ha fired the gun, then turned his
                    attention toward keeping from being run over and trampled by the crowd. As far as one could see east
                    and west, people were going at full speed. After about the first mile the crowd began to widen out,
                    giving more room. Dust was thick and stifling, but luckily there was a little side wind and the
                    horses were able to keep abreast of the thickest of it.
            By this time the horses were warmed up and our attention was centered on seeing that they keep the
                    pace at which we had trained them. Good horses were passing us on the left and right and the
                    temptation to let ours go was great. However, we knew this was a race of endurance rather than
                    speed. The Pfrimmer boys were nervous about this, but I told them we soon would be doing the passing
                    when the other's horses had given out. Soon drops of sweat as large as hulled peas began
                    forming around the edge of the saddle blanket. The horses' breathing all the while was easy
                    and regular, which was very important.
            People began dropping out of the race for one reason or another. By the time we had gone perhaps five
                    miles I looked ahead and saw a very unusual and peculiar sight—a rather small man riding
                    a fine-looking bright bay, brown running horse. He was riding without a saddle or blanket. But more
                    peculiar than this was the way the horse, by throwing his head down would pull the rider up on his
                    weathers. The man would regain the proper riding position but only for a few seconds, when the
                    performance would be repeated. Both the horse and rider were completely worn out, when we came up to
                    him and exchanged a few words. I asked him where he was from and he answered, "From 
                        Kentucky
                    ." Then he said, "How will you trade horses?" I replied,
                    "No time to trade horses now." That was one of the fast horses that had got off to
                         such a seemingly good start but couldn't keep up
                    the pace—out of the race after five or six miles, while my little cow pony did sixteen
                    miles in one hour flat and was in good shape at the finish.
            Now we could see on either side of the trails men and women on horseback and vehicles slowing up,
                    dismounting, and driving stakes, signifying their choice in a home site. Since we had not yet found
                    the kind of land we wanted, we rode on. Ahead of us suddenly was plainly visible a cloud of smoke,
                    and we soon came to a prairie fire. Because of the short grass and the side wind the horses jumped
                    it easily. It was generally supposed that the men who came into the territory the night before the
                    run and who bore the name of "Sooners" set the fire. In a speech made by Governor
                    Ferguson at Billings, three years later, he complimented the people of the strip on their good
                    citizenship and on the strides they were making in the improvement of the territory. He said in
                    part, "It's true that some of them were soon and others a little sooner, yet they
                    are doing a good and great work in the improvement of the new territory."
            Elias Pfrimmer, one of our party who had been injured by a fall on registration day, was in no
                    condition to make the run, but by sheer determination did ride for six miles, where he got off and
                    staked a claim. His wife and son, following us in a wagon with supplies, stopped to care for him.
            People continued to drop out on the right and on the left, presumably to stake claims. Some were
                    successful while others were not. At one point in the race a hack broke down while crossing a small
                    stream and other vehicles were forced to wait in line until the way could be cleared. The
                    horsebackers, however, never slackened their speed, but crossed on either side of the stalled line.
                    From this place we had about a mile of upgrade to the level of the flat between Warren Creek and
                    Black Bear Creek. Looking off to our right we could see horseback riders riding at top speed to the
                    north. We knew they had not passed us so concluded they were responsible for the
                    "Sooner" tracks we had previously seen in the dry creek bed. They kept going to
                    the north and west and were probably headed for Red Rock, Chicasky, or Salt Fork.
            George Pfrimmer decided to go toward Red Rock or Salt Fork so set out on a trail toward the
                    northeast. This left John, Marian, and me in the group.
            
            Finally John said, "Louis, I believe you had better get off here soon for I believe the
                    places we wanted are already taken by the ‘Sooners.’ You have been to quite a
                    lot of expense and I would hate to see you miss getting a claim." But I decided to risk it
                    a little longer. I soon came to a spot that looked good to me. "Well, boys, I believe this
                    is good enough," I said, as I dismounted and drove my stake.
            As the brothers rode away they promised to be back by night so that we could all go to Perry the next
                    day to file our claims at the land office. Night came and the boys had not returned. Nine
                    o'clock and still they had not come. My preparation for the night consisted of unsaddling
                    my horse, tying the reins to the saddle horn, spreading the blanket on the saddle for a pillow, and
                    stretching out, but not to sleep. The horse was restless and kept pulling at the saddle.
            Other strange prairie noises, together with my excitement and anxiety about the boys not returning,
                    kept me from sleeping, except for a few cat naps. Thus passed my first night on my new farm.
            Sunday morning as the sun was coming up I saw a sight I shall never forget. A deer with her fawn came
                    bounding out of the sunrise, stopped forty yards to the north of me, stood there for perhaps five
                    minutes before scampering away to the northwest.
            The boys still had not returned so I decided they had gone to Perry. I later learned that they had
                    tried to return to my location but because of the darkness of the night and the unfamiliar
                    surroundings, they had gone a mile too far to the east.
            Since I had not eaten since Saturday morning, my greatest concern was to find the chuck wagon. I rode
                    to a big watering hole, watered my horse and drank all I could hold. I found a man with some corn so
                    I bought a feed for my faithful pony. After riding all the remainder of the day, I found George and
                    Elias and the chuck wagon, two miles north and two east. Needless to say, I was glad to see some
                    food. I have never since had to go without food for that long.
            George had staked a claim four miles north of me, Elias seven miles south, John two miles north, and
                    Marian in the northwest section with John. All of us made straight filings except John, who filed a
                    contest against a U.S. marshal.
            
            When we arrived in Perry the town site was teeming with people from all parts of the 
                        United States
                    . There stood a tent city of ten thousand population, where the day before had been only
                    prairie. Filing companies were formed which took several hours. It was necessary to stay close
                    together in order to file when the company was called. If you weren't there when called,
                    you had to go to the end of the line and join another company, which caused delay.
            John and Marian decided to stay and file immediately even though it caused additional expense, while
                    George and Elias and I waited until later to get our numbers at the land office.
            It was five weeks before the papers announcing, announced ours. We were lucky in getting to file the
                    same day we went to the office. During the five weeks' wait, we did some work on our
                    homesteads.
            We all got better than average farms while John got one of the best bottom farms in the country. I
                    later bought it from John and still own it.
            All business being finished here I returned to Indiana, where I made a sale of personal property that
                    couldn't be brought with us. I left Corydon with my wife and two children, Sadie and
                    Clarence, and arrived in Perry February 19. The trial contesting the filing of the U.S.
                    marshal's on John's claim was set for February 21, but since he failed to appear
                    no trial was held.
            Now the task of building a home on the prairie where there was not a stick of timber began. It was
                    such a contrast to the timbered country where I had spent my life up to this time. The first few
                    years were hard but we fared better than many others.
            If this account of one of my life's big experiences has been, interesting to a few of my old
                    friends I will have been well repaid for my trouble."

            On May 9, 1865, eight persons went on trial before a military commission in 
                        Washington
                    , charged with complicity in a plot to assassinate President Abraham 
                        Lincoln
                     and other high personages in the government. Charges were also presented against
                    Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States, and certain Confederate agents. A staff of
                    court reporters, headed by Benn Pitman, took down the record of the trial. When it ended, early in
                    July, four versions of the court proceedings were rushed into print. Two of them, published
                    respectively by Barclay & Co. and T. B. Peterson & Brothers, both of 
                        Philadelphia
                    , the one a mere summary and the other frequently inaccurate, scarcely merit our
                    attention. The other two have been our chief sources of information as to what went on behind the
                    closed doors of the courtroom.
            The first of these, edited by a well-known 
                        Washington
                     journalist, Ben: Perley Poore, and published by J. E. Tilton and Company of 
                        Boston
                    , first in a ten-volume wrapper-bound edition and then in three volumes in hard covers,
                    reproduces the interrogations and the replies of the witnesses in chronological order; but lack of a
                    table of contents and an index makes it inconvenient to use. Moreover, both the wrapper-bound
                    edition and the third volume in hard covers are now rare.
            The final version, and the one we are here concerned with, has been reproduced in facsimile by the
                    present publishers by means of a photographic process. Published originally by Moore, Wilstach
                    & Baldwin of 
                        New York City
                    , it is in some respects the most useful edition for students. For Benn Pitman, the
                    editor, who was chief of the court reporters at the trial, so organized his material as to bring all
                    the testimony concerning each of the conspirators together, and he implemented his volume with a
                    complete table of contents and an alphabetical index of witnesses. A map of Booth's  escape route, a diagram of the stage of Ford's theater
                    together with a map of the vicinity, and a floor plan of the courtroom are other features of his
                    book. Besides the testimony, moreover, he also printed the orders convening the military commission,
                    the rules for its guidance, its findings, the sentences, and the arguments of counsel, none of which
                    are to be found in Poore's version.
            Notwithstanding the superiority of Pitman's book in these respects, however, it also has
                    defects and limitations. Both Pitman and Poore were obliged to omit some of the testimony in order
                    to obtain permission to publish from the War Department. And Pitman omitted still more of it
                    according to his own standards of relevancy, triviality, and repetitiousness. Furthermore, his
                    method of organization made it necessary for him to depart from the chronology of the trial, though
                    he always gives the date of the witnesses' testimony. And to save space, he often omits the
                    questions and consolidates the answers of the witnesses. For the general reader and even for most
                    students these are not serious defects, but those who must work meticulously may find it necessary
                    to use Poore along with Pitman.
            Since the publishers must expect a narrow margin of profit on a venture such as this, one should
                    perhaps forgive them the use of a printing process, which, through reproduction of the original
                    minuscule two-column type, endangers the reader's eyesight. And they are to be commended
                    for adding a splendid and informative introduction by Philip Van Doren Stern.

            In the nineteenth century the American public learned its history from such great scholars as John L.
                    Motley, George Bancroft, William H. Prescott, and Francis Parkman. These men knew their subjects,
                    and could write readable prose. In the twentieth century, however, hardly any American historians
                    have attained a popular following. Allan Nevins, perhaps; and possibly Henry Steele Commager, Samuel
                    Eliot  Morison, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. It would almost
                    seem, then, that Charles A. Beard, who died in 1948 and undeniably was a popular historian, lived
                    out of his proper time. His nearly fifty books sold the astonishing number of 11,352,163 copies. He
                    also wrote innumerable articles, essays, and reviews. There is no doubt about the quality of this
                    writing, either; "Uncle Charley" had his poor moments, but generally maintained a
                    very high level of excellence. Sometimes a few pet phrases or ideas reiterated themselves into
                    cliches, occasionally the thinker nodded while the prose rattled on; but the sharpness of language
                    and acuteness of thought almost always took the reader irresistibly to the conclusion that Beard had
                    in mind.
            It was peculiarly fitting that this extraordinary historian should have come from a farm near 
                        Spiceland
                    , Indiana. Beard never forgot his farm experiences in Indiana, nor his college training
                    at DePauw in the 1890's. Neither the intellectual refinement of 
                        Oxford
                     nor the academic assembly line at 
                        Columbia
                     could change his Midwestern views. His utter sincerity, droll wit, and homely approach
                    to all problems, great and small, made his personality tremendously attractive to generations of
                    students. This present volume of tributary essays indicates the effectiveness of his teaching and
                    scholarship.
            There are some brilliant essays here, especially those by George S. Counts, on "Charles
                    Beard, the Public Man," Merle Curti, on "Beard as Historical Critic," and
                    Eric F. Goldman, "Charles A. Beard: An Impression." The editor, Howard K. Beale,
                    has written well of Beard as historian. Beard's own academic interests divided along lines
                    generally true of American scholarship of his time. With one exception, the symposium covers these
                    interests very adequately: around the turn of the century Beard concerned himself with local
                    government, chiefly its institutions; his interest then broadened to American federal government,
                    culminating in his notable volume on the Constitution and an extraordinarily perceptive study of the
                    economic origins of Jeffersonian democracy (these works marked Beard's search for the
                    underpinnings of politics, which he found to be essentially economic); in the 1920's he
                    turned to the history of American civilization, writing his greatest work, The Rise of
                        American Civilization; in the thirties his mind turned to economics again, although this
                    time to a search for a way out of the Great Depression;  and in
                    the 1940's he faced the problems of world war and American foreign policy.
            Now it seems that Beard's work during the 1930's for the first time showed marked
                    signs of tendentiousness. The wish was constantly father to the thought, and his literary production
                    so suffered that by the end of the decade he had turned to pamphleteering. The Open
                        Door at Home and The Idea of National Interest are not very competent
                    books, in argument or literary finish, and the tracts which Beard published just prior to American
                    entry into the second World War—Giddy Minds and Foreign Quarrels and
                        A Foreign Policy for America—are unfit products of historical
                    scholarship. After the war Beard set out to show fatuousness and bad faith on the part of President
                    F#2 D. Roosevelt, in two books which were, again, not searches for truth but vindications of
                    positions taken in advance. Beard's writing in the 1930's and 1940's grew
                    from his great concern for the future of the Republic. Yet wishing could not make America safe. He
                    could not return the 
                        United States
                     to the carefree era before the first World War, and it was of little avail to ransack
                    history to prove what essentially was a false theory: that isolation (or
                    "continentalism," as he liked to call it) was possible in the twentieth century.
                    This impossible quest brought him much unhappiness; even his tremendous personal influence upon
                    American scholarship and American popular thought could not make his point of view prevail.
            The present symposium unfortunately does not face up to this tragedy of Beard's later years.
                    A problem deserving at least three or four essays in a book as long as this is given only
                    one—"Beard and Foreign Policy," by George R. Leighton. A member of the
                    staff of the Republican Policy Committee of the 
                        United States
                     Senate, Leighton in some sense is disqualified as an objective critic. Although
                    unfavorable criticism is not frequently found in memorial volumes, surely Beard himself would have
                    wished its inclusion. His reputation is solid enough to have withstood some adverse appraisal.
            Withal this symposium comes off quite successfully. The editor deserves congratulation for the high
                    quality of the contributions, which with minor exception are worthy of their subject.

               Victorian Architect; the Life and Work of William Tinsley. By John D. Forbes. (

                    , Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1953, pp. xiv, 153. Illustrations, bibliography,
                    and index. $5.00.)
            In a pleasant and readable style John D. Forbes has told, for the first time, the story of William
                    Tinsley's life. What could have been a prosaic biography has turned out to be lively
                    narrative, interspersed with interesting anecdotes and useful information about the problem that
                    faced the average architect in the nineteenth century.
            Tinsley was not the most famous architect of his generation nor the leader in any of the new
                    movements, but he was more than average in artistic stature. For us he is of considerable
                    significance because of his activity in Indiana and the importance we attach to some of his
                    buildings.
            As fascinating as any chapter in Forbes' account is that dealing with Tinsley's
                    formative years in 
                        Ireland
                    . With his customary painstaking approach, the author apparently submerged himself in
                    the lore of southern 
                        Ireland
                     and in the activities of the people with whom Tinsley came in contact. He even refers
                    to the countryside of County Tipperary with such intimacy that the reader unconsciously feels that
                    Forbes has, himself, often travelled the road from Clonmel to Cashel and knows intimately such
                    landmarks as Knockevan House and Tullemain Castle.
            As the story unfolds and the author follows the architect to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and then to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Tinsley's professional and domestic problems interweave in such a way as to
                    keep the narrative on a high plain of interest. Tinsley was forty-seven when he arrived with his
                    family in 
                        Cincinnati
                     in the autumn of 1851, and the competition for the proposed North Western Christian
                    University (later 
                        Butler
                     University) brought him to 
                        Indianapolis
                     soon after. His winning of that contest led him to change his residence to 
                        Indianapolis
                    , where he remained, except for professional activities in nearby mid-western cities,
                    for almost twenty years. He died in 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1885.
            Tinsley was principally a designer of institutional buildings—colleges, courthouses, and
                    churches—and among the best-known examples still standing are Center Hall at Wabash
                    College, Bascom Hall at the University of 
                        Wisconsin
                    , Ascension  Hall at Kenyon College, Institution for
                    the Education of the Blind at 
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , Calvary Church at 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and Christ Church on Monument Circle, 
                        Indianapolis
                    . Of the last the author writes: "This handsome little church is
                    Tinsley's finest ecclesiastical building in America."
            Characteristic of nineteenth-century architects as a group, William Tinsley was an eclectic. He
                    borrowed principally from two earlier historic styles, sometimes resorting to one and at times to
                    the other, but always adding his own imagination and touch in adapting them to the problem at hand.
                    Those sources of inspiration were sources for most of our buildings, civic and domestic, in the
                    mid-nineteenth century: English Tudor (Gothic) buildings and Italian Renaissance villas. On one
                    occasion he turned to the Greek temple as a prototype, and at another time he experimented with the
                    Romanesque (the Henry Probasco house in 
                        Cincinnati
                    ), in which he was anticipating a movement that swept the country in the
                    1880's.
            
               
                        Indianapolis
                     and most of our Indiana cities reached their periods of prosperity and expansion soon
                    after the Civil War, and erected their first important buildings during Tinsley's residence
                    here. Our architectural heritage is what is loosely called Victorian (more specifically Italian
                    Villa Revival, Gothic Revival, and late French Renaissance Revival), and it is through books like
                        Victorian Architect that we come to understand and appreciate the stately old
                    houses that dominate some of our streets—and that are fast disappearing in the path of
                    what we call progress.

                    index. $2.50.)
            The scholarly approach which characterizes the biographical contributions of Benjamin P. Thomas would
                    not allow one to anticipate many important changes in a reprinting of 
                  
                            Lincoln
                        's 
                            New Salem
                        
               , regardless of the book jacket announcement that it has been
                    "extensively revised." The only alteration in the text important enough to attract
                    attention is the author's comment on the authenticity of the 
                        Lincoln
                    -Rutledge  tradition. Twenty years ago Mr. Thomas
                    reviewed the story with considerable detail and in the present edition lets it stand in its original
                    form with the exception of a few corrections in its chronology and orientation. He does, however,
                    change his observation with reference to the authenticity of the alleged 
                        New Salem
                     romance and while he admitted in 1934 that "some historians have questioned
                    it," in 1954 he is confident that "historians are practically unanimous in
                    rejecting it." After a tradition has been discredited it does not appear as if objectivity
                    in biography or history can best be achieved by continuing to utilize erroneous data in the body of
                    an argument, especially when the author may express his lack of faith in its dependability. One of 
                        Lincoln
                    's best known biographers of a century ago continually used a tradition which
                    he knew to be absolutely false, yet his only ground for so doing was that it contained such
                    "a fine bit of color."
            With the exception of a few words in the story mentioned above there are no other expurgations worth
                    noting. There are practically no interpolations, with the exception of two in the last chapter,
                    which brings the 
                        New Salem
                     restoration program up-to-date, and two concluding sentences that set forth the
                    author's evaluation of 
                        Lincoln
                    's 
                        New Salem
                     years and their impact upon the world. Such few changes as may be discovered, the
                    choice of words and improvement in grammatical construction, contribute very little to a volume
                    already an acceptable piece of literature. The map of 
                        New Salem
                     has been redrawn more artistically and the one entitled "The 
                        New Salem
                     Community" has been moved from the end papers to the body of the book. The
                    index has been improved in several instances by better lines of description.
            The finest word of commendation which can be said about the format of the publication is the liberal
                    spacing between the lines of type in the text which contributes to easy reading. The moving of the
                    footnotes from the appendix to the bottom of the related pages is also an improvement. The one
                    adverse criticism of the book which might be raised may be almost entirely due to the period of
                    inflation which has engulfed us. The 1934 volume adorned with a beautiful buff colored buckram cover
                    and sold for $1.00 has now disintegrated into a black and blue paper-bound edition which
                    shows wear at the spine and corners even before it reaches the book shelf and sells for
                    "$2.50 net."
            
            Those who are not familiar with the story of 
                        Lincoln

                        New Salem
                     from 1831 to 1837 will search in vain for a finer presentation than the monograph by

            Mr. Justice Shiras served on the Supreme Court of the 
                        United States
                     for a little over a decade round the close of the nineteenth century—he was
                    appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican president, Benjamin Harrison, in 1892, and
                    voluntarily stepped down from the Court in 1903. Shiras entered a Court that contained amongst
                    others that venerable titan, Justice Stephen J. Field of 
                        California
                     who had been appointed to the Court by President 
                        Lincoln
                     in the middle of the Civil War; and a year before Shiras retired Oliver Wendell Holmes
                    Jr. was nominated to the Court by President Theodore Roosevelt. Shiras' term on the Court
                    represented a decade in which the foundations were laid for that
                    "businessman's" majority on the Court that was to be dominant right up to
                    the Court Revolution of 1937. In the middle of Shiras' term of office, for example, the
                    Court handed down the important decision in Allgeyer v. 
                        Louisiana
                    
               1 which paved the way for the line of decisions beginning with
                    Lochner v. 
                        New York
                     (Holmes J. dissenting) in 1905 striking down governmental regulation of the economy in
                    the name of substantive due process; the Court also, in the E. C. Knight Case in 1895,2 was able effectively to muzzle the anti-trust forces by its ruling that
                    "manufacture" was not "commerce," and that therefore
                    manufacturing concerns were beyond the ambit of the Sherman Act. It was a period in American history
                    when the rugged individualism of the pioneer and the expansive 
                  
                     1 Allgeyer v. 
                                Louisiana

                     self-interest of commercial enterprise formed a solid block of
                    resistance to incipient collectivist trends, producing, as Holmes himself described it in 1897, a
                    disposition in those who "no longer hope to control the legislatures to look to the courts
                    as expounders of the Constitutions … [I] n some courts new principles have been
                    discovered outside the bodies of those instruments, which may be generalized into acceptance of the
                    economic doctrines which prevailed about fifty years ago, and a wholesale prohibition of what a
                    tribunal of lawyers does not think about right."3
            
            It is easy to see in the judicial opinions of a patriarch like Field, with a varied and exciting
                    professional career in the frontier society of the West Coast as a background to his appointment to
                    the Court, the influence of pioneer notions of individualism and self-help. But Shiras belonged to a
                    later generation of justices, the generation of corporation lawyers; and the temptation is rather
                    strong, especially to critics of the Court around the time of the Court Revolution of 1937, to see
                    in these men's decisions on the Court the rationalizations, conscious or otherwise, of the
                    preferred interests of their former professional clients.
            As a professional lawyer, Shiras is not too readily distinguishable from countless other corporation
                    lawyers of his time. He graduated from Yale College, class of 1853, and thereafter studied briefly
                    at the Yale Law School before electing the more direct method of entry into the legal profession
                    through apprenticeship in a law office. He was admitted to the Allegheny, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , bar in 1855, and began practice in 
                        Pittsburgh
                    , being so successful that by the 1880's his professional income was estimated
                    at $75,000.00 per year. He was even mentioned briefly as a Republican candidate for the
                    Senate in 1881. When Justice Joseph P. Bradley died in 1892, it was accepted that his successor
                    should, like Bradley, come from the third 
                        United States
                     judicial circuit (comprising 
                  New
                        Jersey, Pennsylvania
               , and 
                        Delaware
                    ). Friends of Shiras immediately undertook a campaign in his behalf and began writing to
                    President Harrison. Notable among the Shiras supporters were the members of the Yale class of 1853,
                    a fact which secured for Shiras important bi-partisan support, one of the members being Democratic
                    Senator Randall Lee Gibson of 
                  
                     3 Oliver Wendell Holmes, "The Path of the Law,"

                        Louisiana
                    ; while Andrew Carnegie, an old fishing acquaintance of Shiras, had a long and friendly
                    talk to President Harrison on Shiras' behalf. The only really discordant note seems to have
                    been struck by the Republican party "machine" in 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , whose currently reigning "bosses," Senators James Donald Cameron and
                    Matthew Quay, piqued at President Harrison's rejection of their own
                    "machine" candidate, attempted vainly to assert the principle of senatorial
                    courtesy as a means of blocking confirmation of the Shiras nomination in the Senate.
            It is likely that by virtue of his very "representativeness" and also the absence
                    of any notable color or even eccentricities in his make-up, Shiras would today be substantially
                    forgotten, even by legal historians. What saves him from this fate is the controversy over his role
                    in what Charles Evans Hughes was later to characterize as one of the Supreme Court's
                    "self-inflicted wounds"4—the income tax cases of
                        1895.5 The Supreme Court, at its first consideration of the federal income
                    tax legislation, had announced its invalidation of certain portions only of the legislation,
                    including the tax on rents and income from real estate; at the same time Chief Justice Melville
                    Weston Fuller indicated that the Court was evenly divided (necessarily by a four-four vote, Justice
                    Howell Edmunds 
                        Jackson
                     being absent on account of illness), upon certain other questions, principally the
                    question whether the whole act was void because the tax on income from real estate had been declared
                    invalid (the "severability" issue) and also the question whether the tax on income
                    from personal property was also invalid. The Court directed re-argument on these issues. At the
                    rehearing, Justice 
                        Jackson
                    , now virtually at death's door, managed to fight off the ravages of
                    tuberculosis and dropsy long enough to attend and vote in favor of the legislation. The result was
                    that the remaining portions of the federal income tax legislation were now invalidated also, by a
                    five-to-four vote (Fuller C. J., Field, Gray, Brewer, Shiras, in favor of invalidation; Harlan,
                    White, 
                        Brown
                    , and 
                        Jackson
                     dissenting). On analysis of the vote, it was plainly evident, as a simple matter of
                    mathematics, that one of the original four justices who had at the first hearing

                     voted against invalidation of the balance of the legislation,
                    had now switched his vote so as to favor invalidation. However, since the Court's
                    conferences are held in camera and since Chief Justice Fuller had, for some reason, made no
                    announcement at the first hearing of how the four-four tie was made up, it was impossible to say
                    with any certainty just which judge had now changed his vote. Judges, of course, are technically
                    entitled to change their minds; nevertheless, popular opinion at the time greeted the
                    Court's final decision with extreme bitterness as being an example of a judicial decision
                    dictated by conscious solicitude for the special interests of the privileged and wealthy classes. An
                    indignant public seems immediately to have fastened upon Shiras as the guilty party in the switch of
                    votes, and though Shiras seems to have accepted the public fury and clamor with outward calm, there
                    is little doubt that he felt the charge very deeply. The authors of the present volume advance the
                    thesis at some length that it was not Shiras who switched his vote at all, but some other
                    justice—a conclusion, it should be noted, to which Charles Evans Hughes also seems to
                    have inclined.6
            
            But the evidence seems to be as inconclusive as ever and quite incapable of basing any hard-and-fast
                    proposition as to whether Shiras did change his vote, or whether he did not. What can, however, be
                    said in Shiras' behalf is that there is no justification on the known facts for singling
                    him out in preference to any one of the remaining members of the court majority at the second
                    argument—Chief Justice Fuller, and Justices Field, Gray, and Brewer—as the
                    justice who changed his vote. And this is enough, in passing on the merits of the charge against
                    Shiras, to warrant not merely the somewhat ambiguous Scottish jury verdict of "not
                    proven" but also the more affirmative common law jury formula of "not
                    guilty."

            According to the author, this book, intended for a popular audience, was written "for the
                    purpose of conveying a better knowledge and understanding of our Indians of the United 
                  
                     6 Hughes, The Supreme Court, 54.
               
                     States, to tell of their lives, customs, arts and industries,
                    their psychology and mental reactions, their religious myths, and their legends—in short
                    their human characteristics, and not the shell they assume when in the presence of strange white
                    men."
            Good and bad information is mixed together in such a way that it is difficult to make an overall
                    criticism. The general picture of the American Indian that emerges is pretty orthodox, although
                    there are some passages that will make the professional anthropologist squirm.
            Most of the material in the book has a familiar ring, reflecting standard publications, but no credit
                    is given to major sources. The rather short first chapter, dealing with the origin and racial
                    make-up of the Indian, is the worst. Discredited theories are mixed with generally accepted facts, a
                    few straw men are set up and knocked over, and standard viewpoints are misinterpreted.
            Once the historic horizon is reached, the material becomes much more acceptable.
            In his introduction the author gives a long list of Indian friends who presumably helped him in
                    formulating the book, but in only a few chapters containing personal anecdotes does this help seem
                    apparent. Most of the myths from various tribes are attributed to particular Indians, who are named.
                    In some instances at least, these individuals would seem to have had access to anthropological
                    publications. Compare, for instance, Looks to the Moon's tale of The First Fire, with the
                    myth bearing the same title published in "Myths of the Cherokee, by James Mooney, in the
                        19th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, or Smiling
                    Girl's story of The Origin of the Thunderbird Clan, with the "Origin Myth of the 
                        Winnebago
                    ," published by Paul Radin in the 37th Annual Report. Rarely
                    do myths recounted by different individuals at different periods show such detailed correspondence.
            The last third of the book consists of two parts, a "Glossary of the Principal Tribes now
                    Living in the 
                        United States
                    ," and "Brief Biographies of Famous Indians."
            Both of these sections, alphabetically arranged, are taken almost verbatim from Bulletin 30,
                    "The Handbook of American Indians North of 
                        Mexico
                    ," a few words being changed or transposed as a rule in each item, and some of
                    the longer handbook articles being somewhat condensed. Nevertheless  in his introduction the author states: "in the Glossaries I
                    have given brief condensed descriptions of every existing tribe in the 
                        United States
                     and brief biographical accounts of the majority of Indians of history and fame or who
                    have attained to noteworthy prominence. This never previously has been done, as far as I can
                    ascertain."
            In spite of all this, the general reader will get a pretty accurate picture of the Indian, both
                    aboriginal and acculturated, on reading The Real Americans.
            
            Much of the criticism of the book as a popular account could have easily been eliminated by a
                    paragraph or two in the introduction acknowledging extensive use of published source material and by
                    naming the sources.

                    described the 172 collections in the library at that time. New accessions in the intervening years
                    have increased the holdings to 304 collections, ranging in size from one to about 300 volumes and

                    and adds to it descriptions of all materials acquired since 1942. The descriptions follow the
                    concise form recommended in the tentative rules for cataloguing manuscripts recently issued by the
                    Library of Congress. These rules have been prepared in cooperation with curators of manuscripts from
                    other libraries to provide a uniform system for reporting holdings to the proposed National Register
                    of Manuscripts at the Library of Congress. Each entry carries a description of the types of papers
                    and documents in the collection; a list of writers of letters and  signers of documents in the collection; a reference to the longer descriptions in the first
                    edition of the Guide for collections listed there; biographical data for personal
                    papers; a record of publication of groups of letters or separate pieces from the collection;
                    references to descriptions in sales catalogues; information on provenance when known; and a
                    statement of the size of each collection.
            A feature of the Guide, which will prove of great value to historians, is the Index
                    of some 18,000 names, which lists all writers of letters and authors and signers of documents
                    represented in the manuscript collections. As an aid to identification, birth and death dates are
                    given after each name when known or lacking these a date at which the person was active. Recipients
                    of letters in a number of the collections are listed in a manuscript catalogue in the Clements
                    Library.
            The library's emphasis on the American revolutionary period is well known, but its other
                    areas of collecting are perhaps less generally realized. Its field is Americana. There are no date
                    limits, but few of the manuscripts are before 1700. The collections can be divided geographically
                    into two groups, those of British origin and those of American. The former fall into three
                    divisions: the prerevolutionary collections; the papers of political and military leaders of the
                    Revolutionary War period; and the collections relating to British politics at the turn of the
                    nineteenth century and the War of 1812.
            The collections of American origin complement the British collections for these same periods. In
                    addition the library possesses important concentrations of papers of later date on the genesis of
                    the anti-slavery movement, the history of 
                        Michigan
                    , the Spanish-American War and the emerging imperialism of the 
                        United States
                    , and the collecting of Americana. Hispanic American and Philippine history are also
                    represented. Only the fields of major manuscript strength of the library are indicated here. Many of
                    the smaller collections deal with other periods, and any student of American history may find it
                    well worth his while to consult the index of the Guide for manuscripts of possible
                    interest to him in his own particular area of study.

                     Historical Society, 1953, pp. 567. Illustrations and index. $3.75.)
            This biennial report of the 
                        South Dakota
                     Historical Society consists of five articles and a documentary section devoted to an
                    abstract or digest of Reports of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs from 1815 to 1852. The
                    publication serves as a clearance house for historical material dealing with the Upper 
                        Missouri
                     basin in general and the 
                        South Dakota
                     locale in particular.
            The leading article represents an assembled history of Sanborn County. The account is based mostly on
                    reminiscences and personal accounts that were compiled, collected, and placed in the hands of the
                    Historical Society as a permanent record. The work of assembling, rewriting, and rechecking was
                    performed by Will G. Robinson, the secretary of the society and editor of its publications, with the
                    assistance of several leading citizens of the county. The narrative includes such topics as first
                    settlers and settlements, county seat fights, ghost towns, schools, churches and the usual gamut of
                    frontier experiences ranging from weather to disasters of various sorts. Biographies of leading
                    families are likewise included. Such an account of pioneer times in 
                        South Dakota
                     can be of more than passing interest to readers in Indiana inasmuch as the majority of
                    the early settlers came from the upper 
                        Mississippi
                     Valley and occasionally included Hoosiers.
            Then follow two articles which were prepared as Master's dissertations at the University of 
                        South Dakota
                    . A brief account of steamboat navigation on the 
                        Missouri
                     River by Ralph E. Nichol gives special attention to the impact of the river steamboat
                    upon Yankton, the territorial capital and metropolis. In his history of Fort Sully, Steven Hoekman
                    presents a comprehensive and illuminating study of a frontier military post which existed from 1863
                    to 1894.
            In an article on promoters and promotion literature of Dakota Territory, William H. Russell notes the
                    various efforts exerted by public officials, local newspapers, and other private agencies in the
                    campaign to attract settlers to the Dakotas. The author emphasizes the work of the territorial
                    immigration office but apparently is not familiar with a fairly complete  study of the official immigration activities of Dakota Territory
                    published two decades ago.
            A lengthy ethnological study of the Siouan Indians by W. E. Sanders under the title, "Trail
                    of the Ancient Sioux" leaves this reviewer somewhat perplexed. The author undertakes to
                    examine the archaeological and anthropological records for the different areas inhabited by
                    forty-seven divisions of Siouan stock to find common features or similarities in their culture
                    patterns apart from their community of language traits. The disciplines of history and sociology are
                    also heavily drawn upon for illustrative materials. This might just as well be called a study of
                    North American Indians frequenting a distinct geographical region extending from the Great Plains to 
                        North Carolina
                     and from the Gulf coast to the 
                        Ohio
                     and Upper 
                        Mississippi
                     Valleys. Much of the material presented does not seem relevant to the author's
                    purpose. The ceremonials, the social organizations and mores, as well as the economy pattern, are
                    not necessarily peculiar to the ethnic groups reviewed. The inclusion of so much irrelevant material
                    produces the effect of disunity rather than the unity he seeks to establish. The author, however, is
                    to be commended for his extensive exploration into the field. He has steeped himself in the
                    published literature but has permitted himself to become lost in the process of selecting and
                    organizing his data and consequently fails to make his thesis convincing.

               The Rise of Methodism: A Source Book. By Richard M. Cameron. (
                        New York
                    : Philosophical Library, 1954, pp. xv, 397. Index. $4.75.)
            This source book provides the layman with a substantial introduction to the early thinking of Wesley
                    and other Methodist Church fathers. It is characterized best as a warm and intensely human
                    work—no small task for a source book. Wesley comes alive through these expertly chosen
                    pieces of his writing. The editor's selections give Wesley's family background,
                    his early soul-searching, and conclude with the meeting of the first Conference. All is tied
                    together with an unobtrusive editorial text.
            
            Wesley's ancestors were noteworthy for their dissenting views and intellectual independence;
                    however, they remain remote to the reader. His immediate family, on the other hand, is pictured
                    vividly. One shares the family troubles of disastrous fires and annoying
                    ghosts—Wesley's youthful environment becomes quite real.
            Well-selected documents tell the story of Wesley's activities in the Holy Club. This
                    organization's emphasis on the hard and regular life is related clearly to
                    Wesley's spiritual growth, and the anxiety to save his soul which he felt at this time took
                    him to the missionary field of 
                        Georgia
                    . His experiences there are extensively documented and are interesting for the colorful
                    lights they throw on Wesley in a nonreligious context.
            Documents demonstrate the influence of Bohler and Whitefield on the religious thinking of Wesley and
                    also detail the climax of his religious experience in the "strange heartwarming"
                    in the Aldersgate Chapel. By 1739 Wesley was trying eagerly to give all Englishmen his glowing
                    knowledge of personal salvation. This large task created the need for field preaching and lay
                    preachers, which Wesley accepted as undesirable, but necessary, innovations. Whereas in 1739
                    Wesley's work was still revival in form, by 1741 his United Societies were taking shape and
                    gradually separating the Wesleyan movement from others of the period.
            By 1745 this separation was complete, and Methodism's basic form had been set. Wesley had
                    achieved a spiritual revival combined with a reform program in a superb organizational frame. The
                    organizational forms—the band, the class, the conference—assured
                    Wesley's control and influence in the early formative years of Methodism.
            Printing costs, no doubt, are responsible for the grouping of the footnotes at the end of the book.
                    This will not be a serious fault to the layman who will read this work, but it is to be regretted by
                    all that the scope of the book is so limited. Few documents are included which present insights into
                    the social and intellectual ferment of eighteenth-century 
                        England
                    . Methodism and Wesley's personal development can only be understood in terms
                    of these conditions. Nevertheless, the book is of value for its concise reporting by Wesley of his
                    early views.

               War Labor Boards in the Field. By Allan R. Richards. Volume 35, James Sprunt Studies in History and Political Science. (
                        Chapel Hill
                    : University of 
                        North Carolina
                     Press, 1953, pp. vii, 281. Index. $1.25.)
            With a national board located in 
                        Washington
                     and twelve regional boards distributed throughout the country, charged with
                    responsibility for wage stabilization and the task of preventing work stoppages in essential
                    industries, the War Labor Board was one of the most important of the numerous wartime governmental
                    agencies. From January 12, 1942, to August 18, 1945, the National War Labor Board and its field
                    agencies decided 17,650 dispute cases that other agencies had failed to settle and terminated
                    436,894 voluntary wage adjustment cases. That the national board handled less than .005 per cent of
                    the latter cases is adequate indication of the importance of the regional boards.
            The present volume does not profess to be a history of the Regional War Labor Boards. It is, rather,
                    a study of their administrative policies and problems, and is designed to fill a reported gap in the
                    literature of governmental administration. The "literature on top-level administration
                    outnumbers the literature on field administration by at least twenty to one," and this
                    book, begun as a doctoral dissertation, is an attempt partially to alleviate that discrepancy.
            The author finds much to criticize about the organization and procedure of the War Labor Board. Most
                    serious, perhaps, is the charge that the nature of the national board's orders and
                    directives put the regional boards "in a position of responsibility without
                    authority." Throughout the volume evidence is plentiful that the national board was
                    extremely reluctant to spell out its policies in definite and clear-cut terms. Although refusing to
                    accept the idea that each case should be judged on its own merits, the national board maintained
                    that no formula adequate for all cases could be devised. Regional boards frequently were criticized
                    for taking unauthorized action, but their requests for more definite instructions seldom were
                    heeded. The result was a considerable amount of grumbling, groping, and bungling.
            The mountainous records of the War Labor Board, most of which are housed in the National Archives,
                    would discourage any but the most determined of researchers, but  the more than 1100 footnotes contained in this 271-page monograph indicate that the author has
                    worked them carefully. In several respects, however, the result of this prodigious amount of work is
                    disappointing. Because the text is broken up into 230 sections, ranging in length from three lines
                    to eight pages, the reader seldom gets the feel of a topic before it is abruptly broken off and
                    another one is begun. The volume abounds in statements that might variously be described as obvious,
                    contradictory, and redundant. For example, the following sentences seem to assert the obvious:
                    "Effective policy effectively administered yields good administration."
                    "The ability of a field office to act within the scope of the agency program depends upon
                    its ability to understand that program." Some examples of contradictory statements are:
                    "Every regional board used part-time members to represent all three
                    groups—labor, industry, public. The sole exception was RWLB VI in 
                        Chicago
                    ." "When an analyst opened a case folder, his first concern was that
                    the application was properly filled out." And in the same paragraph: "By the time
                    a case reached an analyst, [it] had been previously checked for accuracy and completeness."
                    Finally, too many short, choppy sentences and a lack of variety in sentence structure greatly reduce
                    the readability of the book.
            Despite the defects which have been noted, War Labor Boards in the Field may
                    properly be described as a useful contribution to the literature on governmental administration. The
                    development of the War Labor Board from inception to termination is minutely traced. The many
                    problems, both procedural and substantive, which it faced and the changes made to meet those
                    problems are discussed in detail. Some of these problems were: (1) what standards would best
                    maintain central control and allow regional discretion at the same time? (2) To what extent should
                    the regional boards be allowed to operate independently? (3) Did the tripartite structure of boards
                    adequately protect the interests of the public? (4) What was the best way to secure sufficient wage
                    data upon which to base wage stabilization decisions? (5) How could contradictory authority and
                    overlapping jurisdiction be eliminated? (6) How specific and unyielding should be the instructions
                    of the national board to regional boards? Few of these problems ever were completely solved.
            The bringing to light of these problems together with the 
                    various procedures devised to cope with them, although of somewhat limited value to the historian,
                    should be of particular interest to the administrator who may be confronted with similar problems.
