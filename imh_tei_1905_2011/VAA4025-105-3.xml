                         late nineteenth-century historian Frederick Jackson Turner.
                         Turner&apos;s so-called &quot;frontier thesis&quot; had
                         convinced generations of readers of the signal importance of an American
                         frontier that evolved inevitably from wilderness to farmland to small towns
                         and finally great cities--an idealized sequence that already seemed to
                         some, by 1959, the relic of another time. In the intervening years,
                         historians had largely given up on the task of searching for the origins of
                         a singular American cultural character, and they had grown to expect
                         greater precision--in the research sources available to them and in the
                         kinds of conclusions that those sources might reasonably yield--than that
                         which had sufficed for Turner&apos;s generation.</p>
                    <p>Other things had changed, too, in the decades since Turner explained the
                         &quot;Significance of the Frontier&quot; to the historians gathered
                         at the World&apos;s Columbian Exposition in <placeName>

                         most part, in or around cities--and not just along the eastern seaboard.
                         Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., himself a child of the Old Northwest, had
                         understood the implications of this change for the historical record a
                         generation earlier. His <hi rend="i">The Rise of the City,
                         1878-1898</hi>, which appeared in 1933, made a plausible claim for an
                         equally important urban strain of American behavior and ideals. Richard

                         demands revision? How has our understanding of the histories of these sites
                         changed since Wade&apos;s book was published, and how much did his work
                         help to set that understanding in place? What questions remain for future

                         would serve as the subject of an <hi rend="i">IMH</hi> discussion. He
                         recalled with fondness his time spent working on Robert E

                         encompassed five cities and the examination of forty to fifty years of
                         local newspapers, municipal records, and other primary materials. As if
                         unraveling the economic and geographical roles of five cities were not
                         enough, Wade also wrote on everything from municipal governments&apos;
                         structures and their evolving responsibilities to racial relations,
                         cultural activities, and emerging social configurations. He presented a
                         story of a rapidly developing and surprisingly sophisticated urban life on
                         the frontier despite the towns&apos; small populations and relatively
                         brief existences. In this narrative, citizens ambitiously pursued the
                         myriad high-risk economic opportunities of these newly developing regions,
                         while (in another challenge to Turnerian interpretations) they
                         simultaneously emulated older eastern cities by bringing

                         audience, and although he based his book on newspapers, manuscripts, and
                         other primary sources, he admittedly emphasized &quot;feeling, drama,
                         and atmosphere rather than textbook completeness.&quot;<hi rend="sup"

                         generation of historians, he produced a book more in the style of older
                         city biographies than the interpretive scholarly studies of cities which
                         came after Wade.</p>

                         Despite being impressed with the city&apos;s growth of manufacturing,
                         Reiser spent most of her book carefully describing transportation
                         improvements, the emergence of commission merchants and marketing, and
                         developing efforts at eco- nomic organization. Further, her analysis
                         involved the evolution of a prodigious trade in goods, largely unrelated to
                         local manufactures, with points on the East Coast and in the <geogName

                         histories and a smattering of essays and research notes (often written by
                         history buffs), Wade had only Baldwin&apos;s and Reiser&apos;s
                         works, and a handful of graduate theses and articles, on which to draw. On
                         eco- nomic matters, he referenced Reiser several times, but clearly he pre-
                         ferred to depend on his own research. There is no evidence that he used

                         Between 1790 and the end of the War of 1812, the city provisioned federal
                         troops, marketed regional products, and outfitted migrants exhausted from
                         their arduous, trans-mountain journey and preparing to embark on the

                         countryside and goods imported from eastern merchants, such as
                         cloth, spices, tea, and coffee. With the expansion of settlement in the
                         <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName> Valley during these early years, the demand for eastern goods rose,
                         requiring the services of middlemen or commission merchants to handle the
                         growing volume of trade at this transshipment point from overland to
                         river transportation. Reiser found evidence that

                         first commission merchant may have dated to 1805; by 1815 twenty commission
                         merchants appeared in a local directory along with ninety-three other
                         merchants and twenty-one storekeepers.<hi rend="sup">13</hi></p>

                         tradesmen produced goods on a small scale for food, shelter, clothing, and
                         transportation needs. They recognized that the mountains added a
                         transportation premium on the cost of eastern goods, some of which could be
                         locally manufactured more cheaply and profitably. The distinction between
                         retail stores and artisan shops is unclear in the documentary record and
                         functionally blurred in practice. Boot- and shoemakers, tanners, tailors,
                         weavers, and blacksmiths, some with shops separate from their residences,
                         joined boat builders, wagonmakers, saddlers, and others vital to
                         transportation to make Pittsburgh a city full of busy work- shops. Wade and
                         later historians particularly noted the nascent iron foundries and rolling
                         mills, glassworks, naileries, textile mills, and steam engine
                         manufactories, which are distinctive from the typical array of processors,

                                   commission merchant as follows: &quot;When trade was in its
                                   infancy, there was no need for commission merchants because the
                                   business was too small to support a middleman. As business
                                   expanded and goods were sent on longer journeys and in greater
                                   amounts, one man found that he could make a living by
                                   distributing goods for merchants and manufacturers&quot; (p.
                                   134). The commission merchant placed goods on appropriate boats,
                                   held auctions, and ran a warehouse.</item>

                         , especially during the war, greatly
                         stimulated these manufacturers, surveys of the city&apos;s
                         manufacturing in the 1810s placed iron and glass among the leading
                         industries. Wade described these industrial developments and argued that by
                         1815 <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         had turned its business emphasis to manufacturing. Like
                         other western towns, he asserted, its &quot;direction of growth . . .
                         had been pretty well set.&quot;<hi rend="sup">14</hi></p>
                    <p>Nearly all young, ambitious American cities of this period dreamed of
                         commercial greatness and engaged in rivalries for regional and long-
                         distance trade. One might wonder, then, why Wade lost sight of the extent
                         of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>&apos;s commercial aspirations and emphasized the manu-
                         facturing activities of a town self-designated as the gateway to the West.
                         To be sure, Wade grounded his interpretation on the impressive extent of
                         the city&apos;s manufacturing. In 1815, for example, the city directory
                         reported 1,960 persons (out of a total population of between 8,000 and
                         9,000) employed in industrial activities. He duly noted contemporary
                         descriptions such as an 1810 characterization of the city as &quot;a
                         large workshop&quot; or John Melish&apos;s comment that
                         &quot;in the course of my walks through the streets I heard everywhere
                         the sound of the hammer and the anvil.&quot; He gleaned other
                         contemporary references to its being called the 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7010955" reg="Birmingham">Birmingham</settlement></placeName> of

                         already displaying a smoky, dirty atmosphere.<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
                         Moreover, Wade, like Reiser a decade earlier, noted that some Pittsburghers
                         in these initial years of the century believed that manufacturing was the
                         city&apos;s path to increased trade and prosperity.<hi rend="sup"
                              >16</hi> In this vein, he pointed to the dependence of early
                         manufacturers on the capital of merchants and to the mixing of these roles,
                         as a few merchants also started manufacturing enterprises.</p>
                    <p>In many frontier cities, merchants who accumulated capital from their trading
                         activities often purchased real estate in or around the city and farm
                         acreage in the hinterland. Land was a familiar investment for early
                         Americans, who found it a more attractive and stable investment than
                         manufacturing. Wade, however, proposed that the poor, already- <list

                                   influenced by, or accepted, this view as he began to research

                         Valley
                         towns did. Accordingly, he reasoned that manufacturing would have been an
                         attractive alternative investment for <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         merchants. An examination
                         of the city&apos;s elites, however, throws doubt on Wade&apos;s
                         speculation. Lingering Indian hostilities and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName>
                         land policy had
                         delayed settlement of the lands north of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         so that opportunities
                         for speculation certainly existed. More importantly, like members of their
                         class elsewhere in the nation, many of the city&apos;s wealthy,
                         including, for example, James O&apos;Hara, John Ormsby, John Herron,
                         and John McClure, added investments in urban land and farms about the
                         region to their commercial portfolios.<hi rend="sup">17</hi> They also fre-
                         quently invested in manufacturing, perhaps to a greater extent than their
                         downriver peers. A scarcity of opportunities for real estate speculation
                         does not seem to be a likely explanation for the merchants&apos;
                         financial support of local manufacturers.</p>

                         &apos;s
                         manufacturing activity further convinced Wade of the city&apos;s
                         distinctive economy. When the War of 1812 ended, British merchants flooded
                         American markets with manufactured goods. 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         felt the impact almost
                         immediately--before the other <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName> Valley cities--and the depression that
                         enveloped the national economy worsened the city&apos;s plight. By
                         1819, both industrial employment and the value of production declined to
                         approximately one-third of their 1815 peaks. The 1820 census recorded a
                         population decrease in the city during these hard times. Pittsburghers
                         commented on the closed factories, empty houses, eerie silences, and less
                         smoky skies about the town. Further, Wade observed, 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         took longer
                         to recover from the depression than did its peers, not reaching former
                         economic levels until the middle of the 1820s. While manufacturing and
                         commerce were flourishing a few years later, the 1830 census showed that
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         had surpassed <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         in population. In Wade&apos;s view,

                         &apos;s extensive
                         commerce, he included packed meat as its &quot;central export
                         item&quot; and reported that the city had already become known as
                         &quot;Porkopolis.&quot; He appeared not to have considered meat
                         packing as a manufacturing activity, although most historians include
                         agricultural processing as part of a city&apos;s manufacturing
                         complex. Like

                         the constant bellowing of their raw material, odiferous operations, and
                         stream-fouling wastes, but they also spawned substantial linked manu-
                         facturing (such as coopering) and by-product firms turning out brushes,
                         combs, buttons, and a host of other goods. Viewed in this light,

                         Secondly, Wade may have adopted a retrospective view of the Iron City.
                         Given the unprecedented expansion and transformation of the iron and
                         steel industry only a few decades after 1830, both amateur and academic
                         historians (including Reiser) have concluded that 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         was destined
                         from its beginnings to become the Steel City. With iron ore available in
                         the <geogName key="tgn_7020004" reg="Allegheny Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</geogName>, an abundance of coal nearby in the southwestern
                         corner of the state, and access to the rivers, the small iron foundries and
                         rolling mills of these initial decades were the precursors of the massive
                         iron and steel industry of the future, and could be seen, therefore, as
                         evidence of its destiny as a great industrial city. Few have resisted the
                         temptation to interpret the early city in light of its spectacular
                         industrial development at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

                         prosperous future. The spirit of urban imperialism infused the

                         development in the western country spurred the city&apos;s middleman
                         trade. As Reiser points out, the earliest efforts at economic organization
                         strove to enhance trade by expanding and stabilizing the export markets for
                         the region&apos;s agricultural and manufacturing products.<hi

                    <p>The war&apos;s stimulus to manufacturing and its dramatic decline after
                         the war set up the 1820s as a critical decade for determining which type of
                         economic activity would drive the city&apos;s recovery from depression.
                         The close relationship of merchants and manufacturers, however, when
                         combined with the unevenness of economic data, cloud the picture of the
                         recovery process. Reiser, Wade, and Ingham all believed that manu-
                         facturing recovered more quickly than trade and that by mid-decade it had
                         become the leading activity. The transport and sale of the city&apos;s

                         bear fruit. By ending his study in 1830, Wade did not track the full
                         revival of the western trade during the rest of the decade. Steamboats
                         facilitated that revival throughout the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName> Valley; by making upriver

                         as
                         the most eastern, upstream port. The improved overland routes to the East
                         became quite busy, but it was the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710" reg="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</region></placeName>
                         Main Line Canal that had the
                         greatest impact on the western trade. The city became a depot for western
                         agricultural products and &quot;southern groceries&quot; such as
                         sugar, tea, spices, and coffee, while the re-export of eastern
                         merchandise and &quot;freight&quot; joined with
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s iron products, glasswares, hardware, and machinery to
                         dominate the downriver trade. By 1836 the estimated value of trade doubled
                         that for manufacturing. Reiser claimed that there were sixty to eighty
                         wholesale establishments in the 1830s, the successors to the commission
                         merchants. As Baldwin wrote, &quot;Before many years an increasing
                         share of the intersectional commerce began to find its way back through
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         in order to utilize its improving transportation
                              facilities.&quot;<hi rend="sup">25</hi></p>
                    <p>Manufacturing also continued to expand well into the 1830s, and the merchants
                         did not lose sight of its importance for their trade and as a source of
                         profit. Indeed, commerce and manufacturing always went hand-in-hand in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         . The merchants&apos; development of markets and capital was
                         critical to the rise of manufacturing. The mutual economic interests of
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s merchants and manufacturers eased the flow of
                         merchant capital into manufacturing. Wade and the other historians point
                         to, for example, the investments of wealthy merchants Joseph McClurg and
                         James O&apos;Hara in the city&apos;s first iron foundry and glass
                         works, respectively. The growth of manufacturing, especially iron prod-
                         ucts, in the 1820s and 1830s required considerable capital that the mer-
                         chant community largely provided. The lack of surviving company records for
                         the period makes it impossible to gauge the level of merchant support, but
                         in summarizing scholarship on antebellum iron manufacturing, Ingham

                         during the initial third
                         of the century leaves open to interpretation the question raised in this
                         essay. Wade and other historians assume that the city&apos;s manufac-
                         turing greatness was set in the second and third decades of the nine-
                         teenth century. Wade concludes that manufacturing had become

                         leading economic force by 1815. Henceforth, it was a
                         manufacturing city and commerce was subordinate. Merchants, however,
                         remained in power into the 1830s, increasingly sharing their leadership
                         with manufacturers with whom they were closely associated both eco-
                         nomically and socially, apparently without antipathy. The political strug-
                         gle of the anti-Masons in the early 1830s was more the result of the older
                         generation trying to hold onto leadership than of an explicit division
                         between manufacturers and merchants.<hi rend="sup">29</hi> The merchants

                         and enjoyed the fruits of their labors until the onset of the 1839

                         Moreover, critical changes in the market for iron goods, in particular the
                         burgeoning appetite for railroad rails and the demands of the Civil War,
                         presented excellent opportunities for <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>

                         businessmen, including merchants like Benjamin E Jones and James Laughlin
                         and railroaders like Andrew Carnegie, pursued the new industrial horizon
                         with astonishing success.</p>
                    <p>Wade aptly recognized most of the merchants&apos; relationships to
                         manufacturing and placed these commercial men at the top of the social
                         hierarchy. However, by ending his study on a census year instead of on the
                         more natural economic moment of the depression in 1839--when an expansion
                         of fifteen or more years came to an end--Wade missed the revival of
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>&apos;s
                         western trade and, like others before and after him,
                         stressed the more robust manufacturing sector in the initial years of
                         recovery in the 1820s. Additionally, this perspective allowed little con-
                         text to understand fully the merchants&apos; transportation strategy
                         and its consequences. Without studying the composition of the
                         city&apos;s political leadership, he could not evaluate the continued
                         power of the merchants in the face of manufacturing&apos;s
                         &quot;challenge&quot; to commerce. Wade&apos;s interpretation
                         of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013927" reg="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</settlement></placeName>
                         as a manufacturing city since the second decade of the
                         century, in fact since 1815, is convenient and compatible with later
                         developments. But it deflects our attention away from the central, driv-
                         ing motivation of the city until the 1840s, and in so doing might well
                         miscast our view of its social and political life.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">W</hi>hile perhaps not as famous as &quot;Call me
                         Ishmael,&quot; a memorable line opens Richard C. Wade&apos;s
                         seminal work: &quot;The towns were the spearheads of the
                         frontier.&quot; That simple declarative sentence threw into question
                         everything historians thought they knew about how the frontier worked.
                         Frederick Jackson Turner&apos;s conception of the frontier, so central
                         to how Americans thought of themselves and their nation&apos;s his-
                         tory, was clearly flawed. Rarely does a single book so quickly and thor-
                         oughly change the way historians think. The book&apos;s influence
                         derived from two factors: Wade&apos;s evidence, so powerful and
                         abundant that his radical declaration seemed incontrovertible; and
                         Wade&apos;s straightforward writing, as evidenced by the appearance of
                         his thesis in the very first sentence, which made everything he wrote seem
                         matter-of-fact.</p>
                    <p>I first read this opening sentence--and all those that followed it--thirty
                         years after Wade had written <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi>. I was as
                         taken by the book as previous generations of historians had been. I found
                         it so revelatory that I even remember where I was while reading it. The
                         book introduced me to urban history, and it introduced me as well to one of
                         the founding tenets of the field: cities have been integral to the develop-
                         ment of this nation, even in its earliest decades and even on its
                         frontiers.</p>
                    <p>Undoubtedly one of the reasons that Wade&apos;s work so struck me was its
                         attention to my hometown,

                         I felt rather pleased. Having grown up in a shrinking city whose
                         politicians and boosters increasingly found it necessary to defend
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         as a bona fide urban center, as a place that still mattered, I
                         found it refreshing to come upon a book that set out to prove that
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         counted as a city. To support his thesis regarding the
                         centrality of cities on the frontier, Wade gathered every bit of evidence
                         that might be mustered in support of the idea that even infant 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         was urban. According to <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi>, by 1830
                         Cincinnatians had built a 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Queen City</settlement></placeName>

                         ing economy and a rich, urbane culture.</p>
                    <p>But there is a problem, and not a small one. If 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         was clearly a
                         city forty years after its founding, it was not one when Matthias Denman
                         and a group of other investors commenced their settlement, initially called
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Losantiville</settlement></placeName>
                         , in 1788. Denman founded what he hoped would become a
                         city--laying out and naming streets, hammering stakes in the ground,
                         sending new maps to the printers, placing advertisements back East--but
                         declaring that a city exists does not make it so. Wade knew this, and he
                         devoted the bulk of <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi> to attempting to
                         convince readers that the five aspiring cities he studied, including
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>, were in fact urban.</p>

                         <p>The kind of evidence that Wade gathered and the manner in which he
                              categorized it tell us a great deal about how he, and many other his-
                              torians of his era, thought about cities. Curiously, economics play a
                              relatively insignificant role in the discussion. Chapter 2 describes
                              the &quot;economic base&quot; of the city, focusing on river
                              travel and trade, and on the development of 
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>

                              city&apos;s role in the development of the frontier. Agriculture

                              in the countryside. This was an era when economic activity was
                              remarkably diffuse, in even the most urbanized regions, let alone on
                              the frontier.</p>

                              fill <pb n="222" id="VAA4025-105-3-030"/> with villages. Denman hoped
                              that his village would be among those that thrived, although most

                              founded by John Cleves Symmes, who had purchased a million

                              sites, understood the importance of villages to an agricultural
                              society. Driven by the profit motive, these men also understood that
                              rapidly growing towns were the best places to make a fortune, because
                              such sites allowed them to sell their land in many smaller parcels at
                              considerably higher prices.</p>
                         <p>Wade was unconcerned with <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              &apos;s wider economic connec-

                              more distant ports. His approach ignored the rural hinterlands and
                              thus heightened his assertion that these cities grew in a western
                              wilderness. An analysis of the city-country relationship on the
                              frontier awaited the attention of William Cronon, whose <hi rend="i"
                                   >Nature&apos;s Metropolis: <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                                   and the Great West</hi>
                              (1990) goes beyond Wade&apos;s argument to reveal precisely how
                              cities were essential to the frontier process, following all those
                              economic connections that Wade so scrupulously avoided. Interestingly,
                              although he plowed in fields cleared by Wade thirty years earlier,
                              Cronon says essentially nothing about <hi rend="i">The Urban
                                   Frontier</hi>, instead taking on Turner&apos;s frontier
                              thesis, which had survived multiple historiographical blows over the
                              years. Like Wade, Cronon argues that frontier history makes no sense
                              without a discussion of cities, but unlike Wade, he makes his argument
                              by imbedding the city in the process of regional growth. Here the ties
                              between city and country--most of them economic--become critical to
                              understanding how the frontier developed over time and how 
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                              became the metropolis of the Midwest. Ironically, Wade had included in
                              his book a wonderful quote from <hi rend="i">Pictures of
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              </hi> (1815) by early booster and polymath Daniel
                              Drake, who anticipated Cronon&apos;s argument. &quot;The <hi

                         <p>Since Wade&apos;s economic evidence in support of urbanism was not
                              especially strong, he needed another approach. After a brief
                              discussion of charters and the legal foundation of frontier cities and
                              their states, Wade begins a long description of the
                              &quot;Emergence of Urban Problems.&quot; These were mostly
                              problems of governance, related to the lack of municipal authority.
                              Here we find out that as late as 1815 
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              had no paved roads,
                              and that people complained of pigs and manure in the streets.
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              lacked a night patrol until after 1825, and street light-
                              ing was haphazard. Residents used outhouses, with private vaults stor-
                              ing human waste throughout the community. Wade&apos;s larger point
                              is that cities only slowly gained the municipal authority to solve the
                              problems of urban growth, but at the same time he reminds us just how
                              similar these places remained to the many smaller communities in their
                              hinterlands. Unpaved roads and wandering pigs were not specifically
                              urban problems, obviously. In fact, during this long discussion, the
                              reader might begin to wonder what constitutes a city.</p>
                         <p>But then in a separate chapter Wade treats the most familiar urban
                              problem--the growing differentiation of the population and the devel-
                              opment of what Drake euphemistically called &quot;moral

                              gambling, and prostitution clustered near the waterfront. Surely these
                              particular social wills were evidence of urbanity.</p>
                         <p>Wade&apos;s discussion of an expanding population of dependent poor
                              and the growth of vice are just prelude to his presentation of his
                              favored evidence of urbanity. Frontier cities were urban, he writes,
                              because they served as cultural centers. In a chapter entitled
                              &quot;The Better Life,&quot; Wade describes the myriad ways in
                              which every one of his frontier cities made tentative progress in its
                              cultural development. Wade tells us about the- aters and night patrols
                              and fire departments. <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>

                              best in the region. There were churches, museums, libraries, and, that
                              most urban institution of all, newspapers. By 1820,

                              same year, Drake founded his Western Museum, which he hoped would
                              advance scientific understanding in his city. Poor support for the
                              museum led to its intellectual deterioration, Wade tells us, as it
                              added &quot;oddities, freaks, and wax models to meet the competi-
                              tion of a neighboring commercial museum.&quot; Indeed, as he
                              describes many of the city&apos;s early cultural offerings, Wade
                              reveals just how much

                              must have felt like an outpost, far
                              removed from the cultural centers of the East. The city had theater,
                              but one newspaper noted that in 1827 support for drama was so slim
                              that &quot;last winter and spring the Players absolutely
                              starved.&quot; Some of the harshest criticism came from
                              Englishwoman Frances Trollope, whose observations of her (briefly)
                              adopted home consistently called into question the 
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Queen City</settlement></placeName>&apos;s
                              urbanity. The consummate snob, Trollope complained
                              of the theater, where &quot; [m]en came into the lower tier of
                              boxes without coats, and I have seen shirt sleeves tucked up to the
                              shoulder.&quot; Worse yet, &quot;the spitting was
                              incessant,&quot; and &quot;the mixed smell of onions and
                              whisky&quot; made the crowd nearly unbearable. We do not need
                              Trollope to confirm that

                              adds weight to his argument concerning the urban frontier, but

                              &apos;s cultural evolution may not tell us
                              enough about the growth of the city overall. Indeed, the easiest way
                              to describe a city is with population figures. In 1810, twenty-two
                              years after its founding, Cincinnati had a population of just over
                              2,500, the threshold figure that the Census Bureau has long used to
                              define an urban place. At that point, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>

                              largest city--contained just a little more than 1 percent of the
                              state&apos;s population. It was the 46th largest city in the
                              nation, and just 3 percent of the size of the largest,

                              Even after another twenty years of growth,

                              none of whom lived in a community larger than 2,500. Figures like
                              these might make us wonder about Wade&apos;s assertion that
                              &quot;towns were the spearheads of the frontier.&quot;</p>
                         <p>To truly understand the urban frontier, however, we must move beyond the
                              numbers and consider how migrants and travelers perceived these young
                              midwestern cities in their settings. Early settlers might well have
                              thought of the cluster of wooden buildings around Fort Washington as
                              the seat of civilization in the Northwest Territory. After days of
                              drifting down the river, seeing little more than occasional curls of
                              smoke, travelers knew instantly that even nascent 
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName> was very
                              different from what surrounded it. As early as 1797, one observer
                              called it &quot;the metropolis of the north-western
                              territory.&quot; At the time, the community had fewer than 750
                              residents. Only on the frontier might a <pb n="226"
                                   id="VAA4025-105-3-034"/> village of 750 serve as a metropolis. By
                              the 1820s, travelers regularly expressed surprise at what they saw as
                              they rounded the river&apos;s bend: church spires and brick
                              buildings; civilization&apos;s redoubt. Even if most streets were
                              unpaved, they were at least straight, a sure sign of urbanity in a
                              wilderness of meandering roadways and river ways. Only on the frontier
                              might a town of fewer than 25,000 residents pass for a Queen City.
                              This is why we need to understand <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              &apos;s hinterland of
                              farms and forests to understand the city itself.</p>

                              Ohio Territory. Wade might also have included

                              which did not grow as quickly but became the
                              state&apos;s first capital in 1803. It seems unlikely that a

                              Turner had shortchanged cities in his depiction of the frontier. Wade
                              chose instead to study only settlements that grew into substantial
                              cities. Villages that failed to thrive, like <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2081074" reg="North Bend">North Bend</settlement></placeName>

                              continued to grow along with its region for 150 years,
                              eventually developing into a city of 500,000 people by the
                              mid-1900s. In the early 1800s, settlers and speculators peered into
                              the future with remarkably strong expectations of growth. Their blend
                              of wishful thinking and reasonable expectation helps to explain why
                              even small settlements took on the air of urbanity on the frontier.
                              The expectation and anticipation of change were essential parts of
                              frontier culture, in aspiring cities and on recently cleared fields.
                              Wade exploited these expectations of growth in his attack on
                              Turner&apos;s teleological portrait of the frontier--an inevitable
                              sequence <pb n="227" id="VAA4025-105-3-035"/> of stages of
                              development, progressing from natives, hunters, and trappers to
                              extensive farming, then intensive farming, and finally urban growth.
                              Ironically, Wade&apos;s own teleology turned Turner around,
                              putting cities first and treating all speculative town sites as though
                              they possessed the potential to become substantial cities.</p>
                         <p>Despite the problem of teleology, Wade&apos;s book has remained
                              interpretively sound for fifty years. Modern readers might wish that
                              he had said more about Native Americans and women, especially, but his
                              prose remains remarkably fresh after all these years. One must
                              conclude that Wade&apos;s work remains so alive mostly because he
                              was right. By 1830, as Wade concluded, the rise of these five cities
                              &quot;had driven a broad wedge of urbanism into Western
                              life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi> By then, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>

                         <p>Curiously, Wade&apos;s book did not inspire a spate of work on

                              although Aaron had completed the work in 1942, well before Wade began
                                   <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi>. Aaron&apos;s
                              dissertation shared important commonalities with Wade&apos;s,
                              suggesting that the time was right for a reversal of Turner&apos;s
                              conception of the frontier. In search of urban culture on the frontier
                              of the early 1800s, Aaron determined that &quot;all roads seemed
                              to point to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>

                              Valley.&quot; Unlike Wade, Aaron took on Turner directly and
                              openly, noting that erroneous clichés had been attached to frontier
                              settlers, clichés that emphasized Turner&apos;s beloved
                              &quot;individualism, enterprise, egalitarianism,
                              self-confidence, and a variety of other absolutes,&quot; as Aaron
                              summarized them. Like Wade, Aaron looked to culture to describe
                              &quot;the urban West,&quot; which he likened to
                              &quot;urban islands in a sea of wilderness.&quot;

                              historians have

                              the course of thirty-some years, Miller directed a host of
                              dissertations, most of them on the twentieth century, and many of them

                              Following Miller&apos;s lead, most of his students exhibited deep
                              interest in shifting ideas about the city, especially as expressed in
                              how Cincinnatians planned for the future. Wade&apos;s influence in

                              argument as a given. The book begins in 1802, and in Taylor&apos;s
                              depiction <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              appears to be a city already, born with the
                              original sins of its mixed parentage--a racial code reflective of the
                              South, the racial segregation common of the North, and the violence
                              one would expect to find in the West. The urban qualities in
                              Taylor&apos;s <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              are very similar to Wade&apos;s. It
                              has an increasingly diverse population and the concomitant conflict.
                              Like Wade, Taylor searches for success in the growth of cultural
                              institutions, especially churches and schools. Taylor&apos;s and
                              Wade&apos;s books, written nearly fifty years apart, have so much
                              in common that we are reminded of just how prescient Wade really was.

                         <p>Taylor&apos;s book may also point to an agenda for the future:
                              historians should investigate the mixed parentage of the young
                              <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              . In what way was <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              a southern city when most of
                              its residents came from the mid-Atlantic? How was it a northern city
                              at the same time, when it so clearly looked south for profit and west
                              to its future? How long could <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                              remain western as it watched
                              the frontier move farther and farther away? Most important: how did
                              all these connections to places distant--and the many more connections
                              that tied the young city to the Miami and <geogName key="tgn_2587801" reg="Pleasant Valley">Licking</geogName> valleys--make

                              This agenda replicates Turner&apos;s professional trajectory from
                              the study of the frontier to the issue of regions in American history,
                              but it is also represents a logical next step--a very tardy next
                              step--leading from Wade&apos;s groundbreaking work. Wade put
                              cities on the frontier, where they belonged. Historians must now tell
                              us more about how young cities like Cincinnati helped create the
                              regions in which they grew.</p>

                         in particular--in light of that personal
                         journey.</p>
                    <p>My intellectual introduction to Wade occurred during 1968-1970, when I was a
                         teacher intern at two elementary schools on <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s South Side.
                         I was only a few months into my internship when I realized that I lacked
                         the temperament for elementary teaching. But as a small-town boy, I became
                         fascinated with the vigor of the big city--from the intrigues of its
                         machine politics and the hustle and bustle of the Loop to the
                         competitiveness of the city&apos;s newspapers and the ethnic, class,
                         and racial disparities among its neighborhoods. Captivated by the city and
                         aspiring to a career as a history professor, I decided to specialize in
                         urban history. During the balance of my stay in the Windy City, I devoted
                         most of my limited resources to the development of a library in urban
                         history.</p>
                    <p>Since Wade taught at the University of Chicago, <hi rend="i">The Urban
                              Frontier</hi> was among my early purchases. I cannot recall, however,
                         when I first read it. What I do remember is that Wade was a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         Housing
                         Authority (CHA) commissioner and occasionally commented in the press about
                         its operations. As an aspiring urban historian, I was impressed that he
                         took a direct part in a challenging arena of public life, but as one who
                         worked every day in schools that served public housing complexes, I sensed
                         sharp contradictions between what Wade and other CHA officials said about
                         public housing conditions and what I witnessed in the neighborhood where I
                         taught. While my reaction no doubt reflected considerable youthful
                         naivete, the opportunity to temper intellectual inquiry with real-world
                         experience prompted a decision to pursue a second master&apos;s
                         degree in urban affairs before beginning doctoral studies.</p>
                    <p>The plan was to remain at Roosevelt University, where I was pursuing a
                         master&apos;s degree in urban education, and then, perhaps, to study
                         with Wade at the University of Chicago. But that plan changed in 1969 when
                         the political scientist Charles V. Hamilton and the sociologist St. Clair
                         Drake, two key members of Roosevelt&apos;s urban affairs faculty,
                         accepted positions at other universities.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Instead, on

                    <p>During my first year at the university, I became acquainted with
                         Wade&apos;s thesis in an American urban history seminar taught by
                         Donald Martineau, a former student of Sam Bass Warner. Wade&apos;s 1958
                              <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi> article--in which he
                         first presented his thesis--and Martineau&apos;s lectures gave me a
                         deeper appreciation of the importance of early planning in shaping a
                         town&apos;s long-term development; the roles of merchants and
                         speculators as town builders; the involvement of commercial elites in
                         developing strategies to address emerging urban problems; the phenomenon
                         of urban imperialism in which towns promoted steamboats, canals, and other
                         transportation improvements to control their hinterlands; and the early
                         emergence of sharp social class divisions as economic specialization and
                         population growth eroded ties of neighborliness and community.<hi

                    <p>But these arguments were still largely conceptual until early 1971, when I
                         joined the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>

                         research planner. My first major assignment was to develop growth
                         projections for a population report then in progress as an element of a new
                         comprehensive plan. It was a challenge for a novice historian and planner
                         whose experience in demography was limited to a brief stint with the Census
                         Bureau. Nevertheless, the assignment went well, and my director asked me to
                         rewrite a section on recent trends that he had written before my
                              arrival.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
                    <p>Our projections proved woefully inaccurate, because our demographic
                         assumptions did not anticipate the sharp decline in fertility during the
                         early 1970s. The experience, however, strongly influenced my professional
                         course. In preparing the projections, I had extrapolated recent growth
                         patterns based on current subdivision filings. But as I probed more deeply,
                         I discovered a paucity of scholarly research that <list type="footnotes">

                         &apos;s historic urbanization patterns. By
                         the time I completed the report, I had resolved that helping to narrow that
                         gap would be a goal of my doctoral dissertation. Insights gained from
                         Wade&apos;s work would help shape that aspiration, though not in the
                         way I originally had anticipated.</p>
                    <p>As I read further in urban history, I developed an appreciation for the work
                         of Warner and Charles N. Glaab, both of whom shared with Wade a position at
                         the top of my list of prospective doctoral mentors. Wade and Warner
                         relocated during my application process, but Glaab, who was teaching at the
                         University of Toledo, accepted me and the History department offered a
                         teaching assistantship, beginning in the fall of 1972.</p>
                    <p>A full reading of <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi> in Glaab&apos;s
                         seminar significantly enhanced my comprehension of the urban development
                         process in general, and in the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>
                         region in particular. Having
                         spent nearly four years in urban education, community development, and
                         urban planning, I appreciated Wade&apos;s point that western cities
                         were economic entities. &quot;A city is many things,&quot; he had
                         observed, &quot;it is a cultural focus, a social resort, a political
                         center, but before all--but not above all--it is a place where people earn
                         a living.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Wade&apos;s emphasis on
                         economics gave me a keener understanding of the Falls of the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName>
                         as a
                         locus of town development, of the steamboat industry&apos;s role in
                         shaping the region&apos;s economic base, and of a lengthy canal
                         controversy as a manifestation of urban imperialism.</p>
                    <p>Over the next two years, I wrote several essays that explored in greater
                         depth many of the themes raised in <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi>.
                         Reflecting Glaab&apos;s interest in urban imagery and intellectual
                         attitudes towards cities, my work examined various observers&apos;

                         and looked at facets of the
                         city&apos;s social and cultural life between 1800 and 1840. But much of
                         my analysis addressed themes Wade had discussed in <hi rend="i">The Urban

                         &quot;miasmatic theory&quot; of disease, contemporary observers
                         such as Dr. Henry McMurtrie and editor Shadrack Penn had rejected notions
                         of contagion, but they urged officials to institute public health measures,
                         including establishment of a board of health, construction of sewers, and
                         drainage of stagnant ponds that generated the &quot;foul airs&quot;
                         threatening the town&apos;s health and commercial aspirations.
                         Enthusiasm for such measures waxed and waned, but they improved public
                         health. In elucidating the importance of environmental factors as a

                    <p>Wade devoted two chapters to the evolution of social and cultural
                         institutions--including churches, schools, libraries, theaters, newspa-
                         pers, and taverns--and their importance in promoting a sense of community
                         and urbanity in emerging <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio</geogName> valley towns. With respect to Louisville, he
                         noted the creation of an early library company, Samuel Drake&apos;s
                         theater, and the Lancastrian-based public school system, and he cited John
                         James Audubon&apos;s struggle to obtain patrons for his ornitho-
                         logical art. He also mentioned the formation of early houses of worship and
                         often cited Penn&apos;s <hi rend="i"><placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>

                    <p>Paradoxically, in the light of my planned dissertation topic, one theme in
                              <hi rend="i">The Urban Frontier</hi> that I had not written on was the
                         dynamics of the urbanization process, especially the mechanics of land
                         development. Moreover, in an early paper, I repeated one of
                         Wade&apos;s few notable errors. In his first chapter, he lamented the
                         sale of land between the <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio River</geogName> and Main Street and a 180-foot strip
                         between Jefferson and Green (Liberty) Streets, which were designated as
                         public space on a 1779 plan attributed to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s founder,
                         General George Rogers Clark. According to nineteenth-century historian
                         Reuben T. Durrett, the city was forced to sell this public land to satisfy
                         a debt owned by speculator John Connolly to his former partner, John
                         Campbell, depriving the city of income from the property.<hi rend="sup"
                              >10</hi></p>
                    <p>Because of Durrett&apos;s prominence as a founder of the Filson Club,
                         generations of scholars, including John W. Reps and A. E. J. Morris,
                         accepted his explanation for the demise of the public space. Then in the
                         1970s, local historians Samuel W. Thomas and George H. Yater discovered
                         that the so-called Clark map was a fraud perpetrated by Durrett. Further
                         research identified no definitive connection between the sale of lots to
                         satisfy Connolly&apos;s debt and the loss of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>

                    <p>An opportunity to correct my error and to refocus on the urbanization
                         process came in 1976, when the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>

                         central and southern <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>
                         . Soon thereafter, Thomas and Yater alerted
                         me to Durrett&apos;s fraud and I produced the first scholarly explana-

                         , which
                         was completed in 1978. These reports provided context for over a dozen

                         the transformation of the residential subdivision process from one that was
                         chaotic, unregulated, and dominated by private individuals in the early

                              West</hi> (1991) corrects what I consider Wade&apos;s major
                         conceptual weakness--the notion that &quot;by 1830 the West had
                         produced two types of society--one rural and one urban.&quot; Certainly
                         both city and country developed distinctive characteristics, and Wade
                         grants the economic and cultural influences each exercised over the other.
                         But he never really demonstrates such connections, tending instead to
                         depict city and country as opposite ends of a spectrum. In contrast,
                         Cronon&apos;s analysis of the railroad, grain, meat, and lumber
                         industries reveals powerful symbiotic relationships between city and
                         country and the ways they shaped both urban and rural landscapes. Cronon
                         has caused me to rethink my own work in agribusiness history. How, for
                         example, did the Bourbon Stock Yards, which shaped <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville">Louisville</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s
                         Butchertown neighborhood, affect the landscape of the counties that
                         supplied the livestock sold there and processed by nearby packing plants?
                         How does this apply, by analogy, to the region&apos;s distilling,
                         brewing, and tobacco industries? These questions remain to be resolved.<hi

                         harkened back to an imagined past, a time when <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         &quot;was the

                         origin story, Lane said that this first camp &quot;became the depot and
                         residence of many traders, under the organization of a village, and now
                         you can see it rearing its crest in the attitude of an inspiring

                         its regional influence assured. But the city&apos;s successes were
                         still shaped by the patterns of its previous French and Spanish colonial
                         rule, embodied in the accents and customs of the city&apos;s

                         to 1830 was mere prelude,
                         as the geography of slavery and freedom and the acquisition of lands
                         further west brought transformative success and then lasting frustration to
                         the city&apos;s ambitions. Wade praised the city that William Carr Lane
                         envisioned as of 1825; by the end of Lane&apos;s long life, however,
                         the criticism that he volleyed at his once-loved city revealed how <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014444" reg="Saint Louis">St. Louis</settlement></placeName>

                    <p>Through his research, Wade demonstrated the fallacy of Frederick Jackson
                         Turner&apos;s frontier thesis. Solitary men creating clearings in the
                         woods were not the vanguard of American civilization, as Turner had
                              claimed.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> Wade&apos;s analysis of urban
                         development foreshadowed the work of &quot;new western

                         Turner&apos;s teleology completely.<hi rend="sup">9</hi> Yet while Wade
                         inverted the order of Turner&apos;s frontier progression, he ultimately
                         preserved the same basic directional and national orientation, looking west

                         its institutions--the property deeds and trade contracts written first in

                         &apos;s origins.</p>
                    <p>More fundamental than the interplay of European interests in any of these

                         &apos;s origins, Wade casually referenced how the presence of

                         was regarded as a savage

                         of Wade&apos;s cities, &quot;founding&quot; was predicated on
                         local indigenous leaders accepting the establishment of a permanent
                         European settlement, and on continuing intercultural exchanges.<hi

                         &apos;s founding, the European importation of the

                         urbanism was an important part of the occupation of the
                         West&quot;--has been reflected in Indiana historiography only
                         occasionally. Donald E Carmony&apos;s examination of the state from
                         1816 to mid-century is definitive on constitutional, financial, political,
                         and transportation topics, but is much less informative concerning social
                         and urban history; indeed, Wade&apos;s book does not appear in
                         Carmony&apos;s bibliography. In his one-volume history of the state,
                              <hi rend="i">The Indiana Way</hi>, James H. Madison echoes Wade when
                         he writes: &quot;Towns were an essential part of frontier development

                         1,900 residents and probably several hundred fewer, remained at the time an

                         scarcely had an urban component at all. To be sure, several extant

                         state&apos;s early political and economic life, but these were still
                         very small places in 1816, well below the threshold of 2,500 residents
                         necessary today to be classified as an &quot;urban place&quot; in
                         the census.</p>
                    <p>The situation did not change much during the first twenty-five years of
                         statehood. There were many new towns established in the aftermath of the
                         New Purchase of 1818, as migrants began to surge northward from the 
                         <geogName key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio River</geogName>
                         and new counties (requiring county seats) were created. But in both
                         1820 and 1830 less than 1 percent of Indiana&apos;s residents could be
                         classified as urban, even if the technical definition is abandoned.
                         Geographer Stephen Visher, an early student of the state&apos;s nascent
                         urban network, observed that &quot;there were few towns in much of
                         south central and central Indiana until after 1825, and few in northern
                         Indiana until after 1840.&quot;<hi rend="sup">4</hi> By 1840 a mere 1.6

                         (2,692). &quot;That Indiana
                         was a rural state in 1840 can scarcely be doubted,&quot; observe two
                         well-known historians, &quot;but the lack of urban centers may not be
                         fully realized.&quot;<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>
                    <p>Population statistics, however, do not tell the whole story. The cities,
                         towns, and villages of Indiana&apos;s pioneer era had an importance
                         belied by their modest size. These &quot;wedge[s] of urbanism . ..
                         driven into the backwoods&quot; served critical economic, governmental,
                         and social functions, and did in fact provide &quot;the central
                         experience of many settlers.&quot; R. Carlyle Buley argued that life
                         in the villages and country towns of the Old Northwest &quot;differed
                         but little&quot; from life in the surrounding countryside. Perhaps--but
                         it did differ.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>
                    <p>Why did towns and cities develop in certain places and not in others? And
                         why did some urban areas grow while others stagnated? The location of
                         Indiana towns depended on many factors, the combination and importance of
                         which differed from place to place and over time. Although no listing of
                         such factors can purport to be all-inclusive, Carmony and John D. Barnhart
                         offered a useful compilation: &quot;county seat selections, the Indian
                         trading places, spots where land or water traffic and trade crossed, the
                         clustering of shops or stores around grist and saw mills, the boosting and
                         gifts of speculators and promoters, sites where boats were loaded or goods
                         exported, and the impetus which came from the location of general
                              stores.&quot;<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p>
                    <p>Entrepreneurial functions should perhaps be emphasized, since the initial
                         raison d&apos;etre for most towns was essentially economic.
                         Wade&apos;s description of western towns as the &quot;commercial
                         nerve centers of the frontier&quot; seems applicable to Indiana
                         (although, as will be seen, less so to early 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> than might be
                         expected). As Francis P. Weisenburger observed in his pioneering study of

                    <p>The enterprise of town promoters must also be acknowledged. Land speculation
                         was a widespread and important activity throughout the nineteenth century,
                         and &quot;town jobbing&quot; was merely a specialized form of the
                         art. As Buley observes: &quot;The turnover, if any, was relatively
                         quick and profitable; since little capital was required almost anyone could
                         try his hand at it.&quot; By the late 1820s and early 1830s, town sites
                         were being promoted in central and northern Indiana, and newspapers carried
                         advertisements for the sale of lots in

                    <p>One other item, sometimes overlooked, should be included in any discussion of
                         &quot;initial advantages.&quot; The governmental functions assumed
                         by some cities and towns usually gave them an edge with respect to
                         long-term growth. Designation as a county seat (or, as we shall see, the
                         state capital) automatically added a flourishing
                         &quot;industry&quot; to the community. Competition for this honor
                         was intense, leading one writer to document what he called the
                         &quot;county seat wars&quot; in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> Such
                         fervor was not misplaced; in many cases the community designated as the
                         seat of government went on to become the largest town in the county. In
                         1970 over two-thirds of the state&apos;s county seats (64 of 92) were
                         at least two times larger than the next largest town in the same county.<hi

                         setting out into the wilderness in 1820 to find a centrally located site
                         for the new state capital, as mandated by the General Assembly in order to
                         fulfill the provision in the 1816 state constitution that

                         remain the seat of government only until 1825. Their charge was
                         straightforward: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>The principal requirement for the site of the new capital was its geographic
                         proximity to the center of the state. Three places were considered, all
                         of which had the primary advantage of location: the Bluffs, near
                         present-day <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7018981" reg="Waverly Woods">Waverly</settlement></placeName>;
                         William Conner&apos;s farm, near what is now
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2033098" reg="Noblesville">Noblesville</settlement></placeName>;
                         and the confluence of <geogName key="tgn_1133174" reg="Fall Creek">Fall Creek</geogName> and <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName>
                         . The last of
                         these was chosen because it was nearest the center of the state; because it
                         provided the best location for landing boats of all the sites considered;
                         and because <geogName key="tgn_1133174" reg="Fall Creek">Fall Creek</geogName> was highly suitable for mills. (The mills would thus
                         be to the east of <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName>, the east side of which was the better
                         landing bank.)<hi rend="sup">32</hi> Several of these factors were based on
                         the commissioners&apos; mistaken belief that the <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName> was, or
                         could easily be made, navigable. This was an error that significantly
                         compromised the &quot;initial advantage&quot; the location was
                         expected to enjoy, and it made the capital&apos;s early development
                         markedly different from that of the river cities discussed by Wade.</p>
                    <p>Historians have argued back and forth about whether the McCormicks or the
                         Pogues were the first to settle in what would become the capital, but the
                         fact is that they, and perhaps ten other families, had settled on the east
                         bank of <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName> by the summer of 1820--about the time of the
                         commissioners&apos; visit--with the cluster of cabins coming to be
                         known as the <geogName key="tgn_1133174" reg="Fall Creek">Fall Creek</geogName> settlement.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> As word of the
                         location of the new capital spread, an estimated additional 200 settlers
                         arrived during the next year or so. Simultaneously, Alexander Ralston
                         developed his distinctive plat for the town, leaving many early cabins
                         standing in the middle of planned streets or oddly oriented after the
                         lots were surveyed.<hi rend="sup">34</hi></p>
                    <p>The official sale of lots began in October 1821, and more than three hundred
                         were purchased in the initial wave. While the original settlers had built
                         their cabins near the <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName> and <geogName key="tgn_1133174" reg="Fall Creek">Fall Creek</geogName>, lots to the north and
                         east went first once sales began, with buyers wanting to locate closer to
                         the future center of the city--and also to escape the miasmal low areas
                         near the waterways. Proceeds were earmarked for the erection of public
                         buildings. Sales slowed dramatically after the initial rush to purchase,
                         however, and many who made advance payments to secure lots ultimately
                         defaulted. Perhaps because of this, Governor <list type="footnotes">

                         work.&quot; In 1831 there were still 1,900 acres unsold, and by the
                         mid-1830s, approximately 75 percent of the lots were still owned by the
                         state. As of 1842, the year public land sales ended, they had contributed

                         needs or served its immediate hinterland. By the early 1830s it had become
                         apparent that the <geogName key="tgn_1131742" reg="White">White River</geogName>
                         was not navigable as far north as the

                         overland transportation greatly limited trade to and from the city. One
                         result of the lack of incoming as well as outgoing trade was that local
                         businessmen had to be general rather than specialist merchandisers. A
                         daybook of the Union Inn, dating from the mid-1830s, in addition to showing
                         lodging and boarding payments for men and horses, also records sales of
                         such diverse items as alcoholic beverages, bulk corn and apples, coffee,
                         rifles and shot, and furniture. What trade there was to distant points was
                         arduous at best. If supplies in town ran low, a local hostler might require
                         a month to travel to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>
                         and back with new goods. What outgoing
                         trade there was required a similar commitment of time and energy. In a
                         letter to his parents in 1823, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>

                         the state to local governments, and it marked a significant stage of urban
                         maturation.<hi rend="sup">43</hi> For <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         , as will be seen,
                         the 1847 date of the first city charter not coincidentally occurred in a
                         watershed year in the city&apos;s history.</p>
                    <p>The nascent capital&apos;s commingling of Upland South and eastern
                         immigrants resulted in an admixture of cultural and other institutions and
                         pursuits. Much of the early social life of the town was of the kind that
                         would be expected in an isolated frontier settlement, with many tasks
                         accomplished cooperatively. Calvin and Sarah Hill Fletcher&apos;s
                         diaries and letters contain numerous references to interaction with their
                         neighbors for barn raisings, assistance with ailing family members,
                         sewing and quilting sessions, and myriad other tasks of daily life in the
                         wilderness that were lightened somewhat by helping each other through them.
                         The Fletchers cite a wide variety of amusements, including weddings,
                         Christmas and New Year parties, theater performances, circuses and animal
                         shows, candy pulling, and evenings of games such as dominoes.<hi rend="sup"

                    <p>In the founding of more formal cultural institutions, however, the eastern
                         element tended to dominate: &quot;[T]hey were influenced by a sense of
                         regional superiority and by New England Protestantism, which preached
                         civilization and Christianity to save the West--and ultimately the
                         nation--from barbarism and license. . . . Men such as James Blake, Isaac
                         Coe, Calvin Fletcher, and Samuel Merrill became involved in all forms of
                         civic and reform activities, constituting an informal network that shaped
                         much of the capital&apos;s character and affected its daily
                              life.&quot;<hi rend="sup">45</hi> As early as 1822, Calvin
                         Fletcher co-founded the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>

                         Library Society were formed, followed
                         within five years by the Indiana Historical Society (1830) and the
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         Lyceum/ Athenaeum (1831).<hi rend="sup">47</hi> While many of
                         these organizations lasted only a short time, they were often forerunners
                         of more permanent institutions that flourished by mid-century. They also
                         show the impetus toward cultural activity that recreated for educated
                         early settlers the milieu from which they came and that they believed to be
                         a necessary part of any city&apos;s path to prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The earliest religious meetings in the city, being few, were likely attended
                         &quot;without regard to denomination,&quot; but distinct
                         congregations began forming as early as 1822, with the first Baptist group
                         organizing in that year and the Presbyterians in 1823.<hi rend="sup"
                              >48</hi> The founding of churches led in many cases to the
                         establishment of schools under religious auspices. The first Presbyterian
                         school was established at the church of that denomination in 1824. The
                         first Methodist school was established several years later, in 1829, and
                         the first Baptist school in 1832. In 1833-34, the county seminary was
                         built on University Square, followed by the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         Female Institute,
                         which opened in 1837. One city chronicler commented of the latter that
                         &quot;[i]t was a good school, but the Misses [Mary and Harriet]
                         Axtell,&quot; who ran the institute in its early years, &quot;were
                         strongly imbued with the rather intolerant religious ideas of the old New

                    <p>Because <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         was the capital, much social discourse was political in
                         nature. In the fall of 1824, for example, &quot;in anticipation of the
                         [inaugural] meeting of the Legislature [in January 1825] the citizens
                         formed a &apos;mock&apos; body . .. called the
                         &apos;<placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         Legislature,&apos; the members of which
                         assigned themselves to any counties they chose, and discussed pretty much
                         the same questions as the real Legislature had discussed, or would when it
                              met.&quot;<hi rend="sup">51</hi> Often, members of the state
                         General Assembly, during their own legislative session, would attend
                         meetings of the &quot;<placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         Legislature,&quot; giving
                         citizens access to lawmakers that many today would envy. In addition, the
                         mock legislature was reportedly an unusually democratic body for the
                         time, as &quot;it was a great resort of the ladies of the place, which
                         greatly added to the interest of the discussions.&quot; The presence
                         of the General Assembly also had a broader effect on the town.
                         &quot;The influx of strangers, with new topics of thought and
                         conversation, excited the quiet villagers; and after the session opened
                         crowds of gaping natives witnessed the proceedings with unsated curios-
                              ity.&quot;<hi rend="sup">52</hi> Once the legislators departed,
                         however, <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         went back to being &quot;a dull country village,
                         with no excitement beyond the annual sessions, when a little animation
                         was given to society and to trade. It seemed to have attained its
                         growth.&quot; For a good portion of the year, the town was cut off from
                         the rest of the state by impassable roads and non-navigable waterways. As
                         Ignatius Brown recalled several decades later, &quot;It is impossible,
                         at present . .. to realize the situation of the early settlers after a
                         Spring thaw or a long wet spell, separated from civilization by sixty miles
                         of mud and slush, with unbridged streams, floating corduroys and

                         travel remained difficult. The first stagecoach between

                         and the trip took four days.<hi rend="sup">54</hi></p>
                    <p>The National Road, though planned to pass through Indiana, was originally
                         routed about thirty miles to the south of what became the city&apos;s
                         site. The Indiana General Assembly prevailed upon the federal government
                         to alter the route, and the road ultimately passed through the capital on
                         Washington Street. In addition, the Michigan Road connecting <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032714" reg="Madison">Madison</settlement></placeName>
                         to

                         also passed through town. Both roads were greeted with much
                         anticipation: &quot;Permanent advantages are held forth, sufficient to
                         stimulate our citizens to be active in improvement, and offer many
                         inducements for emigrants to settle amongst us.&quot; Where the
                         National Road was concerned, however, one historian has held that
                         &quot;its direct advantage beyond macadamizing Washington street, was
                         not at all equal to the anticipations of the citizens. It became a
                         thoroughfare for emigration to the <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi</geogName>
                         and beyond but it left here
                         little of the deposit that was borne along by its current. It did a vast
                         deal for the West but not much for <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         .&quot; For many years
                         the National Road suffered from the same difficult traveling conditions
                         for much of the year as did other routes radiating from

                         hard to overestimate the impact of the railroad on the city; even so, the
                         editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana State Journal</hi> waxed hyperbolic in
                         describing the euphoria that accompanied the opening of the line:

                         has changed. Friday, October 1st, 1847, was an era
                         in our history. On that day we were linked with commerce. From the
                         beginning of the world until that day, the rattling of the cars and the
                         whistle of the locomotive were unknown sounds, but from then until the end
                         of civilization, perhaps to the end of time, those sounds will never die
                              away.&quot;<hi rend="sup">58</hi> While more prosaic, later
                         assessments agree in spirit with the editor&apos;s sentiments.
                         Historians at the state&apos;s centennial remarked on the
                         transformative nature of the availability of rail commerce:
                         &quot;Business at once revived and new stores were opened, and new
                         factories started, while others were projected. Up to that time the stores
                         kept a little of everything, but a railroad demanded a division of trade,
                         and stores for dry goods and stores for groceries were opened. The price of
                         property advanced, and a new city government organized.&quot;<hi

                         would be easy to account for the failure of each. Some were too easily

                         early seasons of disease?</p>
                    <p>The foremost factor must be its status as state capital, which auto-
                         matically made the town the center of a certain degree of activity that
                         proceeded regardless of other less than ideal conditions. Wade, as noted
                         earlier, claims that &quot;the central nexus of the urbanization of the
                         West was commerce.&quot;<hi rend="sup">63</hi> In

                         however, merchants and other boosters of the town&apos;s economy
                         faced challenges more daunting than those in Wade&apos;s case study
                         cities. While there clearly was a &quot;business community&quot;
                         in antebellum <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         , its members had to devote much of their
                         attention during the town&apos;s first two decades to
                         &quot;numerous attempts to end their near isolation.&quot; At the
                         end of the 1830s the reality they and their fellow residents faced, in
                         Madison&apos;s words, was &quot;an unfinished canal that was
                         useless for transportation purposes, a railroad less than one-third
                         complete, and several roads that caused more dissatisfaction than

                         , Indiana, achieved a presence in American

                         was also home to a number of individuals who had made their names
                         nationally. In the summer of 1922, renowned labor leader Eugene Debs was
                         living at 451 North 8th Street, having been delivered there the previous
                         December by a torchlight parade of well-wishers. Debs had just returned
                         from the Federal Penitentiary in

                         , criticizing the nation&apos;s
                         involvement in the Great War. Meanwhile, little more than a block away and
                         a week later, hometown boxing sensation Charles &quot;Bud&quot;
                         Taylor thrilled a capacity crowd of 1,400 at the Grand Opera House with his
                         first round knockout of Solly Epstein.</p>
                    <p>In a near perfect merger of timing and talent, Bud Taylor ascended the
                         ranks of the bantamweight division during the decade commonly referred to
                         as &quot;The Golden Age of Boxing.&quot; The Walker Act, passed by
                         the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007568" reg="New York">New York</region></placeName>
                         State Legislature in 1919, had just sanctioned prizefighting
                         in the nation&apos;s most populous state. The American public quickly
                         embraced a sport that had been illegal just a few years before. Opportu-
                         nity beckoned to a generation of young men who saw cash purses of five or
                         ten dollars as an attractive alternative to a day of hard manual labor.</p>
                    <p>They soon discovered the work of boxing could be far more brutal. During the
                         year 1923, for instance, Taylor fought fifteen separate bouts-- enduring
                         three ten-round bouts in the month of July alone. He won the vast <pb
                              n="284" id="VAA4025-105-3-092"/> majority of those fights and still
                         managed to crack a rib, break a thumb, fracture his right hand and wrist,
                         and have his front teeth rammed through his lower lip. Taylor also meted
                         out a staggering amount of physical abuse. Two of his ring opponents,
                         Frankie Jerome and Clever Sensio, died from massive head trauma soon after
                         their bouts with Taylor. In both cases, the victor was fighting again
                         within a month.</p>
                    <p>Biographer John D. Wright explores the story of this local hero and temporary
                         celebrity with care and balance. Understandably, the bulk of
                         Wright&apos;s portrayal is committed to Taylor&apos;s professional
                         career, which almost perfectly matched boxing&apos;s ascent in
                         popularity across <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>
                         . Curiously, just as Taylor&apos;s skills
                         began to diminish, so did the broad appeal of his sport. His effort to
                         build an outdoor boxing arena in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014370" reg="Terre Haute">Terre Haute</settlement></placeName>
                         during the Depression
                         ended in failure. Over the years that followed, the aging fighter divorced
                         his second wife, drank prodigiously, and nearly doubled his fighting
                         weight. He died in a large city far from his hometown before reaching 60,
                         forgotten by all but a few boxing historians.</p>
                    <p>Bud Taylor&apos;s almost inevitable fall from grace might approach the
                         cliché of a Hollywood film, but the author gives flesh and blood to this
                         profile with a skillful mix of apocrypha and documentation. Like the best
                         folklorists, Wright never lets the ring of truth deafen him to a good
                         story. He displays a love for his subject and a love for the sport
                         --absolutely essential in his earnest effort to capture those who may open
                         this book with scant interest in either.</p>

                    <p>When All-American George Taliaferro led Indiana University to its first Big
                         Ten football championship in 1945, its basketball program was still three
                         years away from integrating. The Hoosiers reflected the Big Ten norm
                         regarding African Americans in basketball. Operating under a &quot;gen-
                         tleman&apos;s agreement,&quot; the conference was lily-white on the
                         hardwood.</p>

                         &apos;s Bill Garrett changed all that in 1948, but only after
                         a high school career marked by racism. Until 1943, segregation was endorsed
                         by <pb n="285" id="VAA4025-105-3-093"/> the Indiana High School Athletic
                         Association, which barred Catholic and all-black schools (including Tal-

                         Crispus Attucks) from competing in its state tournaments. Among the black
                         players whose basketball careers were restricted by this segregation was
                         Johnny Wilson. Though he led <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013300" reg="Anderson">Anderson</settlement></placeName>
                         High School to the state championship
                         and was named Mr. Basketball, none of the state&apos;s big-time
                         colleges recruited him. The snubbed athlete settled for Anderson College,
                         where he earned small-college All-American honors.</p>
                    <p>Following Wilson, Garrett was one of three blacks who started for

                         &apos;s Golden Bears, derisively referred to in parts of
                         Indiana as &quot;The Black Bears.&quot; In their drive to the 1947
                         state title, the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2033652" reg="Shelbyville">Shelbyville</settlement></placeName>
                         team was refused service by an

                         hotel where they planned to rest after their semistate opener. Overcoming
                         the last-minute scramble for accommodations, the Golden Bears beat

                         to advance to--and win--the Final Four.</p>
                    <p>After leading his team to the state title and being named Mr. Basketball,
                         Garrett enrolled at Tennessee State. He was, however, plucked off the
                         southern campus by Indiana University&apos;s Coach Branch McCracken,
                         who reluctantly bowed to pressure exerted by the African American commu-
                         nity and by progressive university president Herman B Wells. Indiana
                         University was barely integrated in the late forties. Of 12,000 students,
                         only 200 were black. It was a difficult time for President Wells, who was
                         also dealing with public outrage over the controversial Kinsey Report.</p>
                    <p>Once situated at IU, Garrett was embraced by such teammates as Phil Buck, who
                         later coached at Frankfort and Anderson Madison Heights; Bill Tosheff, who
                         worked in the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary">Gary</settlement></placeName>
                         steel mills when he was only 13 and came to IU after
                         serving as an Army Air Force pilot; and Gene Ring, who later coached
                         against Garrett in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName>
                         . &quot;Bill was the shortest center
                         in the Big Ten,&quot; said Tosheff, who roomed with him. &quot;He
                         was barely 6-3, but was greased lightning.&quot;</p>
                    <p>In Garrett&apos;s three years, IU won 50 of 66 games. His senior season,
                         the Hoosiers, with a 19-3 record, were ranked as high as fifth in the
                         country, but road losses at <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007521" reg="Minnesota">Minnesota</region></placeName>
                         and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>
                         , the conference
                         champion, cost them the Big Ten title.</p>
                    <p>Garrett was lionized during his IU career, but his most revealing comments
                         about his college experience were made to a <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013511" reg="Dayton">Dayton</settlement></placeName>
                         reporter in his junior
                         year. With some hindsight, Garrett said he might have attended an all-black
                         college because too many people at IU treated him as if they were doing him
                         a great favor. Significantly, Garrett made the needed breakthrough in the
                         Big Ten: one year after he graduated, five conference teams listed black
                         players on their roster.</p>
                    <p>Author Tom Graham, who grew up in Garrett&apos;s hometown and played <pb
                              n="286" id="VAA4025-105-3-094"/> basketball for IU as a freshman, is
                         well-suited to tell readers of his subject&apos;s adversities on the
                         way to becoming IU&apos;s first black basketball player. Graham and
                         co-author Rachel Graham Cody should be congratulated for the thoroughness
                         of their research and for the book which resulted from their seven-year

                         promises to accelerate in the future. &quot;Demographers
                         argue,&quot; Edmunds writes, &quot;that if current
                         [intermarriage] trends continue, by 2080 almost 90 percent of all Native
                         American people in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>
                         will be of less than one-half Indian
                         by lineage&quot; (p. 10). The challenges of these trends, however,
                         pale in comparison to those of past centuries, when Indians lost their
                         children and their lands.</p>

                         employed various survival
                         techniques while confronting removal. Thomas Burnell Colbert portrays
                         Keokuk as a worthy Sauk chief, even when compared with Black Hawk; he was
                         an accommodationist who surrendered land to the government and enjoyed a
                         positive relationship with federal officials. Bradley Birzer describes Jean
                         Baptiste Richardville, Miami principal chief, as a métis who maneuvered his
                         cultural advantages to acquire great <pb n="287" id="VAA4025-105-3-095"/>
                         wealth. Although Richardville eventually accumulated nearly 29,000 acres
                         in Indiana by 1840 while the tribe ceded away its lands, he also used his
                         privately held property to provide sanctuary for Miamis facing removal.</p>
                    <p>Four contributors examine an especially interesting topic--the essential role
                         of Indian women. Lucy Eldersveld Murphy documents the lead mining
                         activities of Native females in the Upper <geogName key="tgn_7022231" reg="Mississippi River">Mississippi</geogName>
                         Valley. Susan
                         Sleeper-Smith concentrates on the history of a white captive named Frances
                         Slocum, the &quot;White Indian,&quot; who lived with her Miami
                         relatives for more than sixty years. The Miami used Slocum&apos;s race
                         to avoid removal by presenting their community as essentially white. Con-
                         sidering her experience, Edmunds questions whether &quot;Native
                         American identity is a genetic trait, or ... a subscription to a certain
                         set of cultural values accepted by other members of the tribal
                         community&quot; (p. 6). Rebecca Kugel looks at gender and class while
                         examining the metis of the western <geogName key="tgn_7029370" reg="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</geogName>
                         and the issue of race during

                         considers the traditional social support function of Anishinaabe (Ojibwe)

                         stimulating arguments. Alan Shackelford, for example, contends that

                    <p>In <hi rend="i">American Pogrom</hi>, historian Charles Lumpkins upends the
                         dominant narrative of the 1917 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027624" reg="East Saint Louis">East St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         race riot not only by
                         placing the African American experience at the center but also by arguing
                         that the riot was a strategic effort to negate black political organizing.
                         Whereas previous scholars placed the responsibility for the riot on
                         white working-class males concerned about social strife, Lumpkins argues
                         that city elites, women, and political bosses played an integral role in
                         this destructive demonstration of white superiority. Lumpkins offers a
                         provocative interpretation that the riot represented a growing battle for
                         political clout between black and white elites.</p>
                    <p>Lumpkins lays out his argument chronologically. He begins with the
                         establishment of 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027624" reg="East Saint Louis">East St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         &apos;s African American community and
                         then outlines its political structure from 1898 until 1915. During this
                         period, African Americans began to assert their autonomy in the political
                         arena by shifting from a typical patronage system to &quot;a black
                         political infrastructure independent of white political bosses&quot;
                         (p. 45). It was this &quot;increasingly assertive black pop-
                         ulation&quot; (p. 73) and white elites&apos; unfounded paranoia
                         over southern black migration that prompted whites to enact drastic
                         measures to reduce black migration or to force African Americans from the
                         city. Using commission reports and newspapers, the author reconstructs
                         both the May and July incidents. Lumpkins reveals in detail how blacks
                         responded with armed self-defense to white attacks, an important fact
                         buried by contemporaries and scholars alike. This historical erasure is
                         remarkable considering that the city&apos;s predominant black
                         communities in the south end remained untouched by rioters.</p>
                    <p>Although the pogrom metaphor is effective in showing the desire of
                         participants to completely rid 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027624" reg="East Saint Louis">East St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         of its black residents, the
                         author&apos;s omission of a sustained discussion of the use of daily
                         violence as a means of social control weakens his thesis. Throughout the
                         book, Lumpkins demonstrates that blacks in 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027624" reg="East Saint Louis">East St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         knew that they
                         were &quot;not safe as long as most white Illinoisans held contempt for
                         black people&quot; (p. 61). Yet, he only briefly discusses
                         blacks&apos; everyday experiences with violence (pp. 19, 37). In his
                         book, <hi rend="i">The Making of a Lynching Culture: Violence and

                              , 1836- 1916</hi> (2004), William D.
                         Carrigan asserts that in central <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007826" reg="Texas">Texas</region></placeName>
                         whites &quot;remembered
                         extralegal violence as a just and necessary part of their his-
                         tory&quot; (p. 13). Lumpkins&apos;s book ignores the work of
                         scholars who <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-105-3-097"/> study daily violence and
                         terror against blacks in the Deep South, and thus he loses the opportunity
                         to consider how social control via racial violence played an integral part
                         in daily race relations in the Midwest and other parts of the North.
                         Despite this shortcoming, Lumpkins demonstrates that black midwesterners
                         occupied a curious position in the social hierarchy--simultaneously
                         integral parts of the machine yet living under the constant threat of
                         violent repression.</p>
                    <p>Lumpkins&apos;s monograph focuses on the black experience within 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2027624" reg="East Saint Louis">East St. Louis</settlement></placeName>
                         politics and the interwar-era riots, but it also demonstrates the
                         resiliency of this African American community. Beyond challenging the
                         accepted motivations for racial violence in urban areas in the first
                         decades of the twentieth century, he offers an in-depth view of the actors,
                         social organizations, and political structures of black communities, which
                         allowed African Americans to create and sustain their lives in the face of
                         racial oppression.</p>

                    <p>After one particularly bruising encounter with Gilded Age clerics who
                         considered themselves inconvenienced by Dwight L. Moody&apos;s urban
                         evangelism, the lay leader remarked: &quot; [S]ave me from the devil
                         and ministers.&quot; Moody might have added to that list future
                         generations of feminist historians who would find fault with the Third
                         Awakening&apos;s &quot;gendered theology&quot; which
                         &quot;marginalized women&quot; while &quot;ritualizing racial
                         superiority and ethnic animosity&quot; that privileged white
                         middle-class morality (pp. 14, 17). Thekla Joiner asserts that the roots
                         of the modern religious right and its &quot;dedication to imposing its
                         moral, social, and racial authority upon the nation&quot; (p. 231) can
                         be found in three revivals staged in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         between 1893 and 1918.</p>
                    <p>Joiner makes little effort to join the sixty-year interval between the
                         revivals of Billy Sunday and the rise of Ronald Reagan. Instead, readers
                         are expected to accept a linkage that the author sees between the current
                         religious right &quot;who feel overwhelmed and embattled by
                         evil&quot; (p. 232) and their evangelical forefathers who sought to
                         usher in a second Eden by keeping women in their place. So, <pb n="290"

                         Revival of 1893 is reduced to a redemptive tale of &quot;domestic
                         morality&quot; where righteous women &quot;offer metaphysical
                         restraint&quot; to sinful males (pp. 96, 104). The author further
                         generalizes the revival as a strategic Protestant tendency to convert those
                         &quot;perceived as inferior to themselves&quot; (p. 108).</p>
                    <p>Joiner seems uninterested in the social and political forces through which
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         landed the Columbian Exposition or in the symbolic significance
                         of Daniel Burnham&apos;s White City. The revival&apos;s many
                         meanings, developed in the thoughtful work of David Burg, Reid Badger,
                         Stanley Applebaum, Robert Rydell, and others is completely ignored. Joiner
                         acknowledges the staff of the Moody Bible Institute in her research, but
                         does not cite Moody&apos;s papers in her study. Perhaps that is why she
                         has Mr. Moody dying in 1896 (p. 117) when he went off to his reward three
                         years later, and why she gives such short shrift to his relentless,
                         persuasive preaching on the sacrificial mother and the wayward son, which
                         only makes a brief appearance on page 103 of her text.</p>
                    <p>J. Wilbur Chapman makes but a guest appearance in the &quot;simultane-
                         ous revival&quot; he staged in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         with song leader Charles
                         Alexander in 1910. Alexander does not appear at all. The author
                         characterizes their campaign as an exercise in status anxiety for white
                         middle-class males &quot;concerned about their power in soci-
                         ety&quot; and threatened by &quot;the impurity and low morals of
                         working class immigrants&quot; (pp. 120, 126). Chapman was actually a
                         strong supporter of working-class rights and his ministry more than a
                         recitation of &quot;the virtuous and submissive female&quot;
                         (p.167), but one will hardly find him here in Joiner&apos;s
                         summary.</p>
                    <p>When Sunday, an advance man for Chapman&apos;s revivals, comes to

                         in 1918, he becomes (according to Joiner) the mouthpiece for
                         &quot;fundamentalist fears that women had abandoned their domestic
                         assignments&quot; (p. 214). She caricatures Sunday as a front man
                         for the advocates of Prohibition who see &quot;foreigners and blacks as
                         inferior to whites&quot; (p. 202). Sunday&apos;s work, according to
                         Joiner, is &quot;a showcase for religious indoctrination&quot;
                         driven by &quot;consensus-forming rituals&quot; and intended to
                         produce families that will sanctify &quot;the industrial
                         order&quot; (pp. 218, 221).</p>
                    <p>Readers hoping to better understand the many meanings of religious revivals
                         as civic and cultural spectacle and as individuals&apos; searches for
                         spiritual significance will be disappointed in <hi rend="i">Sin in the City</hi>. The book
                         claims to be a study of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>
                         and revivalism over forty years of municipal
                          history, but it is little of either. Instead, the author appears to
                         define first and then observe. As a result, religious revivals in
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>&apos;s second city are little more than ciphers that chart the
                         way toward &quot;demonizing those outside evangelicalism&apos;s
                         domestic ideal&quot; (p. 241).</p>

                    <p>A fierce passion for politics and a corrosive anxiety over national purpose
                         drove three generations of post-Revolutionary Americans to bring down
                         their Union. Ideologically considered, argues Elizabeth R. Varon in this
                         excellent synthesis of the coming of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>
                         Civil War, the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>
                         &apos; &quot;more perfect&quot; Union carried within
                         itself from its founding the germ of disunion. Talk of disunion was never
                         absent even from the hopeful political vision of the 
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName> as a people
                         held together by bonds of interest, goodwill, and rational calculation.
                         Fears abounded from the outset. Fear of foreign and internal enemies, of
                         impure morality, of tainted faith in God, of corrupt use of public power,
                         of economic collapse--the American nation had at hand the rich
                         ingredients of its demise as national boundaries expanded and political
                         conflicts multiplied. Once linked to the debate over slavery, disunion
                         became the one fear that held them all.</p>
                    <p>In one sense, Varon tells a familiar story of the years from 1798 to 1859,
                         based on the changes and continuities in national political leadership
                         and parties, popular political culture, and the well-known public
                         benchmarks of national collapse: territorial expansion, North-South eco-
                         nomic and social divergence over slavery, Constitutional struggle and
                         repair (featuring the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523" reg="Missouri">Missouri</region></placeName>
                         Crisis, the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007254" reg="Kansas">Kansas</region></placeName>
                         Crisis, and Dred Scott),
                         and the final moral crucible that made slavery the sticking point. She is
                         especially good on the rise of the Republican Party as a catalyst for
                         the national grappling with disunion. Varon has worked in key primary
                         sources and provides sharp, critical assessments of recent scholarship use-
                         fully synthesized. And although she is not inattentive to other issues in
                         the American political firmament, Varon, like most modern historians of the
                         era, understands slavery as the central, transgressive moral and polit-
                         ical issue leading to the dissolution of the 
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>.</p>
                    <p>What, then, does the focus on disunion add to our understanding? For one, it
                         puts the spotlight on ideological conflict to suggest that there never
                         was a time when American national public life was not extreme.
                         &quot;Disunion&quot; became a key weapon in the fight club that was
                         American politics. Purists used it to prophesy final judgment. Political
                         critics from abolitionists to pro-slavery zealots used it as an ultimate
                         threat or accusation. Nearly everyone in the political arena saw disunion
                         as a powerful process of sectional alienation that called for constant
                         vigilance and suspicion. In taking this view, Varon heightens our sense of
                         such language as basic to <pb n="292" id="VAA4025-105-3-100"/> how politics
                         worked. Too, Varon is successful in showing that a focus on disunion
                         provides a way to understand how slavery took on the political weight
                         equal to its moral transgressions; &quot;disunion&quot; became both
                         a desire and a doom in the partisan slavery struggle.</p>
                    <p>Varon&apos;s is a narrative told with liveliness and clarity, though of
                         course some features of antebellum politics emerge as less well-lighted
                         than others. For example, her analysis tends to underplay the intensity
                         and flexibility of Americans&apos; religious faith as a means for
                         understanding the national crisis. In the same way, race takes a back seat
                         to the institution of slavery, somewhat underplaying many of the darker
                         impulses of white American political power and national expansion. And,
                         strangely, she gives very little attention to the meaning of
                         &quot;Union&quot; (the term is not even indexed) as the good twin
                         of her subject. More attention to Americans&apos; desire for
                         wholeness, permanence, and harmony, even as a fantasy, might have given an
                         extra edge to this very fine narrative of the great national
                         unraveling.</p>

                    <p>This volume is a collection of essays in honor of Robert H. Ferrell, the dis-
                         tinguished diplomatic historian and biographer of Harry Truman. The essays,
                         composed by Ferrell&apos;s former students and friends, cover a wide
                         range of subjects from Lincoln&apos;s Emancipation Proclamation to
                         regime change in modern American foreign policy. Some of the essays deal
                         with obscure figures: George Kennan&apos;s uncle and namesake, whose
                         influential travel writing introduced Americans to the mysteries of a
                         Moscow where his nephew would later serve; or Lawrence Dennis, a minor
                         diplomat who played a major role in early twentieth-century relations
                         between the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>

                         . Other essays focus on minor
                         episodes in major careers: Franklin D. Roosevelt&apos;s brief meeting
                         with King Ibn Saud after the Yalta conference; or Ronald Reagan&apos;s
                         Hollywood experiences with the science fiction stories and scripts that
                         were later alleged to enhance his fascination with missile defense. The
                         essays focused on recent foreign policy developments take a critical view
                         of Clinton-era interventions and the controversial buildup to the war in

                    <p>There is no thesis that holds the essays together; there are no conclusions
                         that sum up the contributions in the collected chapters. Instead, and
                         appropriately, the final two essays provide personal remembrances of Pro-
                         fessor Ferrell. Those chapters nicely capture Ferrell&apos;s ability to
                         combine high-quality research with compassionate and effective teaching
                         and mentorship. Any reader of the last two essays will be impressed by a
                         career that could easily stand as an ideal version of a successful Ameri-
                         can academic life--Mr. Chips with publications.</p>
                    <p>Doing diplomatic history is not easy. It involves both understanding
                         complicated trends and odd events that occur all around the world and
                         learning to see those trends and events from the peculiar perspectives of
                         the politicians and policymakers who encountered them for the first time.
                         It rests at the nexus of international relations and biography and
                         requires a careful balancing of the personal and the political aspects in
                         controversial stories. Through his scholarship and teaching Robert Fer-
                         rell has clearly trained an impressive group of diplomatic historians. This
                         sample of their work confirms that contribution, even if the collected
                         essays do not develop or advance any other theme or thesis.</p>

                         Court&apos;s unanimous decision that racial segregation in public
                         schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment and thus was unconstitutional.
                         To this day, the impact and legacy of this landmark case continues to be
                         analyzed by scholars, national leaders, politicians, and community
                         activists. In <hi rend="i">With All Deliberate Speed: Implementing Brown

                         different states, to present a broad assessment of how well the Brown
                         decision was implemented. Each of the twelve authors provides unique
                         perspectives on the importance of African American activism during the
                         1940s and 1950s, especially the crucial role played by the NAACP; the
                         deep-rooted racism that opposed school integration at every turn; and
                         the importance of various aspects of both the state and federal government.

                         . All in all, these
                         scholars conclude that despite the internal debates within the various
                         African American communities, the quest to implement the Brown decision
                         never wavered for most black American civil rights leaders.</p>
                    <p>Without question, <hi rend="i">With All Deliberate Speed</hi> adds much to
                         our understanding of the history and legacy of the Brown decision and
                         also raises significant questions about the broader civil rights
                         movement. This carefully researched and lucidly written volume is a
                         must-read for those interested in this crucial period in American and
                         African American history. All parties involved in this venture should be
                         highly commended for their pathbreaking and much-needed collection. The
                         one shortcoming is the lack of a coherent analysis of the roles and
                         activities of black American women in these various campaigns. Despite
                         this weakness, this is an exceptional volume.</p>

                    <p>Historian David Kyvig is the author of an award-winning book on federal
                         constitutional amendments, <hi rend="i">Explicit and Authentic Acts</hi>
                         (1996), which provides perhaps our best study of the general history of the
                         amendments process and the amendments to the 
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>
                         Constitution. In his new
                         book, Kyvig notes that amendments are one &quot;repair device&quot;
                         that was built into the Constitution to be used if the instrument failed
                         to function as expected or desired (p. vii). The impeachment mechanism, he
                         suggests, is another. And thus this study of impeachments is a follow-up of
                         sorts to his earlier examination of amendments and a consideration of how
                         our experience with these features of the Constitution have both realized
                         and deviated from the purposes and expectations that led to their inclusion
                         in the document in the first place.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">The Age of Impeachment</hi> does not provide a comprehensive
                         history of federal impeachments. Rather, Kyvig is concerned with the
                         &quot;impeachment culture&quot; of American national politics
                         since the mid-twentieth century. The book is framed as an attempt to answer
                         the question of why federal impeachments have become more common since 1961
                         than they were earlier in American history. The Senate tried federal
                         impeachments in only eleven cases prior to 1960, but it has held four
                         trials since then. Moreover, the idea of impeachment has been seriously
                         raised in a number of other cases, targeting officials from Chief Justice
                         Earl Warren to President George W. Bush. Kyvig is not alone in suggesting
                         that we have entered a new &quot;age of impeachment&quot; in which
                         political conflict routinely involves the use of such unconventional
                         weapons.</p>
                    <p>The book is not organized to systematically examine that thesis, however.
                         Instead it provides a case-by-case study of episodes in which serious
                         arguments were made for impeaching a federal official since 1960,
                         beginning with Earl Warren and running through Bill Clinton. The chap-
                         ters cover a range of figures in between, from Abe Fortas and William O.
                         Douglas, Spiro Agnew and Richard Nixon, to Ronald Reagan and Harry
                         Claiborne, Walter Nixon and Alcee Hastings. The individual chapters are
                         fascinating, and bring to light new detail on the controversies and
                         politics surrounding these figures. They will be essential reading for any-
                         one interested in any of these individuals. Even in discussing well-worn
                         cases, such as the criticisms of Earl Warren&apos;s tenure on the
                         Court, Kyvig is able to find new angles and materials to advance our
                         understanding of these episodes. He offers less support <pb n="296"
                              id="VAA4025-105-3-104"/> for the claim that the last half century is
                         really a distinctive and coherent political era relative to the impeach-
                         ment power. It remains unclear that there are meaningful connections to be
                         drawn between the impeachment and acquittal of Bill Clinton on the one hand
                         and the impeachment and removal of Judge Harry Claiborne on the other.
                         Likewise, there is not enough examination of the pre-1960 period given to
                         evaluate whether the modern era is importantly different from, say, the
                         early twentieth century when five judges were impeached, or the
                         mid-nineteenth century when a variety of officials were impeached,
                         including a president and a cabinet official. This book may not answer the
                         question that Kyvig sets out for it, but it does provide a fine history of
                         modern impeachment threats.</p>

                    <p>In 1970, a multi-ethnic legion of steelworkers and students, housewives and
                         welfare workers, priests and politicians gathered in 
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014319" reg="Hammond">Hammond</settlement></placeName>, Indiana, to
                         organize the Calumet Community Congress (CCC). Endorsed by national
                         Democratic leaders, the CCC sought to marshal local ethnic pride and
                         cooperation behind an agenda of social, economic, and political reform. Two
                         years later, in the 1972 presidential election, Republican incumbent
                         Richard Nixon won northwest Indiana&apos;s vote by promulgating a
                         similar message of ethnic pride and cooperation, only for conservative,
                         not social democratic, causes.</p>
                    <p>What northwest Indiana wrestled with in this brief moment--the fluctuating
                         politics of ethnic identity--the nation grappled with for an entire era.
                         Matthew Jacobson explores this period of ferment in his masterful study,
                              <hi rend="i">Roots Too</hi>. With stunning breadth and scintillating
                         prose, he traces the &quot;ethnic revival&quot; that started in
                         the 1960s and continued unabated through the century&apos;s last
                         decades. The pivot--and much of the focus--of his story is the 1970s, when
                         momentous occasions like the nation&apos;s bicentennial and television
                         broadcast of Alex Haley&apos;s Roots &quot;denoted
                         Americans&apos; heightened self-consciousness about their own roots
                         and about the new, pluralized idioms of national membership&quot; (p.
                         17). Prior to this point, ethnicity had been <pb n="297"
                              id="VAA4025-105-3-105"/> something to hide and overcome for the sake
                         of belonging. But by 1976, Jacobson emphasizes, &quot;after decades of
                         trying to conform ... descendants of earlier European immigrants quit the
                         melting pot&quot; (p. 2).</p>
                    <p>What precipitated this change in thinking? Jacobson offers many reasons,
                         all stemming from exhaustive study of myriad intellectuals, politicians,
                         organizations, and &quot;culture industries&quot; (especially
                         television and Hollywood). Part of the shift, he acknowledges, had to do
                         with a third generation of immigrant Americans yearning for the stability
                         of heritage in a time of chaotic change. But Jacobson also moves past
                         this rendering of ethnic revival, fleshed out elsewhere by historians, to
                         dissect its racial and political composition. Here his insights sparkle
                         with fresh significance. Jacobson argues that the ethnic awakening
                         occurred &quot;precisely when the American color line was sharpening in
                         new ways&quot; (p. 35). As a deliberate response to the political
                         empowerment civil rights bestowed on racial minorities, white Americans
                         rallied behind a revised sense of superiority. A myth of &quot;<geogName key="tgn_7014105" reg="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</geogName>
                         whiteness&quot; was forged in this context, and a different
                         notion of &quot;<placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>
                         &quot; created, one that attributed
                         authentic citizenship to those whose forbearers had once been part of a
                         diaspora that suffered, sacrificed, and strove. Italian, Irish, Jewish,
                         Polish, and other once-marginalized &quot;hyphened Amer-
                         icans&quot; now joined White Anglo Saxon Protestants in collectively
                         evoking the fable of individual initiative and in redrawing the boundaries
                         of true Americanness by making &quot;Caucasian&quot; normative (p.
                         179). This act of exclusion, however, also allowed white ethnic
                         Americans to brush off responsibility for the systemic mistreatment of
                         racial minorities; they too, after all, had once felt the pain of prejudice
                         in an unjust social order, but through perseverance and hard work (not
                         special privilege and government assistance, this trope emphasized) had
                         risen above their circumstances.</p>
                    <p>Herein lies the crux of <hi rend="i">Roots Too</hi>. Although Jacobson spends
                         most of his time recounting with rich detail the cultural manifestations of
                         the new ethnicity, politics remains his bottom line. He rightly emphasizes
                         that the new ethnicity flourished because of progressive Democratic as well
                         as conservative Republican politics. Post-civil-rights-era liberalism came
                         to celebrate diversity, rather than assume consensus, and to make mul-
                         ticulturalism a central plank in its platform. Liberal feminists, he adds,
                         tapped romanticized notions of their grandmothers for inspiration in the
                         fight for equal rights. Jacobson also insists that the new ethnicity
                         allowed the Republican right to tilt the culture wars in its favor by
                         appealing to &quot;traditional&quot; values of individual ini-
                         tiative and community, and by tapping extant frustrations with the civil
                         rights movement. Indiana&apos;s flip-flop politics in the early 1970s
                         were, in this way, indicative of much larger, <pb n="298"
                              id="VAA4025-105-3-106"/> violent swings across the nation, swings that
                         continue to the present day. Indeed, in his final chapter, Jacobson makes
                         it clear that the bipartisan quest to define diversity&apos;s prop-
                         er place in &quot;an increasingly uneasy &apos;nation of
                         immigrants&quot;&apos; remains as hotly contested as ever, with the
                         stakes higher than ever before. Though willing to raise more doubts than
                         certainties about the nation&apos;s future course in this matter, he
                         predicts that any proposed solutions will legitimate &quot;idioms of
                         white primacy&quot; as readily as they open up avenues for inclusion
                         and assimilation (p. 388).</p>

                    <p>Gallagher looks at four basic concepts about the war: the Confederacy as
                         a glorious &quot;Lost Cause&quot; pitted against the industrial
                         might of the North, the &quot;Union Cause&quot; to maintain the
                         republic, the &quot;Emancipation Cause&quot; of a war to free the
                         slaves, and the &quot;Reconciliation Cause,&quot; which Gallagher
                         calls &quot;an attempt by white people North and South to extol the
                         American virtues both sides manifested during the war, to exalt the
                         restored nation that emerged from the conflict, and to mute the role of
                         African Americans&quot; (p. 2). He is concerned with the influence of
                         these ideas on the motion picture industry, and with Hollywood&apos;s
                         transmission of these images to the general public. He also is interested
                         in the paintings, illustrations, and sculptures that he considers
                         &quot;popular art&quot; about the Civil War.</p>
                    <p>In the past twenty years, general interest in the war has increased, due
                         perhaps to the popular success of Ken Burns&apos;s 1990 eleven-hour
                         documen- <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-105-3-107"/> tary. As many as forty
                         million people watched all or part of the Public Broadcasting series, which
                         turned &quot;talking head&quot; Shelby Foote into a star and
                         greatly increased the sales of his three-volume narrative about the war
                         (pp. 5-6). Gallagher does not spend much time with television, despite the
                         fact that it is our most popular medium. Many more people have seen images
                         of the Civil War on the small screen than on the big screen. The
                         made-for-television version of Alex Haley&apos;s <hi rend="i"
                              >Roots</hi> was enormously popular and influential, and television
                         has brought <hi rend="i">Gone With the Wind</hi> to each new generation of
                         viewers. Gallagher also does not spend much time with the influence of
                         the thousands of novels written about the Civil War. Instead, he emphasizes
                         recent movies and illustrations.</p>
                    <p>The Civil War has been a topic for painters and other illustrators ever since
                         the war itself. Newspaper readers of the time saw the war through the
                         eyes of these illustrators, since photographs were not yet being pub-
                         lished. Gallagher&apos;s discussion of Civil War popular art in the
                         nineteenth century is particularly interesting. The battle images of that
                         time glorified either the Confederate Lost Cause or the Union Cause, and
                         many of these paintings and sculptures still grace our public spaces. But
                         Gallagher has chosen to emphasize the past twenty years, and some of these
                         more recent Civil War illustrations feature images of Robert E. Lee that
                         look more like a movie actor portraying Lee than like the general
                         himself.</p>
                    <p>There are many books about movies and the Civil War. Some try to cover
                         everything, and some discuss only a single film. Gallagher is a brilliant
                         historian who has written a very valuable book about the influence of
                         Hollywood and popular art on our images of the Civil War. Everything
                         Gallagher does he does with intelligence and style, but he has chosen not
                         to write a big book on everything he knows about the influence of movies,
                         novels, television, and popular art on our concepts of the Lost Cause,
                         the Union Cause, the Emancipation Cause, and the Reconciliation Cause.
                         The definitive work on this subject has not yet been written, and one can
                         only hope that someone like Gallagher will complete the task.</p>

                         Halfway through Jessamyn West&apos;s prolific career she wrote the
                         novel <hi rend="i">Leafy Rivers</hi> (1967). Like much of West&apos;s
                         fiction, the work is set in the Midwest during the early nineteenth century
                         and is centered on the life of a female protagonist of Quaker origins,
                         named Mary Pratt Converse Rivers (aka Leafy). As a young bride, Leafy
                         wonders whether she will ever live a life of genuine fulfillment. To aid
                         Leafy in this process, West writes a rich cast of characters including
                         Leafy&apos;s incompetent husband, Reno; Simon Yanders, a man whose
                         previous suffering causes him to recognize the power of goodwill; and the
                         eccentric Cashie Wade. With their help, Leafy faces the challenges of
                         raising a family in an uncultivated land.</p>

                         years ago. Part two goes on to describe the diverse ecological regions that

                         animal life these ecosystems now sustain. Part four &quot;focuses on
                         the sweeping changes that have rolled across Indiana&quot; and
                         discusses how &quot;the value of our natural resources is determined by
                         our perceptions&quot; of the environment (pp. 359, 383). In light of
                         this tension, parts five and six conclude by delving into the history and
                         present status of conservationist efforts across the state, so that
                         Hoosiers can &quot;reconnect in a more meaningful way to what remains
                         natural in their landscape&quot;; this, according to Jackson, is the
                         book&apos;s &quot;primary objective&quot; (p. 437).</p>

                         derive from a Penn State lecture series on the Civil War era. Silber
                         draws on a wide range of scholarship, from studies of women during the
                         Revolutionary era to studies on why men fought during the Civil War, to
                         examine the roles Northern and Southern women played both during and
                         after the conflict. She posits that different ideas about women&apos;s
                         sphere and their public and private roles in society led to differing
                         ideas about how they should behave in a time of war. She also examines how
                         Northern women&apos;s more public and political activism during the war
                         was paralleled by Southern women&apos;s work after the war,
                         commemorating Confederate soldiers and promoting the ideology of the Lost
                         Cause. </p>

                         well-produced volume begins with two essays--one by Michael Fellman on the
                         importance of photography and particularly of the carte de visite in the
                         Civil War, and the second by the author, detailing his research into the
                         lives of a group of Confederate soldiers. The bulk of the text consists of
                         brief, informative biographical sketches of seventy-seven Southern
                         soldiers, each accompanied by an original photograph of the man.
                         Coddington&apos;s research in manuscript collections, newspapers,
                         regimental histories, and soldiers&apos; memoirs has yielded a
                         fascinating volume which anyone interested in the Civil War will enjoy
