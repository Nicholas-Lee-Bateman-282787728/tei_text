                    <byline>OWEN V JOHNSON</byline>


                    <p>Famed journalist and war correspondent Ernie Pyle was a year out of high
                         school when he came to Indiana University (IU) in September 1919. He
                         appears not yet to have been outside the states of <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> and
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251" reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName>.
                         Four years later he had become a world traveler, holding a position with an
                         up-and-coming daily newspaper in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7015717" reg="District of Columbia">Washington, D.C.</settlement></placeName>, where his assignments
                         included covering a speech by the president of the <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>. During
                         his student years, &quot;[Pyle] became a part of the University
                         life-interested, loyal and friendly,&quot; as Herman B Wells, his classmate
                         and later president of the university, recalled a short time after the
                         journalist&apos;s death. &quot;We feel that his years at Indiana prepared
                         him for his active newspaper career which reached such a climax of acclaim
                         and of tragedy.&quot;<hi rend="sup">1</hi> But as Lawrence Wheeler,
                         executive director of the IU Foundation, told Lee Miller, Pyle&apos;s first
                         biographer, &quot;There has been a good deal of misinformation used in
                         connection with Ernie&apos;s time [at IU].&quot;<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p>

                    <p>Pyle entered IU as a farm boy who spoke in an easy rural <placeName><region
                         type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> dialect, and
                         emerged as someone who loved to write in a polished, but everyday style.
                         Arriving at IU as a country hick and blackballed by a fraternity his
                         freshman year, he would a year later pledge another fraternity and become a
                         well-known and much-loved &quot;big man on campus.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Like many freshmen even today, Pyle acclimated slowly to the more challenging
                         academic environment in college. In fact, during his first two years he
                         garnered mostly Bs and Cs, with an English class and a journalism class
                         drawing his best grades. In his junior and senior years he received all Bs
                         and As, an impressive accomplishment given the multiplicity of his campus
                              activities.<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p>
                    <p>Pyle&apos;s surviving correspondence with his family back home in Dana offers
                         us some insight into his IU experiences and provides evi- dence of his
                         intellectual and social growth at IU. As would be the case in most of his
                         voluminous correspondence later in life, he saw his letters from
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"
                                   reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName> as a kind
                         of conversation with people. He wrote mostly about things which he knew
                         would interest his family members. None of them—father Will, mother Maria,
                         and Aunt Mary—had gone past eighth grade.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> In the dozen
                         surviving letters we see almost nothing about the intellectual climate of
                         the campus and only passing references to his classes, factors that may
                         have been very influential in his life. All of Pyle&apos;s letters to his
                         family are signed Ernest, which is what he was always called by family
                              members.<hi rend="sup">5</hi></p>

                         in an effort to understand how his <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         that we frequently can predict a youngster&apos;s future from his college

                    <p>Pyle&apos;s first contact with IU was a letter of inquiry, written more than
                         a year after he was graduated from Helt Township High School and shortly
                         after his return from a brief volunteer stint in the Navy. The university
                         to which Pyle was requesting admission comprised only fifteen buildings,
                         but it was on the threshold of significant change. &quot;Indiana <list

                         academically among the Big Ten universities of the upper Midwest,&quot;
                         historian Howard H. Peckham writes. &quot;It seemed parochial in that,
                         until after World War I, it was full of native students and native
                              faculty.&quot;<hi rend="sup">8</hi> That had begun to change with the
                         arrival of World War I veterans who had seen more of the world than their
                         cohorts of earlier years. The university hired new faculty members as
                         enrollment surged above 2,300 by 1919. With rooming houses, fraternities,
                         and sororities providing the chief source of local housing, IU faced a
                         challenge accommodating its new students.</p>
                    <p>Pyle&apos;s two letters from his freshman year (1919-20) show that he still
                         belonged to the country, both in speech and interests. He was blackballed
                         that year by the Kappa Sigma fraternity, perhaps because of his country
                         roots. By the end of the first semester of his sophomore year, however,
                         Pyle had pledged Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and moved into the
                         fraternity house. Fraternity life provided him an entree to such campus
                         social rituals as dating and &quot;boress&quot; sessions. As Wells wrote in
                         his memoirs, <quote rend="blockquote">At night with studies completed, &quot;boress&quot;
                              sessions, the rap sessions of today, formed around the den fireplace

                              running until the small hours of the morning. On the spur of the

                              the game was played at home or away, and the score little altered the

                    <p>One letter dated May 22, 1921, written near the end of his sophomore year,
                         provides interesting evidence of Pyle&apos;s intellectual and social growth
                         at IU. It also offers the first hint of his desire to travel. But for the
                         bulk of our evidence of Pyle&apos;s college days, we turn to the letters
                         written in his junior year, when his grades improved and he took on
                         leadership positions in campus activities. Pyle had served as city editor
                         of the <hi rend="i">Daily Student</hi> during the fall semester of 1921.

                    <p>An important clue to Pyle&apos;s development appears in his reference to a
                         &quot;geology&quot; class he was taking—in fact a geography class taught by
                         Professor Stephen S. Visher. Pyle clearly was much taken with Visher&apos;s
                         wide travel experience and with the enthusiasm he conveyed in talking about
                         his travels during class. One day after class Visher gave Pyle one of his
                         articles—we cannot know which one, because Visher published six articles in
                         1921 and sixteen in 1922 (in addition to co-authoring a book).
                         Visher&apos;s enthusiasm for travel is evident in an article he wrote for
                         IU&apos;s <hi rend="i">Alumni Quarterly</hi> describing his journey to

                         easily conclude that Visher provided him with his inspiration to make that

                              rend="sup">19</hi> Pyle wrote several letters to his family on that
                         trip, one of which is included here because it provides an early example of
                         his descriptive travel observations.</p>
                    <p>No letters survive from Pyle&apos;s final full semester at IU (September
                         1922-January 1923), when he enrolled in seven classes totaling seventeen
                         hours of credit. Perhaps the most interesting to us is Philosophy 43a,
                         &quot;Life Views of Great Men of Letters,&quot; taught by a team of
                         prominent professors-including IU president William Lowe Bryan, as well as
                         the chairs of the departments of Fine Arts, Romance Languages, Government,
                         English, Latin, German, and Economics and Sociology. It seems likely that
                         the course was designed for campus leaders such as Pyle, who in the same
                         semester would earn a football letter (for his service as student manager)
                         and would garner the <hi rend="i">Daily Student</hi>&apos;s distinction as &quot;the most
                         versatile man on campus.&quot;<hi rend="sup">20</hi></p>

                    <p>In the end, Pyle&apos;s surviving IU letters only hint at his experience and
                         development in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"

                         there would not interest his family. Almost never did he comment on the
                         content of his courses. He wrote almost nothing about his many travels with
                         athletic teams, perhaps not wanting to worry the folks at home. On the
                         other hand, he was confident that they would appreciate his status as a big
                         man on campus, participating actively in the Greek system, supporting the
                         memorial fund drive, and working at the student newspaper. The way in which
                         Pyle continued to respond to and talk about people and events in Dana
                         suggests that when he sat down to write he had a picture in his mind of his
                         parents or aunt sitting around the kitchen table. It is an image that may
                         have served him well when he became a columnist and war correspondent. The
                         letters also show his gradually improving ability to tell a story, although
                         they were not the single-subject accounts that his columns would be.
                         Instead the letters took shape as vignettes in which Pyle played a
                         role.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps Pyle himself did not consciously think about how his maturation at IU
                         changed both him and his writing. He did recognize when the opportunity
                         came to take a job and leave IU, and he did not hesitate. He was confident
                         in his ability to survive in the outside world.</p>
                    <p>Pyle&apos;s college letters betray no sense of unhappiness with his
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"

                         of a mystery. It has often been read as reflecting the heartbreak that
                         supposedly came from the failure of his romance. In fact, a closer reading
                         of that column suggests that Pyle knew that his time in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437" reg="Bloomington">Bloomington</settlement></placeName> was

                              work any either.</p>
                         <p>Glad your hogs did so well. That will help out a right smart on your
                              machine. Wish Will would sell his mules and get a Ford. If I was
                              Beatrice, I would make him. I&apos;ll bet Jack is cute. Can he talk
                              any yet?</p>
                         <p>I had my pictures taken the other day, and am sending you one. Tell Mama
                              I intended to send theirs in the letter last night but forgot it, so
                              will send it the next time.</p>

                              <salute>Dear Auntie,</salute></opener>
                         <p>Received your letter this morning and will answer before I lay it away
                              and forget it. Also got one from Thad. He is still going to school and
                              is taking Spanish. I guess he likes it fine down at El Paso. I
                              don&apos;t know whether he is going to stay there after he finishes
                              school or not.</p>
                         <p>It was too bad about Frank Randolph getting killed. He always was rather
                              reckless anyway. He turned their Ford over the first week they had it.
                              I suppose you did hear a lot about the boys last week-end. Mary Alice
                              and Catherine each wrote me a letter, and that was all they talked
                              about. They will get over that foolishness when they get a little
                              older. Mary Alice ought to get a pretty nice fellow, she&apos;s pretty
                              and seems to have a right smart of sense.</p>
                         <p>I guess papa is having a high time at <placeName><settlement type="city"

                              didn&apos;t know whether he would be back by Christmas or not. I hope
                              he is for Mama&apos;s sake. Too bad Bobby is sick. Hope there[&apos;]s
                              nothing serious the matter with him. I guess Fred Bales is the only
                              one of the boys in school as Carl is working in <placeName><settlement

                              bad the boys can[&apos;]t come over Christmas.</p>
                         <p>I suppose mama told you about our dance Saturday night. We had a
                              wonderful time and everybody was carried away with the music. I am
                              invited to two sorority dances this weekend. Have never seen
                              Harold&apos;s girl since that day we met her here.</p>
                         <p>It is trying to rain this morning. It is lots warmer and I expect it
                              will rain and then start to snowing or something. I dread to see the

                              so [I] could get to make some of those trips. They went all thru the
                              south this spring on their training trips, and went to

                              day and got to go all thru the state penitentiary.</p>
                         <p>Two weeks from today I will be on my way home. We have classes all this
                              week and examinations the next week. Next Monday is Memorial Day and
                              we don[&apos;]t have any classes on the following Tuesday either so I
                              won[&apos;]t have much to do the last week of school. Our dance is the
                              night before I come home. My buddy from <placeName><settlement

                              come as they are covered up with work in the offices up there. There
                              are lots of dances now that the warm weather has come. I am going to
                              two sorority dances this week and one next week end besides ours.</p>
                         <p>The campus is as pretty as can be now. Everything is in bloom. I wish
                              you and the folks could get some one to do the chores for you for one
                              even[in]g and drive down on Saturday June 4th, and then we could drive
                              back home the next day. I expect you will all be too busy or
                              won[&apos;]t want to leave your chickens. I know that it is pretty
                              hard to get away this time of the year.</p>
                         <p>I am glad that the sore on your head didn[&apos;]t prove to be a cancer.
                              How is it getting by this time[?] Well I must close and get to

                         <p>It is awfully cold up here, have to wear sweaters &amp; pea-coats. I
                              don&apos;t have to be on deck in the cold tho, because it is warm in
                              the galley where I work, &amp; when I am off duty I loaf below. I go
                              to work at 1 p.m., work till 9:30 that night, get up at 3:30 and work
                              till 1 the next day without a stop, then I have 24 hrs. with nothing
                              to do.</p>
                         <p>They put me to firing the next day after we left Chi. I fired 2 days and
                              accidentally dropped a slice bar on my foot &amp; almost broke it, so
                              I wasn&apos;t able to fire any more, &amp; they put me on this galley
                              job. Talk about this being a vacation, I will need one when I get
                              out.</p>
                         <p>Was in <placeName><country key="tgn_7005685" reg="Canada">Canada</country></placeName> Sunday morning. We went thru the locks at Sue Saint Marie
                              - I went on the Canadian shore to help with the lines. I wrote you a
                              card Sat. thinking we would dock at Mackinack, but we only stopped in
                              the harbor about a half hour, &amp; they didn&apos;t take mail off, so
                              I suppose it was mailed at the Sue the next morning.</p>
                         <p>This kid that was at Champaign with me and I hang together as much as
                              possible as we are about the only two of the same type on the ship.
                              Most of the rest are rough-necks, typical sailors. Don&apos;t know
                              when I will be home but I expect about a week from Sunday. We will get
                              to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013622" reg="Duluth"
                                        >Duluth</settlement></placeName> about Thursday, &amp; not
                              start back till about Sat. Then we will get in <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> about Friday
                              &amp; they will probably hold us a day or two to clean up the
                              ship.</p>
                         <p>I am getting plenty of good stuff to eat, that&apos;s one consolation.
                              We met four other battleships at the Sue, and they are still with us,
                              sailing in fleet formation. We had an awful storm Sunday night,
                              lightning, wind &amp; rain. My razor was stolen last night, I&apos;m
                              glad I didn&apos;t bring my watch. I will have to write Mr. Davis that
                              it is impossible to write anything while on board this wagon, but will
                              try &amp; write him a little when I get home. Maybe you had better
                              call him then. If I don&apos;t find time to drop him a line he
                              won&apos;t be looking for it.</p>
                         <p>They called for painters the other day and I painted the hammock
                              nettings, the booms &amp; part of the stacks. It is time for me to go
                              to work, so I must close. Tell Auntie hello. How is the painting
                              coming, about to run out of anything to do?</p>

                              <salute>Dear Auntie,</salute></opener>
                         <p>It is raining tonight so I am reading magazines and writing a few
                              letters. I have gotten so I like to write letters when I have time. It
                              has been very warm all week and began raining last night, so I presume
                              it will turn good and cold about tomorrow. My cold is almost well,
                              altho&apos; I am a little hoarse at times.</p>
                         <p>Things have been very dull this week, as it is hard for everyone to get
                              settled down to studying again after vacation days. We have just two
                              more weeks until final examinations, then the semester will be over.
                              It ends Jan. 29th I believe, on Friday. The second semester starts on
                              Monday. I haven&apos;t been able to get much news for the
                              &quot;[Indiana Daily] Student&quot; this week as campus activities
                              have not yet gotten back into full swing. From now on tho&apos; I
                              expect news will be more abundant, I am working in my spare time on a
                              bulletin which the fraternity is putting out the first of Feb.</p>
                         <p>I suppose you would like to hear a little about my trip, so I will tell
                              you about it. I went to <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_2031401" reg="Clinton">Clinton</settlement></placeName> Friday afternoon with Paul and his
                              girl, and had to wait there until 2 o&apos;clock the next morning. It
                              was an awfully long wait, but finally passed away. I slept all the
                              way from there to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                                   reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName>, and got into Englewood at 7 o&apos;clock.
                              On the way to Jack&apos;s house I passed University Ave. on 55th St.
                              and saw Mary and Anna&apos;s house, but didn&apos;t go see them. I got
                              to Jack&apos;s just as he was getting up and he had to work, so I went
                              to bed and slept till noon. In the afternoon his two sisters and I
                              went to a picture show downtown, and after that I went to Jack&apos;s
                              office and the girls went on home.</p>
                         <p>In the evening, Jack and I went to a musical show - &quot;Cinderella on
                              Broadway&quot; - which was very good. I called Sullivan up Sunday noon
                              - tried to get him Sat. and couldn&apos;t - and learned that his wife
                              had taken pneaumonia [sic] fever and that they had gone home. Jack and
                              I took a walk Sunday afternoon and in the evening we stayed at home
                              and visited with his folks and looked at some pictures he had. </p>

                         <p>His father and mother are very nice, as well as his sisters. They are
                              very refined and cultured people, but not the least bit
                              &quot;stuck-up.&quot; His sisters, I would judge are about thirty
                              years old. One of them works in a bank and the other stays at home.
                              They are only about 4 blocks from Aunt Nancy&apos;s house.</p>
                         <p>I left <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> at 8:30 Monday morning, and got in here about 4 in the
                              evening. Our train killed a woman just north of here. She was a deaf
                              woman walking along the track and didn&apos;t hear the train coming. I
                              had a very pleasant trip and do not regret having gone. I think Jack
                              will spend a week-end with me here in the spring.</p>
                         <p>I think I will make all my work this semester, altho&apos; there&apos;s
                              one short course in Economics I&apos;m a little doubtful of. However
                              I&apos;m carrying enough extra work tho&apos;, that it doesn&apos;t
                              matter if I should drop a little.</p>
                         <p>I wonder if papa is able to be out all the time now. He said his cold
                              didn&apos;t seem to improve much. Well, I must close as it is getting
                              late. Tell Uncle George hello.</p>

                         <p>I will write y[o]u a few lines to let you know that I am all right, but
                              haven[&apos;]t much time right now to write bec[au]se I just got back
                              from the office. It is 7 o[&apos;]clock and I worked thru the dinner
                              hour because we had so much copy piled up, and I am going to see my
                              girl tonight.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> This week is the first time that I
                              haven[&apos;]t worked every week night for about three months. I have
                              been promoted to News Editor and just have to work at night every
                              other week now. I work all afternoon until about 6 o[&apos;]clock
                              usually, then next week I will have to work till about 1 o&apos;clock
                              at night but not in the afternoon. I am going to work hard and I think
                              I [c]an be editor next year but don[&apos;]t say anything about
                              it.</p>
                         <p>It has been pouring down rain all day today and is still raining. We
                              started classes today and I have to carry some extra work because I
                              couldn[&apos;]t get any 2-hour cou[r]ses unless I would take them at 8
                              o[&apos;] clock and I couldn[&apos;]t get up for an 8 o[&apos;] clock
                              after working till mid- night, so I took a three hour course at eleven
                              instead, which makes me carry an hour extra work, but that
                              won[&apos;]t be much. My courses are harder this semester than they
                              were last and I don[&apos;]t expect I will make as good grades as I
                              did last, but I am going to work hard anyway.<hi rend="sup">65</hi> I
                              didn[&apos;]t have to buy any books at all last semester but I had to
                              cut loose for $7 wor [th] of books today and am not thru yet.</p>

                              <salute>Dear Folks:-</salute></opener>
                         <p>I got your letter yesterday morning and was glad to hear from you, of
                              course. I got a letter from Klink this morning and he is coming down
                              either this week-end or next.</p>
                         <p>I also got a letter from Paul Sturm this morning and he is all worked
                              up. He said Doc called him home and accused he and the rest of us of
                              being drunk when they were down here for the Purdue game. It&apos;s an
                              outrage, and makes me so mad I can&apos;t see straight. It&apos;s just
                              like someone said once, no matter how hard you may work to get to
                              the top, there[&apos;]s always someone waiting there to kick you
                              down.</p>
                         <p>I don&apos;t know who started such a story, but Paul thinks Earl
                              Thomasmyer did it over jealously over Opal.<hi rend="sup">67</hi> Paul
                              said Earl told that Paul wouldn&apos;t hardly associate with his dad
                              while they were down here. I can account for every minute the boys
                              spent here, and if he still insists that Paul and I were drunk, I can
                              prove it to him.</p>
                         <p>Some day he&apos;s going to pop off to me and I&apos;m going to tell him
                              what I think of him. I wonder how he thinks I could spend 8 hours a
                              day working on the Student, make the highest grades in the fraternity,
                              and go with one of the most highly respected girls in school if I was
                              a drunkard?</p>
                         <p>There are three forms of dissipation that I absolutely do not 
                              participate in, and those are gambling, drinking and running with wild
                              women, and I defy anyone to say they ever saw me do any of them. I
                              guess papa ought to know whether I acted like I was drunk or not. You
                              can tell Doc Sturm where to go, and if you don&apos;t, I will.</p>

                              before I start studying. I put on my blue suit today for the first
                              time in about a month and I had fallen off so much I could hardly keep
                              my pants on. I hadn&apos;t noticed it before.</p>
                         <p>Yesterday morning I wrote over a thousand words of &quot;dope&quot; on
                              the Memorial drive for the downtown papers.<hi rend="sup">70</hi>
                              Yesterday I had a couple of passes to &quot;The Merchant of

                              is too silly and nonsensical to dwell upon. Remember that a dirty lie

                              It is interesting but a pretty deep subject for me to be writing on.
                              Next week I have to write on &quot;Socialism.&quot; I am going to make
                              50 cents this afternoon by writing a song for a Pi Phi pledge that has
                              to have a sorority song for initiation. Klink didn&apos;t come this
                              week-end or last either. I haven&apos;t heard from him since he wrote
                              that he was coming.</p>
                         <p>John is feeling allright now. He passed all his work &amp; will be
                              initiated. I think initiation is March 9. Yes, Buck is still pledged,
                              I hope he will make his work this semester, if he does he will be
                              initiated about the time school is out. How is papa feeling by this
                              time? You must be careful for there is a lot of sickness now. A girl
                              died at Residence Hall Friday night. Paul wrote me that Spence quit
                              school. I guess he flunked out in some of his work.</p>
                         <p>Glad your chickens and lambs are doing well. Did you get the [Indiana
                              Daily] Students I sent the first of the week? Well, I don&apos;t think
                              of anymore to write so will close. Ward Gilbert, an S.A.E. that is
                              married and lives here in town, invited Harriett and I up to spend the

                              <pb n="223" id="VAA4025-107-3-035"/> your letter this morning and will
                              answer it now while I have a little time. It was awfully warm
                              yesterday and started raining last night and is turning colder
                              today. I suppose we will have quite a bit of winter weather yet before
                              spring comes.</p>
                         <p>Yesterday, being Geor[ge] Washington&apos;s birthday was a holiday, so
                              there were no classes. I wrote stuff for the Memorial drive all
                              forenoon and then had a date and went to the show in the afternoon.
                              The Tri Delts had initiation yesterday and Harriett was initiated. She
                              was awfully proud of her pin and kept looking at it last night but she
                              will get over that before long. She wanted me to go to
                                        <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                                        reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> to
                              the Tri Delt State dance the 11th of next month with her but I told
                              her that I didn[&apos;]t have enough money so wouldn[&apos;]t go. I
                              expect I could make the trip on six or seven dollars but I
                              didn[&apos;]t care much about going anyway.</p>
                         <p>Our cook hurt her knee Sunday and we didn[&apos;]t serve any meals at
                              the house till yesterday so we had to eat around. I was invited out to
                              dinner most of the time so didn[&apos;]t have to buy much stuff.
                              Yesterday was so warm some of the boys went hiking out in the country.
                              I think I will go some of these times when it gets warm and I have
                              time. Buck&apos;s girl is a Tri Delt and she was initiated yesterday
                              too.</p>
                         <p>Glad you have lots of lambs and that they are doing well. Are you going
                              to raise as many chickens this year as usual[?] Wish you
                              wouldn[&apos;]t work so hard with them. I hav[e]n&apos;t written to
                              Thad since Xmas so I don[&apos;]t know what he is doing. I suppose if
                              he did do anything wrong though Sturm&apos;s would make the most of
                              it. I get so mad [I] almost tremble every time I think of their names.
                              It&apos;s a wonder to me that Paul is as good a boy as he is the way
                              they nag at him. If he was brought up right in the first place he is
                              old enough now to know what is right and what is wrong without them
                              constantly nagging at him. I expect it will do him lots of good to go
                              to church when they write and tell him he has to go. I very seldom go
                              to church, but I&apos;ll bet that I do more thinking on the church and
                              religious subjects than Doc Sturm does in a year.</p>
                         <p>That dance where they tried to dance by wireless music was last Saturday
                              night at the Student Building. I wasn[&apos;]t there as that was the
                              night that I went to the Sigma Kappa house dance. I heard all about it
                              [th]o. They had their wires all strung and were going to catch some
                              music from Pittsburgh, but the air was so damp that they
                              couldn[&apos;]t do it so they wound up a phonograph over in Science
                              Hall and played into the amplifier and no one ever knew the <pb

                              all-right. I wrote her a long time ago but I don[&apos;]t think she
                              has ever written to me.</p>
                         <p>I have a test the first of the week in Geology. I was in this
                              man[&apos;]s class two years ago and I think he likes me pretty well.
                              The other day he gave me an autographed copy of a booklet he wrote. He
                              has been in every country in the world and he talks about his travels
                              [q]uite a lot in class which of course interests me very much.<hi

                         <p>I didn&apos;t get to write to you yesterday so I will peck you off a few
                              lines now. I got papa&apos;s letter and yours Tuesday. We have been
                              working pretty hard this week getting out a seven column paper and I
                              have to write five themes for my sociology te[a]cher.<hi rend="sup"

                         <p>The weather has been real cold here for several d[ay]s but it is
                              beginning to warm up now. Maybe spring will be here in a few days. I
                              am going to the Men&apos;s Panhellenic formal dance Saturday night.
                              Each fraternity was entitled to ten tickets and only one person in

                         <p>Well, the drive went over at midnight last night and I am sure not a bit
                              sorry, for it means that most of our hard work is over. The drive
                              opened at 5 o&apos;clock Tuesday evening after a wonderful mass
                              meeting in the Men&apos;s Gymnasium. We put out an extra at [?] p.m.
                              that evening and another at midnight besides the regular morning
                              edition. I worked almost all night that night and was up and at it
                              again early the next morning. The campaign officials worked all night
                              soliciting subscriptions and tabulating results. Our fraternity was
                              one of the first to pledge 100 percent, that is, everybody in the
                              fraternity pledged to the drive. I pledged $200, payable within ten

                         <p>Yesterday was a holiday and now since the drive has gone over the goal

                              extra yesterday at noon and then the drive went over the top at about
                              midnight and we put out another extra then. They had an all night
                              celebration on the campus but I was so nearly worn out that I went

                         <p>Johnny and Buck pledged $100 apiece, I think. Lots of fellows pledged

                              their way thru school, and then a lot of rich people were Bolshevics
                              [sic] and wouldn[&apos;]t pledge a thing. Those that could pledge and
                              didn[&apos;]t are sure going to be disgraced around here. It[&apos;]s
                              funny that the roads are so bad around home, they are pretty good

                              Montana at 5 p.m. Monday and then were in the foothills of the
                              Rockies, It is just 30 miles north of Yellowstone park and we saw the
                              railroad that led down to the park and could also see the top of a
                              mountain that was in the park. It got dark before we got into the
                              highest mountains, but we woke up in <placeName><region type="state"

                              next morning in the midst of them. The scenery is wonderful, I cannot
                              attempt to describe it. Papa can tell you how wonderful the mountain
                              scenery is better than I can in a letter. We soon were in

                              I would rather live in this district than any other. After passing
                              thru these we came into a desert and rode for about five hours without
                              seeing a living thing. It is a disheartening sight, part of the <list

                              Pacific. We slept in our seats all of the time and were not a bit worn
                              out when we got here. I got more sleep on the trip than I had any
                              night for the last three months. We went to a hotel and stayed all
                              night and the next morning I went to the post office and had a letter
                              from Harriett. We then went to see if our passports were here and they
                              were not but they issued us special series passports. Benham and
                              Cooper then went to get something to eat and Kaiser and I went and
                              looked Mr. Hammond up. He directed us to Captain Smith of the United
                              States shipping board and we went to see him and told him what we
                              wanted. He said he didn&apos;t have the authority to do anything for
                              us but he called up Captain Payne of the Sea Service Bureau and made
                              an appointment with him for us and told him that he would like to see
                              us get on. Captain Payne was awfully nice to us and told us he would
                              do all he could for us but said that there was no hopes for the other
                              two boys because they would be lucky if they found room for we two. On
                              that afternoon we went out to the ship and reported to the chief
                              steward and he told us we could come on the next morning at 8
                              o&apos;clock, and told us to go to the second steward and get a pass
                              to come on board the ship whenever we wanted to. So we went to the
                              second steward, who does the hiring of the crew and he said that he
                              couldn&apos;t use us at all[,] that he had a full crew. So we were
                              pretty downhearted but we went out the next morning and went on board
                              the ship anyway in the hopes that something would turn up. We hung
                              around in the way and finally I guess he got tired of us and told us
                              to get to work. So we worked till one o&apos;clock when they signed
                              the articles to take the voyage. Captain Payne came out and told us
                              that if we would sign up to make the entire round trip that he would
                              get us on, so we did. We worked then for two days on the ship before
                              we sailed. In the meantime the other boys went to Captain Payne and he
                              said he would do all he could for them but that he didn&apos;t think
                              there was any hopes. But yesterday they went to see him and at 10
                              o&apos;clock this morning, just an hour before the vessel sailed. They
                              have jobs as mess boys and we are on as bell boys. Kaiser and I are
                              the only two bell boys on the ship and it keeps us pretty bus[y]
                              running errands but I expect we will get a lot of good tips before we
                              leave the ship.</p>

                         <p>I was interrupted there by a severe case of sea-sickness. This is four
                              days later, but I was only sick half a day. I have been feeling fine
                              ever since but the sea has been so rough that it was impossible to
                              write any. Yesterday we had an awfully heavy sea and about half of the
                              passengers were sick. Ward Gilbert has been sick ever since we left
                              Seattle. I feel sorry for him because he isn&apos;t enjoying the trip
                              as much as he would otherwise. We are just off the coast of
                                        <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7006450"

                              a clear day we could see the mountains in <placeName><region
                                        type="state" key="tgn_7006450" reg="Alaska"
                                   >Alaska</region></placeName>. The sea is getting smoother today
                              and they say that we will have a nice trip from here on in. We four
                              boys sleep in the &quot;glory hole&quot; and have a nice clean bunk. I
                              usually go to bed about 8:30 and get up about 6:30 so you see I am
                              getting about twice as much sleep as I got at school. And then besides
                              I quit work at noon and have all afternoon off and then work from 6
                              till 8 in the evening so I have all afternoon off and I usually sleep
                              there because there is nothing else to do. Now that the sea is
                              smoother I think I will write a few letters and mail them when I get
                              to <placeName><country key="tgn_1000120" reg="Nihon"

                         <p>The baggageman on here, one of the officers, took a liking to us and
                              invited Kaiser and I up in his stateroom last night. He fed us candy
                              and showed us pictures and treated us like we were his own boys. He
                              used to go to the University of Minnesota. Everyone on the ship knows
                              where we are from and the circumstances under which we are here, and
                              everyone treats us fine. Even the tougher gang that have been to sea
                              all their lives do not pick on us because I guess they admire our
                              nerve to start so far,</p>
                         <p>The last letter I got from you was on Friday night before we sailed. It
                              was the one that had the dollar bill and the stamps in it. You said
                              you would write one the next day but if you did I had gone before it

                              with me and then we could go back on the train the next day. I would
                              like for you to meet her and it would be nice if I could drive down
                              and back. The sea is pretty rough today and it is all I can do to keep
                              this typewriter on the table. We passed thru a pretty bad storm the
                              other night and the old boat sure did do some rocking. We have an
                              awfully soft job. Kaiser and I work together and we get up in the
                              morning and scrub our stairway and then one of us stays on the bell
                              for a half day. We have a chair and sit there until a bell rings and
                              then we go to the room that is calling. We make about fifty cents a
                              day on tips. I felt pretty good this morning. I asked the chief
                              steward if Kaiser and I were doing our work satisfactorily and he
                              said, &quot;Yes, I have said it to your back so I will tell you, if
                              every body on the ship did their work as well as you two boys,
                              everything would get along fine.&quot; And it&apos;s very seldom that
                              any of these sailors ever say anything like that. I had a long talk
                              with Dean Edmondson yesterday and said he certainly admired us for
                              this trip and he wants me to write a book about [it] when I get back.
                              If I don&apos;t get the editorship of the Student next fall on account
                              of taking the trip, I think I will not work on the Student at all and
                              will devote all my time to writing a book. I will have a lot of
                              pictures in it and I think I can make a right smart [amount] of money
                              out of it besides the experience. It is getting so rough I can&apos;t
                              keep the typewriter on the table so will have to finish this
                              later.</p>

                                   the assets of the school usually mentioned by its boosters. They
                                   have nothing to say about the remarkable professors whose fame
                                   seems so much greater in the outside world than it does to the
                                   students who work under them. They do not mention the buildings
                                   or equipment or the many advantages carefully compiled in the
                                   school catalog. They do not gather together and present facts

                                   a great school.</p>

                                   of blossoms and new leaves, and when the moon is bright-it is
                                   undeniable that spring is nowhere in the world as it is at
                                   Indiana. They are thinking about the autumn evenings when dusk
                                   has settled and the last cheers have died out over Jordan Field
                                   and another football game has become a memory, another football
                                   game which may or may not have been a victory but which was a
                                   courageous fight by Indiana men whom everyone in school knew and
                                   liked. They are thinking of &quot;pep&quot; meetings and mass
                                   meetings and pow-wows in which Indiana men sounded the ancient
                                   battle cry, where sheepish football captains tried to make
                                   speeches before a howling crowd of students and equally wild old

                    <p>By the second decade of the nineteenth century, Welsh-born businessman turned
                         social reformer Robert Owen was ready to cast his ideas, formed during
                         years of social engineering at his factory in <placeName><settlement

                         the wider world. Between 1813 and 1817, Owen published a series of essays
                         on <hi rend="i">A New View of Society</hi>, in which he put forth his
                         beliefs on individual character and society: &quot;That the character of
                         man is, without a single exception, always formed for him; that it may be,
                         and is chiefly, created by his predecessors .... Man, therefore, never did,
                         nor is it possible he ever can, form his own character.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >2</hi> Because character could only be formed outside the individual,
                         Owen believed that education should be available to people of all ages and
                         all social classes, but especially to young children. Owen also wanted to
                         see communities built around cooperation, human betterment, and a lack of
                         the competition, greed, and other evils that he saw infecting the character
                         of so many children and adults.</p>
                    <p>Owen continued to speak and publish, but at this point in his career he found
                         little support for his ideas in <placeName><country key="tgn_7008653"

                              >3</hi> He longed to build an ideal community that would serve as a
                         proving ground for his theories and a pattern that could be replicated.
                         Owen&apos;s imagined community-with no more than 2,000 people-would provide
                         housing, food, clothing, and basic wants to every inhabitant in return for
                         their labor. The community would emphasize children&apos;s education but
                         would make learning and cultural enrichment available to all. Residents
                         would engage in agriculture and a wide variety of manufacturing
                         enterprises. In August 1824, opportunity presented itself to Owen in the
                         person of an agent representing the Harmony Society, a successful
                         communitarian religious group with a large settlement in southwestern
                         Indiana. The community wanted to sell its lands and all of its buildings;

                         because of the school led by William Maclure; it also became associated

                         1825 into 1828, when the community, beset by economic failures and internal
                         divisions, devolved into an ordinary town, albeit one with some rather
                         extraordinary occupants. Robert Owen had spent much of that period
                         traveling back and forth from the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                         approach to his great experiment. Historian Arthur Bestor describes Owen in
                         1825 as acting &quot;in utter disregard of the fact that he had staked
                         everything upon a crucial experiment. While time ticked away, he turned his
                         back upon the reality which was <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         still undeveloped. A few families had begun to buy land in 1816 and 1817.

                         year could claim thirty families, as well as a log courthouse that also
                         served as the first schoolhouse. The town quickly acquired general
                         merchandise stores, tanneries, blacksmith shops, grain mills and sawmills,
                         carding and fulling mills, taverns, and other small and necessary
                         businesses. Even with this growth, by 1824 the town had only about 400
                         inhabitants. The surrounding rural townships were slowly gaining settlers,
                         who bought eighth, quarter, and half-sections of land on which to establish
                              farms.<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>

                         members signed its constitution, which appears below. There are no physical
                         remains of the community and little evidence of what it was like to live

                    <p>Nineteen men and eight women signed the community&apos;s constitution. Land
                         deed records reveal that twelve of the nineteen men owned land. Nine of the
                         men owned land in Van Buren Township, where the Blue Spring community was
                         located; four men owned town lots in nearby <placeName><settlement

                         men were married, as were seven of the eight women (the other female signer
                         was probably an adult daughter of one of the member couples). Five men had
                         held county-level offices-justice of the peace, recorder, surveyor-or had
                         served on grand juries.<hi rend="sup">12</hi></p>
                    <p>Family ties seem to have been one important element in determining who joined

                         and Elizabeth-signed the constitution. Elizabeth was married to Dudley
                         Smith, another signer; Hannah was married to signer Robert Hamilton; and
                         William was married to Patsy Givens, a relative of signer John Givens. In
                         addition, John Givens was married to Jane Berry and signer Orion Crocker
                         was married to Olivia Berry.</p>

                    <p>The available information suggests that the signers were fairly typical of

                         and extended families. They were neither wealthy nor dirt poor. What were
                         the attractions of this Owenite settlement, that these women and men were
                         willing to pledge themselves to it?</p>
                    <p>We do not know how the Blue Spring members first heard of Owen and his
                         proposal for a new society. Someone may have heard him speak in

                         inspired. Bestor writes that &quot;Owenism was more gospel than
                         theory,&quot; casting Owen as a secular preacher whose theory of social
                         reform was &quot;closely bound up with the personality of its
                         founder.&quot; Bestor&apos;s description is borne out by the memoir of
                         Miner Kellogg, an artist who, as a young boy, spent time in

                         promise &quot;a much happier era in human affairs&quot; and the
                         reformer&apos;s &quot;calm logic and good temper&quot; persuaded the man to

                         did not hear Owen in person, it is likely that newspaper accounts of his
                         speeches made their way to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"

                    <p>Owen&apos;s model of a small community whose members cooperated in
                         agriculture, manufacture, and domestic work would have appealed to young
                         families as well as unmarried men beginning to make their lives on the
                         frontier. Harrison observes that &quot;although the ideology of Owenism was
                         not the product of frontier conditions the communities themselves were in
                         part a response to problems of life on the frontier. ... The Owenite
                         community became in practice, if not always in original intent, a means of
                         coping with such difficulties of pioneer settlement as shortage of capital,
                         technical knowledge and social institutions.&quot; The priority of
                         education-&quot;the basis on which the future prosperity and happiness of
                         the community must be founded&quot; (article 19)-and the guarantee of
                         schooling to every child in the community must have been of particular
                         interest in a county where only a few small schools had been built.<hi

                         future (11); a structure of departments and committees for community
                         administration (14); an educational system which would mold each child into

                         The document also reveals the earliest structure of the community:
                         William B. May, Jonathan Nichols, and John Givens are listed as the
                         &quot;Committee of Management&quot; and Robert Hamilton is identified as
                         the treasurer.<hi rend="sup">15</hi></p>
                    <p>After the constitution, signed by some members on April 10, and by others on
                         April 15 and May 11, the next document related to the community is a land
                         deed for 80 acres (&quot;the West half of the South west quarter&quot;) of
                         section 21 of Van Buren Township. The deed is signed by a &quot;Committee
                         of the Blue Spring Community,&quot; made up of John Givens, Jonathan
                         Nichols, and Coonrod Kerns. No deed records indicate that any of the
                         members who already owned land sold any of that property during the time
                         that the community existed.<hi rend="sup">16</hi></p>

                         also gave information to Richard S. Simons for a 1941 article on the
                         community. Histories that mention Blue Spring often rely on Rodney
                         Smith&apos;s information, as well as oral traditions used by Simons;
                         although Simons himself treated the information with due caution,
                         subsequent accounts often cite tradition as fact and seldom refer to the
                         original source.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
                    <p>Simons&apos;s account of the community-more than a century after the
                         fact-describes &quot;twenty-four houses,&quot; a store, a granary, and a
                         schoolhouse. According to patterns suggested by Owen, the log houses were
                         said to be &quot;erected in the form of a square with six dwellings to a
                         side.&quot; Local informants also told Simons that after the dissolution of
                         the community, some of the members moved their cabins to their own farms
                         elsewhere in the township.<hi rend="sup">19</hi></p>
                    <p>Rodney Smith&apos;s account, based on his family stories, adds more
                         information about the school at Blue Spring: <quote rend="blockquote">My

                    <p>Finally, Smith&apos;s typescript suggests two contributing factors to the

                    <p>Did Blue Spring fail over the dye color of a batch of denim? Probably not,
                         but both of the stories suggest that the small community, like other
                         Owenite experiments, experienced insurmountable difficulties with the
                         practical application of Owen&apos;s cooperative society. Communities
                         seldom enjoyed the right mix of farmers and craftsmen for
                              self-sufficiency.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Cooperation did not overcome
                         shortages of capital, and hastily built dwellings sometimes provided
                         inadequate quarters for living and working in communal order. And like
                         other Owenite communities, Blue Spring apparently attracted members who
                         did not contribute their fair share of labor.</p>
                    <p>The dispute over homespun jeans also suggests that Blue Spring shared the
                         problems that many Owenite communities faced over the gendered system of
                         labor. The Blue Spring constitution is typical: women were allowed to vote
                         on some community matters-issues of membership but not economics-but their
                         labor was centered on traditional household tasks.<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                         Carol Kolmerton&apos;s study of women in Owenite communities finds that
                         female members who objected to their workload were deemed disruptive and,
                         in more than one instance (including Blue Spring), blamed for the demise of
                         the community. As Kolmerton observes: &quot;Domestic-service employments
                         were vital for the survival of the community, so that an unquestioned
                         sexual division of labor was extraordinarily useful.&quot;<hi rend="sup"
                              >23</hi></p>
                    <p>Blue Spring, like most of the Owenite communities that arose in the
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">United
                         States</country></placeName> between 1824 and 1828, was short-lived. Its impact upon its
                         members-who dispersed to their private farms and homes- and upon the larger
                         community of south-central Indiana appears to have been equally ephemeral.
                         It is worth remembering, however, as one of the many examples of Robert
                         Owen&apos;s influence that took quick root in the soil of the American
                         frontier but soon withered under the many challenges of that life.</p>

                    <head>Teaching Indiana History</head>

                    <head>A Roundtable</head>






                    <p>Each December, the Indiana Historical Society holds its annual Founders Day
                         award ceremony. Watching this winter&apos;s proceedings, we noticed—as we
                         do every year—the range and intensity of historical activity, across the
                         state, represented at the event. Amateur and professional historians from
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_2032390" reg="Jasper"

                                   type="city" key="tgn_2030961" reg="Auburn"
                              >Auburn</settlement></placeName>, from <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_2032579" reg="Lawrenceburg"
                                   >Lawrenceburg</settlement></placeName> to <placeName><settlement

                                   Haute</settlement></placeName>, stood up that night to accept
                         recognition for the museum exhibitions, classroom activities, public
                         history projects, and—in some cases—lifetimes of effort that they have
                         devoted to the cause of researching and sharing the state&apos;s historical
                         legacy.</p>
                    <p>The people who do such work—like the people who attend such dinners and the
                         people who read this journal—tend on average to be more seasoned in years
                         than is the general population. The same might be said for historical
                         audiences anywhere—both our desire and our ability to understand the past
                         grow naturally with age. But we also wondered to what extent the
                         particular notion of a distinctive &quot;<placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history&quot;—still so
                         vital to many older Hoosiers—continues to compel this state&apos;s young
                         people beyond their forced exposure to the subject in fourth grade. Wrapped
                         around this question is a larger one: does &quot;Indiana&quot; continue to
                         provide a meaningful marker of common identity at a time when people, jobs,
                         ideas, and images move about with little respect for traditional political
                         boundaries?</p>
                    <p> A sampling of scholars teaching in the state&apos;s colleges and
                         universities suggests that historians, at least, think so.
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> history, as we confirmed in the
                         weeks following the ceremony, lives on as a topic of study in the
                         university classroom. We asked a few of the historians who teach <pb
                              n="251" id="VAA4025-107-3-063"/> such classes to assess the study of
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> history—how it has changed, how
                         they encourage it in their own classes, how it can continue to represent a
                         meaningful scholarly challenge for the twenty-first-century student. What
                         follows is the transcription of an online discussion carried out from
                         January 12 to February 4, 2011, among four scholars who teach
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> history in the college classroom.
                         Participating were Bruce Bigelow, Professor of Geography, Butler
                         University; Nicole Etcheson, Alexander M. Bracken Professor of History,
                         Ball State University; Jason Lantzer, Adjunct Professor of History, Butler
                         University and IUPUI; and James H. Madison, Thomas and Kathryn Miller
                         Professor of History, Indiana University Bloomington. The dialogue has been
                         edited for length and clarity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> I&apos;d like to give everyone an opportunity to
                         describe their <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName> history classes. What do you call your class, how
                         long have you taught it, what are its distinctive features?</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">Jason Lantzer:</hi> My class is officially the &quot;Survey of
                         Indiana History,&quot; but I simply call it &quot;Indiana History.&quot; I
                         have taught the class, both in the classroom (since 2005) and as a distance
                         learning course (since 1999). Despite the course title, the topic
                         apparently surprised one student recently, who commented on his course
                         evaluation that I was &quot;obviously biased&quot; towards <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName>!</p>
                    <p>Because it&apos;s a survey, I cover the length and breadth of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                         >Indiana</region></placeName> 
                         history—from its pre-history to the present. I tend to focus on politics a
                         good deal, though we also highlight religion, reform, and race. Students
                         tend to enjoy our discussions on the Civil War and the Klan, of course, and
                         I&apos;m going to be adding a new lecture on eugenics this semester.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">James H. Madison:</hi> Like Jason, I teach a course whose
                         official title is &quot;Survey of Indiana History,&quot; and I too call it
                         &quot;Indiana History.&quot; I first taught the class in 1977. What I
                         consider distinctive is how much the class has changed over the years—as I
                         learned more, as students changed, as the relationship between past and
                         present has changed. Recently, I&apos;ve tried especially to do more with
                         the last fifty years and to connect the recent past with earlier pasts.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">Nicole Etcheson:</hi> At Ball State, the course is called
                         &quot;History of Indiana.&quot; I started teaching it in 2006. Although I
                         had completed my PhD on a midwestern history topic at Indiana University
                         under Jim Madison, my <pb n="252" id="VAA4025-107-3-064"/> jobs had been
                         outside the state until six years ago. Hence, I didn&apos;t have the
                         oportunity to teach <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName> history until recently. Like Jason, I cover a
                         period from pre-history to fairly close to the present. I try for a balance
                         of political and social history. Probably the course&apos;s most
                         distinctive feature is that our readings consist of primary sources and
                         novels rather than historical monographs. After each novel, the students
                         write a &quot;What Is a Hoosier?&quot; paper. The purpose of these short
                         papers is to get them to think about state and regional identity.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">Bruce Bigelow:</hi> I have taught &quot;Indiana and the
                         Midwest&quot; three times. I concentrate on <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName>, but I also discuss
                         regional history. The course begins with Native Americans, but I
                         concentrate on the Civil War, industrialization, the Klan, and race. I use
                         fiction, especially novels, in the class as well as historical case
                         studies. I do a module on <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                              reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> because it is the regional capital and
                         Butler University has a large cohort of suburban <placeName><settlement
                              type="city" key="tgn_7013596" reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> students.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> One hundred years ago, writers like George Cottman
                         seemed almost desperately concerned to rescue old documents, capture
                         pioneer memories, and generally to instill Hoosiers with a pride in the
                         history of this state. The fact that you all teach your <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history
                         classes makes me feel that you believe there is still a uniquely
                         &quot;Indiana&quot; history worth knowing—and perhaps still a uniquely
                         Hoosier identity that grows from that history.</p>
                    <p>In this global age, do state boundaries still make sense—either as meaningful
                         markers of historical content or as defining boundaries of a common set of
                         continuing cultural and social traits? And if so, what do you want your
                         students to consider as the essence of the <placeName><region
                              type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> experience?</p>

                    <p>
                         <hi rend="b">NE:</hi> Having lived in <placeName><region type="state"

                         decade, I don&apos;t think <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                         do think it&apos;s possible to identify elements of a Hoosier, and a
                         broader midwestern, identity.</p>
                    <p>In the class, however, I want the students to come to an idea of the
                         &quot;essence of the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> experience&quot; for themselves. There are
                         themes that I emphasize as important in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history: the southernness
                         of the state&apos;s settlers; the conservative nature of the state&apos;s
                         politics, not just recently but throughout <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s history; and
                         Hoosiers&apos; troubling history of race relations—from William Henry
                         Harrison&apos;s efforts to force <pb n="253" id="VAA4025-107-3-065"/>
                         slavery into the territory up through the period of the Ku Klux Klan and
                         beyond.</p>
                    <p>But the &quot;What Is a Hoosier?&quot; exercises allow students to bring
                         together the novels, primary sources, and lecture materials to posit their
                         own thesis about what <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s essence might be. At the beginning of
                         the semester, the students&apos; gut reaction is mostly that a Hoosier is a
                         Colts fan. I tell them that I can remember when the Colts moved here from
                         Baltimore, and someone interviewed on television said he wished
                         Indianapolis had at least stolen a good team. My point is that certain
                         parts of what they consider important to the state are relatively recent in
                         historical terms-perhaps even ephemeral. Some of the students will, in
                         their papers, discuss parochialism and racism as Hoosier traits; others
                         will emphasize self-reliance, industry, family, and community. Most
                         importantly, I hope to get them thinking about Hoosier identity and what it
                         might be.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">BB:</hi> As a historical cultural geographer, I am very much
                         concerned about the issue of culture regions and their unique identity. I
                         do think that <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> is in a distinct
                         region-namely, the Lower Midwest. The area would include central and
                         southern Ohio and Illinois as well as <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. The
                         area is a mixture of Border Southerners and Midlanders from
                                   <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007710"

                         later immigrants from Europe and blacks from the South. It is an area that
                         is conservative Protestant with a Roman Catholic minority, and is
                         politically conservative, whether Republican or Democratic. Within the
                         Lower Midwest, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> can be defined as a
                         sub-region. I believe that Americans still identify with their state
                         because their knowledge is circumscribed to a degree by state borders; they
                         also identify with one of their major state universities, both as the home
                         to their favorite sports teams and as a place to attend in favor of a
                         university in a neighboring state.</p>
                    <p>I am not sure that the essence of the Hoosier experience would be very
                         different from that of similar portions of <placeName><region type="state"

                         major northern cities which are very different from their

                         history is rural and small-city living, socioeconomic class division, the
                         automobile industry, anti-black racism, and conservative religion and
                         politics. On the other hand, there are obviously people and places in the
                         state that challenge these assumptions; <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> is
                         contested space in which glib generalizations can be countered by
                         antithetical examples.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, I believe there is a distinct Hoosier identity for those who
                         grow up in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                                   >Indiana</region></placeName> (though not for recent
                         in-migrants), with the exception of the northwestern portion of the state
                         (The Region), which is more a part of <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         talk about an essential &quot;<placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"

                         of the lower Midwest, at least, and possibly a larger part of
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">America</country></placeName>.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JL:</hi> Let me try to answer this question in two ways that are
                         far from mutually exclusive. The first is as a native-born Hoosier. I can
                         honestly say that I&apos;ve always felt a specific Hoosier identity.
                         Perhaps this comes from having relatives (and traveling to see them often)
                         in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                                   >Kentucky</region></placeName>. That is to say, I always had a
                         sense of being &quot;from&quot; a specific place (<placeName><region
                                   type="state" key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana"
                              >Indiana</region></placeName>) and &quot;not from&quot; another,
                         despite familial ties. That sense of Hoosier identity was perhaps
                         reinforced by being from northern <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007252" reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                                   (<placeName><region type="county" key="tgn_1002353" reg="Elkhart"
                                   >Elkhart County</region></placeName>), as well. We were not part
                         of The Region, nor part of either the <placeName><settlement type="city"
                                   key="tgn_7013933" reg="Fort Wayne">Fort

                              >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> metro regions.
                                   <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014320"
                                   reg="South Bend">South Bend</settlement></placeName> (save for
                         Notre Dame football) held little allure. Nor, despite constant news
                         broadcasts were we really part of Michiana (southwestern lower
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007520" reg="Michigan">Michigan</region></placeName>/northern <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>) either. We were
                         Hoosiers, and the northern state boundary for us was just as important as
                         the southern one in defining who I was in terms of my state
                         affiliation.</p>
                    <p>Now, one could argue that this is more about defining yourself by who you are
                         not than it is by who you are, but I&apos;d say that my experience never
                         cast those other areas in a negative light per se. Rather, I felt that
                         there was never anything wrong with being from where I was from-no reason
                         to look down upon it, surely—and many reasons to be proud of what was and
                         what could be.</p>
                    <p>Having had the opportunity to live in the three classic regions of the state,
                         I think the old south, central, and north distinctions still hold a good
                         deal of weight. But I also think—and here comes the more professional,
                         academic side of my answer—that Hoosiers (whether native-born or of more
                         recent vintage) don&apos;t often know enough of their own past (good or
                         bad) to take pride in either the real accomplishments or in <pb n="255"
                              id="VAA4025-107-3-067"/> the progress that has been made in issues
                         like race. I&apos;ve encountered native Hoosiers (in both <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> History
                         and U.S. History surveys) who are shocked to learn of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s Golden
                         Age (in both politics and in literature), and who are more apt to assume
                         an almost &quot;flyover&quot; attitude towards their home state—if it
                         didn&apos;t or doesn&apos;t happen on the coasts, then it must not have
                         mattered. But I&apos;ve also found that if you spend some time linking
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s story to wider (whether regional or national) stories
                         (putting things in a Hoosier context), those same students also come around
                         a bit to thinking that maybe <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> isn&apos;t such a bad place either to
                         be from or to live in.</p>
                    <p>So, in conclusion, yes, I think there is a Hoosier identity. Is it as
                         distinct as Nicole&apos;s experience in <placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007826" reg="Texas">Texas</region></placeName>? Probably not! But it is
                         there, if somewhat below the surface, and for all our midwestern
                         commonalities, it is also different from what one sees in residents of our
                         neighboring states—just as <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s experiences have been different.
                         On the other hand, I might argue some days that we aren&apos;t exactly
                         unique. At these times, I&apos;m inclined to think instead that Hoosiers
                         offer a rather good reflection of the nation as a whole-warts and all.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JHM:</hi> This is getting serious! The answer is &quot;mostly
                         yes&quot;: there is a place called <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> and a people who call themselves
                         Hoosiers. In class I use the old notion of an imagined community—the
                         ability of so many people who have never met face-to-face to feel
                         nonetheless some connections, and at times to act on those
                         connections.</p>
                    <p>To understand this particular imagined community it&apos;s very important
                         that my students understand the migration and cultural patterns of the
                         pioneer era, the distinctive mix of Upland South pioneers with 
                         mid-Atlantic and New England newcomers. I still think that themes raised by
                         earlier scholars such as Richard Power and James Bergquist—and revised more
                         recently by Nicole, Bruce, and others—are foundational and remain
                         significant in the twenty-first century. Somehow in all that mixing there
                         developed a distinctive <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                    <p>Of course whatever we think might be Hoosier identity is challenged by
                         alternatives and contradictions. I spend a lot of time in class on
                         &quot;the others&quot;-cases of people and ideas outside the mainstream,
                         including Rappites, abolitionists, and rebels like Eugene Debs.
                         Surprisingly, basketball is another great subject with which to challenge
                         the mainstream and to goad students into thinking. I always proclaim that
                         Oscar Robertson is the greatest Hoosier player ever. And then we <pb
                              n="256" id="VAA4025-107-3-068"/> think about the Crispus Attucks High
                         School team. Last semester I assigned an essay that challenged the Milan
                         miracle.</p>
                    <p>I also work to help students see the changing and contested purpose of
                         state and township government, from 1816 forward. Here, too, there is an
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> identity, too often taken for granted. Richard Longworth is on a
                         crusade to diminish the midwestern states as governmental units by
                         substituting extensive regional organizations and partnerships. It&apos;s
                         a quixotic idea because Hoosiers will never give up state control—even in
                         response to relatively uncontroversial proposals such as a regional,
                         multi-state tourist organization.</p>
                    <p>I hope to teach <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                         reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history in a way that respects the state and its
                         culture and also challenges it. I want students to consider the 
                         possibility that some of the central—even celebrated—Hoosier traits may be
                         outdated. I hope they will question the sense of complacency that 
                         produces such Hoosier wisdom that &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix
                         it,&quot; or that &quot;good enough is good enough.&quot; So, I pay more
                         attention to the last half-century and to the challenges of education, to
                         the methamphetamine crisis, to the withering of small towns, to the passing
                         of high-paying and secure jobs in auto plants. Of course, reading
                         Tarkington&apos;s Magnificent Ambersons, which I often assign, helps us
                         understand that change is nothing new in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, even if it has been more
                         evolutionary than revolutionary (a concept my students have abundant
                         opportunities to consider).</p>
                    <p>This imagined community of Hoosiers may not be as strong now as it was a
                         hundred years ago. It&apos;s interesting, however, that organizers of the
                         1916 state centennial were also anxious about <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s identity in
                         their rapidly changing age. Our next big challenge is preparing for the
                         2016 bicentennial. Among the outcomes of that celebration, I hope, will be
                         new ways to think about and to teach <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history, from the fourth grade
                         to colleges.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">IMH:</hi> I&apos;d like to pick up on Jim&apos;s challenge that

                         bicentennial observance, so I hope you will all forgive me if I pop the
                         cork a bit early and put you on the spot right now. We can call it our
                         celebration of the 195th anniversary of state-hood.</p>
                    <p>Specifically: What needs to happen next—whether in fourth grade, high school,
                         or the college classroom? What ideas, questions, voices, skills do we need

                         and daring teaching and learning experiences? Put differently, if you had
                         all the resources and all the energy you needed, what would the <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"

                    <p><hi rend="b">NE:</hi> For guidance on the future of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                         reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history, I turned
                         to my colleagues Ronald V. Morris and Dorshell Stewart. Ron and Dorshell
                         are the elementary social studies education experts in Ball State&apos;s
                         history department. Ron has published extensively on teaching elementary
                         students (most recently in 2010,<hi rend="i"> The Field Trip Book: Study Travel
                         Experiences in Society Studies</hi>) and Dorshell taught fourth grade in
                         <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013797" reg="Gary">Gary</settlement></placeName>
                         before entering academia.</p>
                    <p>I&apos;ll start with Ron&apos;s quip that it would be nice if we taught
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history in fourth grade. He joked that the students might get
                         &quot;fifteen minutes on Friday afternoon after the fire drill.&quot;
                         Because it&apos;s not emphasized on the ISTEP test that students take in
                         fifth grade, and because the teachers are tasked to cover so much material
                         they know will be tested, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history coverage is skimpy. When I was
                         growing up in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, we took <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> History in seventh grade, but Ron
                         tells me this is no longer the case. (All I remember learning about is
                         Tecumseh.) So he would like to see the subject revisited in junior high or
                         high school, where students are capable of thinking about the issues in
                         more sophisticated ways than they can in fourth grade. Elementary
                         students may not be ready to discuss controversies in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history. At
                         one workshop, a teacher asked about how to deal with the 1920s Klan with
                         her students.</p>
                    <p>Dorshell emphasized—and Ron affirmed—that as teachers, they felt constrained
                         by the limitations of material. They both felt there were limited
                         sources—secondary and primary—available to teach young students. With
                         dwindling budgets, field trips are disappearing. Dorshell remarked that she
                         would do more with online field trips that allow students to access
                         historical sites on the Internet. Ron talked about having students work
                         backward—and I might try this in my college course. They have accessible
                         sources in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history: parents, grandparents, neighbors. Start with
                         oral histories of the recent past and then work towards the earlier
                         eras.</p>
                    <p>Part of the reason I like Ron&apos;s idea is that I&apos;m increasingly
                         uncomfortable with <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history&apos;s fascination with the pioneer
                         period. Let me say that I love log cabins—like Daniel Webster, I was not
                         born in one, but I&apos;ve made many a pilgrimage to them. But I find my
                         college students <pb n="258" id="VAA4025-107-3-070"/>too glibly saying
                         that Hoosiers are hardy pioneer types, eliding a full century of different
                         migratory streams, industrialization, and myriad social and political
                         controversies that have marked <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>&apos;s past. The pioneer past is
                         also exclusionary: if the Hoosier is a descendant of these pioneers, can
                         Hispanics, Asian immigrants, my Polish American nephews, or African
                         Americans be &quot;real&quot; Hoosiers? Perhaps if the college students
                         began my &quot;What Is a Hoosier?&quot; exercise with their grandparents,
                         they would produce a broader, more contemporary, more accurate picture of
                         Hoosiers and their history</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">BB:</hi> I will let others talk about elementary and secondary

                         history in college, I will discuss ideas, questions, and voices. (I
                         confess to thinking aloud about these topics with George Geib of Butler
                         University and Randy Mills of Oakland City University before responding to
                         the questions.)</p>
                    <p>In terms of ideas, I&apos;d like to see more discussion of <placeName><region

                         heightened globalization. Students could consider deindustrialization and
                         the drastic weakening of the automobile industry. Take a stroll through

                         places like these. On the other hand, we should study the success stories
                         of growth poles like <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013437"

                         Another aspect of globalization would be a study of the large Latino
                         migration to <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> in the past 30
                         years.</p>
                    <p>With regard to questions, I consider one of the most important to be the
                         degree to which a Hoosier identity means anything these days. Certainly, a
                         state identity based on the pioneers and local color nineteenth-century
                         writers seems far removed today. On the other hand, it is maintained by the
                         professional and collegiate sports teams, especially for basketball.
                         Histories of the programs at IU, Purdue, and Butler could be included as a
                         module in a college course. Another option for resuscitating state
                         identity would be to have students recover more of the &quot;sacred
                         texts&quot; of Hoosier identity. As I mentioned earlier, I have used early
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> literature in my course, with great success.</p>
                    <p>As to voices, I think, first, we should emphasize more minority voices-racial
                         and religious. I have in mind Tecumseh and the Prophet; Wes Montgomery,
                         Oscar Robertson, and Darryl Pinckney; and Theodore <pb n="259"
                              id="VAA4025-107-3-071"/> Hesburgh. Second, students should also hear
                         more of the voices of significant politicians: from Oliver Morton, Eugene
                         Debs, and Albert Beveridge to Richard Hatcher, William Hudnut, and Richard
                         Lugar.</p>
                    <p>I am arguing for two things here: an extension of the course forward by
                         studying in more depth the changes in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> in the past 30 years, but
                         also the act of recovery for those who have forgotten the major writers,
                         politicians, and other important Hoosiers of the more distant past.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JHM:</hi> Nicole is right about the necessity of expanding our

                         subject matter into general <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"

                         the middle and high school levels. Instead of teaching the <geogName

                         can teach our own Ku Klux Klan. There are also local history subjects in
                         every community that can connect to state and national standards.</p>
                    <p>I think there are two primary means for bringing more and better <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                         reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>
                         history to classrooms at all levels. First, remember that all teaching
                         begins with the teacher; we need more teachers to be better prepared and
                         enthusiastic to teach <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> subject matter. Among the best ways to do
                         that, I think, is through summer workshops that focus on content. Workshops
                         would include reading and discussing lots of primary sources, as well as
                         the best of secondary sources, such as essays from the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                         History</hi>. They would include hands-on exploration of the varieties of
                         subject matter, method, sources, and delivery to be found in historical
                         study.</p>
                    <p>The second step would be to strengthen, enlarge, and make more accessible the
                         content itself. The IMH has made good progress. So have the Indiana
                         Historical Society, the Indiana Supreme Court, and numerous other
                         institutions. But the busy classroom teacher struggles to make sense of all
                         the opportunities and to bring them into the classroom. Coordination of
                         what is now online would help greatly. So would adding new digital
                         materials. Many teachers would welcome sophisticated and thoughtful units
                         on the best subject matter that connect to core <placeName><country
                                   key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>
                         history issues and bring the range of primary sources to the classroom.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Nicole and Bruce are right about the challenges of pioneer
                         domination. The state&apos;s history needs a foundation, and I think
                         that&apos;s to <pb n="260" id="VAA4025-107-3-072"/> be found in the pioneer
                         era. We need to improve our understanding of the varieties of pioneers, as
                         for example, teaching about the pioneer black communities like Lyles
                         Station and Roberts Settlement. But the changes since 1850 are just as
                         important. So are changes since 1950. Bruce&apos;s call for a more
                         globalized <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history is critical. I&apos;ve recently been working on
                         the last hundred years of the auto industry in the state. In that one
                         subject, among several others, can be found superb connections between
                         past and present and core issues in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, <placeName><country
                                   key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States">U.S.</country></placeName>, and world history.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="b">JL:</hi> Ah, so many good ideas! While it has been awhile since
                         my own fourth-grade <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> History experience (though I have nothing but
                         good memories of the &quot;yellow book,&quot; the unit flash cards, and the
                         various projects—including making a spear out of my mother&apos;s new
                         broom, which didn&apos;t go over very well!), let me echo what others have
                         said. It would indeed be nice if there was more coverage later on—if, in
                         short, instruction in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> history was built up from elementary to
                         middle to high school. Whether those later classes would be more
                         &quot;unit&quot; based, or just available as potential social studies
                         offerings (especially at the high school level), I&apos;m not sure. The
                         obvious first step would be to at least force a conversation at the State
                         House as to why <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> History isn&apos;t included
                         as part of ISTEP—and not rest until a real answer is given or real change takes place.</p>
                    <p>The other requirement for moving forward in our teaching (at all levels) is
                         obviously to make more material available and to let more people know
                         about it. I&apos;m referring not just to teachers, but to the community
                         at large, including the growing home-school community. Short of achieving
                         an ISTEP revolution, perhaps the surest way to reach Hoosiers about the
                         importance of their history is to convince school boards that it
                         matters.</p>
                    <p>As for how to teach (at the college level) in the future, I don&apos;t fret
                         the pioneer domination. It is a hook to draw students in. One of the things
                         I do try, while following the usual chronological path, is to move both
                         forward and back in time. Talking about Native Americans, for example,
                         opens ourselves up to discussing why Hoosiers have opted to name so many
                         things after the tribes they displaced, why schools and sports teams (from
                         the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924" reg="Indianapolis"
                                   >Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> Indians to school teams)
                         are named after them—even why we&apos;ve moved away from doing so recently.
                         No matter how you teach it, helping students to make connections between
                         the past and their present is the important <pb n="261"
                              id="VAA4025-107-3-073"/> thing. In short, I&apos;m not worried about
                         the future of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                                   reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> History. I&apos;m as
                         excited about it as I am about the past that I try to convey to my students
                         whenever I get the chance.</p>

                    <p>In 1932, Paul Schuster Taylor, a rural sociologist from the University of
                         California at Berkeley, published his now classic study <hi rend="i"

                         Calumet region, Mexican anthropologist Manuel Gamio was completing Mexican
                         Immigration to the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                                   reg="United States">United States</country></placeName> (1930), a
                         penetrating work that was the first to document the connections between
                         emigrant-sending areas in <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560"
                                   reg="México">Mexico</country></placeName> and immigrant

                              Mexican Immigrant: His Life Story</hi> (1931), Gamio presented a
                         pioneering ethnographic account from interviews of Mexican immigrants
                         living in the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                   >U.S.</country></placeName>, some in the same places where Taylor
                         was conducting his field studies.</p>
                    <p>There is no reason to suspect that these researchers from the first decades
                         of the twentieth century would have known Maria and Miguel Arredondo,
                         immigrants from hard-scrabble <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7005584"
                              reg="Guanajuato">Guanajuato</region></placeName>, <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560"
                              reg="México">Mexico</country></placeName>, who were struggling to
                         make a better life for themselves, their ten children, and one
                         mother-in-law in East Chicago, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>. Yet the Arredondos were living
                         the very life that the sociologist Taylor and the anthropologist Gamio
                         sought to document in their studies.</p>
                    <p>Maria&apos;s Journey is part memoir and part family biography, told by Ramon
                         Arredondo, the second youngest of the children, and his wife Trisha Hull
                         Arredondo. As historian James Lane remarks in his foreword, the work is a
                         reliable case study of Mexican family dynamics and Mexican immigrant
                         experience to the Calumet region. It follows Miguel and Maria from what
                         Taylor and Gamio called the West <placeName><country key="tgn_7005560"
                                   reg="México">Mexico</country></placeName> sending region-centered

                         the core <pb n="263" id="VAA4025-107-3-075"/> of the American industrial
                         heartland, first to <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7013596"
                              reg="Chicago">Chicago</settlement></placeName> and then to Harbor Island, <placeName><region

                              >Indiana</region></placeName>. There they face the inevitable issues
                         of employment security and citizenship that confronted so many of their
                         fellow immigrants; Maria is forced to return to <placeName><country
                              key="tgn_7005560" reg="México">Mexico</country></placeName> while Miguel remains
                         to work in the steel mills that were the economic salvation for so many
                         Mexicanos who ventured al norte during the chaos of the Mexican Revolution
                         at home.</p>
                    <p>The account also offers a testimonial of the lives and upbringing of the
                         Arredondo children. An important sidebar in the family chronicle—one
                         that contrasted with similar Mexican immigrant accounts grounded in the
                         experience of migrant farm labor—is Miguel&apos;s role as an urban labor
                         activist and champion of the local union. This passion is passed on to one
                         son who becomes a leader in the union.</p>
                    <p>But the heart and soul of the memoir, extending over decades to the present,
                         resides in Maria, the mother who holds the family together through stern
                         conviction, faith, and a persistent will. Her story is a drama that will be
                         recognized by many readers of immigrant ancestry who have lived the same
                         experience as children of such a matriarch. And that may be the book&apos;s
                         most important contribution. Through their telling, the Arredondos present
                         a compelling example of the lives documented by scholars like Taylor and
                         Gamio. Maria&apos;s Journey is a welcome addition to the larger story of
                         the Mexican immigrant experience because it offers us a view from within,
                         not only adding flesh to the bone of leaner academic texts, but revealing
                         the spirit and drive along with the disappointments and sorrows of
                         immigration that are in some ways unique to the Mexican experience in
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United States"
                                   >America</country></placeName> and in others universal to migrant
                         stories around the world.</p>
                    <p>Maria&apos;s Journey reveals how the immigrant experience, passed through
                         several generations, has transformed Mexicans into Americans of Mexican
                         descent. That story is not simply history; it is a living experience
                         still unfolding in cities and towns across <placeName><country

                         basketball bus. You probably feel you have read the Butler story told in
                         every hue possible, but you haven&apos;t. You have primarily read sports
                         writers, people like me. In this book, Susan S. Neville, a native Hoosier
                         and a professor of creative writing at Butler, elevates the chronicle to
                         new heights.</p>
                    <p>Neville is the author of four books, none of which likely brightens any
                         sports library. She and others taught classes, as usual, when things were
                         not at all usual on the small <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                              reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> university&apos;s campus—when
                         college basketball&apos;s 2010 Final Four phenomenon was played out about
                         five miles from campus, and hitherto bit player Butler was its surprise
                         star.</p>
                    <p>At just about the time Ms. Neville&apos;s book was coming into bookstores
                         extending once-in-a-lifetime adoration to Butler&apos;s 2010 tournament
                         run, the 2011 Bulldogs were re-astounding the college basketball world by
                         making a second straight run all the way to the national championship game.
                         Hers surely was, at worst, a merry melancholy when the second lightning
                         strike emanated from her campus before she had properly introduced us to,
                         for example, Pam, the mailroom operator whose motherly charm blossomed in
                         the maelstrom of 2010. Pam talked of rushing out t-shirts &quot;by the ones
                         and twelves and hundreds ... to <placeName><region type="state"

                         overseas—the most insane thing I ever saw in my life&quot; (p. 24). This
                         was a lady who knew every player, and who, in her hyperactivity, told Ms.
                         Neville: &quot;We can never have another ride like this year. It&apos;s
                         incredible that you only get to bloom for one season&quot; (p. 24).
                         Everyone knew this truth, and everyone was wrong. So the magic that Neville
                         captured became a two-time wonder, no less &quot;mythopoetic&quot; (her
                         perfect descriptive word) than the time before.</p>
                    <p>The author writes from within a rare college campus where students—and even
                         some players—actually went to class the day of the national championship
                         game; where a professor—during the Syracuse game that started the
                         &apos;10 Bulldogs down their path to the Sweet Sixteen—had a group of
                         students in a seminar room &quot;studying Althusser&apos;s essay
                         &apos;Ideology of the Ideological State Apparatus&apos;&quot; (p. 15). At
                         the class break, the professor realized the game would be in its second
                         half, so the group stopped to watch it to the end, then regathered and
                         pondered, in light of the essay and what they had seen during the break,
                         &quot;how does college basketball help to reproduce culture, how does it
                         serve as an ideological <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-107-3-077"/> apparatus
                         that helps us reproduce the exploitation and power dynamics of
                         capitalism?&quot; (p. 18)</p>
                    <p>Neville is a Hoosier. She spent some adult time in <placeName><settlement
                         type="city" key="tgn_2033045" reg="New Castle">New Castle</settlement></placeName>, when Steve
                         Alford mania was in flower. She followed Indiana University&apos;s 
                         tournament successes, before and during Alford&apos;s years there. She absorbed
                         Butler&apos;s past as the daughter of a BU alumnus, and writes
                         appreciatively of the &quot;Butler Way,&quot; with its Tony Hinkle roots,
                         Barry Collier regeneration, and Brad Stevens full-flowering. She quotes an
                         unidentified alumna: &quot;I cried when they went to the Final Four, after
                         they beat Kansas State ... (and) I cried after the championship game.&quot;
                         Butler lost that game to Duke, when Gordon Hayward&apos;s potentially
                         game-winning three-point shot bounced off the backboard and rim. &quot;I
                         was so sad, but after walking home from Lucas Oil (Stadium) I got over it.
                         After I saw how close that last shot had been on ESPN, I flipped out again.
                         Day to day, every once in a while, it hits me&quot; (p. 26).</p>
                    <p>In the eye of so happy and unforeseeable a hurricane, a little overstatement
                         isn&apos;t sinful, but: &quot;Before this tournament, there were two big
                         moments in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> basketball. The first was in 1954 when Milan upset
                         Muncie Central. The second was in 1955 when Oscar Robertson led Crispus
                         Attucks to the state title. This tournament is now number three&quot; (p.
                         36). Whoa! Five national championship banners that wave in Bloom- ington,
                         and a high school legacy that stretches from Homer Stonebraker through
                         Fuzzy Vandivier, Johnny Wooden, Bill Garrett, Rick Mount, George McGinnis,
                         and Damon Bailey, among others, would suggest that Hoosierland&apos;s
                         &quot;big moment&quot; basketball list is a lot longer than that. But if
                         this be blasphemy, professor, make the most of it, while border-to-border

                                   >New Orleans</settlement></placeName>. Estill Pennington takes us
                         over the mountains, or more accurately, down the <geogName
                              key="tgn_7014265" reg="Ohio River">Ohio River</geogName>, to access
                         these southern hinterlands—the destination, he argues, of a considerable
                         number of artists after the Revolutionary War, who sought patronage among
                         the growing communities of <placeName><region type="state"

                         and in newly minted states downriver. Along the way, Pennington manages to
                         cover artists working in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007706"
                                   reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> and <placeName><region

                    <p>For all that, Pennington keeps his eye primarily on <placeName><region
                         type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>, not only as a
                         scholar compiling artistic activity in the state from 1802 to 1920 (that
                         is, from John James Audubon to Frank Duveneck), but also as a theorist of
                         portrait painting. Wary of past treatments of ancestral likenesses that
                         have either been immersed in &quot;formidable oral histories,&quot; or
                         treated their subjects as examples of one period style or another,
                         Pennington wants us to understand <placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> portraiture as a
                         &quot;lesson&quot; that links individual sitters to an informed social
                         and cultural context.</p>
                    <p>The book is essentially (and helpfully) divided into two sections, the first
                         a historical overview featuring major artists who were native Kentuckians
                         or who, passing through the state, left a considerable mark on local
                         portrait painters. Readers acquainted with artists working in the East
                         between 1802 and the Civil War, for example, may be surprised to find that
                         Pennington&apos;s inventory includes not only Audubon but Matthew Harris
                         Jewett, William Edward West, Chester Harding, John Wesley Jarvis, Oliver
                         Frazer, John Neagel, John Wood Dodge, George Caleb Bingham, a number of
                         talented Thomas Sully students, and G. P. A. Healey. But as Pennington
                         moves into the twentieth century (concluding his survey with John Bernard
                         Albers, an artist too little known outside <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7013915" reg="Louisville"

                         his narrative to include the impact of photography and the Civil War on
                         local artists and the retrospective concerns of later patrons who were
                         dedicated to collecting and publishing a succession of images that more or
                         less endorsed their community standing.</p>
                    <p>In the second part of his book, Pennington presents a more straightforward
                         catalog of artists active in <placeName><region type="state"
                                   key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>
                         (including some who had crossed the river to <placeName><settlement
                                   type="city" key="tgn_7013604" reg="Cincinnati"
                                   >Cincinnati</settlement></placeName>) through 1920. Each entry
                         delivers selective biographical information about artist and sitter,
                         especially those who, like famed orator Henry Clay, played an active role
                         in <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky"
                                   >Kentucky</region></placeName> politics and cultural life. But
                         many others also appear; the catalog is meant to provide an exhaustive
                         record of local artistic activity accompanied by useful remarks on the
                         style and content of the works illustrated.</p>
                    <p>Missing from the remarks, however, and to some extent lacking in the
                         introductory chapters, is a collective definition of <placeName><region

                         <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-107-3-079"/> portraiture, or at least a set of
                         questions that might lead one to ask what it shares with the art of other
                         frontier areas in the South. One thing seems fairly certain: little of the
                         frontier is evident in any of these images. More often, artists and sitters
                         are anxious to project cultural refinements that probably were still on
                         their way from the East. Portraits of Daniel Boone feature him as a
                         backwoods hero, but most artists aimed higher. Those who did were perhaps
                         intrigued by <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255"
                                   reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>&apos;s growing
                         reputation as the seat of the Old South (&quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;),
                         and mindful of a slave-owning aristocracy that remained a de facto presence

                         particularly good detective on this subject, able to recognize the visual
                         subterfuges employed by white artists on behalf of white sitters still
                         committed to the &quot;lost cause.&quot; Indeed, my final tribute to the
                         author of this book—a native Kentuckian—concerns his handling of such
                         issues. Perhaps because he grew up in a world of outmoded racial
                         conventions, he knows instinctively where to look for them. And he knows
                         equally well how to unmask them, with intelligence and discretion.</p>

                    <p>Matthew Schoenbachler has written a fascinating account of an episode from
                         the history of the early American republic. A story of seduction, murder,
                         and suicide, the &quot;Kentucky Tragedy&quot; has all the ingredients for a
                         first-rate microhistory, and this is what Schoenbachler has produced,
                         significantly enriching our understanding of a complex period in the
                         history of a state, <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007255"
                              reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName>, where complexity seems to have been the order
                         of the day.</p>
                    <p>The episode that became known as the Kentucky Tragedy involved the 1825
                         murder of one of the state&apos;s most prominent political figures, Solomon
                         Sharpe, by Jereboam Beauchamp, a young attorney. Some years earlier, Sharpe
                         had been accused of seducing Anna Cooke, who subsequently delivered a
                         stillborn child. Cooke later met Beauchamp, and the two married in 1824. In
                         1825, in the midst of a hard-fought state election, the seduction charge
                         resurfaced, and a rumor began to circulate that Sharpe had claimed the baby
                         could not have been his because it had been a mulatto. Enraged, the
                         Beauchamps plotted <pb n="268" id="VAA4025-107-3-080"/> revenge, and, on a
                         November night, Jereboam went to Sharpe&apos;s home and committed the
                         murder.</p>
                    <p>Arrested, tried, and convicted, Beauchamp was sentenced to hang. Anna joined
                         him in his dungeon cell, where together they composed an elaborate
                         Confession intended to justify what they had done. Then, as
                         Beauchamp&apos;s execution approached, they attempted suicide, first by
                         taking laudanum and then, when that failed, by stabbing themselves with a
                         knife they had concealed in the cell. Anna Beauchamp&apos;s second attempt
                         was successful. Jereboam was severely wounded, but received sufficient
                         treatment to enable him to meet his end on the gallows.</p>
                    <p>Anyone who has examined the case recognizes that, beyond the bare outlines of
                         the events, almost nothing about what happened in the Beauchamp-Sharpe
                         tragedy is clear—including, as Schoenbachler notes, whether it should
                         properly be termed a &quot;tragedy.&quot; Even at the time, the murder
                         came to be bound up in the bitterly divisive politics of the 
                         day—Beauchamp&apos;s opponents charged that the act had been politically
                         motivated—and in a cultural framework dominated by sentimental ideas that
                         influenced perceptions of the principals, their actions, and their
                         fates.</p>
                    <p>Schoenbachler places great weight on this romantic framework, and does so
                         convincingly. As he shows, the Confession—which has served as a major
                         source for most studies of the tragedy—was above all an effort at
                         self-creation on the part of the Beauchamps, who used it to cast themselves
                         as figures deserving sympathy, not condemnation. They also hoped,
                         Schoenbachler notes, to spare Jereboam from his date with death. Most
                         contemporary newspaper accounts cast the episode in romantic terms, and
                         subsequent writers, who found the story a fruitful source for fiction and
                         drama, tended to cast it in the same terms as well.</p>
                    <p>Schoenbachler offers vivid, contextualized accounts of the lives of the
                         principals and other players in the drama, and develops a valuable 
                         portrayal of the unsettled character of <placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007255" reg="Kentucky">Kentucky</region></placeName> politics and society during
                         the early nineteenth century. This is a rewarding book that will be of
                         great interest to students of the early American republic.</p>

                    <p>Roger Billings and Frank J. Williams&apos;s <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln, Esq.</hi> and Burrus
                         M. Carnahan&apos;s <hi rend="i">Lincoln on Trial</hi> are welcome additions to the studies
                         of Lincoln&apos;s legal practice and thought that have appeared during
                         the last twenty years. This surprisingly ample literature derives both
                         from the accessibility of a large database containing Lincoln&apos;s
                         legal papers and from contemporary critical reflection on lawyers. One
                         important question in much of the &quot;Lincoln as lawyer&quot; literature
                         involves the extent to which Lincoln&apos;s background as a lawyer
                         influenced his tortured and, ultimately, tragic presidency.</p>
                    <p>To emphasize that Lincoln was a lawyer is hardly to stress the 
                         insignificant. Folksy legends notwithstanding, Lincoln loved the orderliness and
                         logic of legal thought. While some fellow circuit riders relaxed by
                         reading novels and almanacs, Lincoln delighted in Euclid&apos;s Geometry
                         and its deductive reasoning. According to Harold Holzer in his essay in
                         <hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln, Esq.</hi>, Lincoln&apos;s firm handled between 17 and 34
                         percent of all cases in his county, far outpacing rival firms. Lincoln
                         himself managed roughly 200 cases per year and also &quot;took an
                         astounding 340 cases to the Illinois Supreme Court&quot; (p. 9). In the
                         words of Frank J. Williams in an essay in the same volume, &quot;Lincoln
                         was not just a great president, but he was also a great lawyer&quot; (p.
                         19).</p>
                    <p><hi rend="i">Abraham Lincoln, Esq.</hi> includes four general essays
                         evaluating Lincoln&apos;s work as a lawyer, six essays discussing
                         particular aspects of Lincoln&apos;s <placeName><region type="state"

                         of essays will have the greatest appeal for those seeking a general
                         overview of Lincoln and things legal, but these essays also seem to this
                         reviewer especially prone to excessive lionizing.</p>

                         commentaries on how lawyers, legal institutions, and society in general
                         functioned in the antebellum decades. Two—both by Roger Billings—discuss
                         Lincoln&apos;s work as a debtor-creditor lawyer and as a real estate
                         lawyer. Lincoln had more debtor-creditor cases than any other kind. He more
                         frequently represented creditors than debtors and even on occasion 
                         represented himself while trying to collect a fee. Billings suggests that
                         Lincoln&apos;s <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-107-3-082"/> debtor-creditor work
                         reveals the problems caused by the shortage of money on the frontier and
                         by banks&apos; inability to satisfactorily support business growth by
                         using unsecured promissory notes (p. 81). Lincoln&apos;s real estate
                         work, meanwhile, intertwined with his debtor-creditor work, with many of
                         his cases involving mortgage foreclosures. In both areas, Billings
                         demonstrates, Lincoln prioritized property rights over anything we might
                         call &quot;civil liberties&quot; or &quot;due process.&quot;</p>
                    <p>Writing in the third part of Abraham Lincoln, Esq., Mackubin Thomas Owens
                         and William D. Pederson consider Lincoln&apos;s work during his
                         presidency as, respectively, a constitutional lawyer and as an 
                         international lawyer. In their essays, we tour Lincoln&apos;s understanding of
                         such constitutional issues as secession, the war powers, and
                         emancipation, and such international issues as blockades and the Lieber
                         Code, an early code of war. Pederson lapses into the kind of lionizing
                         characteristic of the first part of the book, saying at one point that
                         &quot;Lincoln could easily be ranked as the greatest international lawyer
                         ever to serve as president of the <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149"
                              reg="United States">United States</country></placeName>&quot; (p. 241) and at
                         another point invoking a popular book of legal lists to the effect that
                         Lincoln ranks &quot;among the greatest lawyers in American history—second
                         only to John Marshall&quot; (p. 241).</p>
                    <p>Burrus M. Carnahan&apos;s short <hi rend="i">Lincoln on Trial</hi> nicely extends the 
                         consideration of Lincoln as a wartime president and an international lawyer.
                         Carnahan insightfully discusses Lincoln&apos;s interpretation of the
                         nineteenth century&apos;s emerging law of war and this
                         interpretation&apos;s impact on civilians. The author avoids the presentist
                         temptation to equate Lincoln&apos;s law of war to that of our own time and
                         to compare Lincoln&apos;s decisions to more recent presidential actions in
                         relation to the former <placeName><country key="tgn_1000102"
                              reg="Srbija-Crna Gora">Yugoslavia</country></placeName>, <placeName><country
                                   key="tgn_7016612" reg="Afghanistan, Islamic Republic of">Afghanistan</country></placeName>,
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_1000118" reg="Al-ʻIrāq">Iraq</country></placeName>, and
                         <placeName><country key="tgn_1000172" reg="Lībiyā">Libya</country></placeName>. Lincoln,
                         it should be underscored, was fighting a civil war on American soil, and he
                         hesitated to invoke the law of war too formally or frequently for fear of
                         according southern rebels sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Especially intriguing are the ways in which the emphasis on property law, so
                         evident in Lincoln&apos;s <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007251"
                              reg="Illinois">Illinois</region></placeName> practice, resurfaced in his thinking
                         about war. At the beginning of the Civil War, Lincoln hoped a respect for
                         the peacetime property rights in the border states would discourage 
                         secession. Even the Emancipation Proclamation, as he stated in a public letter
                         to James C. Conkling, rested on an appreciation of property. &quot;The most
                         that can be said,&quot; Lincoln argued, &quot;is that slaves are property.
                         Is there—had there ever been—any question that by the law of war,
                         property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?&quot; (p.
                         27). Late in the war, Lincoln as well as his generals came to the
                         conclusion that &quot;if Southern hearts could not be changed, threats to
                         Southern property could change Southern political calculations&quot; (p.
                         89). Despite Confederate <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-107-3-083"/> pontificating
                         about a duty to preserve a distinctive culture, &quot;[a] confederate
                         government that could not protect its citizens&apos; property would lose
                         legitimacy&quot; (p. 90).</p>
                    <p>Most generally, it is plausible that Lincoln&apos;s lawyerly habits of mind,
                         honed by two decades of legal practice, had an impact on his 
                         presidential decision making. Both as a practicing lawyer and as president, Lincoln
                         admired Blackstone for having brought order and coherence to a wide range
                         of precedents and developments. Like the model lawyer, Lincoln valued
                         reason over passion, and he greatly preferred to begin with general
                         principles and then draw specific conclusions regarding a given set of
                         facts. Hence, the principle of &quot;military necessity&quot; drove many
                         of his decisions regarding seizure of enemy property, retaliation against
                         the enemy, and devastation of enemy cities and farms. Carnahan concedes
                         that other psychological and philosophical factors affected
                         Lincoln&apos;s decisions, but he, like most of the essayists assembled by
                         Billings and Williams, maintains that Lincoln&apos;s years as a lawyer
                         affected his presidency. When Lincoln left Springfield, he told his
                         partner not to alter their shingle because he planned to return to
                         practice, but in striking ways Lincoln&apos;s presidency demonstrates
                         that he did not have to return to <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         thinking as a lawyer.</p>

                    <p>This collection is the fourth volume of published essays originally 
                         presented at the annual Lincoln Forum in <placeName><settlement type="city"

                         previous two titles in the series, which relied heavily on essays from
                         academic historians, <hi rend="i">The Lincoln Assassination</hi> includes a number of
                         contributions from independent historians. The editors promise that the
                         essayists &quot;will provide a fresh examination ... into the legal,
                         social, and iconographic impact of Abraham Lincoln&apos;s death,&quot;
                         (p. 8) but the book provides few, if any, original insights.</p>
                    <p>In the first essay, co-editors Holzer and Williams examine artistic
                         depictions of Lincoln&apos;s deathbed. They illustrate the essay with 
                         examples (many of them from the Lincoln <pb n="272" id="VAA4025-107-3-084"/>
                         Financial Foundation Collection at the Indiana State Museum) of the 
                         lithographs and engravings of Lincoln&apos;s final hours produced for popular
                         consumption. While the authors purport to show how the American public
                         learned about and responded to Lincoln&apos;s assassination, their essay
                         offers little more than a running commentary on the illustrations and the
                         &quot;rubber room phenomenon&quot; that depicted a larger crowd keeping
                         vigil at Lincoln&apos;s side than the actual room could possibly have
                         accommodated. An assessment of marketing strategies for these prints or an
                         interpretive analysis regarding the public&apos;s reception of these
                         images would have strengthened this chapter.</p>
                    <p>In other essays, Richard E. Sloan writes about Lincoln&apos;s funeral in

                         Williams evaluates the justness of military tribunals during the Civil
                         War and draws parallels with President Barack Obama&apos;s handling of the
                         Guantanamo detainees. Nearly a third of Williams&apos;s footnotes refer to
                         modern newspaper sources, and his conclusion seems more fitting for an
                         op-ed piece than a historical essay. Elizabeth D. Leonard presents a
                         biographical essay on Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who authorized
                         the military trial of <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName> civilian Lambdin P Milligan and subsequently
                         led the obsessed prosecution of the assassination conspirators. Yet
                         Leonard&apos;s essay presents no new insights that were not previously
                         shared in her book, <hi rend="i">Lincoln&apos;s Avengers</hi> (2004).</p>
                    <p>In addition to Leonard&apos;s essay, contributions from Thomas R. Turner,
                         Edward Steers Jr., and Michael W. Kauffman deal directly with the 
                         assassination conspiracy and trial. While these chapters offer no new insights
                         or interpretations of the events, they are perhaps the strongest of the
                         book. The diverging arguments of Steers and Kauffman regarding the
                         complicity of Samuel Mudd in the assassination conspiracy and the overall
                         fairness of the trial are particularly interesting. As Turner observes,
                         &quot;these positions cannot be easily reconciled&quot; (p. 171). A general
                         reader could nevertheless have benefitted from some editorial commentary
                         introducing these opposing positions and the authors&apos; 
                         interpretations of the evidence.</p>
                    <p>Thomas P. Lowry&apos;s essay is the most troublesome contribution to this
                         volume. &quot;Not Everybody Mourned Lincoln&apos;s Death,&quot; based upon
                         the case files of court-martialed soldiers, tackles an interesting
                         subject but is unfortunately dampened by repetitive, uninspired prose.
                         Furthermore, Lowry&apos;s recent confession to the Office of the Inspector
                         General that he intentionally altered the date on a Lincoln pardon raises
                         serious doubts about his research.</p>
                    <p>The editors&apos; decision to reprint a fifty-year-old chapter from Richard
                         Current&apos;s The Lincoln Nobody Knows (1958) sums up the value of this
                              <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-107-3-085"/> book. While this volume promises
                         new insights on the Lincoln assassination, there is nothing new here for
                         the specialist or informed Lincoln enthusiast. A general reader 
                         interested in this topic might find some value in this book, but would probably
                         enjoy one of James Swanson&apos;s books on the assassination more.</p>

                    <p>Mark Dugan has produced a slim and eminently readable biography of Charles
                         Scott, alias Frank Rande, a self-styled desperado whose sordid career won
                         him an equally squalid celebrity.</p>
                    <p>At his trial for murder, Rande&apos;s family described him as a promising
                         young man. He was a good student and occasional preacher whose career as a
                         teacher and talents as a blacksmith were ruined by twin tragedies: first,
                         a carriage accident which allegedly led to major changes in his
                         personality; second, the loss of his young wife to illness, which triggered
                         what Dugan calls a dormant mental illness. Consequently, Rande became an
                         aggressive drifter whose demeanor and actions frightened his family and
                         former associates.</p>
                    <p>Dugan claims that an arrest for suspicion of larceny at age thirty-one led
                         Rande to declare that he would make himself a &quot;terror in the
                         land&quot; (p. 16). Over the next several years, Rande was involved in a
                         string of burglaries, assaults, and finally murders (including among his
                         victims several police officers) throughout the midwestern states. His
                         capture in Missouri made him a regional celebrity. He played the part
                         beautifully, and was clearly obsessed with maintaining his public image
                         as a violent bandit in order to reap the monetary rewards he anticipated
                         from the sale of his memoirs and photographs of himself. Even though his
                         many crimes were open-and-shut cases, a jury bizarrely decided to sentence
                         him to life imprisonment instead of execution. (As Dugan notes, upon
                         hearing that one member of the jury had initially held out for a
                         not-guilty verdict, Rande exclaimed, &quot;That man is crazier than
                         I&quot; [p.146]). In prison, he developed a hatred for one of his <pb
                              n="274" id="VAA4025-107-3-086"/> keepers, whom he nearly killed in a
                         savage assault. Placed in solitary confinement after the assault, he was
                         soon found dead from an apparent suicide.</p>
                    <p>Drawn largely from newspaper accounts and trial testimony, the book is a
                         wholly competent narrative of the trail of pointless and devastating
                         carnage that Rande blazed in the 1870s through <placeName><region

                         and <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007523" reg="Missouri"
                                   >Missouri</region></placeName>. Dugan and his research 
                         assistant have plainly labored hard to reconstruct the chronology of Rande
                         (whose aliases, he once claimed, numbered in the hundreds), and their
                         determination to stick to a documentary account of his career is plain.
                         The book represents in that sense a clearly impressive amount of sleuthing.
                         In this context, though, Dugan&apos;s refusal to follow more closely the
                         question of whether Rande&apos;s hanging was a suicide or a murder carried
                         out by his captors seems all the more puzzling. Evidence matters, but
                         reasoned deduction can be equally valid.</p>
                    <p>It is unfortunate that Dugan&apos;s otherwise admirable devotion to detail
                         obscures the much more promising line of inquiry that he lays out in his
                         foreword and introduction. The most interesting aspect of Rande&apos;s
                         career is that a man so apparently crazed could nonetheless play the role
                         of media celebrity so well. Even allowing for journalistic license in the
                         reporting and embellishing of his words and deeds, Rande obviously played
                         to the crowd, and knew enough of the dime-store novel genre to recast
                         himself as an outlaw icon along the lines of Jesse James. Such self-aware
                         performance—and an examination of what it reveals about the role of media
                         in creating and sustaining popular notions about socially deviant
                         behavior—makes for far more interesting and noteworthy reading than
                         literal, blow-by-blow reconstructions of each of Rande&apos;s encounters
                         with the law.</p>
                    <p>More important, if, as Dugan says, banditry&apos;s popularity derived from
                         class resentment against the excesses of the Gilded Age, then Dugan might
                         have analyzed Rande&apos;s presentation of self and the public acceptance
                         of his portrayal along class lines. Like Jonathan Spence&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Death
                         of Woman Wang</hi> (1998), <hi rend="i">The Brilliant Bandit of the Wabash</hi> could have
                         combined an intensive study of court records with a broader analysis of the
                         culture in which both the law and its consequences were situated. That,
                         perhaps, is a subject for Dugan&apos;s next book.</p>

                    <p>James J. Connolly&apos;s <hi rend="i">An Elusive Unity</hi> considers a topic
                         that has been examined frequently by specialists in the Gilded Age and
                         Progressive Era: the rise of political machines in an America being rapidly
                         transformed by industrialization and urbanization. With a nod to Robert
                         Merton, Alexander Callow, Amy Bridges, Bruce Stave, and an assortment of
                         political scientists and historians who have written perceptively about the
                         big city bosses who dominated the urban scene for decades, Connolly retells
                         the stories of <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7007567"
                                   reg="New York">New York City</settlement></placeName>&apos;s Boss

                         notorious local political leaders. Despite traversing much familiar ground,
                         the author manages to enrich our understanding of machine politics through
                         his creative use of primary sources (including novels, memoirs,
                         journalistic accounts, political cartoons, and photographs) and careful
                         examination of the relationship between political parties and other groups
                         that played important roles in elections and local governance in American
                         cities. Chapters dealing with workingmen&apos;s organizations and
                         reform-minded clubwomen explain cogently how crafty bosses withstood
                         challenges to their party dominance, just as another chapter recounts the
                         ways that professional politicians used newspapers, popular magazines, and
                         other media to mount an effective defense of their value as brokers between
                         competing interests in polyglot urban settings. A brief epilogue
                         discusses the enduring popularity of Edwin O&apos;Connor&apos;s <hi rend="i">The Last
                         Hurrah</hi> (1956) and assesses that novel&apos;s importance in shaping 
                         scholarly and popular perceptions of bosses and machines.</p>
                    <p>Connolly situates his analysis of bosses and machines within a larger
                         discussion of the tensions that have characterized American politics for
                         more than two centuries. His examination of competing interest groups in
                         a small sample of big cities suggests that similar developments occurred
                         throughout industrializing <placeName><country key="tgn_7012149" reg="United
                              States">America</country></placeName>. Thus, the rise of big city bosses
                         reflected a rearrangement of local institutions and the transformation of
                         political practices, signaling the triumph of pluralism over a 
                         republicanism based upon civic virtue and moral order. According to the author,
                         the American politics that developed after the Civil War—seen first in the
                         political machines that gained control in large eastern and midwestern
                         cities—reinforced masculine leadership, rewarded party discipline, and
                         recognized ethnic and class differences, while business leaders, women,
                         and labor leaders raised objections to the emerging political order. The
                              <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-107-3-088"/> rejection of socialism and an
                         inadequate attention to class interests in the cities led to a reform
                         politics limited to structural changes and efficient management of
                         resources. The rise of political machines, which proved to be imperfect
                         tools for reconciling diversity and representative government,
                         constituted the acceptance of a flawed pluralism and the loss of a
                         republican ideal. As Connolly reminds us in this thoughtful 
                         reconsideration of machine politics, Americans&apos; chronic disaffection with
                         American politics and government reflects both a lingering romantic
                         reverence for republican ideals and a determination to nurture a more
                         open, inclusive political order.</p>

                    <p>William T. Horner&apos;s detailed portrayal of Mark Hanna aims to correct
                         misperceptions of Hanna&apos;s role in both <placeName><region type="state"
                              key="tgn_7007706" reg="Ohio">Ohio</region></placeName> and national politics
                         during the closing decades of the nineteenth century. These
                         misperceptions are the result, the author contends, of inadequately
                         researched contemporary news coverage repeated without investigation by
                         modern journalists, as well as of intentional misstatements by the Hearst
                         newspapers and other political opponents of Hanna.</p>
                    <p>Hanna has been portrayed as the puppeteer controlling the actions of
                         Republican presidential candidate William McKinley in 1896. Horner shows,
                         however, that Charles Dawes and other major campaign funders also played
                         major roles in McKinley&apos;s campaign and that the candidate made several
                         important decisions against Hanna&apos;s advice, including the decision to
                         run a &quot;front porch&quot; campaign. The author notes as well that
                         Dawes and others &quot;were far more influential than Hanna once McKinley
                         became president&quot; (p. 307).</p>
                    <p>Another often-repeated misperception, Horner tells us, is the notion that
                         Hanna created the assessment method of campaign funding, a practice by
                         which the campaign told corporations what proportion of their corporate
                         assets they must contribute in order to stay in the administration&apos;s
                         good graces. The author shows that this method had already been used in the
                         Benjamin Harrison campaign and argues that the large sums Hanna <pb n="277"
                              id="VAA4025-107-3-089"/> raised for McKinley&apos;s campaign were
                         necessary due to the intensity of the issues of the election.</p>
                    <p>Horner also rebuts the charge that Hanna engaged in political activities
                         for personal power or financial gain. Hanna made no effort, Horner
                         contends, to use his newspaper to promote his own business interests, nor
                         did he pursue a job in the Garfield administration even after making
                         substantial efforts on behalf of Garfield&apos;s successful presidential
                         candidacy. Similarly, Hanna raised money for McKinley, Horner argues,
                         because he believed McKinley was the best presidential candidate—although
                         it seems clear that Hanna stood to gain far more from a McKinley
                         administration than he would from a victory by Democratic opponent William
                         Jennings Bryan. The author acknowledges Hanna&apos;s willingness to condone
                         bribery and commitment to reward political services with patronage, but
                         defends both practices as common at the time.</p>
                    <p>Homer&apos;s analysis is less persuasive on some points. His broad 
                         indictment of the media ranges from claims that &quot;the modern
                         press&quot;—in
                         opposition to its late nineteenth-century counterpart—&quot;is largely
                         nonpartisan and objective in its coverage of politics&quot; (p. 5), to
                         the seemingly contradictory statement that current media coverage shows
                         &quot;objective journalism on the wane,&quot; in a manner similar to
                         Hanna&apos;s time (p. 315). His argument that the parties are much weaker
                         now than in Hanna&apos;s lifetime seems to depend on research more relevant
                         to the 1970s than to our own time. The book is often repetitive. And I
                         would have liked to see more discussion about the comparison between Hanna
                         and George W. Bush&apos;s adviser Karl Rove, a comparison Horner 
                         discounts. As the author himself notes, just as Rove hoped to expand the
                         Republican coalition in the 2000s, Hanna did so by appealing to 
                         immigrants and urban workers, drawing on techniques such as printing campaign
                         materials in a number of different languages. That is an important story
                         that deserves telling in greater detail.</p>

                    <p>In his book <hi rend="i">The Rise of the Ku Klux Klan: Right-Wing Movements and National
                         Politics</hi>, sociologist Rory McVeigh offers critical insights into the
                         strategies and constituency of the 1920s Klan. The work offers a 
                         sophisticated new explanation of the quick rise of an organization that, at its
                         height, numbered more than three million.</p>
                    <p>McVeigh&apos;s analysis challenges as too simplistic prior research that
                         treated Klansmen as &quot;irrational, ignorant, or gullible&quot; (p. 36)
                         or, alternatively, as &quot;downwardly mobile&quot; folks &quot;clinging
                         to a worldview that was becoming obsolete in a changing world&quot; (p.
                         133). Instead, McVeigh reveals an organization that carefully crafted its
                         narratives and political positions to appeal to a predominantly 
                         middle-class constituency.</p>
                    <p>Using a sophisticated content analysis of Klan publications—in particular
                         the group&apos;s national newsletter Imperial Knight-Hawk—McVeigh shows
                         that the group&apos;s mobilization correlated with a perceived decline in
                         status for many native-born, white Protestants. Klan members were 
                         predominantly small businessmen, shop owners, and craftsmen who felt
                         threatened by cheap factory labor undertaken by immigrants and funded by
                         big financial institutions. The threat was real. Working conditions were
                         rapidly shifting as large-scale factories took over manufacturing from
                         family-run firms. In response, McVeigh argues, the Klan crafted a series of
                         nativist and racist appeals designed to play upon these fears. In keeping
                         with its populist approach, the Klan also supported such civic institutions
                         as public schools as an important bulwark against downward mobility.</p>
                    <p>McVeigh&apos;s analytical frame is heavily influenced by market theory and
                         the concepts of supply and demand. He examines the market competition—not
                         only economic but also political and social—faced by the Klan&apos;s core
                         constituency and argues that &quot;the movement thrived on cultural
                         homogeneity and tended to be most active in states in which native-born
                         white Protestants greatly outnumbered immigrants and Catholics&quot; (p.
                         180). Contact with immigrants or people of color was not what allowed the
                         Klan to flourish; rather, it did well where there was a lack of diversity
                         and arguments for cultural homogeneity were more widely accepted. That
                         meant that the Klan would grow strongest in the Midwest, particularly in
                         <placeName><region type="state" key="tgn_7007252"
                              reg="Indiana">Indiana</region></placeName>, even if its chapters could be found nationwide.</p>
                    <p>Even with the resources of its constituency and the success of its recruiting
                         effort, the Klan fell apart <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-107-3-091"/> within a
                         few years of reaching its height. McVeigh finds that infighting, bad press,
                         and political missteps prior to the 1924 presidential election all
                         contributed to the Klan&apos;s decline. By 1928, only a few hundred
                         thousand members remained in the group.</p>
                    <p>In a larger context, McVeigh&apos;s work makes a strong case for why
                         conservative and liberal social movements should be treated differently.
                         McVeigh rightly points out that conservative social movements offer
                         remedies for populations that have power, but believe they are being
                         challenged by changes in society. Because of this established power, social
                         movements from the right tend to bring greater resources to bear on their
                         causes. Liberal social movements, on the other hand, look to expand
                         opportunities and rights to previously excluded sectors of society. Their
                         work is harder, as the populations they represent are usually oppressed
                         and thus have less access to financial and other resources to fund their
                         battles. These clear differences argue strongly for separate analyses of
                         social movements from the right and the left.</p>

                    <p>Victoria Grieve&apos;s book is a welcome addition to the literature on New
                         Deal art programs. Surprisingly, it is also the first sustained examination
                         of the early twentieth-century emergence of a middlebrow culture as it
                         pertains to the visual arts. Sparsely illustrated, the book nonetheless
                         complements studies of New Deal artwork by illuminating post-World War I
                         cultural theories that planted the seeds for Federal Art Project (FAP)
                         initiatives in the 1930s. Historians and art historians alike will want
                         to read with a laptop nearby to see examples of artworks by some of the
                         lesser-known artists under discussion.</p>
                    <p>Grieve&apos;s study arrives as a growing number of scholars of American art
                         history have begun to examine the 1920s. Situated between the criticism of
                         the genteel Gilded Age and that of the populist New Deal era, the 
                         period&apos;s art criticism resists easy  <pb n="280"
                              id="VAA4025-107-3-092"/> categorization. Grieve aims to correct the tendency
                         among historians to see the controversies of the New Deal cultural
                         projects in terms of &quot;economics, employment, and politics&quot; or
                         as the result of radical cultural agendas in urban centers like

                         City</settlement></placeName> (pp. 3-6). Instead she focuses on tensions rooted in conflicting
                         ideas about the role of art itself. While some progressive reformers
                         embraced a conception of fine art as the purview of an educated elite,
                         others adopted more participatory models of culture. Still others merged
                         the goal of uplift with that of participation to form a middlebrow
                         alternative. The economic upheaval of the Great Depression finally put
                         these new ideas about art&apos;s accessibility to the test.</p>
                    <p>IMH readers may well be familiar with the philosophies of John Dewey; those
                         with additional interest in the history of American art may also know the
                         innovative museum exhibitions and programming undertaken by John Cotton
                         Dana and Albert C. Barnes. However, here we see their boundary-breaking
                         definitions of art and their faith in its educational potential as
                         important precursors to the FAP&apos;s public art agenda. Likewise,
                         Grieve&apos;s nuanced discussion of shifting cultural prerogatives provides
                         a lens through which to view other artists of the period not discussed
                         here. The painter Cecilia Beaux, for instance, stood out for her praise of
                         soldier statues in 1919. When most art world types hoped World War I
                         memorials would little resemble Civil War statues, Beaux suggested that
                         artists make replicas of their designs for communities who could not afford
                         originals. She viewed the emotional and commercial accessibility of
                         soldier memorials as an advantage rather than a liability. Grieve links the
                         FAP&apos;s support of art for the common man to these earlier strains of
                         art criticism, even if it took financial crisis to make them a
                         widespread, though contested, reality.</p>
                    <p>The second half of the book is refreshing for its focus on lesser-studied New
                         Deal art programs. Admirers (and skeptics) of <placeName><region

                         more about the <hi rend="i">Index of American Design and Community Art
                              Centers</hi>. As Grieve shows, anything purporting to be as
                         comprehensive as the <hi rend="i">Index</hi> may say as much by what it
                         excludes as by what it includes (bringing to mind current art digitization
                         projects). FAP director Holger Cahill nonetheless had faith that these
                         initiatives, despite their limitations, would stimulate public interest in
                         contemporary art. Though not discussed here, World War I &quot;liberty
                         houses&quot; offer another example of how FAP programs like the Art Centers
                         echoed earlier progressive impulses by promoting the &quot;active
                         study&quot; of art through community exhibitions and classes (p.141).
                         Grieve&apos;s discussion of the Art Centers is especially relevant at a
                         moment when cultural institutions struggle to nurture new audiences and
                         connect with local communities. In summary, Grieve&apos;s book offers fresh
                         insights into the ways that bold <pb n="281" id="VAA4025-107-3-093"/>

                         collaborators uncover the forces leading to the establishment of local
                         chapters, the mobilization of rank-and-file members, the implementation of
                         community programs, and the impact of FBI surveillance and
                         counterintelligence efforts on the growth and development of each
                         branch.</p>
                    <p>Utilizing archival materials and interviews, the essays in Comrades cast BPP
                         members as social service workers, not militants involved in standoffs with
                         police. This more holistic analysis leads to several conclusions about
                         local branches. First, since <hi rend="i">The Black Panther</hi> newspaper accounted for
                         their most reliable source of revenue, offered work for many of their
                         members, and kept members connected to the community, the paper&apos;s
                         distribution posed a threat to entities seeking to suppress the
                         organization. Second, law enforcement&apos;s active opposition to the BPP
                         financially crippled most branches, as members struggled to pay legal fees
                         for fighting arrests, to replace damaged property, and to recoup their
                         physical health. Third, college and high school students constituted a
                         greater percentage of the membership than other demographics in most
                         chapters. Fourth, the opportunism of members who were informants or who
                         were merely interested in the cachet of being affiliated with the BPP
                         eroded chapters from within. Finally <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-107-3-094"/>
                         and most important, the BPP rank and file&apos;s principal achievements
                         included the establishment and operation of such programs as free 
                         breakfasts for children, food and clothing giveaways, busing to prisons, health
                         clinics, political education classes, and the perhaps better-known 
                         community patrols.</p>
                    <p>The essays explore the particularities of each branch, and midwestern
                         chapters enjoyed their own special triumphs. The work of the Black Panthers
                         in <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7014071" reg="Milwaukee"
                                   >Milwaukee</settlement></placeName>, for example, led to a
                         heightened awareness of childhood hunger in that city that had lasting
                         impacts beyond the twentieth century; in <placeName><settlement type="city"
                              key="tgn_7013608" reg="Cleveland">Cleveland</settlement></placeName>, many of the alternative
                         institutions put in place by the party remain active long after the branch
                         had disbanded. The <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                              reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> chapter stood out for the mere fact of its
                         presence in a city noted for its reserved and calm response to racial
                         issues. Though it suffered like every other BPP chapter from harassment by
                         law enforcement agencies, the <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"
                              reg="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</settlement></placeName> branch was considered &quot;the
                         most non-violent chapter in the country&quot; (p. 147) and the authors tie
                         both its successes and its demise to interracial alliances as well as to
                         the relative comfort <placeName><settlement type="city" key="tgn_7012924"

                         large midwestern cities.</p>
                    <p>With a clear structure, compelling photographs, and an honest introduction
                         that brings the entire work together, Comrades&apos; only major shortcoming
                         may be the brevity of its histories. Even as African Americanists
                         diligently work at writing histories of the 1960s and 1970s, future
                         historians will need to write fuller histories of these chapters. As the
                         book&apos;s conclusion notes, historians should consider each branch&apos;s
                         history and social service components in light of the &quot;rightward
                         transformation of American political culture [that] set in motion the
                         erasure of the meaning and significance of the Black Panther Party&quot;

                         pre-construction planning. Importantly, Dellinger also details the ways
                         in which opposing forces in the affected states have sought to block the
                         highway. In sum, he uses the history of I-69 to assess larger issues:
                         &quot;The magnitude of the project has made Interstate 69 a fault line for
                         many of the key questions confronting Americans: not just matters of
                         transportation policy, macroeconomics, and land-use planning, but also
                         the tug-of-war between urban and rural, and the blurry distinction between
                         standard of living and quality of life&quot; (p. 9).</p>

                         reminiscences of former teachers in an effort to preserve the
                         schools&apos; social, cultural, and educational heritage. The storytellers
                         in this volume reflect on issues ranging from students with special needs
                         to evolving methods of discipline to students&apos; home lives—even to the

                         student—will appreciate Montell&apos;s valuable compilation.</p>
