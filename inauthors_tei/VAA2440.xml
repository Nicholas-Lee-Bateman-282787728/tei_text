                            of the cliff. From up L. C. (meeting upper L. end of railing) the wall
                            of the hotel runs obliquely down to L. where it corners, and runs into
                            foliage wing down L. leaving an entrance there from wings. A door

                            to hotel. This door is of modern Italian style: glass nearly to base,
                            with lace shade. A single step is before the door, which is not on the

                            youthful looking American of about thirty-five, good-natured, shrewd,
                            humorous and kindly. His voice has the homely quality of the central
                            states, clear, quiet, and strong, with a very slight drawl at times when
                            the situation strikes him as humorous; often exhibiting an apologetic
                            character of tone. He does not speak a dialect in the strict sense. His
                            English is the United States language as spoken by the average citizen
                            to be met on a day coach anywhere in the central states. He is clean
                            shaven, and his hair, which shows a slight tendency to gray, is neatly
                            parted on the left side. His brown straw hat is tall-crowned with a
                            medium brim, the latter edged with a thin strip of black, and a narrow
                            black ribbon around the crown. The hat, like the rest of his apparel, is
                            neither new nor old. His shirt, &quot;lay-down&quot; collar and
                            cuffs, are of white, well-laundered linen. He wears a black string tie.
                            He wears instead of a <pb id="VAA2440-056" n="52"/> coat a linen
                            (perhaps pongee) duster, extending to the knees. It is not of a
                            fashionable cut, does not suggest an auto-wrap, but it is not
                            unbecoming, nor does it grotesquely fail to fit him. His waistcoat, cut
                            medium low, is of a gray mixture, neither dark nor light. His trousers
                            are of the same material and not fashionably cut, but they fit him well
                            and are neither baggy at the knees nor high-water. His shoes are plain
                            black Congress gaiters and show a good shine. In brief he is just the
                            average well-to-do but untravelled citizen that you might meet on the
                            accommodation train between Logansport and Kokomo, Indiana. As he enters
                            he is wiping his face after his ablutions, with a large towel, his hat
                            pushed far back on his head. The sleeves of his duster are turned back,
                            and his detachable cuffs are in the pocket of his duster. He comes
                            through the doors rubbing his face with the towel, but pausing for a
                            moment on the stoop, drops the towel from his face to dry his hands. All

                            across stage to up R. This wall is almost covered with vines, showing
                            autumn tints, crowning the crest of the wall and hanging from it in
                            profusion. In the wall up C. is a broad green gate of the Southern
                            Italian type, closed. From up R. a white-columned pergola runs obliquely
                            to down R. The top of the pergola is an awning formed by a skeleton of
                            green painted wooden strips thickly covered by entwining lemon branches
                            bearing ripening lemons. Between the columns of the pergolathat is, to
                            R.are glimpses of a formal Italian garden: flowers, hedges, and a broad
                            flat marble vase on a slender pedestal, etc. Up L. a two-story wing of
                            the hotel meets wall at the back and runs squarely across to tree-wings

                            shows windows (not practicable), and is as short as can be made
                            plausible, the object being to throw the building up stage as far as
                            possible. The wall of the hotel facing audience shows open double doors
                            near its R. corner, with windows upstairs and below all with lowered
                            awnings. One window on upper floor as near L. extremity as possible, and
                            yet fully visible to audience, is practicable. One window on lower
                            floor, nearest double doors, is practicable. Boxes of flowers on the
                            ledges of all the windows, and along base of wall to hotel a narrow
                            strip of well-tended flowers, except where a single broad step leading
                            to doorway interrupts it. A Venetian well L. C. with wrought-iron
                            overwork, showing hanging chain. A marble bench down L. among
                            shrubberies; an open touring-car down R. under the awning formed by the
                            overhang of the pergola; bag of tools open on stage near-by, floor

                            in the second, I kept behind the shade. And suddenly a tramp-looking man

                            he came down and talked to this Yankee person and the Yankee person took
                            off his blouse and put it on the tramp and made him get under the

                            association with trade. He has spent so much of his life out of England
                            that it is difficult to find out a great deal about him. Nothing here in

                            deportment, manners, and ideals, which have lifted her above the mere
                            American circumstance of her birth. She has ambitions. If you stand in
                            the way of them she will wither, she will die like a caged bird. All
                            that was sordid about her parentage, she has cast off. We have thought

                            It&apos;s kind of lonesome sometimes, and then I get to thinking
