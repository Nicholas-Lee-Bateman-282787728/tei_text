                <p TEIform="p">ONE Autumn Afternoon a gray-haired Agriculturist took his youngest Olive Branch, by the
                    Hand and led him away to a Varsity. Wilbur was 18 and un Onion. He had outgrown his last
                    year&apos;s Tunic, and his Smalls were hardly on speaking terms with his Uppers. He had large,
                    warty Hands, which floated idly at his sides, and his Wrists resembled extra Sets of Knuckles. When
                    he walked, his Legs gave way at the Hinge and he Interfered. On his Head was a little Wideawake with
                    a Buckle at the Side. Mother had bobbed his Hair and rubbed in a little Goose-Grease to make it
                    shine. The Collar that he wore was size 13, and called the Rollo Shape. It rose to a Height of a
                    half-inch above his Neck-Band. For a Cravat he had a Piece of watered Silk Ribbon with Butterflies
                    on it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Wilbur had his Money tied up in a Hand kerchief, and he carried a Paper Telescope loaded
                    down with one Complete Change and <pb id="VAA2321-028" n="22" TEIform="pb"/> a Catalogue of the
                    Institution showing that the Necessary Expenses were not more than $3.40 per Week.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As the Train pulled away from Pewee Junction Wilbur began to Leak. The Salt Tears
                    trickled down through the Archipelago of Freckles. He wanted to Crawfish, but Paw bought him a Box
                    of Crackerjack and told him that if he got an Education and improved his Opportunities some day he
                    might be County Superintendent of Schools and get his $900 a Year just like finding it. So Wilbur
                    spunked up and said he would try to stick it out. He got out the Catalogue and read all of the
                    copper-riveted Rules for the Moral Guidance of Students.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Curriculum had him scared. He saw that in the next four Years he would have to soak
                    up practically all the Knowledge on the Market. But he was cheered to think that if he persevered
                    and got through he would be entitled to wear an Alpaca Coat and a Lawn</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Tie and teach in the High-School, so he took Courage and began to notice the Scenery.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Wilbur was planted in a Boarding-House guaranteed to provide Wholesome Food and a Home
                    Influence. Father went back after making a final Discourse on the importance of learning most
                    everything in all of the Books.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Nine Months later they were down at the Depot to meet Wilbur. He had written several
                    times, saying that he could not find time to come Home, as he was in pursuit of Knowledge every
                    Minute of the Day, and if he left the Track, Knowledge might gain several Laps on him. It looked
                    reasonable, too, for the future Superintendent of Schools had spent $400 for Books, $200 for
                    Scientific Appa ratus, and something like $60 for Chemicals to be used in the Laboratory.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">When the Train suddenly checked itself, to avoid running past the Town. there came out of
                    the Parlor Car something that looked like Fitz, on account of the Padding in the Shoulders. Just
                    above one Ear he wore a dinky Cap about the size of a Postage Stamp. The Coat reached almost to the
                    Hips and was but <pb id="VAA2321-031" n="[25]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    They were reefed to show feverish Socks of a zigzag Pattern. The Shoes were very Bull-Doggy, and
                    each had a wide Terrace running around it. Father held on to a Truck for Support. Never before had
                    he seen a genuine case of the inflammatory Rah-Rahs.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Wilbur was smoking a dizzy little Pipe from which the Smoke curled upward, losing itself
                    in a copious Forelock that moved gently in the Breeze. Instead of a Collar, Wilbur was wearing a
                    Turkish Towel. He had the Harvard Walk down pat. With both Hands in his Pockets, the one who had
                    been pursuing Knowledge teetered towards the Author of his Being ami said, &quot; How are you,
                    Governor?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Father was always a Lightning Calculator, and as he stood there trying to grasp and
                    comprechend and mentally close in, as it were, on the Burlap Suit and the Coon Shirt and the sassy
                    Pipe, something told him that Wil bur would have to Switch if he expected to be County

                    up to the-House right away. Then drive me Home by the Outside Road, because I don&apos;t want to

                    were standing around the Shop doing the Soldier Act. He learned to snap his Fingers every time the

                    She wore those long. lozenge-shaped Rings that blind the Spectator, and she had a different Sunburst
                    for every Day in the Week and a Diamond Tarara that made the other Women sizzle with Envy. She wore

                    avoid spoiling the Picture, and at the same time keep the Draught away from the other People. At a
                    Dinner-Party he was usually put in between two gabby Girls who had tacit Instructions to keep him
                    elbowed into the Background.</p>

                    the Family Gibraltar, while his Wife and Jessie were supposed to be more Floral Ornaments. Best of
                    all, Hiram was known to be a Star at getting the Coin. The Fact that the Family put up such a tall
                    Front in the Society Column helped the Public to believe that Hiram was as good as Old Wheat he was
                    supposed to be long on Business Integrity. It was argued that one so Yappy would have to be
                    correspondingly Honest.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Hiram was so Severe and Puritanical and <pb id="VAA2321-045" n="39" TEIform="pb"/> had so
                    much clinging Agricultural Simplicity that no one dreamed the Truth about him. In Reality, his
                    Arteries were surcharged with Sporting Blood. When no one suspected it, he liked to put on a Mask
                    and sneak out and hold up the Stock Market. That is what he did until one sad Day in May the Stock
                    Market up and Did him. He got it right where the Hired Girl wears the Ruching.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Hiram came home as pale as a Ghost and broke the News that he was in the Hole. He
                    hesitated to tell the Wife, for she was a Fragile Being, unaccustomed to the rude Buffets of the
                    Strenuous Life, and he feared that such a cruel Blow might crush her. But he finally divulged the
                    frightful Truth and then flopped to the Settee and began to Bluff about killing himself, so that she
                    could get the Insurance Money. She told him to Behave, and then she went out and made a Cup of
                    Strong Tea for him.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">The Man who lived in the Wicked Metrop-olis was named Sanford and the Cousin who lived
                    out in the Woods was known as Lafe, although his real Name was Lafayette.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Every Christmas Sanford would send Lafe some kind of a stingy Gift, and then Lafe would
                    retaliate by shipping in a fat Turkey for Thanksgiving. There was a formal Exchange of Letters about
                    twice per Year.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Sanford was a good deal Upset one day to receive Word that Cousin Lafayette was coming to
                    spend a Week. Whatever Joy he felt he did not show at all.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The visiting Cousin is liable to be a Fierce Proposition under the most favorable
                    Conditions, but it is more than Hard Lurk to be saddled with one who is Total Stranger Sanford was

                    wrote Cousin Lafe to be sure and come right to the House.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Sanford saw a very pink Week ahead of him. He was not very Strong for the Lafe around and
                    show him the Sky-Scrapers, the Animals in the Park, the Eden Musee, and the big Engine in the
                    Power-House. He had observed that the Excursionist is always keen to sec a lot of Sights that are a

                <p TEIform="p">Sanford tried to get a line on Cousin Lafe so as to frame up the right kind of a
                    Programme. He could tell by the Picture in the Family Album that Lafe was a Pure Character and
                    somewhat of a Rube. He wore a White Tie and had his Hair gummed down on his Forehead. He looked as
                    if he would like to be a Preacher hut could not quite make it. His open Countenance had that sweet

                <p TEIform="p">So far as Sanford could learn, Cousin Lafe was a kind of moral Sign-Board and snow white
                    Object-Lesson in the Jay Town which claimed him as its own. He was a Cemetery Trustee and Chairman
                    of the Committee to solicit Funds for a new Y. M. C. A. Building. Also he had been prominent in the
                    Sunday-Closing Movement and the Main Kazoo in the Citizens&apos; Reform League.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Accordingly, Sanford had all the Drinkables removed from the Sideboard, and he warned the
                    Children not to I augh while Cousin Lafe was saying Grace at the Table. Then be went out and bought
                    some Tickets for a Lecture, and got a written Permit to go through the Car-Shops.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He went to the Station to meet the rural Lamb and protect him against the Cabmen. He saw
                    a Hot Sport with a new Suit of Clothes and a Red Tie come through the Gate, but be did not spot
                    anything that resembled a Cemetery Trustee. While he was still waiting, the Hot Sport came up and
                    walloped him on the Back and introduced himself.</p>

                    a Folding-Hat and a Cape-Coat. His Glad Raiment carried him right into Sussiety, and he began to
                    meet Gazelles that suited him, so he figured on the Probable Expense of Keeping House.</p>

                    Chairs. Before the Lease expired Pet discovered that the Dining-Room was too small, and began to
                    dream Dreams of a House of their Own in which they could Entertain. So he tucked back his Cuffs and
                    took a fresh Grip on the World of Trade, and honed like a Turk, making Payments on the House. He was
                    beginning to look round-shouldered, but he drank plenty of Coffee and smoked fat Cigars and buckled

                    Accordingly he went in Debt up to his Eyes. He would lie awake at Night casting up his Liabilities
                    and computing Interest. He talked to himself on the Street, and acted just the least bit Dippy, But
                    he was determined to swing the Deal, and then, as soon as he was out of the Woods, he could take a

                <p TEIform="p">One Reason why Wilbur had such a strong Pull with the Buds was that he never permitted
                    his Work to interfere with his Social Duties. They could get him on the Phone at any time and book
                    him for any kind of a Stunt from a Luncheon to a Golf Tourney. He kept his Evening Clothes at the
                    Office, and he could respond to a Dinner Invitation like a Fireman going to a Fire. He never

                    belongs to a Club. He cultivated the antique Hens who make out the Invitation Lists, and that is why
                    Wilbur usually led the German and distributed the Favors when the Smart Set pulled off a Cotillon.</p>

                    Date-Book.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Year after Year the Ladies&apos; Idol con tinued his heart-breaking Career, not
                    because he wished to be Cruel, but because he couldn&apos;t help being so all-fired Entrancing.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">There never was a time when he could have put a Tag on any Dulcinea without putting a
                    Blight on the entire Female Community; so ho waited.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In fact, he overdid the Waiting Act.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">About the time that he outgrew his Hair and began to look a little puffy around the Eyes,
                    the Lumty-Tum $EAlite caught the Ath letic Fever. The Real Boy in Sussiety was <pb id="VAA2321-118"

                    of Polo Ponies.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Little Wilbur, the has-been Midge, found that he could drift into a Drawing-Room without
                    causing the faintest Ripple.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now that he was becoming Bald and Shelf-Worn, no one cared to use him as a Pet.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He was lucky if he got a few kind Words from some elderly Patroness. As for the Girls who

                    him so often that at last he got wise to himself and realized that he belonged on the Top Shelf.</p>

                    Drawing-Rooms Queens. They were Gum-Chewers of the most abandoned Type, and what they did to the
                    English Language it would he a shame to tell. Each of them was more or less stuck on some chinless
                    Percy who wore his Watch-Chain high up and rubbed himself with Eau de Cologne. They had read Popular
                    Novels until they were a trifle Moony. Their conception of Romance was to eat Pickles and write
                    Notes on Blue Paper.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">As for the Girls, they usually flocked in a Corner and had a Whispering-Bee. At tire
                    Table they would get an Attack of the Giggles, without letting any one else in on the Good Thing,
                    thus making it very enjoyable for the Guests.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Ma had a proud Chance to win a Social Standing so long as she was handicapped by that
                    Band of Yokels. Just when she would be talking Art with a Massachusetts Accent, one of the Boys
                    would break in with a Demand for a Second Helping of Cauliflower. Or else the Prize Blacksmith in a

                    the Horrible Breaks they had made. She said that sitting around in the Kitchen cracking Hickory-Nuts
                    was about their Size when it came to playing the Society Game. She allowed that they would be more
                    at Home if they moved out to some Hunch and associated with the Live-Stock. When Ma got riled she
                    forgot her Culture-Club training and handed out a very Tabasco Line of Conversation.</p>

                    He was President of the Company, and seemed to think that his Official Position gave him a Right to
                    break Crackers into his Soup. He refused to wear a White Tie with his Evening Clothes just because

                    touch him up for Denominational Colleges, or who had Good Things which they wished him to buck with

                    his Nervous System, he ducked away to the Country and left word behind that he had gone to Europe.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">He struck a Rest Cure, where every one dressed for Dinner and a full Orchestra tore off
                    Popular Music. He saw the same Mournful Faces of the male and female Plutocrats who were trying to

                    Effect on him. So he wandered away from the Hotel and took to <pb id="VAA2321-130" n="124"

                    for years trying to get the Hammer-Lock on Fame, and when it comes to a Cash In nobody knows whose

                    Attorney-General Knox is going to do. When he&apos;s hungry all he has to do is put on the

                    that a $7 Lunch was a Delusion unless I had an Appetite. The Automobile was a Hit until some of the
                    New Machines began to pass me, and then I lost Interest. As soon as it was noised around that I had
                    Stuff, I became a Mark for every known Con Game, so I tightened up and refused to see Visitors, and
                    every one <pb id="VAA2321-138" n="132" TEIform="pb"/> said I was a Snob, and the only Friends I had
                    were the Waiters I tipped. So far as I ran discover, the Bust-Head resulting from the Bubbles that
                    cost $6 per Quart is the same old Feeling that we used to get out of Apple-Jack. In short, I begin

                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was a great big Burly who had a Wife about the size of a Grasshopper. Usually
                    she wore a gray Tailor-Made that looked as if it would have to be let out if she gained another
                    pound.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Any one, to look at Jessaline, would have said that she was rather frail and Weakly,
                    while the he-end of the Sketch looked husky enough to pull a Dray. It often happens that the
                    heavy-draught Bachelor picks out a Midge and makes love to her, and she is so scared at the size of
                    him that she hasn&apos;t got the Nerver to throw him down</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At any rate, the cute and dainty little Jessaline, with a Waist Measurement of 11 inches,
                    was all hooked up with the human Mastodon who went by the name of Henry and looked the Part.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now it happened that Hen and Jess lived in a nice little Town where there were a great
                    many lovely Old Families and a great deal of</p>
                <pb id="VAA2321-142" n="136" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">Wealth, but it was pervaded at all Hours by a Cemetery Calm. The Social Gayeties of the
                    Place revolved slowly around a Missionary Society. Any one desiring to mix a Cocktail had to pull
                    down all the Blinds and disconnect the Telephone, and also it was advisable to wear Masks at a Poker
                    Party.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Jessaline would often become restless and champ at the Bit. She had attended a Select
                    School for Girls, at which she bad learned how to turn Handsprings and do other Parlor Didoes. No
                    wonder that she hated to play Dominoes all livening and then turn out the Lights at 9.30 P.M.,
                    which, in Keen Society, is the mere Edge of the Night.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Now it chanced that Jessaline had a Chum. They had eaten Olives out of the same Bottle
                    while attending the Select School for Girls. Chum had gone against the Matrimonial Game, the same as
                    Jessaline, only, instead of landing in Sleepy Hollow, she was up in the City, taking in the Big
                    Show.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She wrote to Jessaline, urging her to come up and put in a busy Week. After working <pb

                    in reading the whole Letter, and she began to tease Henry to knock off for a Week and take her up to
                    the hoop-la Metropolis and let her burn a few Holes in the Track. She told Henry that he had been
                    sticking to his Desk too closely and that he needed a good Rest.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Large Bodies move slowly, and several Days elapsed before Henry came to her Way of
                    Thinking, although it was a Pipe from the beginning that she would bring him around.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Jessaline got busy and put six Women to work building a new Evening Gown for her It was a
                    Pale-Blue Cerise with Batten-berg Insertion, yoked with Mayonnaise and Valenciennes, the Flounces
                    being gathered in with Passementerie and the Bodice hand-painted. When Henry got a Flash at the Bill
                    he allowed that, instead of taking a Vacation, it would be better for him to stay at Home and work
                    about twice as hard. But winsome Wifey had everything packed, so <pb id="VAA2321-145" n="139"
                        TEIform="pb"/> she took him in Tow and they boarded the Flyer.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Ain&apos;t this Grand?&quot;asked Jessaline, as they sat in the
                    palatial Parlor-Car and watched the Scenery spin by. &quot;We have a whole Week in which to rest
                    up and nobody to keep Tab on what we do and then report us to the Methodist Minister. I&apos;m
                    sure that you will like Clara. She is a Holy Terror. She was engaged nineteen times before she
                    finally hooked up, and since she got Married People come for miles to get her to act, as
                    Chaperon.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;What is the Programme?&quot; asked Henry,</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;There&apos;ll be something doing every Minute, all right, all
                    right,&quot; said the Child-Wife. &quot;Ask no Questions, but follow little Bright Eyes. I
                    haven&apos;t had a touch of Real Life since I crawled down the Liglitning-Rod at the Select
                    School for Girls.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At that time Henry did not realize that a bright young Thing with a Boarding-School
                    Education can give the stalwart Business</p>

                <p TEIform="p">Clara met them at the Train with a Buzz-Wagon. She had framed up a List of Engagements
                    that made the Roosevelt Itinerary look like Open Time. Clara had arranged to give them a little of
                    Everything except Sleep. Jessaline was tickled nearly to Death. She was waltzing all over the Track,
                    waiting for the word &quot;Go!&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Getaway was a Dinner of 17 Courses, at which Jessaline tackled everything with-out
                    losing any part of the Conversation. After that they went to the Opera, which was a little too high
                    for Henry, but Jessaline threw a Conniption Fit every time Signor Dagolini climbed up and hit a Top
                    Note. They went hack to the Apartment and ate Stuff out of a Chafing-Dish until 3 A.M. When they
                    turned in, Henry was on the point of Passing Away, but Jessaline was just beginning to warm up and
                    be kittenish.</p>

                    But when he sat and watched her eating her fourth Hearty Meal and chatting gayly, he tried to figure

                    and holding on to a Chair to keep from falling off. Jessaline was right out in the centre of the
                    Mix-Up, looking as fresh as a Dollar Hunch of Russian Violets. After every Dance she would tear out
                    and get a few Glasses of Knock-Out Punch and eat a couple of Sandwiches, after which she would be
                    ready to do some more two-stepping. When the Orchestra finally struck and she had to pull out, she
                    found Henry in a Comatose Condition leaning against the Hat-Rack. She aroused him and told him the
                    Glad News that they were to get an Early Start and go out to a nice Road-House and have something to
                    Eat. Whereupon Henry fell in a Heap and asked to be counted out.</p>

                    up at him and ask him a lot of feebleminded Questions about the Wicked World and he will talk for
                    Hours at a Time. But the Minute the Sun goes down you want to yell for a Chaperon until you can be
                    heard in the next Township. That will lead him to believe that lie is a fascinating and dangerous

                    sitting out in a Hammock and calling for Chaperons. They used to sit out until Midnight begging
                    somebody to go for a Chaperon, and the Gentlemen had to talk to them for Hours in order to calm them
                    and convince them that the Whole Proceeding was according to Hoyle; that is, as long as they were

                    out until Midnight begging somebody to go for a Chaperon, and the Gentlemen had to talk to them for
                    Hours in order to calm them and convince them that the Whole Proceeding was according to Hoyle; that

                    Papa never had been so weak and foolish as to fall in Love. Sometimes Willie wanted to ask him if he
                    had married Mamma on a Bet, but he was afraid to start anything.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">As for Mamma, she sat back with her Lips closed tightly and listened while the

                <p TEIform="p">She stood for it a long Time, and then she decided to take charge of Willie&apos;s

                    was to threaten to send Willie to a Military School if he ever spoke to her again. Papa knew a lot

                    the smooth-faced Hero of a Richard Harding Davis $1.50 Book. By keeping his Hair neatly gummed down
                    and wearing the right shape of Collar, likewise vamping a few tender Chords on the Piano and holding
                    up his end in a light-weight Conversation, he had managed to elbow his Way into the Front Row of
                    that Select Division of the human Race known as the Landed Gentry, because they get Landed so often.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Bertrand Flappingdale was the Name of this particular Confection. In Our Set he was known
                    as Bertie, and among the Employes at the Shop he was known us a Bluff. Bert&apos;s Pathway in
                    Life was so nicely Lubricated <pb id="VAA2321-193" n="187" TEIform="pb"/> and every one was so
                    awfully Good to him that after a while he felt reasonably Certain that the Earth and the Fulness
                    thereof had been dished up especially for his Benefit, and he could cancel the Order any time that
                    he saw fit.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Flappingdale, Senior, hart never smoked Egyptian Cigarettes and attended Junior Proms
                    during his Incubator Period. He had been too busy trying to make the Meal-Tickets last from one
                    Saturday Night to another. The only Time he got real hungy was when he told how he used to work for
                    6 a Week and plant $100 a year in the Build-Years since they took his Boiled Dinners away from him
                    and made him eat Artichokes, when they threw him into the long-tailed Regalia with the misfit Tie he
                    had Yap stencilled all over himself.</p>

                <p TEIform="p">One of the Hard Jobs that Fate had mapped out for Flappingdale, Senior, was to prevent
                    his blue-eyed Offspring from being abducted and snaked away to the Altar. The Trouble was that
                    Bertie wanted to he Abducted. About every Change of the Moon he would begin to act. more or less

                <p TEIform="p">Then the head of the Works would have to call him in and put some Cracked Ice on him and
                    get him cooled down.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The first one to lay him out and have him Fluttering was a 90-pounder about six weeks
                    from the Nursery. The cold-blooded Guvnor begged him not to rob the Cradle, and wanted to know
                    something about her Knowledge of Housekeeping, which is invariably a Stiff Jolt for Love&apos;s
                    Young Dream. While Bertrand was waiting for a Chance to clope with the Bud, a New Show came to town,
                    and there zipped across the Horizon of his Fresh Young Life a Hurrah Soubrette who wore Holes in the
                    Stage every Evening doing a very refined Coon Number.</p>

                    Presence on Earth, he passed into a Sweet Trance from which he did not fully Awake until the Troupe
                    left Town, when he found himself watching the Red Light disappear around the Curve and realized that
                    he <pb id="VAA2321-196" n="190" TEIform="pb"/> had played his Violets on the Wrong Number.</p>

                    down in Short-Hand and put right into a Book. She threw her Search-Light on the helpless Bertrand
                    and dazzled him to a Fare-ye-well. She got him into a Turkish Corner and told him of the Yearnings
                    of her Soul and all about her Empty Life and how she had groped for an Affinity, and although he
                    muffed a good many of her Points and was clear of the Ground most of the Time, he realized that he
                    was in the Presence of one who could take him by the Hand and show him a lot of <pb id="VAA2321-197"
                        n="191" TEIform="pb"/> Tilings that he had never been wise to as yet. So he wanted to marry her
                    and sit around all Day with his Head on her Shoulder and have her talk Copy, worth about 3 cents a

                    would be a long time to sit at one end of the Dinning-Room Table feeling about the size of a Roach.</p>

                <head TEIform="head">The Ninety-Pound Knight-Errant and His Lady Fair.</head>
                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there was an Estimable Lady named Mrs. Killjoy who used to hunt for Trouble with a
                    Scarch-Warrant.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She was not happy unless she was being Insulted. Before any one chirped she knew that she
                    was going to have Bricks thrown at her Character.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Mrs. Killjoy held to the obsolete Theory that Man was put into this Mundane Trouble
                    Factory to protect weak and defenceless Woman from all Slurs, Slights, and Insults. That is why she
                    picked out for her True Knight an undeveloped Specimen, about the size of a Philadelphia Squab, with
                    four-inch Biceps.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">His steady Assignment was to fight her Battles. Mrs. Killjoy was one of those Sensitive
                    Plants who could not get into a Trolley without having some one rudely Stare at her. She always
                    suspected that the He-Salesmen in the Stores were trying to <pb id="VAA2321-200" n="194"
                        TEIform="pb"/> make Love to her, and if any Man happened to be walking behind her on the same
                    side of the Street she knew that she was being Pursued.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot; Are you going to sit here and allow your Wife to be Insulted?&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">That was the Speech she would hand him when they were out, together. Then it was up to
                    him to call some 200-pounder or else be prepared to lie awake half the Night and listen to the Story
                    of her Wrongs.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Sometimes he suspected that she wanted to realize on his Life Insurance.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">His usual Play was to promise to be an Avenger. Then he would hunt up the Per son who had
                    grossly insulted Mrs. Killjoy and apologize in her behalf and say that she was a trifle Dippy.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">What Mrs. Killjoy needed was a Husband in a full Suit of Armor mounted on a White Horse
                    and thirsting for Blood. She had read the wrong kind of Books. Husband knew that she would stack him
                    up against it, sooner or later.</p>

                    Mr. Killjoy was a Man or a Mouse, and that settled it. He went out to roast the Teamster and she
                    followed along-to Gloat.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Teamster was a Low-Brow with a 48-inch Chest, and he did not know a thing about the

                <head TEIform="head">The Fearsome Feud Between the First Families</head>
                <p TEIform="p">ONCE there grew up alongside of a Railroad Track an overgrown Village that refused to be
                    called a Town, so it was known as a City. It had a Water Tower, a Court-House Park, and a Steam
                    Laundry. On the Main Street was a Business College where the Yokels learned in nine weeks how to be
                    Merchant Princes. Also a Trolley Line that ran as far out as the Cemetery and then threw up both
                    Hands. The Particular Pride of the Place was a $2.50 Hotel with a Tiled Floor and a
                    Ladies&apos;Parlor so Magnificent that no one had been known to use it.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">All the Residents of this Progressive Community took their Cues from two Families that
                    controlled more or less Bank Stock and had Fountains playing in the Front Yard, to say nothing of
                    Senegambians to look after the Horses and keep them from being Lonesome. These two Tribes were the
                    real three-X Gonzabas. Any one on calling <pb id="VAA2321-204" n="198" TEIform="pb"/> Terms with the
                    aristocratic Skilligans or the exclusive Winkles had a perpetual License to throw on right Smart of
                    Dog and kick about the Lack of Good Society.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">One of the many Diversions planned by the high-collared Residents, so that they might
                    temporarily forget where they were living, was Amateur Theatricals. The Dramatic Club was carefully
                    selected from the Inner Circle of the Finger-Bowl Set, and whether they could Act or not it was
                    always a Satisfaction to know that they could rub up against the toney Skilligans and the hifaluting
                    Winkles.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Two or three times every Season the Club gave a Show at the local Temple of Art. After
                    all Expenses had been paid, the Net Proceeds, which sometimes ran as high as $18, went to Charity.
                    This was another Case in which Charity covered a Multitude of Sins.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">At one of these Dramatic Treats it was decided to put on the Balcony Scene from
                    &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; Win. Shakespeare <pb id="VAA2321-205" n="[199]" TEIform="pb"/>

                    Club had such a Social Drag that no one dared to set fire to the Opera-House in order to head off
                    the Massacre.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">It was unanimously agreed that Mr. Plulo Quaekenbush was the Boy to do Romeo. He was Golf
                    Champion, having done 9 Holes in 58 on a Course which made it necessary to Putt with a Lofter.
                    Besides, lie had led the German every Year for 18 years and had Relatives in New York City.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">But when it came to the selection of Juliet there were two Candidates, as follows: Mrs.
                    Skilligan and Mrs. Winkle. Each of these estimable Ladies had a kind of an inward Hunch that she
                    could revive Memories of Mary Anderson and leave Maude Adams somewhere back of the Flag. Mrs.
                    Skilligan was tall, fibrous, and weighed 108 when in Condition. She had a Daughter who was a
                    Sophomore, and that was why some of her Enemies said that she was too for along to look the Part of
                    Juliet. Just the same, Mrs. <pb id="VAA2321-207" n="201" TEIform="pb"/> Skilligan wanted a Whack at
                    it, for what she lacked in Looks and Youthfulness, she could make up in Jewelry. So she began to lay
                    her Pipes and do some tall Scheming.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">In the mean time, Mrs. Winkle was studying the Lines and checking off the Names of all
                    Members who would not dare to throw her down. Mrs. Winkle could sec herself on the Balcony giving an
                    entirely new Interpretation of the Part. She had discovered certain Hidden Meanings in the Lines,
                    and she wanted to hand out the Immortal Hot. Stuff in such a Way that Folks would forget all about
                    Julia Marlowe and those other ordinary Actresses who were after the Coin, regardless of Art.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Stage-Manager employed by the bold Amateurs was an Ex-Legit who had lost his Voice
                    asking for Salary. He plucked up Courage and ventured to ask Mrs. Winkle-on the Measurements to be
                    the girlish Capulet.</p>
                <pb id="VAA2321-208" n="202" TEIform="pb"/>
                <p TEIform="p">&quot;Oh, Pickles!&quot; quoth Mrs. Winkle. &quot;I&apos;m just about the
                    size of May Irwin, and she&apos;s a lovely Actress. Besides, I&apos;ll wear something Loose,
                    so that they can&apos;t see my Real Shape.&quot;</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Stage-Manager said no more, for he needed the Money.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Club had a Meeting and the Lady who carried Weight for Age beat out the Anti-Fat
                    Candidate. Mrs. Winkle was elected the Ideal Juliet by a Majority of One, and some were mean enough
                    to say that she voted for Herself. As for Mamma Skilligan, she was not Put Out a Particle. Not on
                    your Facial Expression! A good many Competent Judges had told her that Shakespeare must have had her
                    in Mind when he wrote the Part, but if the Club preferred a large, coarse Creature to tackle that
                    beautiful Stuff, let it go at that!</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Just to prove that she wasn&apos;t Miffed she bought all of the lower Boxes, and on
                    the Night of the Performance she gave a Dinner-Party at which the Gentlemen proceeded to <pb

                    she could say to choke them off. Along about 9 o&apos;clock she said it was time to do down and
                    watch the Balloon go up.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">The Push landed in at the Opera-House just in time to break up the Scene in which the
                    Child Sweetheart sighs and wonders where Romeo is. The whole Outfit came into the Boxes and upset
                    Chairs and begged everybody else to take the front Seats and called for Programmes. By the time they
                    settled down and got ready to kid the Performance, the large White Mass up on the Shelf
                    didn&apos;t know whether she was playing Juliet or Bridge Whist. She got twisted on her Lines,
                    so that Romeo, with the lied Mustaches, skipped a couple of Speeches. Then the Moon shifted a few
                    Feet and the Balcony squeaked and promised to give way, and some one in the Skilligan Party made a
                    low Crack that started a Giggle. Juliet lasted, but she was too Pink for Words.</p>

                    her Fault, as she hail been bunkoed into thinking she was Good.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Juliet had 8 Curtain Tails, or two more than Melon&apos;s Record, and before the
                    Night was over she received so many Flowers and was complimented so often by those who came up to
                    her little Supper-Party that she had a good Notion to leave Winkle and go and work for Charley
                    Frohman. In fact, at 3 A.M. she was ready to make Affidavit that she had Virginia Harned, Maxine
                    Elliott, and Mary Mannering thrown hack into the Chorus.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">Next Day the Paper said that she was Great, and she took 200 Extra Copies and read them
                    all herself and then sent a few to the Skilligans.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">About a month after that Mrs. Skilligan gave a Fancy-Dress Ball, with Costumes all the
                    Way from St. Louis, and three kinds of Punch on the Dining-Room Table. Lady Skilligan did Queen
                    Elizabeth, with $80,000 <pb id="VAA2321-213" n="207" TEIform="pb"/> worth of Rock Crystals hanging
                    to her. Mrs. Winkle came, for fear People might think she cherished some Animosity against her
                    crushed and fallen Rival, and when she sized up against the Hostess she fell backward and took the
                    Count, for she was only a Dresden Shepherdess.</p>
                <p TEIform="p">She went home and began to whet her Axe, and the first Thing any one-knew she had the U.
