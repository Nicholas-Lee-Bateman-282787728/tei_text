                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag, with the
                    value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All split
                    lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for the
                    final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>

                <head>NOTE TO THE KILLARNEY SNAKE.</head>
                <p><hi>THE</hi> legend runs that before St Patrickâs ministry, Ireland was infested
                    with innumerable reptiles all of which he banished for ever from the country.
                    But one large snake which haunted the borders of the lake of Killarney found its
                    beautiful home too pleasant to be prevailed on to leave it either by persuasions
                    or threats. The saint, finding all his exhortations thrown away, presented
                    himself one morning to the snake, carrying a large chest heavy with clasps.
                    âSee,â he said, âlet there be peace between us. You may stay in this
                    neighbourhood as long as you live, and I have brought you a beautiful house far
                    better than that hole of yours. We can put it under the same tree.â But the
                    snake suspected a snare, and refused the<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7027-138"/> gift.
                    At last, tired of combating the saintâs arguments and half convinced by his fair
                    words, it crept into the chest, letting however part of its tail drop over the
                    side by way of securing a retreat. âAh! I told you it would be too small,â it
                    said, preparing to get out. But, âTake care of your tail, my darling,â cried St
                    Patrick, slamming down the lid so as to force it to jerk it in quickly, and
                    fastening the strong clasps. âLet me out, Oh! let me out,â pleaded the snake.
                    âYes, toâmorrow,â answered St Patrick, as he hurled its prison far into the
                    waters. And on a still day, as you sail over the lake, you may hear the poor
                    captive calling plaintively from below: âIs it toâmorrow yet?â</p>

                    <l>The cheery sound of rough menâs voices, glad</l>
                    <l>With the good meed of honestâhanded toil,</l>
                    <l>And thought of thankful homes and coming rest</l>
                    <l>For healthy weariness of nervous limbs.</l>
                    <l>Then, when she saw the heavyâladen boat,</l>
                    <l>Not seeking other hamlet on the coast,</l>
                    <l>Pass steadily into the narrow bay</l>
                    <l>Highâcragged, where she sat watching from her rock,</l>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7027-164"/>
                    <l>She scared the seaâbirds with shrill welcomings,</l>
                    <l>And laughed wild triumphings aloud to those</l>
                    <l>Who were not there to hear her, since she wept</l>
                    <l>And angered always when they broke her law</l>
                    <l>Of exile from the loneness of her haunt.</l>
                    <l>âAh! see,â she laughed, âyou would have had me think</l>
                    <l>The waves, grown mad with spite, had whelmed my love</l>
                    <l>Down to their hateful caves, and held him there,</l>
                    <l>A festering corpse among the whitened bones</l>
                    <l>Far in the cruel depths of the dull deep,</l>
                    <l>The prey of creeping seaâsnakes, reptile shapes,</l>
                    <l>All slimy horror and limp shapelessness</l>
                    <l>Ah! but I knew it falseâsee, the still sea</l>
                    <l>Curling so lovingly along the shore,</l>
                    <l>The gentle sea is calm as when he left</l>
                    <l>In the bright mornâ</l>
                    <l>Who whispered, âYears agoâ?</l>
                    <l>
                        <choice>
                            <corr>âLong years agoâ? Yes, years. Ah! so they said,</corr>
                            <sic/>
                        </choice>
                    </l>
                    <l>So voices, mocking voices, oft have come</l>
                    <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7027-165"/>
                    <l>And whispered in my ears through the long day</l>
                    <l>Till they half maddened me. But eve is come,</l>
                    <l>The happy eve, and he is coming now;</l>
                    <l>He promised, when he left me with the morn,</l>
                    <l>His boat should skim the first back to our bay,</l>
                    <l>First land its netted spoil upon the sands,</l>
                    <l>And the dear evening hours should all be mine:</l>
                    <l>And now he comes! Aye, look now, you who said</l>
                    <l>He would not come again, look now, and hear</l>
                    <l>How I will call, and he will answer me.â</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>And so she stood on her rockâseat, and called</l>
                    <l>Wild greetings all delirious with joy,</l>
                    <l>Until the darkâsailed boat, low with the weight</l>
                    <l>Of scaly plunder, had drawn very near,</l>
                    <l>And down the cliffs there hurried gossip groups</l>
                    <l>And merry children shouting, clapping hands,</l>
                    <l>And knotted round the beachÃ¨d landingâplace,</l>
                    <l>While the loud keel groaned on the meeting shore:</l>
                    <l>But she remained where she had watched it come,</l>
                    <l>Thinking, âHe knows that I am waiting here,</l>
                    <pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7027-166"/>
                    <l>And he loves best to find me thus alone;</l>
                    <l>I will not seek him in the jeering crowd,</l>
                    <l>In truth, I would not have him fully know</l>
                    <l>How eagerly I longed for his return;</l>
                    <l>But I will wait him hereâhe will come soon.â</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>She saw the fishers pass along the cliffs,</l>
                    <l>Girt with the loving concourse from their homes,</l>
                    <l>But saw him not: she saw the stranded boat</l>
                    <l>Untenanted, and knew the talking knots</l>
                    <l>Of waiters for the coming fisher fleet,</l>
                    <l>And knew him not among them; then she sank</l>
                    <l>In patient weariness on her lone rock,</l>
                    <l>And sighed amid the ebbing watersâ sighs,</l>
                    <l>âHe said he would be first:âwell, âtwill be soon.â</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Into the bay there thronged the swarming skiffs,</l>
                    <l>Pressing wideâwinged along their homeward course;</l>
                    <l>And, one by one, she saw them touch the land,</l>
                    <l>And heard them grating harshly on the beach,</l>
                    <pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7027-167"/>
                    <l>Till all had come, and all lay high and void</l>
                    <l>And glooming darkly in the growing dusk,</l>
                    <l>And stillness brooded oâer the blackening shore</l>
                    <l>Vague with the evening mist. On the wide plain</l>
                    <l>Of cold greyâglimmering waters nothing stirred,</l>
                    <l>Save the first ripple of the waking waves,</l>
                    <l>The wild birds roosted in their silent clefts.</l>
                    <l>She waited weeping, âAh! he has not come!</l>
                    <l>Yet he will come.âBid the wild voices cease,</l>
                    <l>Dear Lord, the voices full of bitter words</l>
                    <l>That fill my brain with fire. How, dead long years!</l>
                    <l>Dead in the arms of the allâgrasping waves!</l>
                    <l>How should he die, since they have come in peace</l>
                    <l>That left with him at morn? Nay, he will come,</l>
                    <l>He has but tarried, tempted by the shoals</l>
                    <l>That lie in myriads round some farâoff point,</l>
                    <l>A while behind the rest. <emph>He</emph> shuns no toil.</l>
                    <l>Yet he is wrong to break his faith with me,</l>
                    <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7027-168"/>
                    <l>And scare me so with absence. He must come</l>
                    <l>Soon, very soon, for the dark night draws nigh.</l>
                </lg>
                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>The wild wind shrieking wakened with the night,</l>
                    <l>And lashed the high crest of the full tideâs flow,</l>
                    <l>And whirled the writhing surges round her feet,</l>
                    <l>And dashed the drenching flakes of briny foam</l>
                    <l>On her dark tresses flapping with the gusts,</l>
                    <l>The maddened clouds raced frantic through the sky</l>
                    <l>The hazed stars peering through their changing gaps;</l>
                    <l>âOh! God,â she cried, âgreat God, watch over him,</l>
                    <l>And bring him safely through the howling storm.</l>
                    <l>Alas! why did he loiter from the rest?</l>
                    <l>Could he not hear among the first shrill winds</l>
                    <l>The nearing sound of the fierce hurricane?</l>
                    <l>But he will comeâthere is no danger yetâ</l>
                    <l>And he must needs be very near at hand:</l>
                    <l>Yes he will come.ââ</l>
                    <l>But when they forced her home,</l>
                    <l>She wakened for a moment from her hope</l>
                    <pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7027-169"/>
                    <l>Into a frenzied tumult of despair,</l>
                    <l>Despair soulâmaddening, as on that dread eve,</l>
                    <l>Seven summers since, when with the sunset glow</l>
                    <l>The fisher barks thronged home with saddened crews,</l>
                    <l>And he, whelmed by a sudden shortâlived squall,</l>
                    <l>Slept with his brother underneath the waves.</l>
                    <l>And with such agony as when she heard</l>
                    <l>That which had wrung her heart from that sad hour</l>
                    <l>To wild forgetfulness even of its cause,</l>
                    <l>She knew it suddenly, his drowning death,</l>
                    <l>And shrieked, âDead, dead!âthey were true voices, dead!</l>
                    <l><emph>He</emph> dead!âthen let me die!â</l>
                    <l>And then indeed</l>
                    <l>It was as though she died, faint in the trance</l>
                    <l>That ever wrought by such brief anguished bursts</l>
                    <l>Lulled them to rest.</l>
                    <l>But with the next dayâs fall</l>
                    <l>She watched again for him that never came,</l>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7027-170"/>
                    <l>But slept unwakened by the plash of the waves:</l>
                    <l>And thus from eve to eve she watched for him,</l>
                    <l>And thus, because she would not be withheld,</l>
                    <l>Waiting for him one summer eve, she died.</l>
