               ∗
            
            By DR. WILLIAM M. RESER
            
            A canal is an artificial watercourse used as a transportation route. By locks it can be made, if desired or
          necessary, to step up or step down so as to cross ridges or water-sheds and other barriers between the sources
          of streams. Thus the 
                  Wabash
                and 
                  Erie
                Canal was planned as a highway of commerce to traverse the valleys of the Maumee and the 
                  Wabash
                and to cross the portage separating their drainage areas.
            It was promulgated and constructed under the provisions of an act passed by Congress on May 27, 1827. By this
          act Indiana was given every alternate section of land, with a few exceptions, five miles back on each side of
          the proposed line of the canal—practically 3200 acres for every mile of the route. The canal was
          planned at that time to extend from opposite the mouth of the 
                  Tippecanoe
                River to the falls of the Maumee River. To obtain this grant work had to commence by March 2,
          1832. Accordingly, on February 22, anniversary of the birth of 
                  Washington
                who had many years previously suggested such a waterway, the ground was broken with appropriate
          ceremonies.
            When first proposed it was thought the entire line would lie within the boundaries of Indiana, but as the
          surveyors began laying out the route they ascertained that the Maumee River was not navigable, nor was it
          practicable to make it so. Therefore, the line of construction was planned so as to connect with Maumee Bay,
          an arm of Lake 
                  Erie
               . Then Congress authorized the state of Indiana to convey that part of the donated lands lying
          beyond her territorial limits to the state of 
                  Ohio
               . This was done on February 1,1834, by a joint resolution of the branches of the Indiana
          Legislature.
            
               
                  ∗ This paper was read at a meeting of the General de 
                     Lafayette
                   Chapter, D. A. R., at Lafsyette, Indiana, on October 3, 1933.
            
            
            On July 4, 1836, the first section, extending from Ft. 
                  Wayne
                to 
                  Huntington
               , being from the 
                  St. Joseph
                River to the forks of the 
                  Wabash
                River, was opened. In 1835 a bill passed the Indiana Legislature to extend the canal from the
          mouth of 
                  Tippecanoe
                River to 
                  Lafayette
               , an estimated distance of fourteen miles and twenty-nine chains, and appropriated for that
          purpose $227,000.
            In 1836 the canal was built through 
                  Wabash County
                but no water was turned in until ten months later when the feeder at Lagro was tapped. During
          this long period of waiting the broad, level bottom of the canal was occasionally used as a driving course.
          According to the program for the opening of this section the freight boat Indiana was to
          make the initial trip to 
                  Wabash
                on July 4, 1837. Upon its arrival the large crowd that had assembled formed a parade and marched
          to Treaty Grounds where a feast was partaken of and speeches made. The day's celebration was closed
          by a dance up town in the evening.
            In the latter part of the year 1837, the section between 
                  Wabash
                and 
                  Peru
                was opened. The digging of the channel was completed to 
                  Logansport
                in the fall of 1838, too late to undertake a regular opening. The January freshet that followed
          created a wide breach at Bull Creek, the repair of which was not completed until about the beginning of April.
          Navigation was formally opened to 
                  Logansport
                on April 20, 1839.1
            
            In November, 1839, it was estimated that the eastern end of the canal would be completed to the state line by
          the first of June, and the western section to 
                  Lafayette
                by the first of October (1840).2 This turned out to be correct, for in the
          fall of 1840 the channel was completed to 
                  Lafayette
                and several trips were made by boats between 
                  Lafayette
                and the State line.3
            
            Before the next season opened, freshets had created a heavy break at Birmingham Bluff and another at 
                  Wabash
                Town. These were repaired in the spring and by May, 1841,

                boats were making regular trips between 
                  Lafayette
                and a point in 
                  Ohio
                six miles beyond the State line.4
            
            During the season the bank at Birmingham Bluff for a distance of more than a mile, was protected by a layer
          of stone, taking the place of a brush rip-rap which had not held. The stone was brought down the canal from 
                  Georgetown
               .5
            
            The canal coursed along the west side of the 
                  Wabash
                River until Carrollton was reached where it crossed to the east side. The towing horses were
          transported across the river on a ferry boat at first, but later on a towpath bridge, the construction of
          which was completed October 1, 1844.6 By means of a lock here the boats were lowered to
          the surface level of the river or lifted to the canal's elevation—according to the
          direction going. The crossing was possible because the stream was placid here, due to the backwater from the 
                  Delphi
                or 
                  Pittsburgh
                dam located four and one-half miles further down stream.7 This raised the
          water eight feet in the pool of the river at the point of crossing, and to all appearances, during normal
          stages, there was no current. In crossing the river the boats were floated upon the quiet waters of the stream
          itself for a short distance and then entered the canal's channel, which, for two and one-half miles,
          was invisible—only the towpath showing. The channel, the west bank and the ground between it and
          the river proper were submerged by the backwater from the dam, making a single wide stream or body of
            water.8 About one and one-half miles above the dam there was a guard lock where the
          canal left the river and the low ground that paralleled it on the west, and proceeded on southward between its
          two banks, both now visible.

            date when the Canal was opened to 
                     Lafayette
                  . For this advertisement, see issues of the

                        Pittsburgh
                      dam was part of the canal system, built by the state for a triple purpose:
                        a. Stilling the current in the river so boats could be towed across it.
                        b. Feeding water to the canal.
                        c. Furnishing power for manufactories.
                     
                  
                  During construction of the dam, a channel for the canal was dug on the east side of the river and a
              towpath 10 feet high was made from the earth that was excavated. When the dam was completed and
              functioning, the backwater completely submerged this channel and its west bank, but the towpath, being
              above the crest of the water, afforded a footing for the towing horses to draw the boats which followed
              the unseen channel. The dam was blown out with dynamite in 1882.

            The towpath was on the east bank of the canal from Carrollton to 
                  Delphi
               , just below which, at Deer Creek, it crossed to the west bank.9 On reaching
          Wild Cat Creek near 
                  Lafayette
                it changed back to the east bank along which it proceeded until Ninth Street, 
                  Lafayette
               , was reached. Here it changed again to the west bank, the draft animals crossing over the canal
          on what was known as the "exchange bridge."
            A well constructed dam, originally thirteen feet high and one hundred seventy feet long, was built across
          Wild Cat Creek to form a pool for crossing this stream and to divert the water into the canal channel.10 Thus the Wild Cat was one of the feeders of the canal—in fact, it was the
          largest feeder within a distance of one hundred miles. Its gauged capacity during the dryest season was 4,500
          cubic feet per minute.11 The towing animals crossed the stream here on a temporary bridge
          until 1848 when a permanent wagon bridge with a passage way on the north side for the towing animals was
            built.12
            
            A short distance above the "exchange bridge" in 
                  Lafayette
               , the canal occupied a natural depression, or basin, which, when filled, acted as a reservoir and
          was known as "Wide Water." Along the border of this, especially on the south side, were
          erected buildings for the storage of ice that was harvested on this lake-like pool.
            In filling the canal channel from Wild Cat Creek to 
                  Lafayette
               , much difficulty was experienced because of the filtration of the water into the gravelly soil
          that formed the canal's bed. Large bunches of brush or small tree tops, drawn by oxen, were dragged
          up and down the muddy channel to cause the earth to "puddle," as it is called. When this
          coating dried and hardened it was almost impervious to water and then the channel was allowed to fill.13
            
            Even though the line was now opened to 
                  Lafayette
               , there was but little traffic because the connection with Lake 
                  Erie
                had not yet been made. Late in 1842, however, 
                  Ohio
                completed

                her part of the work and, in the following May, through traffic was
          established with the Lake.14
            
            In commemoration of the line being opened to the Lake a monster celebration was held at Ft. 
                  Wayne
                on July 4, 1843, with General Lewis Cass as the principal speaker and Hugh Hanna marshal of the
          day.
            The boat Albert S. White was the first to make a through trip from 
                  Toledo
                to 
                  Lafayette
               .15 A local editor wrote of the new canal boat: 
                  THE ALBERT S. WHITE, of 
                        Lafayette
                      is a new and superb Canal Packet built at this place for the 
                        Wabash
                      and 
                        Erie
                      Canal Transportation Company. She was to leave port yesterday for Fort 
                        Wayne
                     , there to receive her furniture, etc., and we venture the opinion, that when fitted out she
              will ‘take the shine off’ of any thing in her line to be met with ‘in
              these diggins.’ She is commodious, and her apartments so arranged as that there can be no
              danger of indiscriminate mingling up of male and female passengers and crew, as is sometimes necessarily
              the case in boats of bad construction.16
                  
               
            
            Meanwhile the extension down the valley as provided by the Act of January, 1836, had been started. The first
          section had been advertised in 1842, and in October, 1845, water was gradually let in at 
                  Lafayette
               , being supplied by the Wild Cat feeder, supplemented further down by a small feeder (1,800 cubic
          feet per minute) from Wea Creek. This last was nothing more, at that time, than the tailrace from the Foresman
          Mill. The gravelly bottom here gave trouble also, and the channel filled slowly. But before the season closed
          there was enough water to float a boat used to carry stone to line the weak places in the banks as far as Wea
          Creek. Breaks occurred during the winter which delayed the opening of traffic during the next summer, but in
          the latter part of September the first boat reached 
                  Attica
               .17
            
            Construction continuing on southward the Canal reached the terminus at 
                  Evansville

                completed its through trip from Lake 
                  Erie
                to the Ohio River.18 This southern extension—
                  Lafayette
                to 
                  Evansville
               , especially from 
                  Terre Haute
                down by way of the "Cross Cut" to the "Central Canal" at 
                  Bloomfield
               —was never as much as a partial success.
            The canal's entire length in Indiana was 375 miles, and in 
                  Ohio
                84 miles, making a total of 459 miles, or, to be exact, 4593/8 miles, the longest canal in the
          world excepting the Grand Canal in 
                  China
                which was about 800 miles in length.
            The boating season opened about March 1, and closed about November 1, annually. The speed of the boats was
          from three to six miles per hour, some of the packets making even as much as eight miles. The freight boats
          never did better than three miles. The boats were drawn by from two to six horses or mules, hitched tandem. In
          1862 a steam canal boat, built in 
                  Lafayette
               , made a trip to 
                  Toledo
               . It ran on a much faster schedule, but the waves formed by its swifter passage so damaged the
          banks that it was never permitted to make another trip.
            In planning the construction of this canal the high water marks of the freshet of January 8, 1828, to that
          time the greatest flood in the known history of this part of the state, were used as guides in obviating, as
          well as could be done, the damages of anticipated floods.19 But in June, 1858, all the
          streams in this region, especially in 
                  Tippecanoe County
               , attained a flood stage that far surpassed that of 1828, the 
                  Wabash
                exceeding the former or earlier flood by two feet. Wild Cat Creek formed a new channel around the
          east end of the dam, destroyed the east abutment, and swept away the bridge. Only the west abutment was left.
          The aqueduct over Wea Creek, "consisting of three spans, supported by two abutments and two piers, in
          all 140 feet long," was completely, destroyed, leaving only the seriously damaged east abutment. The
          feeder dam up the Wea was carried away and many breaks made in the banks along the channel. There were
          created, also, many extensive gaps in the banks of the canal both above and below 
                  Lafayette
               . Through navigation was interrupted from June 10 to August 26, 1858.20

            This destruction of property and, necessarilly, the loss in service while making repairs, was a severe blow
          to the canal interests, especially since the railroads, at this time, were threatening its very existence.
            This flood, in its destructive action, was most severe in the section between 
                  Delphi
                and 
                  Attica
               , and injured the best paying part of the canal, because 
                  Lafayette
               , previous to the completion of the 
                  Wabash
                Valley Railroad, was the "largest exporting office on the canal.21
            
            The 
                  Wabash
                and 
                  Erie
                Canal was more than a transportation line—it furnished power for factories along its
          course. From the very first 
                  Lafayette
                had her share of these. According to the official report of December 16, 1845, the following
          leases for industries at 
                  Lafayette
                were made in 1840: 
                  To Hull and 
                        Spencer
                     , for 30 years, 3 run of stone for a flouring mill, "with the right to use the water
              on the second fall… without increase of price, @ $150 per annum for each
              run."
                  To Messrs. Clark and 
                        Bartholomew
                      for water to run a sawmill, for 30 years @ $260 per annum.
                  To Daniel Yandes for
                  
                     a. One sawmill for 30 years @ $250 per annum.
                     b. One paper mill for 30 years, three powers @ $162 per annum each.
                     c. One flouring mill, 30 yrs., three run of stone @ $162 per annum each.22
                     
                  
               
            
            For all these industrial plants the fall of water was fifteen and one-half feet. The wheels were of the
          overshot type fourteen feet in diameter. The engineer states that "for this fall, and diameter of
          wheel (overshot), I have determined… that… two hundred and sixty-seven and eight tenths
          cubic feet of water per minute, is the quantity for each ‘Mill Stone
            Power’."23
            
            
               Hull and 
                     Spencer
                   Flouring Mill: This mill in 1871 had two overshot wheels on the upper fall and one on the
          lower. It was entitled to three "powers" on the upper fall

              After listing the above industries, the Engineer added: "James S. Hoagland (Hogeland) is using
              58/100 of a power for a woolen mill such as carding, spinning and fulling… He has made use of
              the water from the canal for the last four years, and refuses to pay rent for the Bame. He never had the
              water leased to him, but commenced operations on the word of one Silas S. White, of whom he claims to have
              purchased the privilege."

                and the privilege to use the other without charge.24
          The plant stood on the west bank of the canal opposite the terminus of Union Street, and west of the old
          Thieme and Wagner Brewery. It was reached by crossing the canal on a bridge at 
                  Salem
                Street and going south on the towpath. When Hull left the partnership, which was shortly after
          its inception, Dr. David Jennings took his place. In 1858 the mill was sold to Robert Breckenridge and Barnett
          ("Barney") Jenkins. It secured power from the waters of the canal during the whole period of
          its existence, which terminated in 1887. All of the above mentioned owners took a prominent part in the early
          development of 
                  Lafayette
               —a development that was phenominal and which the canal stimulated.
            
               
                  Israel
                Spencer came to 
                  Lafayette
                in 1829 and purchased, for $160, the ground on north Sixth Street now occupied by the
          building of the 
                  Lafayette
               
               Journal-Courier and that of the Painters and Decorators Union. With his own hands he erected
          thereon a small frame house in which he lived for some time. He was the first mayor of "the Town of 
                  Lafayette
               ," under the statute of 1837-38. He was also a director of the 
                  Lafayette
                Branch of the State Bank of Indiana; one of the projectors of the 
                  Lafayette
                Savings Bank, being its President at the time of his death; and a member of the Board of Trustees
          of the Second Presbyterian Church from the time of its organization.
            In the eighteen fifties he erected a four-room, three-story business block on the east side of the public
          square, on the third floor of which was a public hall known as 
                  
                     Spencer
                   Hall. For many years this was the only place in the city for holding concerts, theatrical
          shows, and other like entertainments. The only original rooms of this block now standing are the two north
          ones, occupied by the King Clothing Company and the successor of the Ankeny Jewelry Company. The two south
          rooms have been rebuilt and are now occupied by the B & W Shoe Company and the 
                  Tippecanoe
                Loan and Trust Company.
            After many changes of residence 
                  Israel
                  Spencer
                finally resided again on the lot where he had first settled, but this time in a double brick
          house erected by himself. This stood

                     Ibid.
               
                next to the alley, just north of the Family Theatre of today. Here he
          died on December 7, 1879, after having been active in the upbuilding of 
                  Lafayette
                for over fifty years.25
            
            Nathaniel Hull, the other original owner of the Hull and 
                  Spencer
                or 
                  Lafayette
                Mill, was identified with the flouring industry of 
                  Tippecanoe County
                for many years. Besides being one of the early partners of this mill, he, later, had a connection
          with the mill at 
                  Dayton
               , and later still, with the Foresman Mill on Big Wea Creek.
            Dr. David Jennings, who succeeded Hull as a partner in the 
                  Lafayette
                Mill, came to 
                  Lafayette
                in 1831. He built the 
                  Lafayette
                Hotel, later called the Jones Hotel, situated diagonally across the street from where the Bramble
          House was later erected, that is on the northwest corner of Third and South streets, where the store of the
          Sears-Roebuck Company is now located. This was the most pretentious hostelry in 
                  Lafayette
                before the erection of the Bramble House.
            Dr. Jennings assisted in organizing a Masonic Chapter in 
                  Lafayette
                on May 7, 1846, and was one of its first officers. An old portrait of him, painted from life by
          that noted 
                  Lafayette
                artist, George Winter, hangs today in the local Masonic Temple.26
            
            The last owners of the 
                  Lafayette
                Mill, Jenkins and Breckenridge, were both born in 
                  Scotland
               . Barnett Jenkins came to 
                  Tippecanoe County
                in 1845, taking employment in the flouring mill at Wyandotte. In 1858, as stated above, he
          assumed part ownership in the 
                  Lafayette
                Mill. He was the father of Mrs. Vinnedge, wife of Dr. W. W. Vinnedge, and lived at the time of
          his death in the house which she now occupies, and which he built. Robert Breckenridge came to 
                  Lafayette
                in 1836 and, with his cousin John McMillan, started a bake-shop on the east side of the public
          square. This bakery was sold when he purchased an interest in the 
                  Lafayette
                Mill. At that time McMillan went west. The Kleinhans Store is the present-day successor of this
          old bake-shop, coming down through the owners, B. Bayles and Joseph Ewery to Charles Kleinhans. Breckenridge
          died on February 21, 1894, in his home at the southwest corner of Ninth and South streets.

               Clark and 
                     Bartholomew
                   Sawmill: The water right for this sawmill was leased by S. M. Clark and A. Bartholomew on
          the fifth of August 1841, and was to run for 30 years from the first of January 1842. "It granted
          water sufficient, when applied on a Parker or flutter wheel, to propel one saw," which would amount
          to "1554 cubic feet per minute." The mill was sixteen feet below the surface of the water in
          the canal, and was to use water only on the second fall. However, the mills that were to use water on the
          first fall were never built, or, at least, not up to 1846.27 This mill had ceased to
          operate before 1871 when Wm. J. Ball made his report on water leases. This sawmill stood west of the canal and
          just north of 
                  Salem
                Street, about one square distant from the flour mill known as the 
                  Lafayette
                Mill. It was approached by crossing the canal on the 
                  Salem
                Street bridge and then going north. In the early days of the canal's existence the above
          mentioned industries were all that were upon it in the northern part of 
                  Lafayette
               .
            
               Yandes Mills: In the southern part of town, situated near to and operated by the waters of
          the canal, were the Yandes saw, paper, and flour mills. These were on the west side of the canal, about the
          distance of a square south of the line of 
                  Alabama
                Street, if extended to the river. The water for all these was taken from the canal at one service
          opening. Within a short distance the race divided, the western branch supplying the paper mill (

                Paper Mill) which stood near the river bank; and the other, or southwest fork, approached the
          flour mill near the rear where the generating machinery was located. The used water continued on southwest,
          was joined by that of the paper mill and flowed into a basin from which, by a second fall, it operated a
          saw-mill situated at the edge of Sample Run. The saw-mill was later abandoned and a second paper mill took its
          place, and later still, the power generated here was used in the flour mill.28
            
            The supervising engineer, J. L. Williams, in his Report of 1846 referring to this mill
          (Star City, or Lower Mill) states: "Daniel Yandes lessee, T. Wood and Co. present
          occupants…. Three run of stone operating, each run doing 23 barrels a day."29 T. (Thomas) Wood was

                later one of the owners of the Hawkins Mill on Big Wea Creek. In fact,
          he, or his company, rebuilt that mill in the late eighteen forties—the same building which, as a
          dilapidated structure stands there today and is known as the Bayles Mill. This old Mill is the only one
          standing today in 
                  Tippecanoe County
                that was once run by water power.
            In 1852 the Star City Mill was purchased by Frederick Geiger who operated it for thirty-two years, or until
          1884, Part of the time he had a partner associated with him in the business but from 1871 on, he was the sole
          owner. Mr. Geiger was born in 
                  Germany
                and as a mere child was brought by his parents to America. He came to 
                  Tippecanoe County
                in 1849. His last residence was at the southwest corner of Seventh and 
                  Columbia
                streets. The house, remodeled and enlarged, is now the Christian Science Church building. His
          daughter Elizabeth was the wife of the late Hon. Will R. Wood.
            
               Hoagland Woolen Mill: The Hoagland Woolen Mill which Superintendent Williams mentioned in
          1846 as operating without a permit but which had "commenced operations on the word of one Silas s.
          White, of whom he claims to have purchased the privilege," was reported by Wm. J. Ball in 1871 as
          having a lease granting it the privilege of using one power, or 267.8 cubic feet of water per minute.30
            
            The following advertisement appeared in a 
                  Lafayette
                paper in 1841: 
                  
                     New Establishment—Fulling and Carding.
                  The subscriber wishes to inform the public that he has purchased of Silas S. White the Carding and
              Fulling establishment on the Canal, in the south part of the town of 
                        Lafayette
                     , where he may be found after the present time ready to execute all work in his line of
              business. Fulling will commence about the 10th of the present month. Cloth is now coming in briskly and we
              hope People will get their Cloth generally to the mill early in the season, as the season is more suitable
              for despatching this kind of work than cold weather.
                  The subscriber would say to the public that he has with considerable expense prepared himself with
              machinery and experienced workmen, for dressing country Cloth, and that he will spare no pains to give
              complete satisfaction in all cases to persons who may favor him with their custom. He therefore throws
              himself upon the liberality of the public. The Custom of the country will regulate our prices.
                  N. B. Carding will continue to be done as usual, at the shortest notice.31

            The Hoagland Mill stood on the west bank of the canal, like the other industries, but farther down, at the
          foot of Green Street. Its power was generated by a sixteen-foot wheel. In 1865 it was purchased by John Ewry.
          Within a short time Edward Robeson, whose father operated a woolen mill near Monitor, became a partner. At
          this time (1867) the firm consisted of John Ewry, Edward Robeson and Jacob Ewry. By 1871 the firm was known as
          J. Ewry and Co., Robeson having withdrawn. It was operated by the Ewrys until about 1875 or 1876 when it was
          destroyed by fire during the burning of the Eagle Distillery which stood less than two blocks southeast of it.
            The main approach to all these industries on the canal in the southern part of the city was, by crossing the
          canal on a bridge at South Street and proceeding south on the towpath. There was another bridge at Green
          Street, opposite the Hoagland Mill, but it was a crude affair compared to the well built, firm structures at
          South, Main and 
                  Salem
                streets.
            About 1875, when the canal ceased to be operated as a transportation unit, the power consumers of each
          section had to maintain the upkeep of that portion which supplied them. Thus the patrons in 
                  Lafayette
               , besides paying the nominal fee for water used, had, also, to take care of the feeder dam on Wild
          Cat Creek and the channel from thence into and through the city. This was so expensive that by 1888 every
          industry supplied by the canal had ceased operations. Just previous to the flood of 1876, the total paid per
          annum for hydraulic purposes by the patrons of 
                  Lafayette
                amounted to $1300.32
            
            It was in 1852 that the 
                  Wabash
                and 
                  Erie
                Canal reached the peak as to its income. From that time on there was a progressive decline in
          revenue which decline was augmented in 1856 by the completion of the 
                  Wabash
                Railroad. After six years of railroad competition canal transportation was practically ended. By
          early 1870, the end of its existence as a highway of commerce was rapidly approaching. The boat Rocky Mountain, which cleared October 26, 1872, was the last that went through from 
                  Lodi
                to 
                  Toledo
               .33
            
            During the first three days of August, 1875, a flood which had been threatening the 
                  Wabash
                Valley at 
                  Lafayette

                days reached its crest. After a five-inch rainfall in thirty hours,
          terminating at noon of August 1, the river, at 11 A.M., August 3, reached its highest stage, which was fifteen
          inches above that of 1858.34 The damage inflicted by this unprecedented high water so
          crippled the canal that navigation was never resumed. For many years following this flood, there could be seen
          here and there along the course of the canal, stranded boats rotting in the mud where the receding waters had
          deposited them, like unto the animal carcases which strewed the routes across the great arid plains of the far
          West in an earlier day. By court order, the canal line was sold on February 12, 1876. The section in 
                  Wabash County
                brought $505, and other sections proportionate amounts.
            The 
                  Wabash
                and 
                  Erie
                Canal hastened the development of the whole 
                  Wabash
                Valley. Along its course there sprang up as if by magic, trading and industrial centers which
          were supported by the oncoming hordes of colonists that kept penetrating deeper and deeper into the wilderness
          country that stretched away to the east and to the west of its line of passage. But even in its most
          prosperous times the great venture was not a financial success, the upkeep being a tremendous drain. The
          average yearly cost for repairs was $262 per mile, or a total yearly cost of about
            $120,000.35 Covering the whole period of its operation, from the time of its
          beginning to the time of its abandonment, the tolls did not equal the cost of repairs. Of the lands donated by
          the government, more than 2,000,000 acres, sufficient were sold to realize $1,500,000, providing a
          fairly steady income for several years. When the sales slackened the financial condition became acute.36 All this government land was practically squandered on a failing enterprise. The
          bondholders lost half of their investment of over $815,000, and received but little interest. But
          the Canal's failure as a money making venture in its own right, does not detract from its beneficial
          influence in the development of the 
                  Wabash
                Valley.
            The route across the 
                  Wabash
               -Maumee divide first existed as a buffalo trace, selected by the natural instinct of that roving
          forager. Later, it became an Indian portage. When the French explorers and traders came they followed the same

                course, making it perhaps, the portage of greatest historical importance
          in all America. The Canal in time followed this carrying path across the divide, and displaced the light-canoe
          traffic of the Maumee-
                  Wabash
                route. Then came the railroad which eliminated the canal. Later the traction line paralleled the
          railroad and, for a span of years, was a prominent commercial carrier. Today, all these modes of travel and
          transportation, except the railroad, have passed out of existence and the hard-surfaced automobile road, the
          modern "Appian Way," with its graceful curves and undulating gradients carries a great part
          of the travel and commerce that passes up and down these valleys and over the divide between them. What a
          contrast between this region today and the 
                  Wabash

            High Points in the Life of Dr. John Shaw Billings
            By DR. THOMAS JEFFERSON GRIFFITH
            
            Dr. Billings was a man who, from humble beginnings, attained a position of eminence and great honor, and who
          for fifty years devoted his life to the good of mankind. He was born April 12, 1838, near Allensville, 
                  Switzerland County
               , Indiana. His father was James Billings of Saratoga, 
                  New York
               . His mother was Abby (Shaw) Billings of Raynham, 
                  Massachusetts
               . The parents were married July 21, 1835.
            The elder Billings was possessed of the wanderlust. When John was but two or three years old, the family
          moved back east, living successively in 
                  New York, Connecticut
                and 
                  Rhode Island
               . They completed the circuit in six years, returning to Allensville, Indiana, when John was about
          ten. Dr. Billings told an astounding tale of his doings while away from Indiana. He declared that before he
          was eight years old, he had read the Bible through verse by verse, in addition to the
          following books: Robinson Crusoe, Pilgrims Progress, The Deer Slayer, The Pathfinder, Harry and
            Lucy, Marco Paul in the Forests of 
                     Maine
                  , Jock O'the Mill, and Plutarchs Lives. He certainly was a
          precocious lad.
            Dr. Philander Sage who lived nearby, told me many things about Dr. Billings. I remember this one. He was
          invited by other boys of the neighborhood to go with them to pilfer some melons and other fruit from the
          gardens of their neighbors; he declined to be one of the party. Misjudging him, the boys called him
          "Lazy John."
            He did not seek, or seem to care for the companionship of other boys. He loved books, and his pleasure and
          recreation consisted in reading them. With the help of a clergyman in the village he learned Latin. Now it was
          that he developed a desire to go to college. He proposed to surrender his share in the estate, if his father
          would help him through college. He procured the necessary books, and studied one year. At the age of fourteen,
          he entered the sub-freshman class of Miami University at 
                  Oxford, Ohio
               , in 1852. Five years later,
          he received the degree of B.A. ranking second in his class. Before he graduated his parents moved to 
                  Oxford
                and John gave up "bachelors' hall" to live with them. It was said of
          John's mother that "she was a persistent reader of all kinds of literature,  that she had a compelling eye, that she knew what she
          wanted—and got it." Many of her traits were reflected in her son.
            John planned to study medicine, but had to wait a year until he had earned money enough for the medical
          school. He spent the summer of 1857 travelling with an itinerant showman, who had a collection of lantern
          slides, and needed someone to give the lectures. John did this satisfactorily. By this means and by tutoring,
          he earned money enough to enter the Medical College of 
                  Ohio
                at 
                  Cincinnati
                in the fall of 1858. Then followed two of the most exacting and exhausting years of his life.
          With dire poverty facing him, he had to practice the severest economy. During one winter he lived on
          seventy-five cents a week, subsisting chiefly on milk and eggs. The hospital was his home, and he cared for
          the college dissecting room. In 1860 he took his degree. The subject of his graduation thesis was
          "The Surgical Treatment of Epilepsy." He had a great deal of trouble collecting the data
          needed for this work. Because of the poor arrangement of the books in most of the libraries he visited, he
          spent six months in getting the desired information. When the college term opened in the fall of 1860 he was
          appointed demonstrator of anatomy and served throughout the term. When the Civil War came on, he determined to
          join the medical corps, and went to 
                  Washington
                in September, 1861. Pending the result of his examination, he became a contract-surgeon, and was
          detailed to go to the Union Hotel Hospital in 
                  Georgetown
               , D. C. He was commissioned first lieutenant and assistant surgeon on April 16, 1862. It was while
          stationed at 
                  Georgetown
                that he met Miss Katharine Mary Stevens. They were married on September 3,1862. The young surgeon
          was ordered to report for duty in the West 
                  Philadelphia
                Hospital in August of 1862. All hospitals in the east were crowded with wounded men, due to the
          heavy fighting of the spring and summer months of 1862. The duties at this station lasted to April 1, 1863,
          when Dr. Billings was ordered to report to the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac. For nearly all of
          the rest of the year, he was on active field duty. Chancellorsville was fought during the first week of May,
          and here he had his first experience of field surgery when he operated under fire just back of the lines.
            
            
               
                  Gettysburg
                was fought on the first three days of July. Surgeon Billings was placed in charge of the field
          hospital of the Second Division of the Fifth Army Corps. He worked all night, and early the next morning moved
          the hospital about one mile to the rear, where he operated all day. When the Division moved on July 5, he was
          left in charge of the hospital. The next day he wrote to Mrs. Billings: I am utterly
            exhausted, mentally and physically. I have been operating night and day, and am still hard at work. I have
            been left in charge of 700 wounded, and have got my hands full. Our division lost terribly, over 30 per cent
            were killed and wounded. I had my left ear just touched with a ball, and Dick's mane was cut in two
            places.
            
            On July 9 he wrote: 
                  I am covered with blood, and am tired out almost completely, and can only say that I could lie down and
              sleep for sixteen hours without stopping. I have been operating all day long, and have got the chief part
              of the work done in a satisfactory manner.
               
            
            After spending several weeks at home in 
                  Georgetown
                recovering from nervous tension and physical exhaustion, Dr. Billings was ordered to 
                  New York City
                on August 16. He spent the following six months in various hospitals in or near 
                  New York
               , and was then again ordered to the Army of the Potomac. It was in the latter part of March, 1864,
          that he went on active field duty once more. During the next four months he lived through the battles of the
          Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and 
                  Petersburg
               . By July a partial paralysis of his left leg made further field service impossible, and he was
          granted sick leave on July 26. He went to 
                  Washington
               , secured an extension of his leave, and on August 22 was relieved from field duty and detailed to
          office duty in 
                  Washington
                with the Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac. On December 27, 1864, he was transferred to
          the Office of the Surgeon General, where he remained until his retirement thirty-one years later.
            It was the great difficulty which he had himself experienced in collecting data for his graduation thesis,
          that caused him to establish for American physicians a medical library, and, together with this, prepare a
          comprehensive catalogue and index. His opportunity came when he was in charge of the Surgeon
          General's Library and he devoted much time to its development. A sum of $80,000 was made
          available, and using  this to the best advantage, he increased the library
          from 600 entries in 1865 to more than 50,000 by 1873. In 1880 Congress provided for printing his monumental
          work, the Index Catalogue, in which he was assisted by Dr. Robert Fletcher. In 1879,
          Billings and Fletcher published the Index Medicus, a monthly guide to current medical
          literature. Dr. William H. Welch says that "the Index Catalogue is probably the most important
          contribution yet made to American medicine." Another writer says that the "three great
          things in the life of Dr. Billings, after the war were the development of the Surgeon General's
          Library and its catalogue, the planning of the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Directorship of the 
                  New York
                Public Library."
            Still another great thing should go to the credit of Dr. Billings—sanitation.
          Not only is this true in connection with the construction of hospitals, but in relation to general sanitation
          as well. He contributed more to the literature of sanitation, than to any other subject. His motto was, "prevent sickness, rather than cure disease." In March
          1875, with four other distinguished physicians he was selected by the trustees of the Johns Hopkins Hospital
          to submit designs for the hospital they were planning to erect, from funds left them by the 
                  Baltimore
                merchant who died December 24,1873. Dr. Billings' suggestions were deemed best, and for
          the next thirteen years he served as adviser to the trustees. He made a trip to Europe in their behalf,
          inspecting hospitals in 
                  England
                and on the Continent, in quest of the newest ideas in hospital construction. The physical
          arrangements of the new hospital were due almost entirely to him. At the Billings' Memorial Meeting
          held at the hospital on May 26, 1913, Dr. Henry M. Hurd said that "these plans influenced hospitals
          in a way unparalleled in the history of hospital construction, and gave a tremendous impetus to better
          hospitals by directing the attention of medical men, sanitarians, and others to the absolute necessity of
          certain great essentials, viz. more perfect ventilation and heating, and the prevention of
          contagion." In 1886, I attended a medical meeting in Ford's Theater Building. Leading the
          discussion of a disease then prevalent in 
                  Texas
                was Dr. Billings, so let's have a look at the man. He was large, had a fine intellectual
          face, and a booming voice. His manner in speaking was animated and intensely earnest. He drove every word deep
          into  the minds of his listeners. I was so impressed with his speech that
          now, after the lapse of forty-eight years, I still remember the subject under discussion—Anthrax.
            Dr. Billings was under my observation from 1890 until his retirement from the Army in 1895. I never saw as
          busy a man as he. When he was not classifying books in the Surgeon General's Library, he was
          lecturing at Johns Hopkins University, or writing articles for medical journals. Time was more precious to him
          than gold. While he won high praise for the part he took in the construction of the Johns Hopkins Hospital,
          equal praise is due him for helping create the staff of medical professors for the University, composed as it
          was of such men as Osler, Welch, and other brilliant teachers. For fifty years its high standard has been
          maintained, and today no medical school in the country ranks higher. Before the close of his army life, many
          honors were bestowed on Dr. Billings. In August 1881 he was invited to give an address before the
          International Medical Congress to be held in 
                  London
               . He was the first American physician to be so honored, and his address on Our Medical Literature
          was received with great enthusiasm. The Lancet described him as "tall and largely
          built," a man of "commanding presence, with a flow of wholesome English, ready wit and
          humor." In 1884 he went abroad to receive the degree of LL.D. at the celebration of the 300th
          anniversary of the University of Edinburgh. He sailed again in June 1889 to receive the degree of D.C.L. at 
                  Oxford
               . In 1892 he was called to 
                  Dublin
                to receive the honorary degree of M.D. at the 
                  Dublin
                University tercentenary celebration, and to be made honorary fellow of the Royal College of
          Surgeons of 
                  Ireland
               .
            When he gave up his work at the National Adademy of Science in 1895, he received from physicians of Great
          Britain and America, at a dinner given in his honor, a silver box containing a check for $10,000 as
          a material expression of gratitude for the labor-saving value of his catalogue. A good many things happened to
          Dr. Billings in the year 1895. He was retired from the Army on October 1, with the rank of Lieut. Colonel and
          Deputy Surgeon General. He moved to 
                  Philadelphia
                in October, 1895, where he had been lecturing in the Medical University for several years. In
          December 1895 he was called to 
                  New York
                to assume the directorship of the New  York Public Library,
          which had recently been created by the consolidation of the Astor, Lenox and Tilden libraries. The work to be
          done was immense including the erecting of a new building. Dr. Billings had the able assistance of Andrew
          Carnegie who gave $5,000,000 to be used in the construction of forty branch library buildings in 
                  New York City
               . After fifteen years of hard work, Dr. Billings had the satisfaction of knowing that he was the
          director of one of the largest and best arranged libraries in the world.
            In 1901-2, Dr. Billings was actively engaged with Dr. Daniel C. Gilman in the establishment and incorporation
          of the Carnegie Institution of 
                  Washington
               , D. C. He became chairman of the board of trustees in 1903, a position he held until his death.
          Other trustees with whom he served were ex-presidents 
                  Cleveland
                and Harrison, and ex-Secretary of State Elihu Root. All will admit that Dr. Billings had
          distinguished associates.
            His great ability and worth were recognized by such master minds as Elihu Root and Andrew Carnegie. Many
          libraries were built with the latter's money on the advice of Dr. Billings. This was a God-send to
          many small and poor towns like 
                  Vevay
               , Indiana. On the motto of Lea, publisher of medical books, "quae prosunt
            omnibus," he "hewed to the line."
            Dr. John Shaw Billings passed to the greater life on March 11, 1913. The funeral services were held in St.
          John's Church, 
                  Georgetown
               , D. C., where he had been married fifty-one years before. He was buried with military honors at
          Arlington on the morning of Friday, March 14, 1913.
         
         
         
            Post Roads in Southern Indiana
            By GEORGE E. AMICK
            
            A study of the routes of the old post roads as established by Congress through southern Indiana up to 1825
          will shed a considerable amount of light on the course taken by pioneer travel during the period when this
          part of the state was being colonized by immigrants from the South and the East.
            To the year 1805, only three post offices1 had been established in that part of the
          Indiana Territory which now corresponds to the state. However, during the next twenty years, Congress
          established fifty-seven different post routes which, served by post riders on horseback carrying the mail in
          saddlebags and by two and four-horse stages and wagons, furnished the transportation for the postal service
          until the coming of the railroads.
            The Eleventh Congress, on April 28, 1810, approved three routes for Indiana: one from 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , by 
                  Jeffersonville
               , Clarksville, Corydon and 
                  Vincennes
                to the "
                  United States
               ' Saline"; another from 
                  North
            Bend, Ohio
                by 
                  Lawrenceburg
                to Port William, 
                  Kentucky
               ;2 a third from 
                  Vincennes
               , Indiana Territory, by 
                  Kaskaskia
               , Prairies du Rochers and Cahokia to 
                  St. Louis
               
               3
            
            During the Twelfth Congress, two additional routes were approved on May 11, 1812. One ran from 
                  Lawrenceburg
                through 
                  Madison
                and 
                  Charlestown
                to 
                  Jeffersonville
               , and the second from 
                  Lawrenceburg
                by 
                  Franklin
                court-house4 to 
                  Wayne
                court-house.5
            
            During the Thirteenth Congress, an Act approved on April 18, 1814, discontinued the road from 
                  Jeffersonville
                by way of Clarksville to 
                  Vincennes
               , and established three new roads: from Eaton, 
                  Ohio
               , to 
                  Salisbury
                Indiana; from 
                  Washington
                Court-house6 to 
                  Vallonia
               , and from 
                  Charlestown
                to 
                  
                     1
                     
                        Lawrenceburg, Jeffersonville
                      and 
                        Vincennes
                     .
                  
                     2 This route connected with one coming down the 
                        Ohio
                      river, established at the same session of Congress, with another route coming from 
                        Cumberland
                      Gap to the 
                        Ohio
                      river at Port William. 
                        Kentucky
                     , which was located at the mouth of the 
                        Kentucky
                      river where Carrolton now stands. The description of these two routes read: "In

            The second session of the Fourteenth Congress, on March 3, 1817, provided for the establishment of nine new
          post roads in Indiana. The Treaty of Ghent had terminated the War of 1812, Indiana had been admitted as a
          state and for the first time colonists were rapidly coming in, hence more mail facilities were required. The
          new routes designated were: from Corydon by Shoemaker's, 
                  Troy
               , Mount Pleasant, Darlington8 and 
                  Evansville
                to Harmony; from Corydon through 
                  Fredericksburg
                to 
                  Salem
               ; from 
                  Lexington
                to 
                  Salem
                and Paoli; from 
                  Vincennes
                by way of Emersonville, 
                  Carlisle
                and 
                  Terre Haute
                to Ft. Harrison; from 
                  Madison
                to 
                  Vernon
               ; from 
                  Lawrenceburg
                through 
                  Decatur
                to 
                  Wilmington
               ; from 
                  Hamilton, Ohio
               , by 
                  Bath, Brookville, Connersville
               ,
          Waterloo, 
                  Centerville, Salisbury
               , Dunlapville and 
                  Fairfield
                to 
                  Brookville
               ; from 
                  Princeton
               , Indiana to 
                  Henderson, Kentucky
               .9
            
            Again in 1818, Congress made provision for additional routes in Indiana when an Act was approved designating
          post roads for the 
                  United States
               . The first session of the Fifteenth Congress approved the following routes: from 
                  Hartford
                to Rising Sun; from Corydon by way of Elizabeth to Laconia and 
                  Elizabethtown, Kentucky
               ; from 
                  Lawrenceburg
                to 
                  Vevay
               : from Fort Harrison through 
                  Monroe County
                and Lawrence County to 
                  Brownstown
               ; from Paoli through Orleans to Lawrence Court-house10; from 
                  Salem
                by way of Bono to 
                  Monroe
                Court-house; from 
                  Madison
                through Graham's to

            In 1820, the first session of the Sixteenth Congress voted three additional roads for Indiana: from Palestine
          by way of Hindostan15 to Portersville; from 
                  Madison
                to

               ; from

                  Aurora, Hanover
               
               16 and Rising Sun to 
                  Vevay
               .17 By the New Purchase Treaty of 1818, a vast central area of the new state
          of Indiana was thrown open to settlement. The line agreed upon in the Treaty of Grouseland which had been the
          northern line of white settlement from 1805 to 1818, that is, during the period of the War of 1812 when the
          Indians had been troublesome, no longer restrained the moving tide from going northward. The site of 
                  Indianapolis
                was selected as the location of the new seat of government for the state in 1820, and mail
          service was extended to it. On March 3, 1821, the second session of the Sixteenth Congress approved roads from 
                  Brownstown
                to 
                  Indianapolis
               ; from 
                  Vernon
                to 
                  Indianapolis
               ; from 
                  Connersville
                to 
                  Indianapolis
               ; from 
                  Lawrenceburg
                to 
                  Aurora, Hanover
                and Rising Sun and then to 
                  Versailles
               , to return by way of Vaughan's in 
                  Manchester

            The first session of the Seventeenth Congress provided for three more post roads all leading to the new
          Capital: from 
                  Terre Haute
                through

            Congress continued for a few more years to make special enactments whereby post roads were provided. The
          roads in southern Indiana, however, remained practically unchanged from 1825 until the mail was carried by
          railroads. The Report of the Postmaster General for 1825 informed the country that "half of the
          intelligence of the country is still carried in saddle bags." It is evident from this statement that
          a good many of these routes were served on horseback, although from this time on more and more of the mail was
          carried by two or four-horse stages which also carried passengers on their weekly or semi-weekly trips. As
          late as 1834, only one route, that from New 
                  Albany
                to 
                  Vincennes
               , was served with daily mail. The primary avenue for mail, especially mail coming from the East,
          for all southern Indiana in the early days was, of course, the Ohio River. Mail was
          brought to the many landings by the mail boats and thence inland over the post routes to the proper
          destinations, the small settlements of early Hoosier pioneers.

            Did Republicans "Colonize" Indiana in 1879?
            By JOHN G. VAN DEUSEN
            
            The Negro Exodus from the South in 1879 was really an emigration movement. 
                  Kansas
                was the "Canaan" for which most of the blacks were bound but some of them found
          their way to older states. The Negro emigrants came chiefly from 
                  Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky
               , and 
                  Tennessee
               . In time, however, the movement spread to the Atlantic states of the South affecting the colored
          people of 
                  Virginia
               , the Carolinas, and 
                  Georgia
               . The 
                  North Carolina
                migration was diverted into Indiana which gave rise to a charge that the Republican party was
          importing colored voters for the purpose of changing the political complexion of the state from Democratic to
          Republican.
            The 
                  United States
                Senate appointed a committee of investigation. The testimony of persons examined filled nearly
          1700 printed pages. All the members of the committee were Democrats save two. The majority report, supported
          by the Democratic members, held that Republicans had "colonized" Indiana for political
            purposes.1 The two Republican members drew up a minority report in which their party was
          absolved from all connection with the northward movement of southern Negroes. Three reasons were given for the
          migration: (1) A sense of personal insecurity attending the reversion of the South to Democratic rule, and
          political discontent among the blacks resulting from disfranchisement. (2) Economic discontent resulting from
          low prices for cotton and the extent of debt-servitude which grew out of the crop lien system. (3) Attractive
          propaganda consisting in part of circulars advertising the holdings of certain land-grant railroads and in
          part of excitement worked up by local leaders, who, in some cases at least, seem to have had selfish ends to
          serve.
            The 
                  North Carolina
                Negroes were first interested by Samuel L. Perry, Peter Williams and Taylor Evans, colored men
          who, in the spring of 1879, began to hold meetings in colored churches and elsewhere. In these meetings, the
          unpleasant features of 
                  North Carolina
                life were dwelt upon, 
                  
                     1
                     Senate Reports, 46 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 693, Parts I. II and III. The great body of
              evidence collected in this document is the chief basis of this paper, and the testimony cited in the
              following pages is taken from it unless otherwise noted.
               
                while Indiana was pictured as a paradise for black men.2 Some believed that Perry was paid for working up the emigration fever, and the evidence shows that he
          was promised a dollar a head for each full fare ticket sold over the 
                  Baltimore
                and 
                  Ohio
                Railroad. Furthermore, he charged twenty-five cents for membership in a Secret Emigration Society
          which he formed.3 Thus it appears that the astute Perry received pay both from the
          "exodusters" and from those who would profit from transportation.
            Perry's first idea was to go to 
                  Kansas
               , and his Secret Society sent him and Peter Williams out to "view the land."4 They left 
                  North Carolina
                in September or October, their Society having advanced funds to pay their fares as far as 
                  Washington
               ,5 where Perry met Mr. H. W. Mendenhall. At that time Mendenhall, who had
          formerly been a political worker in Indiana, was a clerk in the Treasury Department. Mendenhall is reported to
          have said: "Gentlemen, there are a great many colored people going to 
                  Kansas
                from 
                  Louisiana
                and 
                  Mississippi
               , and my opinion is that some of them will suffer. There are other states where you can get to
          much cheaper, and I believe fare better." He mentioned 
                  Ohio
               , Indiana and 
                  Illinois
               . On his suggestion, Perry and Williams stopped at 
                  Indianapolis
               
               6 where they saw Judge Martindale, editor of the 
                  Indianapolis
               
               Journal, and William R. Holloway, acting treasurer of the Republican State Central
          Committee. Both felt that Negro labor would be welcome in Indiana, and Holloway suggested that since Col.
          Streight was a large land owner possibly Perry's whole colony might be settled at his place,7 but Perry did not think his people would like Indiana. He would like to get to 
                  Kansas
                but his funds were exhausted. Through a lecture which he gave at a Negro church he secured
          $4.10, a sum that enabled him to get to 
                  Greencastle
                where he met Mr. Langsdale, postmaster and editor of the Banner, and Rev. John
          H. Clay, a colored man whose circulars advertising

                Indiana, Perry had already seen.8 Perry is said to
          have declared that his efforts in behalf of moving his people from 
                  North Carolina
                had so embittered the whites that his family was in danger and that it was necessary for him to
          hasten back in order to protect them. His return transportation was paid by gentlemen high in the inner circle
          of the Republican Party.9 Perry maintained that he never advised anyone to go to
            Indiana,10 nevertheless, he brought back a large batch of the Rev. 
                  Clay
               's circulars which he distributed. Perhaps there was a failure on the part of the colored
          people to distinguish between what the circulars told them and what Perry actually said, but it is very likely
          that he indorsed the printed word. There is no lack of evidence that he did. It was generally understood that
          marvelous wages ranging from $1.50 to $2 a day, and $5 and $6
          during the harvest season, were being paid in Indiana. When labor was contracted for by the year the current
          rate was understood to be $15 or $20 per month, in addition to a dwelling house, garden,
          plenty of fire wood and a cow to milk. Some of the colored people believed that after they got to 
                  Washington
                they would be given a free suit of clothes and that their ticket to Indiana would be provided.11
            
            The first contingent of Negroes left 
                  North Carolina
                about the middle of November. There were fifty-one in the party, chiefly from Kinston, and almost
          all were men.12 Expecting free transportation beyond 
                  Washington
               , only a few purchased through tickets. An Emigrant Aid Society had been organized at 
                  Washington
                to assist destitute migrants to 
                  St. Louis
                and the secretary of this organization furnished $270 to transport this group of
          Negroes to 
                  Greencastle
               , Indiana.13 Being few in number they were well received and given employment.
          The glowing accounts of Indiana which they sent back home set others in motion and a second party, one hundred
          and sixty four in number, arrived in December. Of these, sixty-five paid their own fare; the others were
          provided for through the

                Emigrant Aid Society.14 About a week later three hundred more arrived at the
          national capital. By this time the funds of the Emigrant Aid Society had given out and the Negroes were
          stranded in 
                  Washington
               , D. C. Perry sent a telegram signed "Koontz"15 to William
          B. Tinney, passenger agent to the 
                  Baltimore
                and 
                  Ohio
                R. R. at 
                  Indianapolis
               , instructing him to collect $625 from the colored people in 
                  Indianapolis
                for the transportation of the marooned Negroes.16 Tinney did not care to be
          responsible for so large a sum and suggested to "Professor" Babgy, one of the leading
          colored men at 
                  Indianapolis
               , that the money be deposited in a bank and 
                  Washington
                telegraphed that the amount was subject to draft. He testified that he did not know whether the
          money was raised or not, although he presumed that it was, saying: "I know the Negroes came to 
                  Indianapolis
                and we don't haul people for nothing."17 Apparently the
          colored leaders were also in the dark as to what happened. Asked whether $600 could have been
          raised among the colored population of 
                  Indianapolis
                in twenty-four hours, Mr. W. H. Woods of the Citizens Relief Committee
          replied—"Well, I know that it could not."18
            
            As a rule no preparations were made to receive the immigrants. When the first load disembarked at 
                  Greencastle
               , they were met at the station by Langsdale and 
                  Clay
                and marched down the street to a colored church where they were temporarily quartered. Colored
          churches were also used as temporary receiving quarters at 
                  Terre Haute
                and 
                  Indianapolis
               .19 It was only natural that many should become objects of charity and that
          there should be some suffering among them. Relief work at 
                  Indianapolis
                was hampered by a quarrel which broke out between two rival relief societies.20 Cold and disease added to the distress. J. H. Russell, who had the contract for burying paupers who
          died in 
                  Indianapolis
               , testified that he buried twenty-five or thirty immigrants, mostly children, in the 
                  
                     14

                months of December, 1879, and January, 1880. Diptheria, pneumonia and
          scarlet fever were the principal causes of death.21 There was some violence on the part of
          the whites. Two houses were burned in Russelville, in 
                  Putnam County
                because their owners had made arrangements to employ Negroes.22 At 
                  Shelbyville
                a body of citizens went to the station to tell the "damned niggers" that they
          could not get off the train and, as a matter of fact, did prevent their getting off.23
            
            Sheriff Lewman of 
                  Greencastle
               , Mr. Leonard Hackney, prosecuting attorney at 
                  Shelbyville
               , and others testified that they had been told that a definite scheme was on foot to
          "colonize" Indiana for political purposes. Lewman's informant was one Heath, a
          colored man who represented himself as an advance agent for a colony seeking lands. Upon his arrival at 
                  Greencastle
               , Heath asked for the post office. This was natural since Langsdale, the postmaster, was known to
          be a friend of Negro immigration. Sheriff Lewman replied that he was the postmaster and a good Republican.
          Taking Heath to the sheriff's office instead of the post office, Lewman obtained information of the
          "colonization" plan.24 Heath repeated the story in a deposition signed
          in the office of the auditor of state,25 though why he should have made such a deposition
          does not appear. Prosecutor Hackney of 
                  Shelbyville
                mentions a colored man named Flowers who informed him that 10,000 was the number of immigrants to
          be imported.26 As Flowers is mentioned by no other witness nothing is known of him. Mr. P.
          K. McCroskey, a building contractor of 
                  Terre Haute
               , mentioned a conversation with J. H. Walker, a colored man, who told him of a plan to import
          10,000 Negroes into Indiana in order to carry the state in the fall election of 1880. Walker, he said,
          "had liquor in him" at the time.27 Statements of two colored men, Silas
          Isler and Lewis Williams, were taken at the auditor's office at 
                  Indianapolis
                on January 10, 1880. Among other things they said that Perry told them that only Republican
          Negroes were wanted in the party of

                emigrants. Each Negro signed by his "mark." Neither
          statement was sworn to, and the statement of Williams was not read to him before he signed it.28
            
            Granting for the moment the possibility of "colonization" for political purposes, who could
          have been responsible? Certainly not the 
                  Baltimore
                and 
                  Ohio
                Railroad. The testimony of their emigration agent shows that he regarded the whole affair as a
          business transaction. He left the witness stand with the statement that he was going "right back to 
                  Goldsboro
               " to make more money out of the exodus and that when the Negroes got tired of Indiana he
          was willing to go to 
                  Indianapolis
                and sell them tickets back again.29 Nor could it have been Perry. While one
          of those chiefly responsible for the movement from 
                  North Carolina
               , Perry stated that he was not aware of any political motive,30 his chief
          interest seemingly being pecuniary. We can not imagine him financing the importation of ten thousand, or even
          one thousand, Negroes from 
                  North Carolina
                to Indiana for political purposes.
            Thomas P. Mills of 
                  Indianapolis
                declared that he "wanted 20,000 bucks, buck niggers, in Indiana this year" and
          that he wanted them for the purpose of voting the Republican ticket. But Mills was not a member of the
          Republican Committee, and a political party cannot be held responsible for the utterances of every person who
          votes the ticket. When asked what he had personally done to advance the object, Mills replied:
          "Nothing, except to blow off a little wind." Scott Ray, editor of a Democratic paper at 
                  Shelbyville
               , reported a conversation with Henry S. Byers, ex-chairman of the

                Republican Committee, made in the presence of two witnesses. "There is no disguising the
          fact, Ray," Byers is reported to have said, "the exodus movement of the colored men to
          Indiana is a political movement of the Republican Party… We intend to carry Indiana with the aid of
          the Negro vote…. We intend to bring 8,000 of them into the state in time for them to vote this
          fall, and will place them in close congressional districts." Asked if it was an organized effort on
          the part of Republican managers to bring Negroes into the state for political purposes, Byers said that it was
          and produced a letter bearing the heading of the 
                  
                     28 Statements, I, 332-3.

                Republican State Central Committee, although he refused to divulge its
            contents.31 The alleged witnesses were not called to confirm this story. Granting that
          the conversation took place as Ray reported it, there is no means of knowing the contents of the letter which
          Byers exhibited. Is it not permissible to suppose that he, too, was "blowing off a little
          wind" or perhaps having some fun with his panicky Democratic friend?
            Were the motives of those who stimulated immigration through the advertisement of labor opportunities honest?
          Rev. John Clay of 
                  Greencastle
                and J. H. Walker of 
                  Terre Haute
                declared that there was a great demand for colored, labor in Indiana.32
          Langsdale, editor of the 
                  Greencastle
               
               Banner, also claimed that Indiana needed labor. Mendenhall saw two letters from him stating
          that he could Provide for a large number of immigrants on farms. Editorials in the Banner
          painted rosy conditions in Indiana as contrasted with those in 
                  North Carolina
               , and expressed the hope that many Negroes would take advantage of the opportunities presented33
            
            Since many persons swore that there, was not only no demand for colored labor, but an actual surplus of
          unskilled labor,34 the conclusion accepted by the Democrats was that Negroes had been
          brought or sent to Indiana that their votes might aid the Republican party. Practically all of the witnesses
          examined were Democrats and consequently partial to the Democratic theory. Other witnesses, who were mostly
          Republicans, testified that there was a demand for labor and believed that many of the Negroes had been
            employed.35 Mr. New, chairman of the Republican organization in Indiana, mentioned that
          the contractors for the 
                  Indianapolis, Decatur
                and 
                  Springfield
                R. R. had been unable to finish their contract on schedule because of inability to secure a
          sufficient number of laborers and had to import 130 colored hands from 
                  Kentucky
               .

                New, Holloway, and Martindale told of receiving many' inquiries
          from farmers looking for hands.36 Langsdale read statements procured from twenty-two
          Negroes to the effect that they were employed at good wages. He followed with forty-seven statements from
          representative residents of all parts of Indiana expressing the opinion that additional laborers were needed
          in the state, and finally read into the record fifty-two requests which he had received from various parts of
          Indiana calling for colored laborers in varying numbers from one to twenty. Many of these he had filled though
          some he had not been able to supply.37 W. H. Woods of the Citizens Relief Committee stated
          that his committee had secured employment for 438 Negroes outside of 
                  Indianapolis
               , while the Christian Aid Association had found places for a good many others in the city.38 F. B. Fields of LaGrange, N. C., visited Indiana to take back two men. He found some
          immigrants who stated that they could not make a living while others said they were doing well, had plenty of
          work, and were getting fair pay.39 The probability is that those who were energetic and
          persistent in the search of employment found it. But as the high wages which Perry had been understood to have
          promised were not forthcoming and as there were no free cows to milk, it was natural that there should have
          been disappointment. Possibly there might have been additional opportunities for colored labor but for the
          violence offered to some employers willing to hire them. Knowledge that mobs had burned two houses planned for
          colored occupancy probably had a deterring effect on the employment of Negro labor. Certainly enough Negroes
          were employed to make it unnecessary to ascribe political motives to all those who encouraged immigration.
            What connection, if any, did the members of the Republican State Central Committee have with the exodus?
          Holloway, acting treasurer of the Committee admitted receiving a letter from Mr. Adams, secretary of the
          Emigrant Aid Society at 
                  Washington
               , stating that there were two hundred persons at the capital who wanted to come to Indiana but who
          were without means to do so. The reply was, according to Holloway, 
                  
                     36 John C. New, 11, 22, 27; Wm. R. Holloway, 11, 31; E. B. Martindale's
              letter, II, 306.20.
                  
                     37 Geo. J. Langsdale, editor, 
                        Greencastle

                that there was no fund which could be used for that purpose.40 Mr. Dudley, an important member of the Republican State Central Committee, mentioned
          receiving a letter from Mendenhall suggesting the political value of colored voters who might be brought to
          Indiana. He then said: "Every one who had any interest in the management of the party in the state
          advised against it."41 Mr. New declared, "We were opposed to it because
          we knew that, as a matter of fact, the hue and cry that would be raised against us, and the clamor that it
          would get us, would do us more injury as a party, tenfold, than any accession we could possible
          gain… by the influx of colored population."42 Mendenhall's
          testimony is corroborative. He declared that Dudley wrote "that if employment could be got for them
          he would be glad to see them come into the state, but the Republicans as a party could have nothing to do with
          it." When asked the question, "DO you know of any movement on the part of active Republicans
          to colonize these Negroes for political purposes," he replied: "No, sir, I never heard of
            any."43 According to Dudley, Mendenhall was the only person who ever applied to
          him for money for such a purpose,44 and the leaders of the Central Committee were
          unanimous in declaring that neither the Committee nor any of its members as individuals had any part in
          raising money for the purpose of bringing Negroes into the state.45 It need not
          necessarily be assumed that they spoke the truth, but the evidence proves no practical or effective connection
          between the Committee and the exodus.
            There remains one other individual to consider—H. W. Mendenhall. Charges against him were made by
          James O'Hara, a colored political leader of 
                  North Carolina
               : "Mr. Mendenhall suggested that Indiana was a doubtful state, and he thought it would be
          a good idea to take the Negroes out of 
                  Virginia
                and 
                  North Carolina
               , as they were states of easy access, and remove them to Indiana to carry the state."46 Charles N. Otey also gave evidence relative to Mendenhall. He stated that, when the
          Emigrant Aid Society was founded in

                     46 James E. O'Harra, I, 70.
               
               
               
                  Washington
               , Mendenhall made a speech suggesting the advisability of diverting the emigrants from 
                  Kansas
               . "In his speech he said that it would be a good thing to send 5000 into Indiana as that
          was a doubtful state in the coming election."47 When examined, Mendenhall said:
          "I knew that a great number of them, if not all, voted the Republican ticket and I would like
          amazingly to see them come here, [to Indiana] just the same as you [Democratic members of the Committee] to
          see the Irish coming in because they generally vote the Democratic ticket."48 The
          evidence does not seem to warrant a conviction. While Mendenhall may have had the wish, there is room for more
          than a reasonable doubt that this government clerk engineered the exodus to Indiana on an annual salary of
          $1200, though funds could have been furnished to him.
            There is no way of knowing the exact number of 
                  North Carolina
                migrants, but the approximate number can be determined. John E. Lamb, attorney at 
                  Terre Haute
               , thought that 150 or 200 had been imported into 
                  Vigo County
               , while P. K. McCroskey, building contractor, thought the number between 200 and 300.49 Lamb declared that fifty or sixty had been taken into 
                  Parke County
               .50 Mr. Lewman, sheriff at Green-castle, thought 250 had been taken into 
                  Putnam County
               .51 Leonard G. A. Hackney, prosecuting attorney at 
                  Shelbyville
               , said that twenty-six came in the first party, and probably twenty came later. Scott Ray, editor
          of the 
                  Shelbyville
               
               Democrat-Volunteer, believed that twenty or thirty had come to 
                  Shelbyville
               .52 Opposed as they were to this immigration, these witnesses would not have
          been inclined to underestimate the influx. Taking the largest figures which appear, 
                  Vigo County
                received 300, 
                  Parke County
                60, 
                  Putnam County
                250, and 
                  Shelby County
                46. A relief society formed by the colored churches of 
                  Indianapolis
                reported the arrival of eighty-seven in that city on December 4,1879, stating that,
          "these were the first who stopped at 
                  Indianapolis
               ." "From that time up to Christmas, 460 emigrants arrived in the city from 
                  North Carolina
               ." Two hundred more are listed as arriving on Christmas

                eve, and 625 after that date, making a total of 1372 for 
                  Indianapolis
               .53 If all these immigrants remained in 
                  Indianapolis
               , the total for the counties most affected is 2028. Probably small contingents settled in other
          counties. A comparison of the census figures of 1870 and 1880 shows an increase of 1813 
                  North Carolina
               -born Negroes in Indiana at the latter date. These figures make no allowance for mortality. There
          were 1354 
                  North Carolina
               -born Negroes in Indiana in 1870. Not more than a fifth of them could have died in the succeeding
          ten years. Making this allowance and making a liberal allowance for decease among the migrants, the amount of
          immigration from 
                  North Carolina
                could not have been in excess of 2300.
            But the absurdity of the colonization theory is even more apparent when one remembers that not all the
          Negroes who came to Indiana were voters. Mr. Lamb, who believed in the contention of the majority of the
          investigating committee estimated that there were forty or fifty voters in the 150 to 200 Negroes who came to 
                  Vigo County
               .54 Dukehart testified that from November 20, 1879 to January 24, 1880, the 
                  Baltimore
                and 
                  Ohio
                R. R. sold 763 tickets of which 236 were half-fare and 428 adult tickets. Probably half the
          adults were women. He did not think he had transported more than 200 voters to Indiana.55
          At this rate the migration netted only about 800 or 900 voters in the whole state. The 
                  Baltimore
                and 
                  Ohio
                R. R. made a rate of $9 for each full-fare passenger with a drawback of one dollar to
          the Emigrant Aid Society, or a net rate of $8.56 As the average Negro family
          consisted of a man, his wife, and numerous minor children, the cost per voter could not have been under
          $20, and probably exceeded that sum.
            We have been taught to look upon the Republican leaders of this period as practical politicians. As such, can
          we seriously believe that they resorted to a plan which required twenty dollars for a 
                  North Carolina
                voter when they could have got him from 
                  Kentucky
                for one-fourth of that sum? There were individual Republicans favoring
          "colonization," who perhaps assisted it to a moderate extent with funds, or encouraged it in
          other ways, but that the Republican organization,

                as such, was involved is absurd when one looks at the matter from the
          point of view of practical politics. One who studies the records of the period may discover the means by which
          Indiana was sometimes carried. The methods were not always above reproach, but they had the quality of being
          efficient. "Colonization" of Negroes in Indiana would have been extravagant in price, the
          numbers insufficient, the plan unscientific from any point of view and altogether unworthy of the ingenuity of
          the men who are supposed to have executed it.
         
         
         
            A Survivor of "The Charge of the Light Brigade"
            By JULIA LE CLERC KNOX
            
            John Thomas O'Day lies buried in the rural cemetery of Ebenzer Church near Moorefield, Indiana. 
                  Switzerland County
               , in which this old graveyard may be found, has the honor of having been for many years the
          dwelling place of this survivor of the disastrous but glorious charge which Tennyson immortalized in the
          stanzas of "The Charge of the Light Brigade." It was in the Battle of Balaklava, an
          important engagement of the Crimean War,1 that in the phrasing of the Poet, 
                  Into the valley of death Rode the six hundred.
               
            
            So much did "Old Tommy" O'Day, as he was familiarly called, take his experiences
          as "all in the day's business" and so little did he seem to understand or value the
          prestige to which they entitled him, that he could seldom be persuaded to talk about them. Once when
          confronted by an interviewer, he exclaimed: "SO ye want to write a piece in the paper about me and
          make some money out of it, do ye?" Then with a shrewd twinkle in his keen, little eyes, he shut up
          like a clam.
            A friend in whom he had confidence approached him one day and finding him willing to talk drew him out at
          some length. This friend wrote up the interview in her own words and preserved the autobiographical
          information furnished by the veteran of the Crimean War. In a letter to the author of August 20, 1934, Mrs. A.
          V. Danner of 
                  Vevay
               , Indiana, for she it was who won the confidence of "Old Tommy," says: 
                  I am glad to be able to do something toward placing Tommy O'Day upon the State's roster
              of heroes. When I took the notes on his talk, he was a middle-aged man and had a keen intellect but was
              very ignorant and somewhat sensitive. I had never met him before and had doubted his story which I had
              heard from others. He soon converted me to the sincere truth of his clear, simple statements about his
              experiences which he could not have learned from another. He had to be there to know it all. It is too bad
              that he sent all of his medals back to 
                        England
                      and gave his sword away, so he had nothing left to show to prove his tale authentic.
               
            
            
               
                  1 The Crimean War centered in a peninsula of Russia extending into the north part of
            the Black Sea, known as the Crimea. Great Britain, 
                     France
                   and the Kingdom of Sardinia, or Sardinia-Piedmont, supported the Turks against Russia. The War
            started at the beginning of 1854 and ended early in 1856.
            
            
            Parts of the story related by the survivor of the famous charge as written down years ago by Mrs. Danner
          follow: 
                  My father was Patrick O'Day and my mother's maiden name was Limmen. They lived in
                  
                        Dublin, Ireland
                     , where I was born Nov. 9th, 1833. I was one of seven children. My father
              worked in the coal mines of 
                        Wales
                      and came home every four or six weeks. When I was a boy I broke rock in the streets of 
                        Dublin
                     . When I was quite young (fourteen), I ran away from home and enlisted in the army at 
                        Bristol
                      against my parents' wishes. Afterwards I was sorry too.
               
            
            The veteran then related how he had sailed from 
                  Portsmouth
                some years later along with a part of his regiment. The transports coaled at 
                  Gibraltar
                and again at 
                  Malta
                after which they proceeded to the Dardanelles and Constantinople. From this city the British
          troops were transferred to the Crimea, where they were joined by French and Turkish forces. 
                  It was thought the Russians intended to capture our guns and to prevent this our company, the Sixteenth
                Enniskillens,2 commanded by Lord Cardigan, were ordered to charge.3 The commander of the brigade at this time, was on his yacht in the harbor and when he reached us
              we were in the saddle waiting. Some said Lord Cardigan refused to obey and that he hesitated as long as he
                dared.4 I don't know about that, I only know the valley lay before us about
              a mile or a mile and a half long. We went four abreast. I was in the second section of our Company B.
              Death stared at us, but it was death to refuse to go. I was scared and could only think of the folks back
              home. The trumpet sounded and we started off at an easy trot. Full charge away we went for sixty yards
              when the Russians opened volley on us. My horse (Nig) was killed as he lunged forward, so I sprang off,
              caught a riderless horse, mounted and started back at the first chance I got. Some say they went through
              the valley5 but I did not. I started back as quickly as I could.
                  When we came out of the charge only seven mounted men reported to roll call. I was one of them. Others
              who had been wounded reported later. My only hurt was a splinter in the calf of my leg. The battle lasted
              nine hours. I don't know how many were killed. They never told US. I lost two brothers and an
              uncle on this battlefield which I saw afterwards. My horse (Nig) had seen sixteen years service in the
              army.
                  
                     
                        2 These soldiers are often spoken of as the "Inniskillings."
                     
                        3 There was much controversy between Lord Cardigan and his brother-in-law, Lord
                Lucan, after the event, as to the responsibility for the charge of the Light Brigade. Lucan was the
                Immediate superior of Cardigan. They were not on speaking terms with each other.
                     
                        4 It is evident that Lord Cardigan was sure that the order was a blunder, but
                after a protest to Lord Lucan, he rode boldly at the head of his first line.
                     
                        5 There is no doubt about a part of the brigade going through the valley.
                "The men who reached the end of that valley of death rode through the guns, scattered the
                gunners, and returned: but of six hundred and seventy-three horsemen who had followed the devoted
                Cardigan… only one hundred ninety-five answered at roll-call. The French General Bosquet
                rendered all eulogy insipid, all criticism tame, by his epigramatic comment— 'C'était magnifique mais ce n'était pas la
                  guerre.' " (It was splendid but it was not war.) Sir Herbert Maxwell, A Century of Empire, 1801-1900. II, 289.
                  
                  
                  I was at Inkerman and between that battle and Alma6 I went out as a scout as my
              regiment was [had been] cut to pieces. With several other privates I took a Russian battery, spiked the
              guns and held the fort. But an officer came up, claimed he did the work, got the honors and is wearing the
              "Victory Cross" today [1902]—if he is alive. A private has no chance for a
              "Victory Cross" as the officers claim all the honors.
                  I got my second wound near Inkerman and while in the hospital I saw Florence Nightingale.7 I was in the Battle of Alma which was on the heights and hard to get to. Between the battle of
              Balaklava and Sebastopol,8 Lord Cardigan died. [?] His throat was cut and they say he
              was murdered by the soldiers.9
                  
                  We were seven months guarding territory near Sebastopol and then were sent to 
                        Malta
                      in the same ship we came over in and were kept there a year. 
                        Malta
                      is not a good place to sleep for there are the queerist Catholics there I ever knew. They
              ring their bells all the time. Never stop day or night. Then they have processions and carry a picture of
              the Virgin. St. John's Cathedral is very beautiful. You know Napoleon took away the golden gates
              at the entrance and coined them to pay his soldiers. So, massive solid silver gates, thirty feet high, had
              been put in their place.
                  I did soldier's duty in 
                        Malta
                     —guard, you know. There we were given our service medals. They were silver and
              about as large as a dollar with our names around the edge and the name of the Duke of 
                        Cambridge
                      (our leader after the death [?] of Lord Cardigan) in the center. Attached were the English
              colors and a half-inch wide silver bar on which was the name of every engagement we had been in. My medal
              had four bars.
                  On the way to Quebec, where I was ordered, we stopped at 
                        Gibraltar
                      where we were given Turkish medals for our service. These were also silver, a star and
              crescent with a whole punched through the edge in which was run the Turkish colors and tied in a bow-knot.
              My name was on the outer edge.
                  As it was reported that every mother who had a son killed in the Crimea could get a donation pension, I
              sent my medals and two hundred dollars to my mother with a testimony that my two brothers were killed at
              Balaklava, so she received the pension. If I were in 
                        Ireland
                      I could get a small one myself.
                  After we had been in Quebec nine months, we were given a choice of buying our discharge for
              $36 or returning to 
                        England
                      to re-enlist when 
                        
                           6 The veteran's memory as to the time of Alma was faulty. The Battle
                  of Alma was fought on the heights above the small Alma River on September 20, 1854, the first battle
                  in history in which English and French soldiers fought on the same side. Balaklava was fought on
                  October 26 and Inkerman on November 5.
                        
                           7 Florence Nightingale, an English woman interested in hospital work, left her
                  position as head of a hospital in 
                              London
                            to go to the front during the Crimean War. She was then thirty-four years of age, and
                  with the thirty-eight nurses whom she took to the Crimea, she started a hospital at Scutari. The
                  undertaking was without precedent in history, but the system started in 1854 has been followed in all
                  later wars.
                        
                           8 Sebastopol, a port on the southwestern shore of the Crimea, was attacked
                  because of the great Russian arsenal located there. The port was protected by forts. The defense was
                  in the hands of a very able Russian, Todleben. The little Alma River was a few miles north of
                  Sebastopol while Balaklava and Inkerman were adjacent to that Port.
                        
                           9 The story of Lord Cardigan's death, which Tommy O'Day
                  heard and which he believed during the rest of his life, was entirely erroneous.
                     
                      the old regiment was refilled. As I had now been in the army for nine
              years, eight months and twenty-eight days, I bought my discharge. I was granted my Carbine because it was
              old, but had to beg for my sword which I afterwards gave to a friend in 
                        Canada
                     .
                  Quebec was full of recruits and I drilled them at target practice for fifty cents a day. When the Fenian
                Raid10 broke out, a young fellow, enlisted for five years, offered to give anyone
              $1000 to go in his stead but when I said I'd go, he decided he would not pay that
              much. "Well you don't have to. Just go yourself," I said.
               
            
            The veteran then related, with a chuckle, that the young soldier's father gave him $500
          and a fine watch to take the son's place. As the service was easy and required only twenty-eight
          days, O'Day felt that he had made a good bargain, especially since he was able, upon his return, to
          sell the watch back to the owner for $100. The young recruit tried to convince Tommy O'Day
          that he had been paid to serve for the five year period of enlistment. The contract was taken to the Mayor of
          the city and then to the Governor of the province who decided that the obligation had been met by the service
          already performed.
            O'Day recalled that a private was paid a shilling a day when he was in the service out of which he
          must provide for himself. This left him only eight cents for spending money. If a soldier lost a spur, a belt,
          or any other article he had to pay for it and his pay was accordingly cut two cents. Drinking was severely
          punished. First offense meant twenty-eight days in the guard house; the second, meant a regimental court
          martial; the third, twenty lashes with a "cat 0' nine tails" and two years
          imprisonment. "For all that," the Irish soldier added, "there was a lot of
          drinking, but they were ‘sly’ about getting caught."
            From Quebec, ex-cavalryman John Thomas O'Day went to 
                  Buffalo, New York
               , then to
              
                  Columbus, Ohio
               , next to 
                  Cincinnati
               , and on to Belleview, 
                  Kentucky
               . There, for a time, he stripped willows to be used in basket making. Later he worked on a farm
          near Carrollton, 
                  Kentucky
               . Coming to 
                  Vevay
               , Indiana, he obtained work on the turnpike road that was under construction from that town to
          Moorefield. His job consisted of rock-breaking, a kind of work which he had 
                  
                     10 The Fenian Raid into 
                        Canada
                      was planned by the Fenian Brotherhood who used cities in the 
                        United States
                      as centers of activity. The Raid occurred in 1866, when 1200 Fenians crossed the
                Niagara River into 
                        Canada
                      above 
                        Buffalo
                     , occupied a fort and defeated a force of Canadians. Veteran O'Day lived in 
                        Canada
                      about ten years before coming to the 
                        United States
                     .
               
                performed when a boy in 
                  Dublin
               . After the road was finished Tommy settled down as a tenant on the farm of John Bakes on Indian
          Creek. One of the persons to whom the veteran would talk was Mr. Bakes, and through him the stories of Mr.
          O'Day's earlier experiences leaked out. He took out naturalization papers, and when
          thirty-six years of age (1869), he married the widow Hines who was the mother of several children by her first
          husband. She died more than thirty years before Mr. O'Day. Three children were born of this marriage.
          They are Mrs. Clarence Hollcraft, Mrs. Aleck Locke, and Eugene O'Day, all of whom live on farms in 
                  Switzerland County
               .
            The ex-cavalryman of the Crimean War lived to be ninety-three and died from a stroke of paralysis in 1926. He
          kept his faculties fairly well to the last. To those who knew him in his old age, he seemed a quaint, old
          character. Many of the stories related about his early experiences were hard to verify. Some believed them,
          while others doubted their truth. Some things were left unsettled. It remained a mooted question whether he
          ever received a Victory Cross. A tradition grew up that Queen Victoria herself pinned one on him. Since he did
          not mention it in his interview with Mrs. Danner, the probability is that the story was fictitious. If true
          the cross had to be bestowed when the soldier was on his way from the island of 
                  Malta
                in the Mediterranean to Quebec in 
                  Canada
               .11
            
            Always a far-off event gains vividness when it can be brought closer through linking it with some one who had
          a part in it or who saw or knew some participant. Thus through modest and retiring old John Thomas
          O'Day, many people in 
                  Switzerland County
                were brought in imagination within sound of the roaring of the guns when the Light Brigade
          charged "into the jaws of death," while 
                  Cannon to the right of them, Cannon to the left of them, Cannon in front of them Volleyed and thundered;
              Stormed at with shot and shell 
                        
                           11 In addition to the interview recorded and preserved by Mrs. A. V. Danner,
                  President of the 
                              Switzerland County
                            Historical Society, the writer obtained information from Mrs. Clarence Hollcraft. Mr.

            King was blood kin to the Turkish Sultan and felt that he had to help him. The "why" of it
            all was remote enough from the Irish soldier's mind, which reminds one of Southey's lines
            in the poem, "The Battle of Blenheim":

            Henry Clay at 
                  Richmond
                in 1842
            By LEONARD S. KENWORTHY
            
            American history abounds with instances in which chance statements, seemingly unimportant at the time,
          subsequently exerted a tremendous influence upon political campaigns. This fact is aptly illustrated by the
          classic example of the Douglas reply to 
                  Lincoln
               's 
                  Freeport
                question; by the Burchard reference during the campaign of 1884 to the Democratic party as one
          whose affiliations were with "Rum, Romanism and Rebellion," an ill-chosen alliteration of
          which Blaine took no notice at the moment but which had a devastating effect on his chances for election to
          the presidency; or by the trap into which the British minister Lord Sackville-West stupidly stepped during the
          campaign of 1888 when he wrote his well-known letter advising a certain Mr. Murchison as a naturalized
          Englishman to vote for 
                  Cleveland
                rather than Harrison, a letter which no doubt seemed harmless to its composer, but which lost
          thousands of Irish votes for 
                  Cleveland
               .
            In Indiana history, perhaps no better illustration could be found for this general thesis than the ill-fated
          reply of Henry Clay to am Abolitionist petition presented to him on his visit to 
                  Richmond
                in October. 1842, Obviously irritated by the raising of that vexing question at that time in his
          preliminary campaign for the Presidency, Mr 
                  Clay
                neyertheless answered the petitioners in a seemingly tactful speech which his biographer Carl
          Schurz called "a masterpiece of oratorical skill."1 Near the close of
          the speech, however, the great man indulged in a disastrous bit of counselling when he advised the leader of
          the group, Hiram Mendenhall, to "Go home, and mind your won business, and leave other people to take
          care of theirs."2
            
            At the time of its utterance this statement was gleefully hailed by the crowd as a fitting rebuff to the
          petitioner and his friends. The speech in its entirety was printed throughout the nation, and the full
          significance of the incident was not realized. "But," says Schurz, "many thousands
          of Mendenhalls

              delivery and was therefore phrased to suit the personal inclinations of

                      after reflection. The less elegant and cruder rejoinder: "Go home and slop your

          by that humble 
                  Quaker
                that was to prove the absorbing question of the time, and the fatal stumbling block of the great
          orator's highest ambition."3
            
            In order to fully appreciate the importance of that occasion and its reverberations, it is necessary to reset
          the stage on which this drama was enacted. 
                  Clay
               's announcement, shortly before this incident occurred, that he intended to withdraw from
          the Senate had created a popular demand for his appearance in different sections of the country as a prelude
          to his nomination as the Whig candidate for the Presidency. Such a nomination his host of admirers considered
          a matter of justice to him, inasmuch as he had loyally supported William Henry Harrison in 1840 despite the
          defeat he had received in the Whig National Convention at the hands of the old hero of 
                  Tippecanoe
               . As a reward for his support, 
                  Clay
                naturally expected to wield considerable influence in the Harrison administration, but upon the
          President's death and the elevation of Tyler, his hopes had been frustrated as far as the Executive
          was concerned. Now was the opportunity for his party to reward him for party service and leadership.
            
               
                  Clay
               's enthusiastic supporters eagerly seized this chance to express their belief in him. The 
                  North Carolina
                Whigs anticipated the action of the national convention by bringing 
                  Clay
                forward as their choice as early as April, 1842. 
                  Georgia
                and 
                  Maine
                followed the example of 
                  North Carolina
                while the Whigs in the 
                  New York
                Legislature, a state which had abandoned the Kentuckian in 1840, sent assurances of their
          support. Despite the influence of Daniel Webster, even the Whigs of 
                  Massachusetts
                could not be restrained and they joined the procession.
            
               
                  Clay
                was not untouched by such evidences of popular support and he agreed upon a western tour which
          led him to 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , where he addressed an assemblage estimated at about 10,000 persons, on September
          27, 1842. At that meeting resolutions were passed favoring 
                  Clay
                and John Davis of 
                  Massachusetts
                as the Whig candidates for the 1844 contest.
            Meanwhile arrangements were being made for the visit of the "Old Prince," as he was
          affectionately known, to 
                  Richmond
               , Indiana. Plans for this momentous event in local history 
                  
                     3 Schurz, Henry Clay, II, 281. It is necessary to add that
              several other factors contributed to clay's slight defeat in 1844.
               
                were in charge of various committees with Samuel Hannah, D. P. Holloway,
          editor of the 
                  Richmond
               
               Palladium, Lot 
                  Bloomfield
                and James Rariden prominent among the active members.4
            
            The strong opponents of slavery were likewise busy, hoping to avail themselves of this exceptional
          opportunity to corner 
                  Clay
                and force him to express himself on the slavery question. The method they devised was the
          presentation of a petition calling upon him to free his own slaves. Whether its signers were actuated by a
          sense of political animosity or by real convictions is a matter of conjecture with a mixture of motives
          undoubtedly explaining the lengthy list of signatures. The existence of such a document seems to have been
          common knowledge, since the Palladium published an editorial as early as September 17,
          referring to it, and expressing the hope that "the committee will refrain from presenting it until
          Mr. Clay's return to his home [Ashland, at 
                  Lexington,
              Kentucky
               ], if not altogether," and in the
          event of its presentation, pleading for no violence to its framers.
            On October 1 the great orator arrived. He was met at the state line and ushered into the city of 
                  Richmond
                where he appeared in the afternoon at the rally in his honor held at the corner of what is now
          Seventh and North A Streets.5 Authorities disagree, but it seems probable that Clay
          delivered his speech, and then at its close, Mendenhall6 pressed forward to present the
          petition, meeting with opposition, but finally reaching the platform with his now historic document which he
          presented to James Rariden amid the hoots and jeers of the throng. Amid tense silence the petition was read:
            
                  To Henry Clay: We, the undersigned, citizens of Indiana, in view of the declaration of rights contained
              in the charter of American independence; in view of that justice which is due from man to his fellow men;
              and in view of those noble principles which should characterize the patriot, the philanthropist and the
              Christian; ask you, most respectfully, to unloose the heavy burdens and that you let the oppressed under
              your control, who call you ‘master’ go free. By doing so you would give liberty to
              whom liberty is due, and do no more than justice to

                  Mendenhall, he has certainly found a place in history." Calvin Colton, Ed., Life, Correspondence ad Speeches of Henry Clay. (

                      those under your charge, who have long been deprived by YOU of the
              sacred boon of freedom; and set an example that would result in much good to suffering and debased
              humanity; and do an act altogether worthy of a great and good man.
               
            
            The situation called for diplomacy and political sagacity. If 
                  Clay
                should bow to the wishes of the petitioners and intimate that he would eventually free his
          slaves, he would win thousands of adherents in the North, but he would alienate many southern Whigs, while if
          he refused the petitioners he would retain his southern friends and affront northern abolitionists. Probably
          warned that this petition would be presented long before he reached 
                  Richmond, Clay
                had his reply partially prepared.
            As the last words of the document were reached, the crowd broke out again, prompting 
                  Clay
                to begin his remarks with the hope that "Mr. Mendenhall may be treated with the greatest
          forbearance and respect."7 He continued declaring that the petition had
          elicitated no disagreeable emotion on his part and that he was glad to have it presented at a time when such a
          vast assemblage could hear it. This assertion was contradicted by a later remark when he complained that he
          did not see why the petitioners should have picked this time when they could have presented their request at
          his home at Ashland any time within the past twenty-five or thirty years. That he considered it a breach of
          hospitality and etiquette as well as a personal affront was likewise intimated by his asking Mr. Mendenhall
          how he should like to reverse conditions and have 
                  Clay
                place him in such a position were he his guest in 
                  Kentucky
               .
            Mr. Clay then attempted to justify his position by the laws of his state which permitted slavery, declaring
          that "Until the law is repealed, we must be excused for asserting the rights—aye, the
          property in slaves which it sanctions, authorizes and vindicates." He then tried to explain away the
          importance of the large numbers of petitioners, many of whom he spoke of as "worthy, amicable and
          humane persons, who by erroneous representations," had been "induced inconsiderately to
          affix their signatures to this petition," persons whom he knew would later "deeply regret
          it." Others were free blacks 
                  
                     7 The speech in full is reprinted in different works. See Swain, Life
                and Speeches of Henry Clay. II, 591 ff.; Colton, Life, Correspondence and Speeches of
                Henry Clay, VI, 385 ff.
               
                who had "been artfully deceived and imposed upon,"
          while the large portion of them, he intimated, were merely his political opponents. That he should have
          entirely ignored those among the petitioners who were entirely sincere in their desire to know his stand on
          the vital issue of slavery was a grave omission.
            Turning to the foundation of the appeal, the Declaration of Independence, he justified his position by
          stating that among the delegates who adopted that document were many from states where slavery existed and
          they certainly were not calling for its abolition by signing the Declaration. Furthermore, he expressed the
          belief that "in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or can the equality
          asserted among the members of the human race, be practically enforced and carried out." To
          demonstrate this he called attention to the fact that there would always be minors, women, insane persons,
          culprits and transient sojourners who could not be accorded equal rights. He ended this portion of his reply
          with the bold assertion that "if the doctrines of ultra political abolitionists had been seriously
          promulgated at the epoch of our Revolution, our glorious Independence would never have been
          achieved—never, never."
            As to his personal attitude towards slavery, he considered it a great evil which he deeply regretted had been
          inheritod by the people of his day. He stated that it was his wish that every slave could be sent back to his
          native country. But the evils of slavery, were, in his estimation, "nothing in comparison with the
          far greater evils which would inevitable flow from a sudden, general, and indiscriminate
          emancipation" with its attendant intermarriage and the possible subjugation of the whites by the
          blacks.
            
               
                  Clay
                then declared that his own slaves would suffer rather than benefit from emancipation inasmuch as
          some of them were incapacitated to earn their own living and were therefore a "heavy charge"
          upon their master; some were helpless infants "with or without improvident mothers," and
          still others "would not accept their freedom" if he were to offer it to them. Then the
          speaker's real feelings came to the surface and he spoke to the leader of the petitioning body,
          saying: "Excuse me, Mr. Mendenhall, for my saying that my slaves are as well fed and clad, look as
          sleek and hearty; and  are quite as civil and respectful in their
          demeanor, and as little disposed to wound the feelings of any one, as you are."
            This latter somewhat derogatory remark was linked with an obvious bid for the 
                  Quaker
                vote of the community when 
                  Clay
                recommended that Mendenhall imitate the example of the Society of Friends8
          which agreed with him in principle, but whose tactics consisted of peace and persuasion rather than blood,
          revolution and disunion. The strange coincidence in the matter was the fact that Mendenhall himself was a 
                  Quaker
               . 
                  Clay
                was anxious to correct the impression which he felt must exist in the minds of some of his
          listeners that he had no dealings with abolitionists, a fact which he vehemently denied although his friends
          among that group were not "monomaniacs who surrendering themselves to a single idea, look altogether
          to the black side of human life," ignoring the evils to be corrected among the whites.
            The great Whig leader of the occasion then attempted to retaliate against the petitioners by making his
          demands practical. He therefore asked Mendenhall if he and his friends would be willing to reimburse him in
          case he did decide to free his slaves which he evaluated at a total of some $15,000. It was a
          clever move and his strategy did not pass unnoticed by interested listeners among the crowd. In conclusion, 
                  Clay
                gave some politically unwise advice to Mendenhall suggesting that he should attend to his own
          affairs, limiting his "benevolent exertions" to his own neighborhood where he would find
          "ample scope for the exercise of [his] charities."
            "The speech was received by the crowd as a masterpiece," according to 
                  Clay
               's grandson.9 This opinion is born out by Schurz, who declares that
          "The assembled multitude was lost in admiration."10 But the sequel was
          not so favorable to 
                  Clay
               . As Professor Paxson has pointed out, this meeting was an outstanding demonstration of the fact
          that "the settlers whom the North contributed to the Old Northwest were refusing to mix with those
          who derived their ideals from the South."11
            
            Thus the Great Compromiser seemed to meet the situation successfully for the time being, but within a few
          weeks

            The Discovery and Identification of an Original Copy of the Constitution of 1816∗
            
            By CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN
            
            On December 11, 1815, the territorial Legislature of Indiana petitioned for admission into the Union. On
          December 11, 1816, the President approved the bill which made Indiana the nineteenth state. The most important
          step in the whole process was the holding of a Constitutional Convention at Corydon in June, 1816, and the
          framing of a state constitution. As the convention finished its work, it directed the making of official
          copies of the constitution in the following resolution: 
                  Resolved, that there shall be two complete copies of the Constitution of Indiana, one of which shall be
              lodged with the president of the convention, to be kept by him until the meeting of the first general
              assembly, at which time the constitution shall be laid before them, and to be disposed of in such manner
              as they may direct.1
                  
               
            
            Thus the convention ordered two copies to be written out, one of which was to be given to the President of
          the Convention, Jonathan Jennings. At the first session of the General Assembly the President of the
          Convention, who, as it happened, became also the first governor, was to give the copy entrusted to him to the
          General Assembly. On November 11, 1816, the Governor delivered the copy of the Constitution in his possession
          to the State Senate, which copy was deposited with the Secretary of State.2
            
            The Constitutional Convention did not provide for the disposal of the other copy, and the writer has found no
          direct reference to it except in the Journals of the House and Senate for the session of
            1826-27.3 In that session the Speaker laid before the House the following communication
          which he had received from William W. Wick, then Secretary of State: 
                  Herewith is transmitted, for inspection of the House of Representatives, one of the original duplicates
              of the constitution of this state, and of the ordinance adopted by the people thereof, in convention,
              handsomely bound in morocco and gilt.

              well by the future antiquarian, as by a grateful posterity. Viewing the subject in this light, I have, as
              a small tribute of respect for, and gratitude towards the people and government of my adopted state, used
              this means of preserving from injury and decay, the original evidences of the independence of our state,
              and they are respectfully presented to the view of each branch of the Legislature, under the impression
              that their preservation is interesting to all the representatives of the people, and especially to those
              who were members of the body who originated them.4
                  
               
            
            A reasonable inference from these letters of Secretary of State Wick is that both of the original official
          manuscripts had been brought from Corydon to 
                  Indianapolis
                in 1826, when the capital had been moved, that they were both in his possession in 1826, and that
          he had caused both of them to be "handsomely bound in morocco and gilt." He apparently
          showed one of them to the Senate and the other to the House.
            There is now in the office of the Secretary of State at 
                  Indianapolis
                only one manuscript copy of the Constitution of 1816. It presumably is the copy ordered by the
          Convention to be given to Jonathan Jennings and by him given to the Senate, and by the Senate in turn given to
          the Secretary of State. The history of the other copy, save for the pride of Mr. Wick in both copies recorded
          in the Journals, is wholly lost in darkness.
            However, the provision which the convention made for printing the Constitution leads one to wonder whether
          the second copy was not used for that purpose. It providently recommended "to the early attention of
          the first General Assembly of the State of Indiana, the necessity of making an appropriation to pay for the
          printing of the Journals of the Convention and the Constitution of the state.5 It further
          provided "that the committee appointed to contract for printing the Constitution
          and Journals of this convention, be authorized to have them, when printed stitched and
          forwarded to the several counties," specifying that eleven copies should be given to each member of
          the convention, and two copies to each of the secretaries.6 It also directed the president
          of the Convention to forward one printed copy of the Constitution to the President of the 
                  United States
               , one to the President of the 
                  
                     4 See ibid. The same communication, mutatis
                mutandis, under the same date, was laid before the Senate.

                Senate, and one to the Speaker of the 
                  United States
                House of Representatives.7
            
            James Lenon and Robert A. New were appointed a committee to superintend the printing of the Constitution,
          with instructions to report to the first General Assembly.8 This committee reported to the
          House of Representatives, at its first session, on December 28,1816,9 and the General
          Assembly appropriated two hundred dollars for printing and stitching the Constitution and
            Journals.
               10
            
            Three different printings of the Constitution dated 1816 are known: one printed in 
                  Louisville, Kentucky
               , by 
                  Butler
                and Wood; one printed in 
                  Washington
               , D. C., by William A. Davis by order of the House of Representatives of the 
                  United States
               ; and one printed by Elihu Stout at 
                  Vincennes
               . All are excessively rare items today among book dealers. The first of the three is undoubtedly
          the one contracted for by the committee appointed by the Convention for that purpose, for the first General
          Assembly of the State appropriated two hundred dollars to pay Mann 
                  Butler
                for printing the Journals and the Constitution. The reprints
          of the Constitution in the volume entitled Acts of 1819 and in the Revision of 1824, though differing in numerous minutiae from these 1816 editions, seem to belong to the
          same "family."
            As one of the official copies of the Constitution was given to Jennings, it seems likely that the other was
          used by the committee appointed to supervise the printing of it. Whether this was the case or not, both copies
          were in the possession of William W. Wick, Secretary of State, in 1826. One has been retained in the office of
          the Secretary of State ever since and the other disappeared at some time earlier than the memory of anyone
          known by the author. There is, to be sure, a tradition, but no direct evidence, that it was in the 
                  Harrison County
                Courthouse at Corydon, the old State House, about thirty or forty years ago. Since it was in 
                  Indianapolis
                in 1826, there seems to be little probability of its reappearance at Corydon later.
            This missing copy of the enrolled Constitution of 1816 turned up in 1932 in the hands of a dealer in
          historical manuscripts. It was eventually purchased by the Indiana Historical

                Society for the William Henry Smith Memorial Library, bequeathed to the
          Society by the late Delavan Smith. A comparison of it with the copy in the office of the Secretary of State
          left no doubt of its authenticity. Materials, general characteristics of the handwriting, binding, and
          signatures of the delegates and officers of the Convention are practically identical. Both documents contain
          the same material, including preliminary matter as well as the Constitution itself.
            The two manuscripts, however, show interesting variations. Capitalization agrees as consistently as could be
          expected. In manuscripts of that time and place it is often difficult and sometimes impossible, to tell
          whether a letter is capitalized or not. There appear to be differences in capitalization in a number of words,
          but the two manuscripts do not differ in this respect from each other more than each scribe differed in the
          capitalization of the same word in different places.
            Punctuation in Indiana in those days was a most inexact, not to say inexplicable art. Commas and dashes came
          so thick and fast that they actually interrupted the sense. It is only natural that punctuation marks and
          marks which look like punctuation marks, but may not have been, differ throughout the two manuscripts. Such
          differences, of course, must be ignored.
            The mistakes existing in the official copy of Indiana's first state constitution in the office of
          the Secretary of State are a reflection on the care in matters of detail exercised by the Constitutional
          Convention. On page one, in the Preamble, that copy reads "one thousand thousand seven hundred and
          eighty-seven," instead of "one thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven." Either the
          word "any" was erroneously later inserted in the Secretary of State's manuscript in
          Article III, Section 14 ("guilty of any disrespect") or it was erroneously omitted from the
          recovered copy. "In extraordinary occasions" in Article IV, section 13, in the former
          manuscript, is "on extraordinary occasions" in the latter; "the army of the 
                  United States
               " in Article VII, section I, reads "the armies of the 
                  United States
               "; "they arrive," in Article VII, section 9, reads "they shall
          arrive"; and "humanity, honesty, industry and morality," in Article IX in the
          Secretary of State's copy reads "humanity, industry and morality" in the recovered
          copy. On the whole, the copy recovered by the Historical Society seems  to
          have somewhat fewer mistakes than the copy of the Secretary of State, but the advantage is not very great.
            The supposition that the copy recently obtained by the Historical Society was the copy used by the committee
          appointed by the Convention to supervise the printing of the Constitution is supported by the fact that the
          early printed copies follow it more closely than they do the other copy; follow it, that is, in most cases in
          which it differs from the other copy. Careful editors of later reprints have followed, as they should, the
          copy now in the office of the Secretary of State.
            It is possible, of course, that this last mentioned copy is not the one which the Constitutional Convention
          entrusted to Jonathan Jennings, which he transmitted to the Senate, and the custody of which the Senate in
          turn gave to the Secretary of State. Jennings himself may have furnished the copy for the printers who turned
          out the first printed edition of the Constitution. What was done with the other copy before Secretary of State
          Wick had both duplicates bound and shown, one to one branch of the General Assembly and one to the other
          branch, does not appear in the record. It is only a surmise that it was used by the committee on printing. All
          that is known is that it also was in the possession of Secretary of State Wick, in 1826, and was bound by him,
          like the other copy, "in morocco and gilt."
            There is justification for the belief that the copy which at some later date was allowed to pass out of the
          office of the Secretary of State was the one used in making the first printed copies. It is not stated
          positively whether it was the copy governed by the explicit direction of the Convention, or the copy about
          which the Convention was silent. If the former, the writer supposes the manuscript copy of the Constitution of
          1816 now in the office of the Secretary of State, became the official, authoritative copy only from the time
          the other copy (now in the State Library) disappeared. If the latter, it was the official copy from the
          beginning.

            Indiana Historical Society
            By CHRISTOPHER B. COLEMAN
            
            The Indiana Historical Society plans to have a local representative in every county of the state. The work of
          this representative will be to nominate persons for membership, to serve as a reference for questions that may
          arise in relation to his county and to make suggestions to the executive committee of the Indiana Historical
          Society for the general good of the Society. He will be expected to serve as the agency of cooperation, so far
          as possible, between the state and local historical society.
            With the possible exception of one or two years, the state Society has never reached the point of having each
          of the ninety-two counties of Indiana represented in its membership. It is now making a special effort to
          attain this goal. In several counties in which there are members, no one has, as yet, accepted the position of
          representative of the state Society. The plan, therefore, has not been fully worked out.

            The latest publication of the Historical Society is Early Architects and Builders of
          Indiana by Lee Burns, Volume XI, Number 3 of the Publications. Mr. Burns'
          article gives short sketches of the most important of the early architects and builders of the state, such as
          Francis Costigan and William Tinsley. He has brought new light to a number of pieces of information, and many
          readers of the article will doubtless find in it corrections of the versions they have accepted about the
          construction of some of the buildings of the state. The publication is illustrated by views of a number of
          typical buildings while details of certain features of others are presented.
         
         
         
            History Teachers' Forum: THE TRODDEN PATH
            By OLD-TIMER
            
            Years ago there was a path through the woods-pasture that many people used as a short cut to the main road
          that led on to the village. It was a gently winding path. There was a crude stile that enabled one to get over
          the rail fence at the edge of the pasture, and, close to the fence where the path started, stood a large
          white-oak. A few rods ahead as one passed along, there was a large granite boulder on the left. It was not a
          "granite boulder" to those who went that way— it was just "the big
          rock." Farther on, the line of travel took one around to the right of a fine clump of wild
          rose-bushes. Close by there was a lower area that did not drain well. Most of the year, this shallow basin was
          partly filled with water. Whether hurrying through or sauntering leisurely along, it did not matter, the path
          safely skirted the marshy sod or the mud at the outer rim of the pond. Just beyond there was a big, decaying
          walnut stump where a few years earlier had stood a splendid tree. A hundred paces on and not far from the old
          highway laid out by pioneers, stood the only evergreen among the three score of trees scattered over the
          thirty-acre tract. Passing this, one came at last to the "bars" guarding the opening into
          the public road. One could climb over, or slip back and let down "bars" two and three from
          the bottom, stoop over and step through or creep through to the outside. Before taking to the broad highway,
          by the unrecorded rules, the opening in the fence must be closed. It was almost a crime to leave the
          "bars" down.
            To anyone who was accustomed to follow that well-marked path across the old woods-pasture, one way or the
          other, it became a friendly, helpful feature of life. Every curve, each gentle incline up or down and all the
          objects on either side turned into familiar guides that directed the footsteps aright. A good many people who,
          coming and going, passed that way years ago can still picture the beaten pathway across the enclosed tract
          from stile to "bars" or "bars" to stile, and would now find real pleasure
          going over it again.
            Having taught history to many classes through a long period of years, Old Timer feels that any course in
          history  should stand out to both teacher and learner somewhat as the old
          woods-pasture with a familiar pathway across it. There would be some curves of course, some hill slopes, and
          some things presenting more or less distracting or difficult problems, but the clear pathway with its familiar
          events, their relations to each other and their order along the line of advance should always be there. Only
          the teacher of history who can readily follow and who loves to follow the highway through the history of any
          country or period can reveal it to the students in his classes. When the end of the semester or the year
          comes, students who cannot feel at home as they look forward or backward through the events which they have
          examined, analyzed and related to each other have really failed.
            The teacher of history who cannot, at any point in the course, be it Roman, Medieval, Modern, English or
          American history, place himself on any part of the pathway and go forward or backward with sure steps is
          poorly prepared for his work. Even the college or university professor who rightly prides himself on his skill
          in historical criticism, dares not lose sight of the need to make plain the pathway through the period. After
          all, research and historical criticism are not ends in themselves, but means to be used in reaching an
          understanding of the events, the actors in, and the movements of history.
            Old Timer does not believe that any teacher of history Should—
            Allow the text-book to control his teaching too completely.
            Allow a long series of interesting class discussions of current problems to usurp most of the time that
          should be devoted to the teaching of history.
            Allow himself to become a purveyor of propaganda for any self-seeking element of the country.
            Allow himself to use his power and influence over his classes to indoctrinate them with all the beliefs that
          he has himself accepted.
            Allow himself to think that he is too busy to read newspapers and magazines that deal with the questions of
          the day.
            
            Allow himself to think that he has no time to read anything in addition to the text in larger histories,
          biographies, and source books.
            Allow himself to remain ignorant of historical geography and still believe that he is teaching history.
            Allow himself to believe that sets of true-false examination questions prepared by some one else are the only
          questions that he needs to use on his classes.
            Allow himself to think that he knows how well or how poorly his students are doing their work without giving
          adequate tests and carefully grading the papers.

            SOME LETTERS
               OF JESSE D. BRIGHT
               TO WILLIAM H. ENGLISH (1842-1863)
            The political career of Jesse David Bright, a powerful Democratic leader of Indiana in his day, is full of
          interest. He was elected to the Senate of the 
                  United States
                in 1845, and while a member of that body, this able politician of 
                  Madison
               , became the boss of his party in Indiana. He loved his friends and served them generously. He
          hated his enemies with intensity and fought them vigorously. In regard to the slavery question he was a
          conservative. In the pre-convention contest of 1856, the Senator threw his support to Buchanan, and, through
          his power over the Indiana Democracy, did more to bring about the defeat of Douglas and the nomination of the
          Pennsylvanian, than any other leader in the party. In January, 1860, the Democrats of Indiana staged a
          successful revolt against Senator Bright in their State Convention. His expulsion from the Senate came in
          February 1862. The next year, though Democrats controlled the Indiana Legislature on joint-ballot, they
          refused to vindicate Bright by returning him to the senate. Instead, a younger man who had been one of the
          leaders in the revolt of 1860 was chosen—David Turpie. Soon after this, Jesse D. Bright took up his
          residence in 
                  Kentucky
               , where he served two terms in the state Legislature. He died in 1876.
            The recipient of the Bright letters printed below, was William H. English (1822-1896), who was born in 
                  Lexington
               , Scott County, Indiana, where he lived until 1863. He served as a member of the constitutional
          convention of 1850, and as a member of the Indiana Legislature. He was a Representative in the national House
          for four terms (1853-1861). During the Civil War he moved to 
                  Indianapolis
               , where he was one of the founders of the First National Bank. He served as president of the
          institution until 1877. He wrote a two-volume history, The Conquest of the Country Northwest of
            the Ohio River and Life of George Rogers Clark. This work was published in 1896,
          the year of the author's death.
            The originals of the letters here reproduced are in the Smith Memorial Library at 
                  Indianapolis
               , and it is through  the kindness of Miss Florence Venn, who
          is in charge of the Smith Library, that they are published at this time.

                        Dr Sir
                        I owe you with other of my Democratick2 Friends in Scott [County] an apology for
                  not attending your Court & addressing the People. There is but one thing that could have
                  occured to prevent my so doing, & that very thing did occur. Sickness. One
                  of my children has been dangerously ill for the last 2 weeks, so much so that I have not left my House
                  2 Hours at a time. I feel that I have been guilty of disappointing my Friends, (a thing by the way I
                  seldom do) but hope under the circumstances I will be excused. I shall attend our Congressional
                  Convention in May at your Town3

                  at the Whig Convention & as I will be at our Congressional Convention on the 1st Saturday in
                  May & address the People, you with other Friends will hear from me on this head. I am truly
                  glad to find that you take such a deep interest

                        My dear Sir
                        I herewith Enclose you Letter of Mr. Edwards—-caviling & special pleading over
                  your claim in behalf of Hannah Berry Widow &c.7 I suppose you can meet and
                  overcome the objections he raises.
                        I enclose you a letter from Mr. Henly. I presume he is under the impression you are in this City. I
                  am sorry there should be any misunderstanding between you & him; and cannot doubt, mutual
                  explanation will restore former friendly relations. I will not permit myself to doubt this.
                        You have been, of mutual Service to each other, and may often be again.
                        He has drawn an order in my favour for the assets in your hands, and asks me to make a satisfactory
                  arrangement with you as to his indebtedness. This I will do if you require it, when we meet, which I
                  hope will not be later than the last of this month. Meantime, write and let me Know. what you require

                  at 12 Oclk, and from day to day thereafter, until disposed of. There are many conflicting opinions as
                  to the fate of these measures. The Administration is doing all in there power, to push them through.
                    Extremes, unite in the House, as they did in the Senate, but my own opinion is
                  they will all pass.

                        Yours of the 10th is recd. I know your feeling toward me to[o] well to believe all the falsehoods
                  that enemies can circulate will alienate your feelings. I have used no such language as you say is
                  attributed to me. I shall be out soon when we will confer on many matters face to face.

                        My young friend
                        Yours of the 16th Inst is recd. also enclosure relative to the claim of Hannah Berry.
                        Edwards has been removed and Heath8 of 
                              Virginia
                            appointed in his stead. I find the impression here is that Heath will open the door wide
                  and let in scores of claims, heretofore rejected by Edwards. I am afraid of it, but yours I believe a
                  just claim & I shall seek an Early opertunity to bring the matter before Heath and ask a
                  favorable decission. My correspondence will occupy most of my time [from] now on until the Senatorial
                  Election is over. You say Jo Wright9 is a Candidate. This I have believed would be
                  the case ever since Gov. Crittenden10 was invited to our
                  State—notwithstanding Joseph has been saying all the time, up to my coming away, that he
                  was not, & would not be. He has acted unfairly and shows in several matters that will disclose
                  themselves, that He is a Trickster. An open and manly competitor I respect & esteem, but one
                  of these subterannean operators, "God deliver me from." I want you English to confer
                  freely with my Partner Jo. Chapman & have Elisha G11 do the same. He
                  (Chapman) will put you and your Father in possession of some facts I have collected here, and I should
                  be glad to have your Father give Joseph his special attention

                  commenced working there machinery against me. I know you will leave nothing undone to counteract their
                  movements. Give my kind regards to your father. I have not bored him with letters & I need not
                  advise him, because he knows instinctively what is right & how to help his
                  friends. I wish you & him would both write me often

                  Major & yourself came up. I am more than anxious to see you before my departure, which will be
                  on Tuesday next. If any thing prevents your coming, I shall take advantage of your friendly letter and
                  confer with you and the Major13 by letter freely. Come up on Sunday if possible.
                  Lane will be here on Monday perhaps Sunday.

                        I have received yours of——14 date and should have answered
                  it ere this, but have been very busy, and withall, not very well. You know how to
                  excuse me, for delays in such matters.
                        I am very sorry to hear of the collission [sic] between you and Doct Davis,15 and
                  I beg you reconcile differences, unless you feel your honor has been assailed, and
                  even then, I mistake Doct Davis, if he is not ready and willing, at all times, to meet a political
                  friend, more than half way.
                        It is unnecessary for me to say a word to you in reference to the Approaching Convention. You instinctively know my views & feelings, and I think know me well enough to
                  bear testimony to my devotion to the true men and measures of our
                  Party, but there are some things I do not wish to be asked to do, and that I do not wish to see

                      House, 1846-1847. Both Davis and English were members of the lower branch of the Indiana
                      Legislature in the first session after the new constitution went Into effect. They were both
                      candidates for the speakership. Davis won, and a temporary enmity arose.
                           
                            of voters in the 2d Congressional District asked to do, &
                  that is swallow such a dose as Jos A Wright & Dr. Ellis at our October Elections in 1852. For Heavens sake English, 'do all in your power to save me, and those
                  of our Party who know these Creatures, as well as you and I do; from passing such an ordeal. I know
                  your devotion to Party and Democratic principles, and well do I know, and appreciate your friendship
                  for me, and I beg you, to let no temporary jar between Doct Davis & yourself, drive you from
                  his support. He can beat Wright for the Nomination16 if the sound Democrats of the
                  Party will take hold of him. But this matter I need not argue to you, do as you think right, and as a
                  sense of public duty prompts, and I shall acquiesce. Let me warn you, a young and growing man
                  & one I love and esteem, not to form any combinations with any interests to alter our
                  Congressional Districts, and above all beware of that mass of moral putrifaction Ellis, & his

                  what you intend to do, or try to do, in these matters. Who will be our candidates for State Officers?
                        You will see from a Paper I sent you that I moved in the Senate in reference to Offices, and I now
                  tell you, I intend to keep moving, until, I move you where you deserve to be, at any rate until we
                  restore the old rule, and come back to "bienal" [biennial] elections and then you
                  can take your chance.

                        Nothing occrd since I wrote last week. The first move in Senatorial matters comes off tomorrow night.
                  Then our friends are to determine when they will make nominations, if at all, before an Election is
                  ordered by the two Houses. I am putting forth all my power to bring about the right nominations, and
                  if this is done, I shall try very hard to bring on this Election. Many of our friends here think this
                  cannot be done. The Abolition[ists] swear it never shall be unless they get one of the Senators
                  & this we swear never shall be.
                        By Thursday or Friday next, I think I can give you some definite information as to the probable
                  result. Slack18 I understand declines

                      under the new constitution of 1850-1861. He was nominated and elected in 1862, and served the
                      first four-year term under the new constitution.

                  when the "People" are jurors. The set of Creatures you mention, are on the surface
                  now, only because, they have not been properly attended to. Time with the aid of a few such open

                  will remedy, what you now appear to regard as permanent evils. Although I am not in the same District
                  with your Father, I am not so far away, that I shall ever forget his friendship for me, or refuse to
                  come up, with zeal, to any work he may call for me in his behalf. I would rather have had Scott23 with us, but on the

                      not long before Davis clashed with the members of the house and resigned. Then English was chosen

                        Come to the Convention if possible, we need Delegates from Ind who feel and act upon the great questions of the times as you do. If however, you
                    cannot come, send me a letter, asking me to act in your stead. This will be
                  ratified I know by the other Delegates, and I feel quite sure would be acceptable to the great body of
                  our Party. We have strong hopes for Lane.25 Genl Cass however is greatly stronger
                  than any other man.
                        Can he ever get 2/3. Regard this as Confidential.

                        W H English Esq.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Senate Chamber U S.
                           
                           Aug. 22, 1852.
                        
                        My young friend,
                        Yours of the 6th inst. advising me of your nomination for Congress, from the 2 District, is received.
                  Judging the future, by the past, there is nothing you undertake, that you will not do. Hence, I
                  consider your election a "fixed fact," and such a result will do no man, more good,
                  than my self, not even your honored father. I hope to be able to accept 
                              
                                 24 Michael Graham Bright.
                              
                                 25 General Joseph lane.
                           
                            your invitation, to speak at the points, named in your letter,
                  but whether I can, depends upon the time I get home and the state of my health. I am far from being
                  well, and could not now, undergo, the fatigue of an extended canvass. I am in the daily receipt of
                  letters, inviting me to speak at different points, in and out of our state, most of which, thus far, I
                  have had to decline. I intend to return home by the White Sulphur Springs, and may, if I find that I
                  derive any benefit, from the use of water, remain there ten or twelve days, in which event, I would
                  not reach home before the 20th of September. I am very anxious to be there, in time to take part, in
                  the Presidential and Congressional canvasses. Though I must be permitted to say, that I believe Pierce
                  and King, will distance the track, without much grooming. I have, and shall continue, to send you,
                  such documents as I think will benefit you in the canvass. Bear in mind, the old
                  maxim—"Continual Dropping will wear a stone." Adopting this motto, and
                  working up to it, I believe you can be elected by one thousand majority. With my kind regards to your
                  own, your father and family, I remain,
                        
                           Truly Yours,
                           Jesse D Bright
                        
                        W. H. English Esq. P. S. By a resolution, lately introduced in the Senate, by Mr.
                    Merriwether,26 of 
                              Kentucky
                           , calling for the amount of money, received by Gen Pierce and Gen Scott, out of the
                  National Treasury. We expect to obtain the information, you desire. So soon as I receive it, it shall
                  he forwarded to you.

                        My young friend—
                        Yours of the 11th Inst is received. I have been for the last four weeks, most of my time in 
                              Boston
                            N Y & Phila. discharging my duty as a member of the come., elected by the Senate
                  to investigate frauds, alledged to be perpetrating on the revenue laws of the U. S. Consequently have
                  to neglect my correspondence. Had I not received yours of above date I should have written. You have
                  anticipated many matters I intended to write about, of interest to us both. By the way I have often
                  said "you were about the only one of my friends that always took the same view of things that
                  I did, always right instinctively, and never failed in whatever you undertook. I
                  will reply to your letter briefly & in the order you introduced the topicks. I take it for
                  granted that what I write you is a sealed book from every man woman & child on earth except
                  your father. I have no secrets as to him. You ask me who ought to be Senator in
                  place of Gov Whitcomb. I answer Doct 
                              
                                 26 David Meriwether, Senator from 
                                    Kentucky
                                  by appointment for the session of 1861-1862.
                              
                                 27 The original letter of this date is not in the collection, but a copy
                      in long-hand marked "Literal copy" in included.
                           
                            Fitch or Charley Cathcart.28 Fitch's
                  geographical position is eligible, and above all he is a true democrat, a gentleman, a man of superior
                  talents, your friend, & my friend. The Lord deliver me from the painful
                  operation of sitting with Jos A Wright, Jno Pettit, Willis [?] A Gorman or Bill 
                              Brown
                            as Colleagues.29 They want all the qualities that I have ascribed to
                  Doct Fitch, and in addition, are my personal enemies, unless it is Pettit. Cathcart is a good man
                  & a man of Talents. I beg you to give this matter your attentions. It is all important to me,
                  and whatever affects me affects you & whatever you politically[,] affects me. I hope that on
                  the receipt of this you will write me what you intend to do. Doct Fitch is expecting your
                    aid. He will write you.
                        As to a seat in the Cabinet of Genl Pierce—I tell you in all frankness & candour,
                  I do not desire it. I would for a hundred reasons, rather remain in the U S Senate. This is now the
                  extent of my ambition. To all of my friends who have spoken to me on this subject (and they have been
                  many in every direction) I have held the same language. I desire no office, but the one I
                    have, this I do desire to hold another Term and you are the only person I have said so to.
                        Gov Whitcomb's brother the Rev. David Whitcomb is now here inventorying the Gov's
                    effects.30 I want to see you very much in reference to that stock you hold. Can
                  you not come on and spend a week or 10 days in December. I wish to God you could, we would then talk
                  matters over. I must see you before the senatorial election comes off & we must by the 11
                  March close the matter above refered to. Then I will talk to you about my little favor. Write
                  & say when you will come. It must be before the Legislature meets. My kind regards to your
                  father. After you have read this hastily written scroll please remail it to me.
                  Latterly, I am afraid of letters out.

                        I have been anxiously awaiting an answer to my letter of week before last, informing me you would
                  come on here in time to return before the Legislature meets.
                        
                           You must come, I must see you. You are the man that can work out an important political
                    problem. Important to you & myself & our

                                       Logansport
                                     was elected 
                                       United States
                                     Senator from Indiana in 1867. He was a member of the national House from his
                        district from 1849-1863. Charles W. Cathcart, was appointed to serve in the 
                                       United States
                                     Senate in 1862 on the death of James Whitcomb. He served until the Legislature
                        could act in 1863.
                                 
                                    29 John Pettit was the successful candidate before the Indiana
                        Legislature in 1863, and served until March 4, 1866, that is to the end of Whitcomb's
                        term. William A. Gorman was at this time a member of the national House, 1849-1863. William J.

                                    ) was the editor of the Indiana Sentinel, and a member of the
                        national House, 1843-46 and 1849-61. In December, 1849, during the intense and extended contest
                        over the speakership, Brown came within one vote of election. Very probably he would have been
                        elected but for the discovery by southerners that he was receiving Free Soil votes. Wright,
                        Pettit, Gorman, and 
                                       Brown
                                     were all members of the Democratic party, as was Senator Bright.
                                 
                                    30 James Whitcomb, Governor of Indiana for two terms. 1843-1849, was
                        elected Senator In 1847. He died in 
                                       New York City
                                     on October 4, 1862.
                              
                               Friends. I can say to you, that which I know you will
                  execute and it is only by seeing you, face to face, that I can hope to make matters understood.
                        If you can spare time, let nothing else prevent. Telegraph me whether you will
                  come.

                        My Young friend
                        Yours of the 16th Inst is received. I am greatly disappointed at the defeat of our mutual friend Doct
                  Fitch, and if one half the men for him, had done there duty, half as well as you & I, the
                  result would have been different. I am disappointed nay mortified, but not the least discouraged.
                  Honesty will prevail of [over] dishonesty in poloticks as in every other relation of life. The late
                  result is but a partial & temporary triumph. I have not time this morning (with over 300
                  letters before me for answers) to enter into details, but I will before long try and take time to go
                  into matters more fully. As to you having impaired yourself for the
                  future—Nonsens—You have made friends, as every man does, by advocating the right
                  & denouncing the wrong.
                        As matters have turned out, I dismiss the Cabinet from my mind. Nothing could now tempt me to resign
                  my place in the Senate, this would be suicidal to both myself (& friends.
                        I have marked down the names you gave me, & with pour aid & a list
                  of others I have in my eye, that I recognize as true friends, we will prepare for
                  the future & prove to the world "that we met them [at] Phillipi." I am
                  distinctly against any negotiations with Bill 
                              Brown
                           .31 I bid him defiance. I would not contribute a
                  Dime toward purchasing him out he will find his level soon & have to sell out or be driven
                  out.
                        With Petit I shall have little or nothing to do. I do not recognize him as a gentleman or as my
                  friend, and this you know, is enough to determine my rule of action.32
                        
                        Set your House in order we are to have War, but it will be a short one.33 Such
                  creatures as Jo Wright, Bill 
                              Brown
                           , Jim Lane & there tools, cannot prevail against honest men. Nothing definite
                  about the Cabinet yet. Write often even if I do not answer.

                        I know you have a right to complain of my inattention to your letter of the 29th ultimo, but as God
                  is my judge, I have not had time since you left here to read my letters, much less
                  to answer them. I have been going to and fro—here &
                  there—for friends who are either here in person, or have been here, and those who would
                  write me; but I will not enter upon what I have done, or am doing, for that would fill a Book. Leave
                  all this until we meet, and then if it is not refered to, there will be nothing lost. Office, Office,
                  Office, Office Seekers, Office Seekers, Office Seekers, how these words ring in my ears, You &
                  Fitch have escaped that kind of wrath and persecution described in divine revelation by going home,
                  however, I am not discussing the points I set down to notice.
                        I wish I could make a trip West with the Major & yourself, but I cannot get off before the
                  1st or 10 of June and of course you must start sooner if you intend to attend the 
                              Kansas
                            Land sales.
                        I hope and suppose there is no doubt but that I will get home before you come, and if so, will of
                  course see you. Your information as to my having urged any particular man for a Cabinet appointment
                  from Indiana, After Mr Buchanan reached 
                              Washington
                            is an entire mistake. I was asked to do so and declined for reasons entirely satisfactory
                  to myself. Perhaps I ought to say that I presume I could have formed a part of Mr Buchanans Cabinet
                  any time before his inaugeration but this I told you on one occasion was a matter that I did not want
                  to talk about. It has annoyed me beyond measure, and I will repeat to you, that there is no
                  respectable office in the U S. that I would not rather take than a Cabinet place, and I think the men
                  who now have them reason somewhat as I do.

                        Yours of yesterday is received. I: am very much obliged to you for your pressing invitation to make
                  you a visit, but my dear friend there is no rest for me, I have been sick for the last 5 weeks (until
                  within the last 10 days), and in this way have fallen so far behind with my business and
                  correspondence that I have almost despaired of ever catching up, but still I must try. I shall go Home
                  to morrow, and hope to see you sometime soon—indeed I intend to try this fall to spend a
                  day at 
                              Lexington
                           , mainly to visit you & the Major but I hope to see you sooner than this can be.
                        Everything looks well for our Party in this State. A few Traitors have been trying to raise some
                  excitement but their efforts have proven a dead failure. In short, the Wright
                  & Co concern have failed, and in the absence of their cowardly leader, the other partners have
                  gone into  liquidation. But more on this head when we meet. I know now who turned Sam English out, the very man I believed done it on my first
                  hearing it. H——[?] Cobb36 I presume wrote you fully and
                  freely on the subject. He told me he would.
                        I am for encouraging your Uncle to expose the hypocrisy & double dealing of one man toward
                  him.

                  adhere to your determination in reference to the Amendment, that I feel sure the Senate will agree to.
                        I should call and see you to night, but I have an engagement to dine with Gov. Floyd38 this evening therefore I cannot hope to see you before your speech goes to press, and allow
                  me to appeal to you again, to conform as near as you can, to the views of the great democratic party,
                  which is now assailed fiercely enough, God knows, by its ancient enemies

                  36 Samuel English was evidently a brother of Major Elisha G. English, the father of
            William H. English. Howell Cobb of 
                     Georgia
                   was Secretary of the Treasury under President Buchanan. Perhaps he was the person referred to
            in this letter. The name as written begins with H, but bears no resemblence to Howell. If not Howell Cobb, the man mentioned must have been a politician or newspaper man
            who knew both Bright and English.

                  an Original true friend of this Administration, and that his selection would be personally acceptable to you. Enclose me the letter to

                        I need not go into explanations. You know why I have not met you before, and agreed upon a plan of
                  operation, as to how we are to proceed to close matters with Dunham.40 I will come
                  up to 
                              Lexington
                            one day this week, if I am able to go, provided you will not come down
                  here. But as much as I wish to go up and visit you and the Major, and attend to a little business at 
                              Lexington
                           , I am almost afraid to try it. I am 88 stiff as a foundered Horse, when I am down it is
                  with the greatest difficulty I rise, and hence I say that I would rather meet you in 
                                 Jeffersonville
                               on Thursday or Friday next, and agree upon a line of policy. I agree with you,
                  that whatever is done, should be done before we go East. Please let me hear from you by return mail

                        I was sorry you could not find time to write me before I left my farm. You discover, that the threats
                  of the assassins of character in the West, who have been pursuing me in their licentious sheets
                  because I will not adopt there opinions, and allow them to control my action, did not prevent me from
                  exercising all the rights of a citizen & Senator. I am here, with a stout heart & pure
                  conscience and yet dare do what I think right. There is not power on earth to make an Abolitionist out
                  of me. The Presidents Message42 is a more conservative paper than was generally
                  expected from him. The radicals are not at all pleased with its tone, while the more conservative
                  practical minded men here think it means the cold shoulder to the Fire & Sword branch of the
                  Republican party.
                        I confess I do not know what it looks to, as yet I see no green spot in the distant future.
                        There is some talk I understand of their expelling me on account of my known disloyalty. Let is come,
                  I have got so that I believe nothing I read and am not surprised at anything that takes place.
                        However I did not intend writing about politicks but rather about business, and what I say in this
                  respect is confidential. My brother M G B is hard up for some funds and I suppose
                  (as usual) I have got!o help him.43 I want you to tell me candidly what you think
                  I may rely upon this Winter and Spring from the Dunham fund, this is all, I do not want to borrow, but
                  to collect all possible. See how much you can get for my little Farm in the terms you and the Major
                  are selling your bonds at, and write me. I am very anxious to sell, and want you to find a purchaser
                  for me, when it does not interfere with your sales.
                        Please see that my Taxes are paid & collect enough rent to do it with.
                        My kind regards to your good Lady, Father & family

                        My dear friend
                        On rereading your letter of the 26th Inst. I have thought best to drop you this line to 
                              Indianapolis
                            in reference to the enquiry you make about Banking operations lest it may not be in time,
                  if I delay to meet you at 
                              Lexington
                            as proposed in my letter of this morning.
                        If you decide to go into the Branch [Bank] at 
                              Jeffersonville
                           , and 
                              
                                 42 The reference is to the last annual message of President Buchanan.
                              
                                 43 Michael G. Bright deserved help from his brother, the Senator, when he
                      asked for it, so it would seem. A citizen of 
                                    Madison
                                 , Indiana who knew the brothers well wrote: "No one knows how much his
                      brother Jesse was indebted to him [Wichael G.] for his successful political career. He was his
                      brother's mentor and counselor. All his movements on the political chess-board were to
                      check the king of his brother's antagonist." (William Wesley Woolen, Biographical awl Historical Sketches of Early Indiana, 453). Both Senator Bright
                      and his brother Michael G. became quite wealthy.
                           
                           
                           give your sole personal attention to the transaction of the business, I will put in
                  Twenty five Thousand Dollars cash, and if the thing bids fair to work smooth, I would go Fifty
                  Thousand.
                        I have sent notes refered to in former letter with the memoranda of M S Bright.44

                        Yours from 
                              Indianapolis
                            is received. I am on my way to 
                              Washington
                            to join my family, who I find from letters & dispatches are very much concerned
                  over the present condition of affairs. I shall be there for the next 8 or 10 days, will write you as
                  soon as I get there and look around a few hours.
                        The news from 
                              Charleston
                            will deter you from coming to any conclusion at present. If you determine however to
                  launch the Bank project come "Peace" or come "War" you will have
                  to go to N Y, and in that event come via

                        I send by this mail a letter intended for Dunhams eye. Send it to him if you choose.
                        I ought to have answered yours of the 2nd of June earlier, but I was in hopes I should have had time
                  to have run up to your House when West, last month. I intended to have no more transactions of any
                  name or nature with Mr Dunham, let matters rest where they are as far as Securities are concerned.
                  Have you been able to get the $575.00 due from H Westphal. The reason I ask is that I was
                  going to ask you to put it to my credit in the 
                              Madison
                            Bank.
                        The land Warrant returned from 
                              Minnesota
                            you may enclose to me at this place. I want no more real estate in a government where the
                  Writ of "Habeas Corpus" is ignored by a Military Mob.
                        I wish to God you would come on and spend a few days or week while we are in Session. I have got a
                  good spare Room in my House, would treat you as well as I know how, and be more than happy to have
                  you.
                        As to the bitterness you speak of being manifested toward me by a certain class of "Douglass
                    Best Lackeys" in and congregating at 
                              Indianapolis
                           , I beg you to believe me sincere when I say that I have them defied. I would not turn on
                  my heel to make every such Traitor to principle and party my friend. Indeed I never will affiliate or
                  consort with 
                              
                                 44 M. S. Bright was a nephew of the Senator.
                           
                            such stock in private or political life. If I remain here as a
                  Senator, I shall act as my judgment prompts, regardless of all consequence political or personal.
                  Myself—I think I know my duty and I hope the sequel will prove I dare do it.

                        This hostility on there part is attributable mainly to Hughes removal & Mathews apt

                  farm with fencing outbuildings &c &c. I shall be here for the next two or three weeks.
                  I need not say that I would be delighted to have you come. Name a day and I will meet you at

                        I am indebted to you, for letters of the 15th & 23 Inst. I have been in my room for two weeks
                  with painful threats of Rheumatism, but have escaped the real old fashioned attack, and now feel
                  pretty confident, I shall be able to keep about, which is a matter of some moment to me, at this time.
                        Whatever you do with creditors to the Dunham fund will be right. I consider that I am very fortunate
                  in having an honest and as cunning a friend as I know you to be, to attend to my
                  business instead of myself.
                        I send you by to days Mail 3 copies of the Mechanical part of the Pat. Rept. for 1861. Anything I can
                  do for you here let me know, it will be done with all my heart?
                        I am glad that my Abolition enemies have opened there Battery in the form of a proposition to expel
                  me, you shall say before it [is] over that they have come out in this, as in all there past assaults
                  upon me (Second best)
                        I am glad that you think of coming on next month.
                        Your old friends here will be delight[ed] to see you. I have not a word to say about Indiana
                  politicks, because I do not care a damn as between Abolitionists & Douglasites I shall never
                  vote or coalesce with either politically.
                        My kind regards to your family, Father & family.

                        Yours of the 28 Inst is received. Exercise your own judgment in reference to notes we hold on Porter,
                  indeed I make the remark general, whatever you do, I approve. You are on the ground,
                  know more of the conditions of parties that owe us. Whether produce is likely to command a market,
                  whether money is likely to be had to pay Debts &c &c, I think of going West about the
                  1 of March and if so will not return without seeing you, unless you come here meantime which I hope
                  you will.
                        I had a letter from A J Cam, Treasurer of Clark Co. telling me that my Taxes $145.50 must
                  be paid without delay. I have written to Mr. Sparks to collect the last Installment of rent due me if
                  possible and pay the same—if he does not do it, I am going to draw on you for that amount
                  to be repaid when I come out, or before if you need it
                        I need not say anything about political affairs as the lying newspapers of the day give you all and
                  more to.
                        I am anxious to see the Wishwashy Resolutions that I am sure will be proposed at a Convention at
                  which the Douglas Democracy will have the ascendency, not that I take any interest in there
                  proceedings, but  as one of the signs showing the degeneracy of
                  the times. Glad to hear from you at any time & desiring to be remembered to your Household I

                     47 On January 6. 1862, when the Senate was giving consideration to the eligibility of
              a certain new member to a seat in the Senate, Charles Sumner included the following in some brief remarks:
              "The Senate is at this moment engaged in considering the loyalty of certain members of this body,
              and it seems to me it would poorly do its duty if it admitted among its members one with regard to whom,
              as he came forward to take his oath, there was a reasonable suspicion." The person whose case was
              before the Senate was an appointee of the Governor of

                     , but Bright felt that Sumner had aimed a shaft in his direction as well, which was true. In
              answer to the gentleman from 
                        Massachusetts
                     , Bright made the brief speech mentioned in his letter to English:
                   "The Senator from 
                        Massachusetts
                      remarked that the Senate were now engaged in examining into the loyalty of certain members of
              this body. I suppose he alluded to me. I am in that category, and the examination is based on three lines
              that it is alleged I wrote in a letter for a friend of mine, dated as far back as the first day of March
              last [Before the beginning of the War]. The objectionable feature is that I addressed Jefferson Davis as
              president of the confederate States. In that I was but following the example of Senators upon this floor
              who, day after day, spoke and addressed him by that title at that time: yet no exception was taken to
              that. However I do not propose arguing my case now: it would be out of time and place: but I want it to go
              out to the world with the statement of the Senator from 
                        Massachusetts
                     , that, as far as I am concerned, I hope the Senate are examining into my case, and I am very
              sorry that they have progressed so slowly. I am impatient for the investigation and anxious for the
              result, ready to meet it at any time it may come, and the sooner the better. I say this much for the
              information of the committee who have my case in charge, and for my friends at a distance, who appear to
              be borrowing some trouble on my account. I do not ask their sympathy. I have done nothing that I would not
              do over again under the same circumstances, and that I am not prepared to defend here as
              elsewhere." Cong. Globe. 87 Cong., 2 Sess., 184.
                  The letter which Bright wrote that caused his expulsion from the Senate is added that readers may judge
              it for themselves:

                        I am truly sorry not to have met you. Were it not that I have engagements of a character I cannot
                  break, without wrong to others, I would go up to

                              Cincinnati
                           ? Why not come up to 
                              Madison
                            Tuesday—meet me on the Mail Boat there, and on the trip to 
                              Cincinnati
                            we can talk over matters generally; or why not get ready to go on to 
                              Washington

                        I propose remaining here until Thursday 12 o'clock. I am very anxious to see you, and I will
                  in a few words state why. I want to sell out my interests in the Dunham debt because I need the money
                    now, and I want you to purchase it. 2nd There is a move or two, to be made on the
                  political boards, that it would require too much time to explain on paper, but if you will come down
                  tomorrow, or next day I will explain it all to you, in person. It is something that will interest you,
                  as much as me, and more you than me, in the end. I hope you will come, enquire for me at Sparks Store,
                  if not there at Major Jarvis Store in this City.

                        The fates seem to decree against my meeting you again. I have written naming two different times and
                  places to be at but presume you did not get my letter in time. On receipt of this drop me

                        I am not satisfied with my interview with you yesterday. I have thought the past present &
                  probable future over as connected with YOU and myself, and I do not intend to take a step that any
                  true friend I have ever had (who is a just and reasonable man) will say is not right,
                    religiously right. I wish to meet you in the spirit we have ever met from boyhood, and if we break the bond that has so long bound us, in more respects than one, you will be the agressor not Z. I intend to go to

                        On reaching here last evening I found your favor of the 18 Inst. I loose no time in replying, though
                  the limits of an ordinary letter will not allow me to give you even the heads of
                  such matters as I would like to amplyfy upon if I were to undertake to say all I want to, on the
                  points presented in yours of above date. I hope we will meet again soon, when I will frankly give you
                  my opinion of matters and things past present & future, I
                  did not leave 
                              Indianapolis
                           , entertaining an unkind thought toward you personally. I claim to be a
                  tolerant politician, and a true friend. I believe I am equally generous in the
                  former & bitter in the latter to an enemy.
                        I attatch no blame to you on account of what occured at 
                              Indianapolis
                           , being a Candidate yourself, I could not, I did not, expect you to say
                  or do anything that might prejudice your Election. If any true friend of mine opposed you it was not
                  because I encouraged it, for not a word did I utter "pro or con" about
                    a candidate for any office while there. I said no gentleman or Democrat would accept an Election for my unexpired term, and that I repeat
                  now, and though I know little or nothing of the fellow that sought the place and got it,48 I shall be mistaken if time does not prove him a worthy successor &
                  second edition of Jo Wright.
                        The miserable Dogs who opposed my restoration,49 both in and out of the
                  Legislature were governed by personal malice and envious
                  considerations, mainly. Some wanting brain to enable themselves to take an elevated view of the
                  principle involved, made committals against me in advance, in order to gratify a rotten class of
                  Douglas Democrats & 
                              
                                 48 David Turpie was the man elected.
                              
                                 49 Bright asked the Indiana Legislature to vindicate him by returning him
                      to the Senate whose members had expelled him.
                           
                            Abolitionists, who having neither courage or honesty themselves,
                  cannot appreciate such traits of character in others. You know that personally I cared nothing about a
                  reelection to the Senate. The State would have been more honored in the eyes of all just men, than I
                  would have been—I would rather stand upon my record as a Democrat and a man of courage, opposed to all the damning heresies of such Abolitionists & rotten booring
                    Democrats as now have power than to be in power by there favor. But enough on those
                  points—you understand me.
                        So far as I am concerned, I am glad to know from your letter that so far as you are concerned, we
                  stand where we always have (and I hope always will) friends, ready to do battle at the proper time
                  (& that time is not far distant), against a gang of political boors who have reached and
                  obtained the political power of this government by false pretences.
                        I supposed you were talking about the land being in our trade. Are you in real earnest? My kind
                  regards to all your Household.

          irresistable in his appeal to the voters of the 
                  United Kingdom
               . Since the coalition ministry formed in the later war period which he headed went out of office,
          he has found no party to lead or no party willing to follow him. The estimate placed on his capacity in that
          line will therefore be very different because he has lived through the period since the World War. Clemenceau
          had won no outstanding place in world history or even in French history prior to the World War, at the
          beginning of which, in 1914, he was seventy-three years of age. Still vigorous, physically and mentally, he
          was able to become one of the strongest men of the hour. Whether we praise or condemn what he did during the
          War and at the 
                  Versailles
                Conference, there is no question about the powerful influence which he exerted on his country and
          the world. If Woodrow Wilson had suffered collapse at the opening of the Peace Conference, as he did
          afterwards, what would the best of biographers say of his loss to the Conference?
            It has often been said that Lincoln was fortunate in that his labors ended with the close of the Civil War,
          and it does seem that there was a possibility that he could not have gone through the "Tragic
          Era" without loss of prestige. It is not always true, but often it is surely true, that no correct
          summary of a man's career can be made without due consideration of the age at which death came to
          him.
            The belief is common that Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Alexander 
                  Hamilton
               —men who died in middle life—had accomplished their work in the world before
          the summons came. In regard to Caesar, Cromwell, Theodore Roosevelt—there remains a question. In
          the case of Stephen A. Douglas, it seems very plain that it is impossible to pass a fair judgment on his
          career without remembering that his life ended when he was but forty-eight years of age. Most of the men born
          at about the same time as Douglas are known very largely by what they did and said and stood for in the years
          of the Civil War and Reconstruction.
            Douglas has had the misfortune to be studied and interpreted in connection with 
                  Lincoln
               . No other man of the time has been so universally contrasted with the emancipator.  Remembering that Douglas had no opportunity to play a part during the armed
          conflict between North and South, it is manifestly unfair that he should have been so often unfavorably
          compared with 
                  Lincoln
               . If the latter had died at the beginning of 1854 when he was forty-five years of age, he would be
          accorded very few lines in the pages of any history and no biography at all. When Douglas died he was only
          three years older than was 
                  Lincoln
                in 1854. It was not until the last mentioned year, that Lincoln found a cause and took a stand
          which gave him some claim to a place in history. Even hostile critics of Douglas usually declare that he rose
          to a high stature in 1858 when he fought against the admission of 
                  Kansas
                under the Lecompton Constitution. In that year, he arrived at the age which 
                  Lincoln
                had attained in 1854.
            It is impossible to conjecture what manner of statesman Douglas would have become had he lived to the age of
          sixty or seventy, but it is entirely proper to give attention to his early death when passing judgment on his
          character and career. He should be judged by his statesmanship in the period through which he was permitted to
          live and by his understanding of what it was best to do to avoid serious dangers that were likely to come.
            Indiana is a wealthy state. It is a commonwealth in which there is much culture, where there is a belief in
          general education and even in the promotion of scholarship. Nevertheless, the patient researcher by whose work
          new knowledge is added to the world's store in one field or another, is one of the forgotten men of
          the state. There is no center in Indiana where either through state appropriations or private endowment,
          research can be carried on as it should be. It is very easy to economize where so few seem to be concerned.
          The fundamental truth is, however, that a multitude of people are involved. College education, high school
          training, elementary teaching, all will suffer in time, but the greatest tragedy resulting from the starvation
          of research work at a great university is what happens to the faculty. No university can remain a great
          institution and no faculty can keep above the water line very long unless a spirit of scholarship prevails,
          which spirit can only live where reasonable facilities for research are provided.
            
            In the last year of his life, Daniel Webster was asked to speak before the 
                  New York
                Historical Society, which invitation he accepted. Certain passages from the address of the old
          statesman are well worth quoting: 
                  But History, while it illustrates and adorns, confines itself to facts, and to the true narrative of
              actual events. It is not far from the truth to say, that well written History is the Epic of real life. It
              places the actions of men in an attractive and interesting light; rejecting what is improper and
              superfluous, it fills its picture with real, just and well drawn images.
                  And the dignity of History consists in relating events with truth and accuracy, and in presenting human
              agents and their actions in a clear and impartial light. The first element in History, therefore, is
              truthfulness; and this truthfulness must be presented in concrete form.
               
            
            An effort is now being made to interest the high school teacher of history in Indiana in the Indiana Magazine of History. During the year now closing a new department, "History
          Teachers' Forum," has been added. Matter suitable to this department is desired, and brief
          articles from teachers of history in high schools and colleges will be welcomed by the Editor.
            A hope is indulged by those interested in the preservation and study of Indiana history that many, indeed
          very many, of the high schools of the state will become members of the Indiana Historical Society. Very few
          high schools have a file of the Publications and Bulletins issued by the
          Society or of the Indiana Magazine of History published by Indiana University. All of these
          will come regularly each year to every high school becoming a member of the Society. The annual dues are
          $3.00 for any institution. The time will come when files of the publications available now through
          the outlay of this small sum will be much desired by high schools. They will prove valuable as they are
          periodically received, but they will become worth more with the passage of years. Students and teachers who
          work in the high schools of the future will praise those who act wisely in the present, but will have good
          reason to look back with disfavor on those who do not.
