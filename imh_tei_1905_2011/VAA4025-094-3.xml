                    to pursue. Decentralization. We must recognize the nature of the thing we are in."<hi rend="sup">14</hi> He continued: "Everything moves faster now. A hundred years long ago
                    is 10 years in today's mode of progress. Can't you see this city going out (to the suburbs)? And
                    when it does, you'd better get out of the way."<hi rend="sup">15</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further documenting Wright's eccentricities, one newspaper reported that during a book signing
                    session the architect refused to sign copies of a bound collection of his work if there were any
                    pages missing.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> And in discussing the status and design for his <placeName>

                        good."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Yet despite his often curt, off-the-cuff comments about <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> architecture, it was noted that he thought the Weir Cook Municipal Airport was
                    "very nicely designed."<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Controversial and often misunderstood, Wright evoked differing opinions among local officials,
                    architects, and the news media. Some, like architect Wilbur B. Shook of McGuire and Shook opposed
                    Wright's contention that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> would be "on the way out" within the next fifteen years. Shook
                    countered: "downtown <placeName>

                    </placeName> is the heart of our thriving urban and fine supplemental suburban
                    development… the life-giving heart of Monument Circle."<hi rend="sup">19</hi>
                    Others found common ground with the master architect's arguments. An <placeName>

                    Vonnegut, Wright, and Porteous agreed with Wright's comments concerning the World War Memorial:
                    "It's a huge mass of state architecture." Suggesting a constructive approach in

            <p>An unpublished document bearing the signature of Leonard Helm acting under the "Power and
                    Authority given" him by George Rogers Clark has come to light among the manuscript
                    collections of the Old Cathedral Library and Museum in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The document was found in an unlabeled archival folder
                    in one of several archival document storage boxes that contain the loose leaf manuscripts in the
                    library's collections. It was immediately apparent that the text, in French, was in a different hand
                    than the signature. Clark's name in the initial sentence; the date, "the 1st day of May
                    1779," a mere nine weeks after the surrender of Fort Sackville by British Commander Henry
                    Hamilton to the American cause; and the signature of Helm, Clark's compatriot who had fought with
                    him in Dunmore's War and who had been held prisoner by <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Hamilton</settlement>
                    </placeName> from December, 1778, to February, 1779, attested to the document's significance.</p>
            <p>The sheet upon which this document was written is a well made, thin cotton rag paper bearing a
                    circular watermark containing what appear to be letters and figures that are not readable and having
                    between eight and nine chain lines per centimeter. The original sheet measured no less than 40
                    centimeters wide and 32.5 centimeters high, but at some point it was folded in half along its height
                    and had the recto of the sheet pasted or glued onto another, central sheet. The fact that Helm used
                    a full sheet, and wrote on only one side, suggests that he had ample paper at his disposal at this
                        time.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The document follows:</p>

                    illiterate, as he signed an "X" on an 1806 petition to Congress advocating passage

            <p>The signature of Charles Vachet, which appears on the back of this document (and many others in the
                    Old Cathedral manuscript collections) in blue pencil, is perhaps the hardest to pin down of all
                    names associated with the Helm document, if only because the name belonged to more than one person
                    in the same family. Ultimately, the specific Vachet who signed the document is less important than
                    the different stories associated with the Vachet family name, stories that provide many different
                    plausible routes by which the document could have come into the Old Cathedral collections.</p>
            <p>Charles Vachet, Jr., whose name appears at the bottom of the abbreviated family tree below,<hi rend="sup">23</hi> is the most likely person to have signed this document and presented it to
                    the Old Cathedral Museum. His great-grandfather, Charles-Francois Vasher, was born in Montreal in

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1778. He fought on the side of the Virginians in the battle of Fort Sackville and
                    may very well have served in the company of Lt. Godere.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Another
                    great-grandfather, Jean Baptiste DeElaurier (DeLuyear, Delaurier), was out hunting ducks with
                    Charles-Francois Vasher's father-in-law, Nicholas Cardinal, when the two were captured by Clark's
                    company. They informed Clark that the British were entirely unaware of his coming and guided him to
                    the Sugar Camp and from there to Warriors Knoll.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> Any of these three direct
                    ancestors of Charles Vachet, Jr., could have handed the document down to their great-grandson. But

            <p>In a newspaper interview published in 1935, an eighty-five year-old Charles Vachet, Jr., states:

                    pencil—a document listing the estate of Francois Godere.</p>

                    to the civilian population and destroy the Confederacy's ability to resist. Sherman's relentless
                    drive deep into enemy territory with more than 60,000 men from November 15 to December 21, followed

            <p>After their arrival at Milledgeville on November 23, the Hoosiers' next objective was the city of
                    Millen, one hundred miles away. In the advance, the troops of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana and the rest
                    of their division were detailed to support Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick's Union cavalry
                    forces. As it moved, the regiment continued to destroy railroads and forage off the land. Despite
                    skirmishes with rebel cavalry, obstructions of logs and felled trees, annoying rain, and scarce
                    forage, the Hoosiers moved beyond Millen in early December and closed in around Savannah.</p>
            <p>Because Sherman was reluctant to order a direct assault on the city, the Seventy-Fifth settled in
                    beyond the rebel fortifications to await their commander's next move. Although the veteran regiment

                    and well-conducted campaign was a source of great pride for the Union veterans. Encountering little

                    cavalry units played a part in the looting and pillaging as well. It must also be pointed out that
                    even though a large amount of personal property was stolen or destroyed by the Federals, few
                    civilians were physically harmed, and their homes were generally left intact. In a sense, Georgians
                    were spared the worst of the devastation, for the residents of <placeName>

            <p>William Bluffton Miller maintained a detailed diary throughout his service, not only noting mundane
                    matters such as personal health and weather conditions but also chronicling the experiences of a
                    Union infantryman in some of the most famous campaigns of the Civil War. Miller's diary also
                    includes other valuable details: his encounters with the men of his regiment and with southern
                    civilians, his concern for his family, his experiences in combat, and his day-to-day struggle for
                    survival in an infantry regiment on active service. Among other things, Miller's journal helps
                    document the treatment of southern property, the destruction of railroads and industries, and the
                    other crucial activities of a "typical" Union regiment during the march through <placeName>

                                    city. The city is fired in severel places and about dark the Torch was set into the
                                    Buisiness part. It was a grand sight from our camp to look down on the burning city.
                                    The night is dark and an occasional shell bursts and scatters things around
                                    promiscuously. Some of our Boys was down and got some clotheing from the burning

                                    clotheing and Rations and have orders to move in the morning. With all the

                                            in small pocket diaries that were easily carried during the war, then later
                                            copied them into the approximately 71/2 × 91/2 volume that

                                            possible to this larger journal. Miller's punctuation and spelling have been
                                            retained, with occasional bracketed insertions to clarify meaning. Double

                                    to pass by his plantation when he had plenty without asking him to contribute

                                    was not at home we just helped ourselves to such as we found. It appears he had very
                                    urgent buisiness away from home when he heard we was comeing to see him. Pherhaps he
                                    thought we might want him to go along with us. But it is all right and we will

                                    Our quarters are coverd with Yams and they are frozen hard. The Darkies Say it was
                                    an unusually cold night. This has been a pretty place and when we arrived here last
                                    night was in a good shape but this morning we leave it stripped of its beauty and we
                                    start to Millidgeville. We camped in the edge of the city. It is a nice place. The

                                    chamber and our Boys held a Mock Legislature personating the Johnies and it was very

                                    in regular Southern fire eating stile and was all armed with large knives captured
                                    from the Arsnell which is Situated in the same encloseure. The Arsnel contained Some
                                    Small arms and about four thousand Pikes and cutlasses for cutting up Yankees and
                                    now we are here for the sacrifice and the Butchers are not at home. The State papers
                                    was about all removed to Macon by the Rebels. The Arsnell was blown up to night and
                                    the state Prison was burned by the Rebels and all the prisoners liberated if they
                                    would join the Army. The men as usual are not at home and a great many citizens left
                                    the city. I noticed some fine buildings but the State House looks old and rusty. I
                                    was through the State prison building and it is badly damaged. I got one of the
                                    cutlasses and will endevour to cary it home as a curiosity. This was a cold frosty
                                    day. The 20th Army Corps has the advance and the[y] moved on to night and we are to

                                    and bring him to him. I done as orderd and Davis gave the Lieut a terible curseing
                                    and then orderd me to release them which I did. Genl Davis is a good reliable
                                    Officer but very passionate and I concluded when I heard him talking to that Lieut
                                    that it might do for him to curse some men that way and I might have kept still if
                                    it had been my case but he has no right to abuse a man simply because he out ranks
                                    him and I think I should have cautioned him not to repeat it. I think every man
                                    should show due respect for his officers but when the General or any officer
                                    descends from his rank to curse and abuse the man below him he is not entitled to
                                    any respect. Genl Davis took the life of Nelson at <placeName>

                        <p>We had the lead to day and marched twenty miles. The Rebel cavalry put in an
                                    appearance again to day and kept popping away at us when ever they got a chance but
                                    they did not bother us much. I got a rebel paper and it is full of good news for
                                    them. It says Wheelers Cavalry cleaned out the 14th Corps and Killpatricks Cavalry
                                    Sunday at Waynesboro. If we had not been there I could believe it better. But if
                                    that is what they call a victory we will give them one every day. It also says
                                    Sherman is trying to get to Savannah and I am thankfull for the information as I did
                                    not know before where we are going. I noticed a Small item where the Tellegraph

                                    marching orders and started again about ten Oclock and moved five miles. The Cavalry
                                    coverd the rear and as they enterd a swamp charged them but our boys held their
                                    ground. The Rebels thought they would stampeed the Cavalry and play the same game we
                                    played on them at Waynesboro but they failed. We stopped about four Oclock A M and
                                    got a little rest but we needed it badly as we marched about twenty five miles Since

                                        carried them with a second assault and drove Wheeler's men into Waynesboro. In

                                    at us and we formed a line of Battle and moved out to meet them but they only came
                                    to our Picket line. There was a number of Shots fired and some men hurt. Some of our

                                        Sherman's army, although some distance from Fort Jackson. On December 13 Rear
                                        Admiral John A. Dahlgren of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron sent word to
                                        Sherman that he had two ironclad ships at Wassaw Sound and a force of gunboats
                                        at Ossabaw Sound and the Savannah River, east and southeast of the city.
                                        Dahlgren believed that the best way to open communications with the army was
                                        from Ossabaw Sound into the Great Ogeechee River. Unfortunately for the
                                        Federals, the river was guarded several miles upstream by Confederate-held Fort
                                        McAllister, although Dahlgren thought the fort could be successfully assaulted

                                    passed the prisoners captured at Fort McCallister and they are the worst looking
                                    Soldiers I ever Seen. They are little Boys and very old men not strong enough to be
                                    in the field. They were about played out marching. We took a good laugh at one of
                                    our men who was guarding a Boy quite small and they was behind the rest and the

                                    the Rebels are pushed for Soldiers and convinces me that the war is nearly over. We
                                    marched about Twenty five miles and crossed the Ogechee river about dark and camped
                                    two miles from the river. Our rout was through a Swampy country and the land is
                                    mostly coverd with water. I started from Camp with four small crackers and a little

                                    any more than I have. There was a Mail Boat lying at the Wharf when we crossed the

            <p>The Hoosiers had the honor of being the first organized Union troops into Fayetteville on March 11,
                    driving the Confederate rear guard ahead of them. After destroying the arsenal there, and taking a
                    four-day rest, the Federals pushed on to <placeName>

                    of Confederate forces in the region, sought to destroy both corps of Sherman's left wing in detail.
                    His first target was the Fourteenth Corps. The battle began on March 19, and the Seventy-Fifth
                    Indiana entered the fray the following morning. The Hoosiers kept up a brisk skirmishing fire and
                    were harassed by Confederate artillery in return, but by late afternoon Johnston retreated. On the

                    of Raleigh. The Hoosiers of the Seventy-Fifth led the army, and on their way they claimed to have
                    fought the last battle and suffered the last combat casualty of Sherman's masterful campaign. The
                    regiment's skirmishers pushed the enemy before them and in a brisk fight captured the city of
                    Smithfield on April 11. Miller and his comrades were paid a rare compliment there by the commander
                    of the left wing, General Slocum. When Captain Mahlon Floyd reported for duty with the
                    Seventy-Fifth's skirmishers outside Smithfield, General Slocum asked if they were part of the same
                    regiment that had first entered Fayetteville. When he was told that indeed they were, he replied,
                    "I want no better; I will risk those fellows with anything."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>The regiment successfully reached Raleigh on the 13th. On the way they were cheered by the news of

                    between Sherman and Johnston. On April 26 the Confederate commander at last signed documents
                    requiring his men to lay down their arms. With this rebel army no longer a threat, the men could
                    look forward to returning home.</p>

                    of the Seventy-Fifth Indiana filled the street from one side to the other and swept the avenue.
                    Military bands worked up the crowd to the "highest pitch," and they

            <p>The 1998 Indiana Archives section of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of History</hi> surveys local
                    archival holdings in the southern part of Indiana. Although sectional borders in Indiana are often
                    in dispute, geography and two superhighways help demarcate the southern part of the state. Bounded
                    by the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and <geogName>Wabash rivers</geogName> and Interstates 70 and 74, the region's mostly
                    rolling topography distinguishes it from the northern two-thirds of the state. Southern Indiana is
                    predominantly rural and agricultural, although the terrain and the relatively poor quality of much
                    of the area's soil make farming sometimes difficult. It is heavily forested in places and dotted
                    elsewhere with coal mining operations, manifestations of recent industrial growth, and tourist
                    attractions. Its largest urban centers are at the southern edges of the region. The population of
                    the area has always been diverse, from the prehistoric people who gathered at Angel Mounds near
                    present-day <placeName>

            <p>The origins and timing of this migration and settlement make southern Indiana the oldest part of the
                    state and the site of many historical "firsts." Some can be readily noted. Many

                    </placeName> the oldest city in Indiana. Clarksville is often identified as the first American
                    settlement in Indiana Territory. Corydon was Indiana's first state capital. <placeName>

                    known. The first state prison, the first hospital, the first state forest, and reportedly the first
                    Ku Klw Klan klavern were established in southern Indiana. The area experienced the first
                    encroachment by Confederate troops during the Civil War, and its young men were among the first
                    American soldiers killed in combat during the Spanish-American War and World War I. New Harmony

            <p>Through memorials, historic districts, and various other initiatives, southern Indianans have
                    demonstrated an acute sense of their region's past, and this year's contributors describe some of
                    the archival resources available for further research. Stephen L. Cochran and Mark V. Wetherington
                    outline the ways in which holdings in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

                    </placeName> provide a general overview of Indiana's oldest area. Josephine M. Elliott and Roger A.
                    Peterson focus on specific antebellum-era collections, showing how local history is made, preserved,
                    and later used for a variety of purposes. Gina Walker describes several archival collections that
                    help illuminate <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Evansville</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Together these essays suggest the
                    range and diversity of sources available for exploration of two centuries of southern Indiana
                    history.</p>

            <p>By far the largest percentage of the collection is the result of a lifetime of book collecting by the
                    Right Reverend Simon William Gabriel Bruté de Remur, first bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Bruté was a remarkable person by any measure. He was educated as a
                    physician and as a priest; twice he turned down offers to work for the French crown, instead joining
                    the Sulpicians and teaching at the seminary at Rennes. He came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1810 and in 1834 was appointed bishop of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He had been there for nearly a year before his books were floated down the

            <p>While Bruté was a major benefactor of the collection, the parish records begin in
                    1749—nearly ninety years before Bruté's arrival—and reflect the
                    life of Catholic laity, both the French settlers and "les Savages." The
                    development of the library over time derives from two additional channels. One part contains
                    essentially books and records that every resident religious since Bruté has left the
                    library. The other part, running concurrently, consists of material donated by many parishioners,
                    known and unknown, over the passage of time.</p>
            <p>A knowledge of French and Latin is essential to derive maximum benefit from the Old Cathedral
                    collections. French was the dominant language of most of the inhabitants of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> until the 1820s, and roughly 75 percent of the collections are in French. A fair amount
                    is in Latin, and much of the correspondence between early French priests is a mixture of the two
                    languages.</p>
            <p>The Old Cathedral Library nonetheless facilitates research into the eighteenth century. It is
                    particularly rich in the areas of theology, dogma, religious studies, lives of the saints, sermons,
                    and homiletics. There is also a large collection of Bibles, exegetical and liturgical works, and
                    works on philosophy. The collection is surprisingly rich in medical materials and in original
                    documents relating to the French Revolution, natural history, geography, law, political economy,
                    general literature, botany, and lexicography. Manuscripts in the collection also include a papal
                    bull signed by John XXII, dated 1319, a letter signed by Saint Vincent de Paul, a facsimile of Saint
                    Isaac Jogues's "New Holland letter, sermons and sermon notes by the <placeName>

                    requesting succor during the French Revolution, and some of Bruté's correspondence.</p>

                    Historical Collections and the County Records Library are administered by the public library staff,
                    and the two collections are highly complementary. Included are records from the offices of the
                    county auditor, recorder, treasurer, and clerks of the circuit, superior, and probate courts. While
                    most of these records date from the twentieth century, many reach back to the early nineteenth
                    century and occasionally earlier. The auditors' records have commissioners' records from 1823 on in
                    thirty-nine volumes and tract books from 1818 to 1875. The <pb n="245" id="VAA4025-094-3-055"/>
                    recorders' records include deeds from 1814 to 1909 in ninety-four volumes, with an eighteen-volume
                    index, and mortgages from 1848 to 1955 in 178 volumes with a twenty-nine-volume index. The
                    treasurers' records include tax lists for the years 1802, 1804, and 1805 and tax duplicates for the
                    years 1846–1994, with additional years added annually. The clerks' circuit court records
                    include civil case files from 1796 to 1965, criminal case files from 1797 to 1954, execution dockets
                    from 1819 to 1955, probate records that include wills from 1824 to 1948, and guardianship case files
                    from 1808 to 1954.</p>

                    </placeName>-area facility that strongly supports primary research is the library at the <hi rend="bold">George Rogers Clark National Historical Park.</hi> This library focuses on the
                    Revolutionary War era and George Rogers Clark, his companies, and his life in—and the
                    cultures and history of—the trans Appalachian frontier. It includes microfilm collections
                    of Clark's <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>

                    period of the French and Indian War and the War of 1812.</p>
            <p>The above listing is far from exhaustive. Most of the early government records are in English, but
                    since quite a few of the wills in the early nineteenth century are in French, a knowledge of that
                    language is helpful though certainly not required.</p>

               </placeName>, was founded in 1884 as an
                    independent history research library. Its mission to "collect, preserve, and publish
                    historical material, especially that pertaining to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>" included the addendum "and adjacent states." This broader
                    collecting field has allowed The Filson Club to build a special collections department that is
                    regional in scope and contains material from the Upper South, the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName>
                    Valley, and "adjacent states" such as Indiana. The Filson Club's founders were
                    especially interested in the earliest periods of exploration and settlement in the <geogName>Ohio
                        Valley</geogName>; thus, their earliest publication series—which began in
                    1884—covers such topics as the explorations of Christopher Gist and the Battle of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tippecanoe</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>The Filson Club's manuscript collections also reflect the founders' interest in the frontier era.
                    Manuscripts include letters that provide insights into many aspects of the early settlement of the
                    region: Indian-white conflict, land acquisition, daily life on the frontier, and the growth of towns
                    and cities. Among the earliest Indiana-related documents is a Revolutionary War letter written in
                    1779 by Joseph Bowman while on the American expedition against the British. Bowman gives a detailed
                    account of the retaking of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Over thirty years later, a letter written in 1811 by militiaman John Drummens to his
                    wife in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> reflects the persisting cultural conflict on the frontier; Drummens speculated on a
                    possible march to "Shawneys <pb n="246" id="VAA4025-094-3-056"/> Prophets Town"
                    and rumors of peace. Most Indians and whites, he wrote, believed that there would be a battle, one
                    that would ultimately claim his life.</p>
            <p>Once the threat of Indian attack had passed and the land had been opened up for settlement, items in
                    a variety of collections describe the frontier process of immigration, land acquisition, and
                    settlement. Both the Clark-Hite and William Clark papers contain much information on land
                    transactions in territorial and antebellum Indiana, as do the Norvin Green, John Jeremiah Jacob,
                    Colonel Thomas Joyes, Francis <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marion</region>
                    </placeName> Lee, and William Pope papers. The Francis Hegan Miller Collection alone includes many
                    land transactions between the commissioners appointed to apportion the 149,000 acres granted to
                    George Rogers Clark's <placeName>

                    </placeName> Regiment and the soldiers who qualified for land grants. In the Corlis-Respess Family
                    Papers a letter written by Jonathan Jennings in 1815 provides general information on the Indiana
                    Territory and assures prospective settlers that the inhabitants are protected by "mounted
                    riflemen." Documents in the Corlis Family Papers include an 1816 letter by George Corlis
                    noting the descent of three hundred immigrant families down the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio River</region>
                    </placeName>, all bound for Indiana. Correspondence by John Jencks, penned the following year,
                    describes the poor living conditions that frontier families encountered in the vicinity of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Indeed, so many people arrived in the Indiana Territory that there was a demand not only for land but
                    for basic household goods. Eliza Fry, writing from <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, noted, "The emigration to this place is so great that there is such a demand
                    for furniture it is impossible for it to be made as fast as it is called for." She
                    predicted that <placeName>

                    </placeName> "will be in a few years a great place." The establishment and growth
                    of Indiana's villages, towns, and cities are topics of frequent comment and description. A letter
                    written in 1815 describes the high quality of the soil in <placeName>

            <p>Religious and moral issues were frequent topics of discussion in antebellum Indiana. The Martha Adams
                    Papers include a letter written in 1853 addressing the tension between economic prosperity and the
                    welfare of the soul. The "spirit of progress" and material gain, one of Adams's
                    correspondents wrote despairingly, came at the expense of religiosity. A diary (typescript copy)
                    kept by Indianan John Brown (1800–1872) during the early 1820s recalls a discussion

            <p>One of the largest groups of Indiana-related manuscript material at The Filson Club describes life
                    during the Civil War era. The Filson's founders were evenly divided between Confederate and Union
                    sympathizers and veterans. Because of this ideological conflict the collections reflect both sides
                    of the struggle. Their specific focus is the western theater, stretching from the Appalachian
                    Mountains to the <geogName>Mississippi River</geogName>. Given <placeName>

                    images of soldiers who served in the commonwealth from other states as well as from <placeName>

                    War diaries at The Filson Club include those of Johnson W. Culp and James W. Thomson. Culp, a
                    private in the 87th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, begins his diary with his enlistment at <placeName>

                    of the Fourth Indiana Battery. Sperry describes the more boring aspects of the soldier's
                    experience—camp life, diet, clothes, and finances—as well as the events that
                    broke the monotony—the execution of a deserter, skirmishes, and his unit's involvement in
                    battles at Stones River and Lookout Mountain, <placeName>

                    1863 records that the troops "lived high" on the food and welcome they received
                    and declares that Indiana "can furnish more prety girls than any other state in the
                    Union." In an 1862 letter in the Corlis-Respess Family Papers Jessee D. H. Corwine reveals
                    the divided loyalties of some citizens in southern Indiana when he concludes that southern
                    sympathizers "are having a great time recruiting here." During the following year
                    Henry B. Carrington wrote to Governor Oliver P. Morton concerning the Union Army's investigation of
                    John Hunt Morgan's raid. Carrington describes the damage done by Morgan's men and the need to
                    "see substantial justice done." Among the more unusual items in The Filson Club's
                    Civil War collections is a letter from James A. Thomas, a captured Confederate soldier <pb n="248" id="VAA4025-094-3-058"/> paroled in Indiana, complaining of the Union League's oppression of

                    journals, account books, maps, newspapers, photographs, microfilms, and tapes. Among the most valued
                    records are the bound volumes of Robert Owen's communal experiment in <placeName>

                    </placeName> during the years 1826–1831 are the 478 letters of William Maclure and Marie
                    Duclos Fretageot. Maclure's geological journals describe that science in its early European stages.
                    The Branigin-Owen Papers, Carol Baldwin Allen Collection, and a large collection of personal Owen
                    papers cover the Owen family and descendants. William Pelham's letters to his son
                    (1825–1827), the epistolary narrative of the son's schoolboy endeavors as one of Joseph
                    Neef's pupils (1809–1815), and the father's bookseller days in <placeName>

                    </placeName> and relationship to the artist Sir John Copley also reveal the early days of the Owen
                    experiment. The collection of the Phiquepal d'Arusmont family—William S. Phiquepal,
                    Frances Wright's husband, their daughter, and descendants—describes a system of musical
                    notation and an original phonetic system involving stenography devised in 1825. Fretageot family
                    members—the most prominent being Madame Marie Duclos Fretageot, a friend, agent, and
                    correspondent of William Maclure—and their lives are well covered in the groups of papers
                    and bound business journals given to the Workingmen's Institute regularly over the years.</p>
            <p>The local people of later generations also left their mark. The Golden family, a famous theatrical
                    traveling troupe of the 1860s to the turn of the century, left a significant group of materials
                    consisting of personal papers, diaries, original scripts, plays, playbills, music, and photographs.

                    (1886–1970) were also benefactors of the institute. The Elliott family papers are a

            <p>Three literary manuscript collections should also be mentioned: Caroline Dale Snedeker's book
                    manuscripts, the collection of her niece Caroline Baldwin Allen, and Celia Morris Eckhardt's
                    writings. The work of the first two women overemphasizes Owen family myth and largely disregards
                    documentation. Eckhardt's biography of Frances Wright is the best to date, and her papers include
                    many of the sources that she used in writing her book.</p>

                    </placeName> are all actively engaged in making as well as preserving history. The records of
                    companies now defunct but important to the local scene include the business books of the Shoultz
                    Funeral Home, containing much genealogical data, and the Golden Raintree Association, which
                    sponsored theatrical events and the Ross Lockridge, Jr., pageant from the 1920s to the 1960s.
                    Although the Keck-Gonerman Company of <geogName>Mt. Vernon</geogName> has gone out of business, the
                    manuals for its threshing machines and tractors are still eagerly sought by owners of its equipment.</p>
            <p>The rare maps, indicating landowners in the town, township, and county, furnish information predating
                    the coming of the Harmonists.</p>
            <p>In answering inquiries the first and last resort for the Workingmen's Institute staff is the Local
                    History File. This resource consists of thousands of handwritten and typed 3″
                    × 5″ cards—sometimes pasted with newspaper
                    clippings—cataloging a cumulative history of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Begun in 1908 and continued to date, the cards contain information about the physical
                    makeup of the town, its residents, events, and historical facts.</p>
            <p>The audiovisual section—photographs, microfilms, tapes, and films—supports the
                    manuscript collection. Photographs taken by William F. Lichtenberger from around the 1870s to the
                    1920s, with Homer Fauntleroy picking up the task into the 1950s, made possible the continuation of

            <p>Numerous folders contain information on each designated building, such as block location,
                    descriptions, photographs, and drawings of intended alterations. The extensive collection of

                    became the Sanborn Map Company in 1902. Maps of the Harmony Society's land acquisitions from 1815 to
                    1824 indicate original landowners. The geological and mineralogical travels of William Maclure,
                    Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, and Gerard Troost are meticulously re-created from letters and personal
                    accounts. There are comprehensive planning and development maps illustrating projected land use. A
                    series of historical maps for the years 1824, 1843, 1887, 1907, 1973, and 1982 greatly extend the

            <p rend="center">RECORDS OF OWEN COUNTY</p>
            <p>The Indiana General Assembly mandates the local and state records that a county must keep.
                    Unfortunately, many counties have, at various times, destroyed records despite this mandate;
                    fortunately, most of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen County</region>

                    </placeName> Archives are the Deed Books, the Complete Record Books of the various courts, the
                    Complete Probate Books, the County Commissioners' Books, and the various packets containing the
                    files associated with the court books. These packets contain the papers presented to the court and
                    are the documents from which the court books were written. They are valuable because they contain
                    information not included in the transcripts, such as the names of witnesses, subpoenas of the
                    defendant and/or plaintiff, fees, and margin notes.</p>
            <p>A county courthouse contains many records that are of interest to a historian or genealogist. Once
                    researchers identify persons in a group (Germans) or a profession (coal miners) in which they are
                    interested, they should start with the Deed Books and, while abstracting land transactions, continue
                    to search for more names. Since, in <placeName>

                    </placeName>, African Americans have been studied extensively in the county records, this group is
                    used in the following examples. Until 1856 many contracts and agreements were recorded in the Deed
                    Books so that, if necessary, this information could be entered as evidence in a court trial. Among
                    the non-land entries found in the Deed Books are free papers, that is, affidavits issued by counties
                    in southern <pb n="254" id="VAA4025-094-3-064"/> states declaring that African Americans who left
                    those states did so as free persons. These papers usually name the parents, spouse, and children,
                    thereby providing additional names. Sometimes interesting details are included, such as in the case
                    of Aaron Roberts, where it is noted that his father, Ishmael Roberts, was "an old
                    revolutionary soldier in the 10th Regiment of infantry under Col. Shepherd" during the War
                    for Independence. Aaron's wife, Sarah, is also named, and the paper states that her father, Edward
                    Newsom, also served in the army during the Revolution. The paper is dated 1830, Chatham County, <placeName>

                    deed, and the deed book and page where the deed is recorded. These deed index books should be very
                    carefully examined before searching. Some books will be indexed with the grantors and grantees
                    intermixed; some have the grantors indexed in the front of the book and the grantee indexed in the

                    political patronage. For example, the contract for custodial services for the courthouse was likely
                    reserved for members of the black community. Richard Walden was a regular recipient of these
                    contracts. He received twenty-five cents for sweeping out the courthouse doorway on the first day of
                    the September term, 1833, and one dollar during the August session, 1834.<hi rend="sup">10</hi>
                    Walden probably paid someone else to do the work since he was quite prosperous.</p>

                    </placeName> commissioners also issued various licenses, such as the one Walden received to vend
                    groceries and liquors in 1833 and other years.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Licenses required bonding, and
                    since no bonding companies existed, local property owners guaranteed payment of the bond in case of
                    default. For example, "Now is presented the Bond of Richard Walden with Benjamin Leonard,
                    John Galletly, Samuel Scott, Joseph Cocheran and Pardon B. Roberts his securities conditioned as the
                    law requires of Grocery keepers in the sum prescribed by law which bond acknowledged by the obligers

                    a justice of the peace and later commissioner, and Roberts an African American active in buying and

            <p>The greatest number of county records are those from the various courts and are found under the

                    before 1836 are found in the Complete Order Books, but the books do not have the detail of the

            <p>The Complete Probate Books provide the historian with a wealth of information, particularly the
                    intestate records. These books note a person's death and often list personal property such as guns,

                    merchants, with detailed accounts of goods purchased, can be found in the Probate Books. Also of
                    value are the store inventories of merchants who have died. Two additional sources are mortgage

                    bibliographical essay, index. $24.95.)</head>
            <p>At first glance, the subject of this book, a male, upper middle-class intellectual, might seem less
                    than worthy. He distrusted ethnic minorities and, in part out of political partisanship, worked for
                    passage of a new state constitution that would restrict their franchise. He reinvigorated his state
                    historical society and state library, in part as a means of increasing the availability of materials
                    for his own literary activities. Finally, he lost his position as city comptroller, in large measure
                    because of suspicion that he was part of a scheme that allowed the mayor improperly to receive city
                    funds.</p>
            <p>In this instance, as is often true, first glances are deceiving. This book, as it turns out, is both
                    important and fascinating. Indeed, the author provides a case study of the Progressive movement in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and gives a balanced portrayal of an individual who—while achieving neither
                    fame nor elective office—left a remarkable legacy of public service. At the same time,
                    Ray E. Boomhower has revealed in yet another way the connection between culture and politics in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Whatever his foibles (most of which he shared with his contemporaries), Dunn, Boomhower points out,
                    heeded his convictions—based on the ideals of Thomas Jefferson—that democracy
                    depended upon a citizenry with knowledge of what had gone before and a willingness to draw upon that
                    knowledge to prevent or remedy the abuses common in government, such as greed and lust for power.
                    Dunn, accordingly, believed that historical scholarship was inseparable from citizenship. Knowledge
                    from painstaking research in the documents, he believed, would make the past accessible as a
                    resource essential for sound public policy. One is reminded here of Dunn's contemporaries, Theodore
                    bsevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and another famous Hoosier of earlier years, General Lew Wallace.</p>
            <p>Dunn's contribution, Boomhower shows, originated in the liberal arts tradition of the Protestant
                    institutions of the nineteenth-century American Midwest (in this case the Methodist church and
                    Earlham College). Dunn used his inveterate optimism, faith in the judgment of an educated citizenry,
                    analytical abilities, and fascination with history to improve society. By the time his life was over
                    in 1924, at age sixty-nine, he had obtained a law degree from the University of <placeName>

                    (becoming its secretary) and the Indiana State Library (serving four years as state librarian). He
                    assisted in establishing a system of local public libraries in the state and was a major influence
                    in the state Democratic party. He helped to reform the government of <placeName>

                        Refined Religion.</hi> By David L. Kimbrough. (<placeName>

                    index. $35.00.)</head>
            <p>Readers of this journal should find David L. Kimbrough's study of the grandfather, indeed the family,
                    of Booth Tarkington of considerable interest. Carefully researched, lavishly documented, full of
                    intriguing anecdotes and asides, the volume will repay careful attention.</p>
            <p>The problems are few—the mistaken declaration that Methodist classes chose their own
                    leaders, exhorters, and even circuit riders (p. 3); the failure to recognize John Fletcher's <hi rend="i">Checks</hi> (1835) as a centerpiece of Methodist apologetics (p. 48); the
                    interpretation of "location" as moving to another circuit instead of leaving the
                    itinerancy altogether (p. 66); the failure to explain Joseph Tarkington's role as presiding elder,
                    his most important ministerial office (pp. 102ff.); the equation of early nineteenth-century
                    seminaries (secondary schools) with later theological seminaries. These few problem stand out
                    because of the otherwise erudite treatment of Methodism. The bibliography and citations are quite
                    remarkable, ranging from obscure early accounts to the most recent interpretive breakthroughs.</p>
            <p>More vexing is the organization of the volume, which chronicles the life of Tarkington and depicts
                    through his experience the transformation of Methodism from plain-style frontier, dualistic
                    evangelicalism into a genteel faith. Both tasks invite a chronological narration, in which direction
                    Kimbrough in fact proceeds successfully <pb n="262" id="VAA4025-094-3-072"/> for the first third of
                    the volume. And at times thereafter he advances conference year by conference year. The introduction
                    details the character of frontier Methodism, and the conclusion, in briefer fashion, describes its
                    genteel outcome. Those sections are quite instructive. Chapter one covers "Joseph
                    Tarkington's Birth and Early Life," and chapter two continues the theme of the
                    introduction—"Religion in Early Indiana." In these chapters and also in
                    chapter three, "The Tarkington Family Moves to Indiana," Kimbrough builds rather
                    nicely around the Tarkington autobiography.</p>
            <p>As his sections on Tarkington's ministerial career unfold, however, Kimbrough occasionally uses
                    flashbacks and asides that interrupt the narrative and provide information or insight that could
                    well have been used earlier. For instance, as Tarkington is being drawn from the role of class
                    leader into preaching and is taken to his first conference, Kimbrough provides an excursus on the
                    earlier development of Methodist conference structure (p. 57) that might more readily have come in
                    chapter two. At the end of the chapter (p. 67), he makes a similar reversion in time, here to
                    provide membership statistics for Methodism. In "A Young Preacher Weds," Kimbrough
                    understandably recalls the deceased Francis Asbury's injunctions that his preachers not marry, but
                    he then reverts to a discussion of the married estate among clergy from Cotton Mather on and of
                    female percentages among church members during and after the Revolution. Kimbrough uses Tarkington's
                    involvement with temperance in the later 1830s to rehearse the movement's earlier emergence (pp.
                    90–93). After settling Tarkington in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Greensburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in 1851, Kimbrough devotes the bulk of the chapter (pp. 109-18) to various
                    indices of Methodist gentility, ranging from the 1830s to the 1880s for data and detail.
                    Tarkington's roles in semi-retirement also invite thematic flashbacks (pp. 139, 142, 143, 150).</p>
            <p>In a more vexing defiance of chronology, Kimbrough carries the reader through the 1830s and 1840s,
                    proceeding conference year by conference year, without probing the growing sectional and slavery
                    crises. He slides over 1844 entirely, without mentioning the traumatic division of the church, and
                    recounts Tarkington's traveling to conference in 1845 with Bishop L. L. Hamline and editor Charles
                    Elliott, both central actors in the crisis, without comment. All such discussion is postponed to the
                    next to last chapter, "A Preacher Faces Slavery and the Civil War," in which the
                    author ranges over the entire course of Methodist history. For a book that seemingly tries to hold
                    issues together, the isolation of this topic is strange and unfortunate. It is also unfortunate that
                    a rich and insightful volume is marred by relatively trivial problems.</p>

               <hi rend="i">Journey to Hell: The Fiery Furnaces of Buchenwald.</hi> By J. Ray Clark. (Raleigh,

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Journey to Hell</hi> is a book for all who had a relative who served in the army in the
                    European theater during World War 11. It is a book about courage—the courage required to
                    engage in combat, to talk about it, and, finally, to write about it.</p>
            <p>No two soldiers fought the same war. What each endured is compared to and filtered through past
                    experiences, stored in imperfect memories, and recalled under varying circumstances. Many may label
                    others' stories as improbable or unbelievable and may conclude, "This never
                    happened." Why, then, would an old combat infantryman risk his reputation to tell his tale
                    of combat: simply because he feels it, like combat, must be done. Thousands of young men were
                    uprooted and forged into the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> armed forces in World War II. These young men won the war. Their stories need to be
                    told.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">Journey to Hell</hi> is the story of one young Hoosier taken from his home and in a few
                    months transformed into an infantryman. J. Ray Clark vividly describes infantry basic training, and
                    readers will sense the cocky optimism of the young men who left camp for Europe. In George S.
                    Patton's 3rd Army, Clark fought as a rifleman, carried a thirty-eight-pound radio, and manned a
                    bazooka in the 80th Infantry Division in <placeName>
                  <country reg="fr">France</country>, <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="au">Austria</country>
                    </placeName>. He and his buddies soon discovered that they did not really know how to survive in
                    combat. They made mistakes, and the survivors learned from them. Friends were killed, and the rest
                    fought on. Clark found that the less he knew about a replacement soldier the easier it was to accept
                    his eventual loss.</p>
            <p>Later, as hardened combat veterans, Clark and others were unprepared for the horrors of the
                    Buchenwald concentration camp. Clark titled his book <hi rend="i">Journey to Hell</hi> because, for
                    him, this camp was perhaps the culminating hell of his war experiences. He saw, could not
                    comprehend, then was ordered to move on. But the horror of the few hours he spent at Buchenwald has
                    haunted him for over fifty years.</p>
            <p>Clark's story could have been written by any of thousands who fought alongside him. Some could not
                    write because they died; others lacked the ability to write; fewer still had the courage to put
                    their memories on paper. All infantrymen should be proud of Clark's story for it evidences the
                    courage of them all.</p>

                    letters that <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> mayor Edward L. Jeffries and his friends exchanged in the course of World War II. The
                    project promises to reveal much about the city that has been a cauldron of economic and social
                    change throughout the twentieth century. Jeffries was first elected mayor in 1939 shortly after the
                    city was swept by an unprecedented working class insurgency. He presided over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> as it became the nation's center of war production and as it was racked by brutal, at
                    times bloody, racial conflict. And he left office in 1947, just as the city was beginning to undergo
                    a complex, and ultimately devastating, economic restructuring. Surely, in conversation with his most
                    intimate associates, Jeffries would have much to say about his struggles to govern amid such
                    profound transformations.</p>
            <p>Capeci portrays Jeffries and his friends—mostly newspapermen then serving in the armed
                    forces—as exemplars of civic duty and personal loyalty. Jefies's circle, Capeci writes in
                    his introduction, shared a "Periclean" concept of governance, committing
                    themselves to "independent leadership" in service to the entire community. Their
                    shared vision pushed them beyond professional association into personal commitment, binding them as
                    comrades who cared about, indeed loved, one another. This portrayal is moving but not convincing.
                    For the most part Jeffries's letters are simply chatty, full of city hall gossip, local political
                    news, and reports of the mayor's golf and card games. Jeffries's friends respond in kind, at least
                    until June, 1944, offering detailed, gently humorous descriptions of training camp routines and
                    military snafus. The exchanges can make for sprightly reading, and it is easy to see how they
                    sustained friendships; but they are hardly the stuff of Periclean virtue.</p>
            <p>Capeci's framework becomes even more problematic when it is placed alongside the larger story of
                    Jeffries's mayoralty. Facing progressive opponents in the 1943 and 1945 mayoral campaigns, Jeffries
                    ruthlessly played the race card, trading on the white hatred of African Americans that in the summer
                    of 1943 had caused two days of rioting and had left thirty-four Detroiters dead. Jeffries's letters
                    brush lightly over the race issue even in the riot's immediate aftermath. But there is no reason for
                    Capeci, who has written two important monographs on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s wartime race relations, to do likewise. In fact, Capeci needed to do the opposite, to
                    fill the silences of the letters either with his own commentary or with supplementary documents
                    drawn from newspaper stones, campaign speeches, or similar sources. For it is in the letters'
                    silences—in the problems left unaddressed, the injustices untreated—that
                    Jeffries most clearly <pb n="265" id="VAA4025-094-3-075"/> expresses himself. He was, as Capeci
                    suggests, a decent, even well intentioned man. But he dreamed no great dreams for his city or for
                    himself. He was, simply, a local politician who loved the camaraderie and competition of city hall
                    and who was willing to call on the most dangerous of impulses to maintain his place in that world.</p>

            <p>Indiana-born Ernie Pyle brought World War II home to the American people. His dispatches captured the
                    life and death of the G.I. from North Africa to the Pacific. Besides being America's most famous war
                    correspondent, Pyle was also one of the nation's most admired citizens. When he was killed by a
                    sniper's bullet on a Pacific island in April, 1945, his passing was compared to the death of
                    President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which had occurred a few days before.</p>
            <p>While newsreels showed battles and invasions, and while Edward R. Murrow brought to America the
                    sounds of the bombs falling over <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Pyle gave America a straightforward yet emotional account of G.I. Joe and his war. To
                    tell the soldiers' heroic tales, Pyle squatted in their foxholes, ate their K rations, and saw them
                    die. If he held back a little about the more horrible aspects of war, it was because he felt that
                    their families could take just so much. The troops loved Ernie and considered him one of their own;
                    even the generals said there was no finer soldier than Pyle and that by his stories he even aided
                    the war effort.</p>
            <p>Born on a farm near Dana, Indiana, in 1900, Pyle hated farming. In order to escape that confining
                    life he enrolled at Indiana University in 1919. Although he majored in economics, it was journalism
                    that held his attention. Soon he worked his way up to become editor of the Indiana University <hi rend="i">Daily Student.</hi> Before he graduated, Pyle left the university to work briefly as a
                    reporter on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">La Porte</settlement>

                    </placeName>, D.C., paper.</p>
            <p>Pyle began writing a successful column on aviation and then was made a roving reporter to write about
                    life in America. In his stories one can detect the development of his style—his
                    succinctness, the choice of the right word, and his ability to explain Americans to themselves. He
                    was able to identify with the people about whom he wrote. He became an American Everyman, who
                    described common men doing uncommon deeds.</p>
            <pb n="266" id="VAA4025-094-3-076"/>
            <p>As Pyle captured the pain and suffering of Depression America, he was suffering from a marriage that
                    was failing, doubts about himself, and constant ailments. Thus for Pyle the war was both a new
                    challenge and an escape. From 1942 until his death three years later, his columns became one of the
                    most important links between the home front and the boys overseas. As he had earlier in describing
                    the brave mail pilots and the frightened farmers of Indiana, Pyle wrote about the G.I. with
                    understanding and compassion. Similarly James Tobin in <hi rend="i">Ernie Pyle's War</hi> writes
                    with feeling and comprehension on this fascinating subject. A prizewinning reporter himself, Tobin
                    began his research on Pyle over a decade ago while writing a dissertation on World War II.</p>
            <p>By reading this useful, scholarly book along with some dispatches from Pyle's book <hi rend="i">Brave
                        Men</hi>, one will have a better understandmg of World War II and the G.I.'s who won it.</p>

            <p>Drat that Ken Burns. Ever since his series, American Civil War publications, always more prolix and
                    profitable than profound, have mushroomed exponentially. Gresham understood the likely results, and,
                    alas, this book is one more proof of his law.</p>
            <p>As the American Christ, Lincoln is the Great Icon, and this volume provides many familiar portraits
                    of him, along with cartoons, photographs of famous documents, and pictures of his friends, enemies,
                    assassins, and children, as well as several takes of the always unattractive Mary Todd Lincoln.
                    Interestingly enough, the earliest known photograph of Lincoln, included here, was taken in 1846,
                    and the next came in 1857. One therefore never sees the youthful man, although the full gallery of
                    images from the last eight years of his life is, of course, a fair representation of Lincoln's
                    meteoric rise to fame.</p>
            <p>Many of Lincoln's portraits show the ravages of depression. Indeed he was at times quite gaunt, an
                    indication, perhaps, that during his deeper bouts of what he called the "hypo,"
                    and described as a helpless, desperate condition, he could not eat. None of Lincoln's countervailing
                    humor shines through the photographs, for which Lincoln, in common with all sitters of his day, were
                    trained to sit motionless and be solemn.</p>
            <pb n="267" id="VAA4025-094-3-077"/>
            <p>Cecil K. Byrd and Ward W. Moore do not discuss states of mind or cultural styles of presentation of
                    self, nor do they analyze the photographers whose work they reproduce, nor the technology of their
                    medium. Instead they present a potted biography of Lincoln in pictures and captions that repeats
                    what readers are likely to know while omitting discussion of new ways of looking at history through
                    photographs, an approach quite well developed by now in the wider historical profession. In this
                    unannotated volume the editors cite none of the work being done in the cultural history written
                    about such images. With considerable innocence they use photographs of monuments designed well after
                    Lincoln's death to depict the historical Lincoln, especially during his youthful, unphotographed
                    years. Although they might have discussed such monuments as an historical genre in themselves, they
                    tend to take artists' imagined images of the young Lincoln as the equivalent of documents, which
                    they are not.</p>
            <p>Neither is the book handsome. The cover is most unattractive and the layout pedestrian, facts that
                    make this book, if inexpensive, not really suitable for the coffee table. In themselves some of the
                    photographs, especially of rarely seen minor characters, are quite fascinating, and Lincoln's visage
                    is always riveting. This reviewer can never decide if he was truly ugly or deeply handsome, but in
                    either event one can see in his face the ravages his office and the war brought him. Some physicians
                    have also seen in these photographs the effects of Marfan Syndrome, which might have brought him to
                    a premature death had John Wilkes Booth missed his mark.</p>

            <p>All seven essays point to the centrality of race in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history. The authors have employed a variety of historical techniques to illustrate the
                    problems that slavery and its adherents produced for this country, problems that have yet to be
                    resolved. From traditional political and diplomatic studies to examination of popular song texts to
                    intellectual history, each author demonstrates how disputes over race and slavery have shaped
                    American politics and society.</p>
            <p>Robert E. May of Purdue University illustrates convincingly that Republican and abolitionist
                    criticisms of antebellum presidents' actions against filibusters in the 1840s and 1850s lacked
                    substance. Official policy toward the filibusters was clearly aimed at stopping the expeditions and
                    invasions of Caribbean and Central American states; unofficial policy was often less coherent. These
                    antebellum presidents, however, consistently took steps to stop the adventurers. That they were
                    often unsuccessful demonstrates the inability of governments in the era to halt enterprising
                    adventurers. Richard J. McManus's essay on states rights doctrine in Republican party politics in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> in the 1850s serves as a corrective to common views of states rights as strictly a
                    southern phenomenon to legitimize slavery. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> states rights was employed by Republicans to fight the federal government's acceptance
                    of slavery. Peter Knupfer's study of the often forgotten Constitutional Union party of 1860
                    highlights generational politics and conflict both within the party and against the sectionalism
                    fostered in the Republican Democratic party duel.</p>
            <p>Louis S. Gerteis's essay on blackface minstrelsy in antebellum America is perhaps the most ambitious
                    of the collection. Unfortunately, his analysis of the role and meaning of the art form is
                    unsuccessful, owing in no small part to his weak attempt to match early-nineteenth-century social
                    Darwinism to a facile reading of the texts of popular songs sung in American theaters. Ira Berlin's
                    strong essay on who freed the slaves brings the reader back onto firmer ground with his conclusion
                    supporting the view that slaves and black soldiers took the lead in emancipation during the Civil
                    War. Brooks D. Simpson shows General Ulysses S. Grant to have been sympathetic to the circumstances
                    of black soldiers who fought for freedom in the war and appreciative of the soldiers' predicament
                    during their occupation duty in the Reconstruction-era South. David W. Blight's excellent essay on
                    race and the memory of the Civil War shows the price paid for forgetting the origins of the
                    rebellion and wallowing in a mythological past built on white supremacy and white nationalism.</p>

            <p>Civil War historians have been blessed in the past ten years with the publication of numerous
                    diaries, letters, and reminiscences penned by Union and Confederate enlisted men or company
                    officers. Now added to this collection is Sergeant Ambrose Remley's letters and
                    "memorandum," published by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>

                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana. Remley served throughout the war in Company E, 72nd Indiana Volunteer
                    Infantry, a regiment that formed part of Colonel John Thomas Wilder's legendary "Lightning
                    Brigade." Armed with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spencer</settlement>
                    </placeName> repeating rifles and serving as mounted infantry, Wilder's men became famous for
                    seizing strategic Hoover's Gap during the Tullahoma Campaign of 1863 and making a tenacious stand
                    when part of the Union Army of the Cumberland was routed at the Battle of Chickamauga the same year.
                    The 72nd Indiana also participated in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Atlanta</settlement>
                    </placeName> Campaign and, after Wilder resigned, General James Wilson's cavalry raid to capture
                    Selma, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="alu">Alabama</region>
                    </placeName>, and Macon, <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>. The brigade was thus one of the most singular and, until recently, most unrecognized
                    organizations in the Union Army.</p>
            <p>Remley's letters and memorandum contain useful information for anyone studying the life of the common
                    soldier in the Union's western armies. Remley often commented on his health, rations, and officers
                    and on the battles and skirmishes in which he participated, the activities at home, and the living
                    conditions in camp and on the march. He was obviously anxious to keep those in Indiana informed of
                    the regiment's service and the ways in which the men from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName> were coping with life "at the front." For the most part his writings
                    make interesting reading, especially if a student of the period has not delved into many published
                    "common soldier" letter collections from the Midwest.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, some of the letters contain simply a brief recounting of Remley's activities without
                    extraordinary detail regarding the activities of his regiment or the Lightning Brigade. A reader
                    expecting extensive information and anecdotes about the fight at Hoover's Gap or the Battle of
                    Chickamauga, the operations of the brigade, or other aspects of its unusual service as mounted
                    infantry will lament that Remley wrote so sparingly.</p>
            <p>The notes and explanatory text by Dale Edward Linvill are largely adequate and accurate but do
                    contain a few spelling and factual errors. For instance, a photograph of Remley's postwar Grand Army
                    of the Republic canteen (p. 62) is instead identified as the one <pb n="270" id="VAA4025-094-3-080"/> he carried during his service. To Linvill's credit, however, two very helpful sections are
                    included in the work, namely, Remley's biography and a family genealogy, which enable the reader to
                    follow Remley's civilian life and trace the persons referred to in his writings. The maps included
                    in the book were taken from the atlas accompanying the <hi rend="i">Official Records</hi>, and while
                    some are clearly reproduced, others are not so readable.</p>
            <p>Overall, the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Montgomery County</region>
                    </placeName> Historical Society should be commended for publishing this work. It is a solid
                    collection of Civil War material by an articulate Hoosier soldier, and although Remley did not
                    provide all the details one might hope for, any accounts by a member of Wilder's Brigade are
                    certainly worth reading.</p>

            <p>After providing a brief historical perspective contrasting myths with the realities of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> communities during the Gilded Age, Michael Lewis Goldberg analyzes the importance of
                    gender as it affected political and social circles. Initially the author focuses on the rise of the
                    Woman Movement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName>, but later he broadens his scope to include the connections of the Woman Movement with
                    other groups such as the Farmers' Alliance and the Populist party, which shared an interest in
                    women's rights. Considerable attention is given to strategies employed by these groups to influence
                    the ruling Republican leaders and in some cases also the Democrats.</p>
            <p>The Woman Movement in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> provided a political platform for urban, Anglo, middle-class women. Members of the
                    movement intended to infuse the major political parties with respectable values, to banish chicanery
                    and patronage, and to attack voter apathy and ignorance. Two organizations, the Women's Christian
                    Temperance Union (WCTU) and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> Equal Suffrage Association (KESA) made up the major components of the movement. The
                    author compares and contrasts the membership of these organizations. A particularly interesting part
                    of the analysis deals with the context in which many members held nativist, racist, and classist
                    beliefs that shaped the formation of their ideology and affected the selection of political
                    strategies and tactics. The author explains how these narrow views made outreach to other
                    constituencies such as rural women and black women difficult and often led to innovative strategies
                    that allowed members to retain their views and still support the cause.</p>
            <pb n="271" id="VAA4025-094-3-081"/>
            <p>Organizers for the Farmers' Alliance had to convince isolated, rural people that they should have an
                    effective political voice. Here again the intent was to improve the tone of the contemporary
                    political scene. The alliance ideally encouraged women to exercise an equal political voice, but
                    leadership rhetoric sometimes undermined this support. Nevertheless, strategies were devised to
                    encourage the participation of rural women. For example, instead of the Woman Movement's
                    conventional confinement to the parlor, the alliance used gender-inclusive spaces to create
                    family-based political communities. Schoolhouses, picnic groves, and other community gathering
                    places provided spaces hospitable to both women and men.</p>
            <p>The Woman Movement, the Farmers' Alliance, and affiliated groups all had to come to grips with the
                    dilemma of partisan politics. Ideologically, they preferred to remain nonpartisan, but in practice
                    these groups had to figure out how to wield power by influencing those in control of political
                    parties. In <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>
                    </placeName> this meant coming to terms in some measure with the Republican leaders. The author
                    provides insight into the complicated political negotiations at local and state levels.</p>
            <p>The influence of a number of national figures such as Carrie Chapman Catt and Susan B. Anthony is
                    mentioned, but a major contribution of this work lies in the inclusion of less well known figures
                    such as Fanny Rastall and Laura Johns, whose efforts to organize and confront the entrenched
                    political machines were exceptional. These detailed descriptions of political confrontation at the
                    local and state level add an important dimension to the understanding of political change during the
                    pursuit of women's rights.</p>
            <p>This work by including gender as a primary variable has provided a provocative and more realistic
                    analysis of political intrigue during the Gilded Age.</p>

                    Folk occupied a position near the latter end of that spectrum. Many of his contemporaries, including
                    Lincoln Steffens and William Allen White, saw him in that way; so have later scholars, from Thomas

                    repeats that interpretation. It must be true.</p>
            <p>Some years ago Richard L. McCormick, writing in the <hi rend="i">American Historical Review</hi>
                    (April, 1981), proposed that "The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics" had
                    much to do with the emergence of Progressivism, and Steven L. Piott's biography lends weight to that
                    hypothesis. Folk discovered corruption and became a Progressive. He did so when the moral values he
                    had acquired growing up in a Baptist and prosperous family in small-town <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName> clashed with what he saw in the big and dynamic city (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>) to which, as a young man of twenty-four, he had moved in 1893, hoping for success as a
                    lawyer. Elected as the city's circuit attorney in 1900, he prosecuted for election fraud and bribery
                    a political boss, Edward <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Butler</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and other individuals from the closely linked realms of business and politics. What
                    Folk learned, Piott writes, "was that big business corrupted politics by bribing
                    politicians; that municipal government was conducted for the interests of private business and not
                    for the common good; and that corruption in municipal government was a problem of national
                    proportions that threatened the very existence of democratic government" (p. 61). Folk's
                    actions and the publicity they received, from Steffens among others, led to his election as governor
                    in 1904. In that office Folk stood for what he called the "<placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
                    </placeName> Idea," which, according to the biographer, "necessitated the
                    unrelenting exposure and punishment of official grafters and the transformation of public office
                    into a public trust where elected officials would work for civic good and not for private
                    gain" (p. 73).</p>
            <p>Folk's battles made him nationally prominent and even a presidential possibility but did not move him
                    up the political ladder. Geiger offered an explanation. While regarding Folk as one of the state's
                    best governors who "did much for the cause of good government" and "was
                    never forgetful of his allegiance to the public he served," this biographer argued that
                    Folk did not have a "firm philosophy or body of principles around which to construct a
                    unified program of action." He lacked a "great theme of humanitarianism or social
                    justice to fire the hearts of man" (pp. 171-72). Piott challenges this appraisal, arguing
                    that Folk's "political vision" broadened during his governorship to include
                    "intensified opposition to special interests; greater direct, democratic participation in
                    the political process; and expanding the scope of government regulation" (p. 116).
                    Furthermore, the new biographer writes that Geiger and others "judge Folk more by what he
                    failed to do than by what he did and adopt a judgmental tone that suggests a criticism hardened by
                    modern-day cynicism" (p. 187). Piott's interpretation values highly Folks collaboration
                    with Steffens and the two men's efforts to reform the political process, and his explanation for the
                    Missourian's failure to rise higher in American politics <pb n="273" id="VAA4025-094-3-083"/>
                    stresses, in addition to his personality, opposition from the "pro-business
                    faction" in his party (p. 121).</p>
            <p>The book is a valuable addition to the literature on <placeName>

                    </placeName>'s political history. Clearly written, it rests on a solid base composed mainly of
                    newspapers and the relevant scholarship, including Geiger's biography, Thelen's history, and Piott's
                    own study, <hi rend="i">The Anti-Monopoly Persuasion: Popular Resistance to the Rise of Big Business
                        in the Midwest</hi> (1985). Unfortunately, Folk's papers make no more than a small contribution.

            <p>After a short introductory essay about the planning and preparation of Forest Park for the fair, the
                    authors organized the book into twenty-one chapters, each focusing on a particular venue or event.
                    Each chapter begins with a one-page introductory essay followed by eight to twenty pages of gorgeous
                    photographs. The final section of the book gives a paragraph or so of background on each of the

                    showcasing photographs. These pictorial layouts are quite impressive. Unfortunately, no new
                    scholarly ground is broken here. In fact, this book is virtually devoid of cultural criticism. For
                    example, William J. McGee's (in)famous anthropology exhibit that ordered humans of different
                    ethnicities from "most civilized" to "least civilized" receives
                    only a few meager paragraphs. Those readers who are looking for a book that adds to <pb n="274" id="VAA4025-094-3-084"/> an understanding of the fair's impact on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> or the goals of fair planners themselves should look elsewhere (to works such as Robert
                    W. Rydell's <hi rend="i">All the World's A Fair</hi>, 1984).</p>
            <p>Although the authors make clear in the acknowledgments that they had limited goals, discussion of a
                    number of relevant topics would have improved the book. What, for example, did the fair's organizers
                    hope the celebration would do for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>? How did the fair's theme of "industrial progress" compare with

                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> history? Furthermore, the theme was remarkably similar to themes of both the Veiled
                    Prophet parades of the late nineteenth century and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pageant and Masque of 1914. Veiled Prophet organization members, fair planners, and
                    pageant organizers usually came from the same segment of <placeName>

                    </placeName> society and believed these events provided important chances to engage in civic
                    instruction of the population. Some sort of attempt to place the themes of the World's Fair in
                    context with those of other civic events would have added to an understanding of the fair's place in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> history and does not seem outside the scope of the book.</p>
            <p>The World's Fair of 1904 is often looked upon by St. Louisans nostalgically as the high point of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">St. Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s history and place in the world. While this beautiful book succeeds in showcasing the
                    society's wonderful collection of fair photographs, it does little more than add to this nostalgia
                    for the World's Fair Era."</p>

            <p>This book, edited by two well-known figures in twentieth century western history, consists of an
                    introduction by Earl Pomeroy and eight essays on various topics. The topics include economic
                    history, natural resources and the environment, urban development, politics, women, cultural
                    history, and the myth of the West. The final chapter by Gene M. Gressley attempts to reach
                    conclusions about the previous essays and to provide some overarching ideas and possibilities for
                    the future course of western history. The central purpose of the book is to encourage new research
                    and to suggest possible topics that merit scholarly investigation.</p>
            <p>Are there significant themes that emerge from the eight essays? One such theme seems to be the
                    unevenness of previous coverage of <pb n="275" id="VAA4025-094-3-085"/> topics. While some subjects
                    have been researched adequately, several writers point out that others have received little or no
                    attention. A related criticism is that western historians have too often failed to relate their
                    studies to the national and global scenes. This weakness, as Gressley particularly stresses, is a
                    serious flaw because recent western events have increasingly been connected to overseas trends and
                    developments. Some of the writers seem to concentrate too much on what has been done in the field
                    and provide too few suggestions as to what needs to be done. Gerald D. Nash's essay on economic
                    history and Glenda Riley's chapter on western women, however, both display a complete mastery of
                    their subjects and contain excellent proposals for future research.</p>
            <p>Although none of the writers are identified strongly with the New Western History, passages devoted
                    to the environment, minorities, women, urban development, the western myth, and cultural
                    developments reveal the influence of that school. In line with the New Western History, the field
                    has greatly broadened in terms of the topics now covered and in a tendency to expand focus into the
                    twentieth century.</p>
            <p>Books such as this are not always enjoyable reading, but they are extremely important. The essays in
                    the present study allow readers to gauge recent trends in twentieth-century western history and to
                    see some of the possibilities for additional research opportunities.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the late nineteenth century. The areas of origin in <placeName>

                    </placeName> (Mecklenburg) and in Sweden (Dalsland) produced a relatively small slice of the
                    immigrant populations of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> and may not be representative of those specific groups or their unmarried female
                    immigrants. Even so some of the behaviors of these newcomers in the Windy City appear to be typical.
                    The Polish and Irish samples, on the face of it, seem to be more representative of their
                    compatriots.</p>
            <p>Christiane Harzig's study of these four groups of single women contends that (1) single women
                    improved their lives and enjoyed <pb n="276" id="VAA4025-094-3-086"/> more personal freedom in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> than in their homeland villages. (2) Immigrant women found a better marriage market in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> where the immigrant male to female ratio was often two to one. Polish women whose main
                    goal was marriage went from being single to more than 80 percent married within four years of
                    arrival. (3) First-generation immigrant women married their own kind at the 95 percent-plus level.
                    (4) Single immigrant women seldom associated with Anglo-American women or those not from their
                    ethnolinguistic group. (5) Although Harzig writes in her introduction that "suffrage and
                    temperance had little attraction for ethnic women" (p. 18), she does not seem to consider
                    sufficiently the Swedish chapter, which shows (and other evidence not in this book confirms) that a
                    sizable body of Swedish immigrants, including many maids, were attracted to temperance societies,
                    temperance halls, temperance cafes, and similar places. (6) Divorce rates were low in both the
                    sending and receiving societies. (7) As Harzig states in her introduction, "Romantic love
                    had been an alien concept to peasant cultures but became more important in Chcago." Dowries
                    also became less common as the economic worth of single-women wage earners rose and because of the
                    favorable (for women) sex ratios. Although none of these findings is particularly novel or
                    noteworthy for immigration scholars, they are interestingly told in several chapters.</p>
            <p>The chapters dealing with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> experience of the Irish, Polish, and Swedish samples are the strongest in the book. By
                    comparison the German chapter is disappointing for the shallowness of its research and for its
                    slender gender content—only six of the thirty-seven pages deal with women.</p>
            <p>In sharp contrast is the story of the Irish, which is much more detailed and better contextualized.
                    Deirdre Mageean highlights the occupational changes occurring among Irish-American women. The first
                    generation worked primarily as domestic servants, waitresses, and kitchen help. The second
                    generation was the beneficiary of upward mobility through education. The vital role of the Catholic
                    schools and training institutions in educating single Irish women as teachers and nurses, Mageean
                    points out, produced a white collar and professional class that nearly doubled that of their Irish
                    male counterparts—8.5 to 4 percent for professionals and 25 to 16 percent for white
                    collars on the job by 1900. This chapter also chronicles the disproportionately large role of
                    Irish-American female union organizers and leaders, including the head of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> Teachers Union, a "Petticoat Butcher" who led strikes in the
                    stockyards, and of course the famous Mother Jones. Partly as an explanation of why the Irish female
                    immigrants broke with old world conservativism, Mageean adds, "Unlike Polish and German
                    Catholicism, the Irish religious were not transmitters of ethnic identity; indeed parishes
                    accelerated the assimilation of Irish immigrants into American life" (p. 259).</p>
            <pb n="277" id="VAA4025-094-3-087"/>
            <p>Also interesting is Maria Anna Knothe's study of Polish women from a village in Austrian <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>. Knothe shows how the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> marriage market for Polish singles "cured" the illegitimacy problem
                    (small as it was at this time). Knothe writes that since men outnumbered women in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Polonia "even a poor, not particularly pretty woman could easily find a
                    husband" (pp. 314 15). Whereas many writers have argued that urbanization of rural people
                    disrupted family patterns and caused high rates of bastardy in big cities, Knothe's evidence shows
                    just the opposite for Polish <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Between 1894 and 1902 when the illegitimacy rate was 7.5 percent for all births in <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> it shrank to less than 1 percent (0.9) for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s Polish section. Lopsided sex ratios in favor of women turned the tide. The findings
                    of this small case sample casts some doubt on the widely held belief that cities cause urban
                    pathologies.</p>
            <p>The Swedish maids chapter by Margareta Matovic points out how Svenska Flickas in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> were much more independent minded than their Baltic counterparts from <placeName>
                        <country reg="pl">Poland</country>
                    </placeName> and North <placeName>
                        <country reg="gw">Germany</country>
                    </placeName> and more like the Irish. Lacking the English language fluency of their Hibernian
                    counterparts, they gravitated toward domestic labor. "Being a live-in servant in a
                    millionaire's home was the top of the career ladder," Matovic writes (p. 296). Some
                    housemaids in middle-and upper-income homes were treated very well: they sometimes had their own
                    rooms and private baths and shared in much of their employer's way of life. "It was a

                    Living at the top end of the social register made some of them picky about their marriage partners
                    and reluctant to marry young working-class Swedish lads for fear of falling back into a lower class
                    life. In any event the parallels between the independence of the Irish second generation as
                    expressed by the upward mobility and the Swedish maids who married later or sometimes not at all is
                    an interesting similarity.</p>

                    collection that enriches knowledge of the immigrant experience and underscores how homeland

            <p>At the end of the twentieth century numerous social commentators have criticized Americans for their
                    retreat from public spaces and expressions of public solidarity. Suburban "gated
                    communities" spatially reflect this sense of isolation, and politics of exclusion and
                    divisiveness do so socially. Before rushing to judgment, however, these social commentators should
                    first read Mary P. Ryan's fascinating new book on public life in the nineteenth-century city. In so
                    doing they would learn that social and political isolationism is far from recent; for more than a
                    century Americans have steadily removed themselves from the public arena and into more homogenous
                    social groupings and spatial settings.</p>
            <p>Concentrating on three representative cities—<placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New
                            York</region>, <settlement type="city">San Francisco</settlement>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName>—Ryan presents this argument by tracing the evolution of public life in the
                    mid-nineteenth century. She sees three distinct phases in this evolution. First is the period 1825
                    to 1850, in which Ryan finds public life and democracy in its fullest (relative to the other two
                    periods) expression. In this period political, economic, racial, and gender debates were carried on
                    (generally) peacefully in public spaces—open markets and squares, public buildings, and,
                    most important for Ryan, on the streets during parades. In the second section Ryan turns to what she
                    calls the "interregnum," the period 1850 to 1865. Here, Ryan argues that the Civil
                    War was actually the conclusion of a longer history of "civic wars" fought in
                    American cities during the 1850s. As issues of race and ethnicity dominated American cities, earlier
                    peaceful methods for debate began to be replaced by violence, vigilantism, and militarism. In the
                    final section Ryan shows how public life had moved far from its original meaning, as class identity
                    and social isolation replaced earlier, more inclusive displays of the "public."</p>
            <p>Ryan's analysis is compelling and draws on a range of historical source material. She also writes
                    clearly and is not averse to throwing in occasional editorial comments. If her analysis lacks
                    anything, it would be in the absence of a critical examination of religion as a social variable.
                    Throughout the book Ryan treats religion as a byproduct of ethnicity—Irish Catholics
                    against the Anglo-Protestants, for example—rather than as its own phenomenon with
                    distinct sources of tension. Similarly, an analysis of the black church would have enhanced the
                    discussions of black-white racial tension. Given the black church's role in modem civil rights
                    battles and as the "public face" of the African-American community, it surely
                    played an important part in nineteenth-century racial politics. The other quibble concerns the
                    absence of maps. So much of the book—the central theme, <pb n="279" id="VAA4025-094-3-089"/> in fact—treats "urban space," yet apart
                    from a few early street maps, the book lacks any geographic signposts. In several instances, for
                    example, when Ryan describes a Fourth of July parade route or a neighborhood's social composition, a
                    map would have enabled this reader to "locate" the goings-on more easily.</p>
            <p>Although the book does not discuss Indiana or its cities, local readers will nevertheless find much
                    value in Ryan's enjoyable and informative work that should contribute to the continuing social
                    analysis of public life in the coming years.</p>

            <p>Beautifully designed and printed, lucidly written, this little book covers the usual ground. It
                    relates the White House meeting of the joint chiefs of staff with President Harry S. Truman on June
                    18, 1945, in which the decision was taken to invade the southernmost Japanese home island, Kyushu,
                    on November 1, 1945, with invasion of Honshu, the Tokyo plain, scheduled for April 1, 1946. After
                    the test of the plutonium bomb on July 16 (a warning went out from the Potsdam Conference on July
                    26, which the Japanese government spurned), the bombings on August 6 and 9 ended the war on August
                    14. One of the best things about this book is the author's willingness to say that it was the second
                    bomb, not Russian entry into the war the preceding day, that persuaded the Japanese military to go
                    along with the civil members of the cabinet and surrender.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the author, a historian in the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, is not as evenhanded as he
                    seems, and the unhappy debate among historians and political scientists over use of nuclear weapons
                    on Hiroshima and Nagasaki will go on—with sides taken frequently out of emotion,
                    ignorance, or memory of the Cold War (Gar Alperovitz opened the debate in 1965 with his book
                    contending that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> dropped the bombs not to end World War II but to impress the Russians). The first
                    evidence of J. Samuel Walker's point of view is his use of the word "myth" to
                    describe the argument that President Truman did not face a stark choice between invasion of the
                    Japanese home islands and use of the bombs. A second appears in his assertion that scholars agreed
                    in deploring cancellation of the proposed text for an exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in <placeName>

                    <pb n="280" id="VAA4025-094-3-090"/> defending itself against American imperialism. The book says
                    little, almost nothing, about possible casualties on Kyushu, implying that such discussion would be
                    (to use a recent academic word) counterfactual: the invasion never happened. The truth is that
                    Japanese force levels on Kyushu rose rapidly after the White House meeting on June 18, from an
                    estimated 350,000 to 900,000. The figure for estimated casualties offhandedly mentioned by General
                    George C. Marshall at the meeting, 31,000 (deaths would have been one out of three or four) became
                    irrelevant. The one million figure for casualties in the invasion of <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName> mentioned after the war by former secretary of war Henry L. Stimson and by President
                    Truman was far from unbelievable. In an astonishing assertion, Walker says that scholars now are
                    united in believing the bombs unnecessary. He does not say that the half-dozen books published on
                    the fiftieth anniversary of Hiroshima divided evenly, pro and con. One of the three
                    "pro" books maintained that an invasion of Kyushu could easily have cost 150,000 <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> deaths. This figure did not include the 100,000 Allied captives in <placeName>
                        <country reg="ja">Japan</country>
                    </placeName>; the Japanese vice-minister of war already had issued the order for their deaths, by
                    any available means, when the first American soldier set foot on Kyushu. Nor did it include
                    casualties possible in the invasion of Honshu, to follow Kyushu. What was Marshall to do when faced
                    with such a holocaust? Until the end of his life in 1959 he insisted that the bombs were necessary.
                    So did Truman.</p>

                    his service with General William T. Sherman from the spring of 1864 to May, 1865. More than a story
                    of the Civil War, this volume chronicles the growth of a twenty-one-year-old private into a
                    twenty-four-year-old major during a bloody war. From an ingenuous, idealistic, ambitious recruit
                    Wills matured into a war-weary officer who was a keen observer of his world. After helping to repel
                    an attack by the <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName> militia in November, 1864, he described the dead and dying as "old grey-haired
                    and weakly-looking men and little boys, not over 15 years old… I hope we will never have
                    to shoot at such men again. They knew nothing at all about fighting…." Wills
                    entered the war to save the Union; his early comments about slaves "lacked sympathy, even
                    decency" (p. ix). Even his eventual acceptance of emancipation and black soldiers probably
                    resulted from the increased opportunities for white officers to command black regiments.
                    Nonetheless, he was bothered by the anomalies of the slave society. Unlike many of his
                    contemporaries whose Civil War experiences have been published, Wills was a witty, talented writer.
                    His letters and diary are not only highly informative but fascinating as well. Described as a
                    "neglected classic" (p. vii) and "one of the finest collections of Civil
                    War letters ever published" (Peter Cozzens, <hi rend="i">The Terrible Sound</hi>, 1992),
                    this volume certainly merited reprinting. <hi rend="i">Lorna Lutes Sylvester, Indiana University, <placeName>

                    </placeName>, published a history of his town. New Ulm had been settled by Germans in the 1850s and
                    forty years later still proudly retained its ethnic identity. Strasser and other contributors told
                    of <pb n="282" id="VAA4025-094-3-092"/> the devastations wrought by the Sioux uprising of 1862 and
                    by natural disasters such as locust plagues and tornadoes; they also wrote glowingly of the schools,
                    industries, businesses, and general prosperity of their town. Strasser portrayed New Ulm as a
                    shining example of "German enterprise, German steadiness, and German success" with
                    "amazing" growth, "outstanding" new buildings, and
                    "hardworking, decent, easygoing, honest" citizens (p. 22). As a fine example of
                    late nineteenth-century civic boosterism with a strong ethnic element, this document should be of
                    considerable interest to scholars of nineteenth-century immigration and ethnicity. <hi rend="i">Dawn

                    </placeName>, OH 45459.) For all the books currently in print about the Shakers, there is still
                    relatively little published information about the western communities. Sites, and the remainders of
                    sites, are scattered through <placeName>

               </placeName>, and Indiana, but less than a handful are
                    well-known enough to attract much tourism. Boice and her coauthors seek to remedy this situation
                    with a series of maps and essays on the major sites of western Shaker settlement. The essays
                    themselves, reflecting the book's multiple authorship, are of varying length and degree of detail.
                    As the title indicates, however, the detailed site maps will probably be of primary interest, both
                    to historians and tourists. <hi rend="i">Dawn Bakken, Indiana University, <placeName>
