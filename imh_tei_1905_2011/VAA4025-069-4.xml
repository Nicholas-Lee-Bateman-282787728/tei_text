            <p>On November 18, 1899, a lecture tour across seven mid-western states took William Dean Howells to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he read his standard lecture, "Novels and Novel Writing," at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName> Church. Next day he wrote his wife: "Well, I had another great and good
                    audience last night—some 1200, of the <hi rend="i">élite</hi>—the
                    tickets being to be had only by invitation. I was caught up into the silken arms of the aristocracy
                    from the moment I arrived … ."<hi rend="sup">1</hi> His lecture was sponsored by
                    the city's five leading literary clubs, members and guests of which alone could attend.
                    Intensely proud of their own literary tradition, these Hoosiers regarded Howells'
                    appearance as the cultural if not the social event of the season. A later writer, likening
                    Howells' sojourn to that of "a visiting potentate," believes that a
                    "presidential candidate today might command no more homage than Howells received in <placeName>

                    study of the itinerary and press coverage of the tour, found but "one derogatory
                    account" of a Howells lecture, "that one a very mild reproof" in the
                            <placeName>

                    adulation pervaded every account of every lecture reported by the press while the author was on
                    tour." Unaccountably, however, Meserole gives only passing mention to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> lecture.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> This virtual omission is regrettable, for the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> press coverage of Howells' visit was unusually extensive and not altogether
                    adulatory. On the contrary, it shows, amid routine homage, the strong hostility of some Hoosiers
                    towards Howells. And the uneasiness was mutual, though that fact was scarcely apparent until after
                    the guest had gone.</p>
            <p>On this tour, Howells was appearing before patrons of lyceum lecturing for only the
                    second—and last—time in his crowded career. Because of an intense aversion to
                    lecturing, he had long resisted the lucrative contracts that repeatedly lured nearly all of his
                    literary contemporaries, including such close friends as Mark Twain and James Whitcomb Riley, to the
                    lecture trails for series of enervating one night stands. Then, in the spring of 1897, he yielded to
                    Major James Burton Pond, manager of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s leading lecture bureau, and read a lecture "eight or ten
                    times" to select audiences in <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>,

                    </placeName>. "But," he complained to Samuel Clemens, "it was ghastly
                    work; and though Pond, when he had once tasted my blood, wanted to suck me dry, he could not offer
                    me enough for his supper. I found that I could get more out of writing than talking, and so that
                    ends it."<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

                        cursorily. Of the "more than thirty newspapers" (p. 341) which reported the
                        lecture, he mentions nine. Those in <placeName>

            <p>And that did end it, for a time, but in the spring of 1899 Howells yielded again to Pond and
                    contracted for the extensive tour that fall. Almost at once he regretted it. That summer at his
                    retreat in Kittery, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="meu">Maine</region>
                    </placeName>, his spirits were overcast by "the blight of lecturing," as he wrote
                    Clemens ten days before the tour began. "I am sick of it already," he said.
                    "Perhaps I shall write you of my luck; but I can't talk of it now."<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Nor could he talk of it during the tour, but six weeks after it was over he
                    recounted, with shudders still evident behind the words, how much "misery" and
                    "suffering" the experience had caused him. Each night he was unnerved before
                    mounting the platform, embarrassed by his introducer's praises, abased by the need to
                    interest and amuse his audience, and depleted by the lecture and the reception afterwards. Then
                    nervous strain prevented sleep, so he wrote, "till I got up and drugged myself with
                    trional, or soaked myself with whiskey. After that came a few hours of blessed stupor."
                    Irregular travel schedules also drained him, as did the social demands. "I had to be
                    lunched and recepted and dined and supped," he told Clemens. "The worst of it was
                    that I was meeting nice, kind, intelligent people all the time, whom I liked and respected, and who
                    wished to be good to me; but it was killing me, and I was a wretched ghost before them."
                    Although his wretchedness was never allowed to show, it was particularly acute when he reached <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, since by then he had not had "one night's natural sleep"
                    for an entire month.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was another, more cogent, reason for disquiet when he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. That city was eminent for the extraordinary number of published authors within or just
                    beyond its bounds, and the literary taste of those authors, like that of their readers, ran
                    overwhelmingly to the historical romance. As everyone knew, Howells relentlessly condemned such
                    "romanticistic" fiction on the grounds that it purveyed a false, impossibly
                    idealized view of life. Quite as relentlessly he championed a "realistic," more
                    true to life fiction. His critical dictums had made him the focus of the vituperative Realism War,
                    which he had waged from the "Editor's Study" of <hi rend="i">Harper's Monthly</hi> from 1886 to 1892 and intermittently <list type="footnotes">

                    every important magazine and newspaper in the land. This fight for American public taste had not
                    gone well for Howells and his disciples. Praising Emile Zola and Leo Tolstoy for their superior
                    artistry and insights had only gained Howells a reputation as a lover of filth. The work of such
                    promising young realists as Stephen Crane and Hamlin Garland, which he supported, was ignored, while
                    George Du Maurier's <hi rend="i">Trilby</hi> and Anthony Hope's <hi rend="i">The
                        Prisoner of Zenda,</hi> both published in 1894, literally set loose "a flood of favor
                    for the neoromantics at their shoddiest and most sensational." The flood crested just
                    before and after the turn of the century when "the schools of irresponsible, neoromantic

                    </placeName>, a formidable stronghold of the enemy faction, to assail in his lecture a type of
                    writing that many Hoosiers cherished. He knew only too well that Indiana authors "dominated

                                under the banner of the realists, with moderate success. Howells had thought them
                                promising. As editor of the <hi rend="i">Atlantic</hi> until 1881, he had printed some
                                of their work and encouraged them in reviews. Later, both Hoosiers not only went with
                                the tide of romance but attacked the creed of realism with vehemence. Thompson was
                                especially virulent. Stung, perhaps, by his large indebtedness to Howells, which
                                included Howells' having helped to find a publisher for two of
                                Thompson's books and having found a job for Thompson on <hi rend="i">The

                    attached to James Whitcomb Riley, portrayer in dialectal poetry of the unsophisticated Indiana

                    pastoral nymphs, he shrewdly alternated poems of pure sentiment with the coarser stuff, so that his

                    escorted Howells to a suite at the fashionable Bates House, where the visitor was greeted by still
                    other representatives of the literary societies and was interviewed by reporters from three city
                    papers, the <hi rend="i">Journal, Sentinel,</hi> and <hi rend="i">News.</hi> The <hi rend="i">Journal's</hi> interview was the least perfunctory, and also the most personal.
                    Readers learned, if they did not already know, that the sixty-two year old Howells was short and
                    rotund, gray of hair and mustache, kindly of face, courtly in manner; that he lived with his wife
                    and daughter on West Fifty-ninth Street in <placeName>

                    appearing serially in <hi rend="i">Harper's Monthly,</hi> would end in another installment
                    or two. He was quoted as saying he enjoyed writing <hi rend="i">The Story of a Play</hi> (1898) more
                    than any other novel because he knew he "was `getting at it.'" Pecked out
                    on a typewriter, that book related the domestic affairs of a young woman whom he termed, the
                    reporter noted, "a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

                    lecture tour "with all the enthusiasm of an enterprising actor telling of the
                    `business' he had played to in various places." Despite some unspecified
                    "frosts" the tour had been, he said, "successful beyond my

            <p>To this report the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> added that the author distinguished carefully between
                    writers of the East and West, saying the former were specializing in short stories and the latter in
                    the longer, more demanding genre. Both groups were American, however, and, as he stated in his
                    lecture that evening, had a better sense of form than European writers. He was said to consider
                    Indiana authors to be among the most promising in the country, and he had high praise for
                    Tarkington's first effort.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Indeed, Howells' estimate of

                    Howells, he was horrified at being asked to sing a solo without accompaniment before "this

                    sing than words to decline, so had struggled through "at a pitch Nature had never planned
                    for him." If Howells remembered the embarrassed soloist's
                    "unintentional" sounds, he graciously chose to say he did not. In any case
                    Tarkington felt better for having explained.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>

            <p>As for the content of the lecture, the earnest newspaper reports show that Howells presented
                    essentially the staple and familiar items of his critical doctrine, holding for the novel as the
                    great intellectual and moral force of the time, realistic fiction over the romance, flesh and blood
                    characters over romantic types, the ordinary over the extraordinary, and, for their truthfulness in
                    art, such realistic writers as Daniel Defoe, Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, Zola, and
                    Tolstoy over Sir Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and William Makepeace Thackeray. "I take as
                    my choice," he said, "the real novel … as being the highest type of
                    fiction. If I could, I would have novels subjected to the principles that govern an honest man. It
                    is easier to fib than to tell the truth about life." Interspersed throughout the lecture

                    throughout his month on the road, he had lain miserably awake until he had drugged or drunk himself
                    into a fitful sleep.<hi rend="sup">30</hi> This time the pattern of sleeplessness was broken. The

                    "lovers of good literature … who not only read the best that is in newspapers
                    and periodicals … but also in `hard-backed books'" and noted that
                    members of the sponsoring societies were "congratulating themselves on the success that
                    attended this exhibit of a living literary lion." Some of the reactions to the lion were

            </p>
            <p>The <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> made a large concession but also found dissent. Howells, the reporter
                    confided, "was talked about pretty generally in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> yesterday. While the greater part of the audience … liked him, there were
                    some who did not, and if the ears of the gifted writer did not burn yesterday it was not the fault
                    of some who criticized him." Faultless in this respect was a "well-known"
                    but anonymous clubwoman who implicated others as careless of Howells' ears as herself. From
                    "a bright young man" she had heard "a very clever thing," which
                    was that Howells' lecture had inspired him to read the newspapers. Why was this, she had
                    asked, and he had replied: "Well, … didn't Howells say that the only
                    true novel is the one that pictures life just as it is? It seems to me that the newspaper does this
                    most excellently in reporting the things that go on about us. If we are to accept the Howells theory
                    what is the use of spending money for novels? Why not confine ourselves to the newspaper?"</p>
            <p>From another clubwoman the same lady had heard a "fearfully slangy" but
                    "remarkably apt" response, which was that the lecture was
                    "tommy-rot"; the narrator herself eschewed this indelicate term but did think it
                    "most expressive at times." From her husband, who did "not like Howells
                    and declined to go out and hear him," she had received the advice, given "with a
                    sneer," that in her own writing she should "do the very opposite" of what
                    Howells had advocated. From yet another clubwoman, however, the lady had heard disconcerting praise
                    of the lecture, from which she concluded soberly that "people look at things in peculiar
                    ways." As for herself, she had her own opinions: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>Besides the reports of the interview, dinner, and lecture, Howells' visit evoked four
                    editorials—one in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> and three in the <hi rend="i">News</hi>—two of which were decidedly not adulatory. The first, in the literary column
                    of the <hi rend="i">News</hi> of November 18, noted with approval "that the fad for
                    listening to lectures from foreign literary notables" was passing and hailed
                    Howells' appearance as a sign "that that gold mine, the American lecture field, is
                    to be left … to literary men of the soil."<hi rend="sup">39</hi> Howells could
                    have read this, and also another, a friendly item in the <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> of November 19.
                    With sympathetic insight the <hi rend="i">Journal's</hi> editorialist wondered (rightly)
                    whether the author found lecturing a strain and supposed that he was eager to return to his
                    accustomed writing. In effect an apologist for Howells, obviously well and pleasurably read in him,
                    the newspaperman acknowledged that the author's books were not "popular"
                    but insisted they should be, for they "could only be written by a great artist and a man
                    who understands the people of whom he writes." He answered one standard
                    argument—that Howells' books were void of "excitement" and
                    "tragic events"—with another—that Howells'
                    commonplace events made "his pages like transcripts of experience we have all known
                    … ." He concluded with a prophecy: "In days to come these minute
                    studies of character will … stand as pictures of nineteenth century life more accurate
                    than any others which have been produced."<hi rend="sup">40</hi>

            <p>It was probably well for Howells that he left <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> on this gratifying note. Next day, November 20, in addition to the two graceless
                    reports on his lecture, there appeared in the <hi rend="i">News</hi> an adverse editorial pointedly
                    disagreeing with "Mr. Howells and his worshipers." The question, as a
                    non-worshiper saw it, concerned the nature of "truth," and the facts were that a
                    story need not "be absolutely and literally true in all points to what Mr. Howells calls
                    life" and that, indeed, it was "not a question of truth at all, but of the
                    presentation of truth." Howells' apparent judgment that Dickens and Thackeray were
                    less truthful than Austen and George Eliot was as "unwarranted" as "the
                    assumption that the men who do not follow the Howells method care less for truth than he does
                    … ." Still, the nonworshiper thought, the world "is not easily
                    fooled" by "what is false," and it "has not been fooled in this
                        case."<hi rend="sup">41</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last editorial—though not the last word—followed in the <hi rend="i">News</hi> on November 25. Probably the same writer, still unfooled, advised his readers that
                    Howells "would do well to cultivate that catholicity of temper which he talks of in his
                    critical writing." What a "moralist" should do "is to make truth
                    as lovely and attractive as possible"; and the "professional realist"
                    need not exhibit "his own limitations" by standing up "before an
                    intelligent audience of Americans" and telling them "that such barbarians as
                    Tolstoy are more `truthful' than Thackeray, Dickens, Scott, and [Charles] Reade
                    … ." The trouble was that Howells seemed "to identify truth with
                    ugliness, if not with positive filth," and attempted "to read romance out of life,
                    and to reduce the great art" of writing "to the level of a mere trade that can be
                    followed by any man with a decent literary style … ."<hi rend="sup">42</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These editorials brought forth a countering letter to the <hi rend="i">News</hi> on November 28.
                    Fixed in purpose but resigned in air, its author lamented the revival of the "endless
                    controversy as to the merits of romance and realism" occasioned by Howells' visit.
                    Howells' critics who asserted "that a novel should lift its readers out of the
                    commonplace" missed his point that the commonplace itself had "the charm and
                    interest of life as most of us live it." Howells was "a man of broad <list type="footnotes">

                    the ordinary life of the average people" and whose works not only appealed to the
                    reader's "pleasure of recognition" but had "the dignity of life
                    and as life … [were] worthy of respectful study." Any sort of truth was
                    "much more worthy of study than any one's idea of what truth ought to
                    be." Of course, even an ardent partisan of Howells had to acknowledge that Howells might
                    omit "some truth that all of us feel," that realism was "not all of
                    art," and that Howells did not represent all of realism. The correspondent pleaded for
                    moderation: "If the partisans and the opponents of authors could only refrain from
                    overstating their values or demerits—but who can hope for change in this?" The
                    letter was signed only, and perhaps misleadingly, "S." It may well have been

                            conjectural, but as friend, host, and disciple of Howells he would probably have been

                            use of argument by analogy all seem to point to Tarkington as the author. So especially do

                    days later Tarkington better appreciated the dangers from dots with arrows.</p>
            <p>Whether Howells ever felt any of these particular arrows, he did not say. What he did say, had it
                    become known, would likely have brought out spears. Scarcely aboard the train for <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> he wrote his second letter that day to his wife. It reveals a deep disquiet, though it
                    begins innocuously enough: "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> is a stately and a beautifully livable city; there is a great Denkmal in it that is
                    distinctly noble, and gives the capital square a very European effect. Asphalt everywhere, and
                    comfort down to the poorest. People gentle and easy spoken. Workingman's family that came
                    to their door to tell me where Whitcomb Riley lived—all very sweet and kind
                    Americans." Yet Howells sensed in the atmosphere something less than noble, for he added:
                    "But I can feel an <hi rend="i">intolerance</hi> in the air. We are <hi rend="i">freer</hi>
                    in the East, and say what we think. In West, I sh'd be first mobbed with praise and then,
                    if I differed, with rotten eggs. People are freer <hi rend="i">from West to East.</hi> In the W.
                    they are all terrible water drinkers—they must be topers or temperance, just as they must
                    be saints or sinners. People are <hi rend="i">free,</hi> only as they are <hi rend="i">rude,</hi>
                    here… . Lots of people came up after the lecture, and stuffed me with
                        praise."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, whatever misgivings Howells felt in general about the West—by which he always
                    meant the Midwest—came to a sharp focus in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In the literary realm the midwestern disposition towards polarities, lamented by this
                    native Ohioan, made saints of the novelists of sanctimony and uplift and sinners of the
                    "naughty" Tolstoy and "filth-loving" Howells. He had reason to
                    suppose that the literati of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> valued his appearance at least as much for the opportunity it presented them to show
                    off their culture as for the chance it gave them to hear his ideas. His linking of
                    "praise" and "intolerance" indicates that he did not wholly
                    interpret the applause for his lecture as tolerance for its content. And since he
                    "differed," the rotten eggs that splattered him in the press and the arrows that
                    pursued him probably would not have greatly surprised him.</p>

            <p>Despite his strong reservations, however, Howells was genuinely pleased with much of his reception in
                    Indiana's capital city. And he would have known that many besides Tarkington in his
                    "great and good" audience would resent rude treatment of a respectful visitor
                    whether they agreed with his ideas or not. He had fought a lonely and discouraging battle for those
                    ideas and was then exerting a revolutionary influence which was, as Tarkington recognized,
                    "the most profound and subtle that has been exerted upon the letters of his
                        country."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> But that influence had scarcely begun to be felt in
                    this major literary capital in 1899. If Howells had hoped to offset somewhat the dominance of
                    romantic falsities in Hoosier literary taste, he doubtless sensed that, for the time at least, he
                    had failed.</p>

                    "by sleeping for twenty-four hours."<hi rend="sup">47</hi> For the next two weeks,
                    Howells wrote Clemens, "I slept 15 hours a night. Two hours after breakfast, I took a long
                    nap, and in the afternoon, I had two long naps… . My head felt <hi rend="i">sprained,</hi> and I had stored up a disorder of the Pneumo-gastric nerve, that made my heart jump
                    a beat every now and then … ."<hi rend="sup">48</hi> And nearly a month after
                    getting home he wrote his sister: "I have hardly yet got back to my old working trim
                    … ."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> He was not likely to neglect again his aversion to
                    the "ghastly work" with its "terrible strain." When Major Pond
                    jumped at him with lucrative contracts for more lecturing, Howells steadfastly refused. "I
                    am not hungry enough yet," he said.<hi rend="sup">50</hi> And this time, that did end it.</p>

                    Valued and preserved by Mrs. Burmester as a bridge to her family's past, the letters are
                    "homely" in the good old fashioned sense of that word. They are intimate,
                    unpretentious, unpolished compositions concerned almost exclusively with the familiar affairs of
                    domestic life—marriage, birth, sickness, death, family problems, and, since all the
                    Conines lived on farms, the weather and the price of crops. Because four members of the family
                    taught school at one time or another<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and because the Conines'
                    religious ties were strong, much of that fraction of the correspondence which does not bear directly
                    on life in the farmhouse is devoted to events in the schoolhouse and meetinghouse. Nevertheless,
                    though their range of topics was somewhat limited, the Conines had much to say. They overflowed
                    their letters with news, questions, advice, and felicitations, squeezing in late additions and
                    postscripts all up and down the margins, around the corners, and topsy turvy over the headings.<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Some of those letters, the ones written by Catharine, Emily, and Jane Conine

                    the ague—"naturalization" Emily called it—was mercifully

                    directly or, in the case of Jane's husband, who was a miller, from the processing of raw
                    agricultural products. To the extent that can be determined from the valuation of real estate given
                    in the population schedules of the manuscript federal census, none of the Conine related families

                    of prominence. The others seem to have lived and died in complete obscurity, not even indulging
                    themselves by purchasing biographical sketches in the subscriptive histories of their counties.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> What does distinguish the Conines, however, not only from their neighbors but
                    from millions of their contemporaries, is the purely fortuitous circumstance that something of
                    themselves has survived into the present, a simple, unadorned record, written "Just as

                                            </placeName>. Every effort has been made to reproduce the handwritten
                                            documents as faithfully as possible within the limits imposed by the
                                            transfer to a printed medium. However, because punctuation, spelling, and
                                            format are erratic throughout the correspondence, the intentions of the
                                            several writers involved are susceptible in many instances to a wide range
                                            of interpretation. In the interests of clarity, readability, and a
                                            reasonable degree of consistency, the following editorial practices have
                                            been adopted. The indentation of the first lines of paragraphs and the
                                            spacing of headings, salutations, and closings have been standardized.
                                            Interlineations have been inserted into the text where indicated by the
                                            writers of the original letters, and marginal notes have been placed after
                                            the closings. False word starts, flourishes, obviously unintentional
                                            repetitions, and stray marks which seemed to be the results of accidental
                                            restings of the pen on the paper have been omitted. Insertions by the editor
                                            appear within square brackets. Where words are missing or illegible in the
                                            manuscripts, such brackets enclose conjectural readings or, if the probable
                                            intent of the writer could not be inferred, appropriate explanations.
                                            Letters left out of words have also been supplied in brackets wherever not
                                            to have done so might have resulted in one word's being mistaken
                                            for another; otherwise, incorrect and phonetic spellings have been retained
                                            as found. In as many cases as possible persons mentioned by first or last
                                            name alone or by initials have been provided a conjectural identification
                                            based upon the appearance of persons with the same name or initials in
                                            similar contexts elsewhere in the letters. In the absence of other sources,
                                            speculative identifications have been drawn from the <placeName>

                                            in the population schedules. Missing punctuation has been inserted in
                                            brackets only when needed for clarity, but run on sentences have been broken
                                            up by spacing between clauses. At the ends of sentences, marks which could
                                            be interpreted either as periods or commas have been transcribed as periods,
                                            and since the various writers generally seem to have intended exclamation
                                            points after such expressions as "O!" the editor has
                                            adhered to that practice in doubtful situations. All superscript letters
                                            have been brought down to the line. Words underlined with a single stroke
                                            have been transcribed in italics, words underlined with two strokes appear
                                            in small capital letters, and words overlined with a single stroke appear in
                                            boldface type. Finally, in an attempt to avoid confusion, the word township
                                            has been used consistently in these footnotes to designate political

                                            the midnineteenth century, many people continued the old practice of merely
                                            folding their letters so that the writing was inside, sealing them with wax
                                            or a wafer of dried paste, writing the address on the outside, and sending
                                            them off with no cover at all. As might be expected, the absence of
                                            envelopes left private correspondence very vulnerable to public inspection.

                        ruined by transplanting, suggests that Catharine Skinner may have brought the currant bushes and
                        peach trees with her to Indiana from <placeName>

                        Conine's agricultural activity, for his farm produced apples as well as plums,
                        cherries, currants, and peaches. Jane Conine commented one autumn, after drying fifteen or
                        twenty bushels of peaches and about forty of apples, that it was "a particular blessing
                        of ours, always fruit enough to work to kill common people … ." Jane Conine

                                 <hi rend="sup">11</hi> Three pieces of internal evidence date this letter
                                            as 1849 rather than. 1848. First, when the Skinners were counted in the 1850
                                            census on October 22, 1850 (see footnote 53), their little girl Emily
                                            Louisa, whose birth is mentioned in this letter, was listed as being one
                                            year old. If the census report is correct, she must have been born August
                                            24, 1849, instead of 1848. Second, Mary Ann and Jane Conine were not
                                            "deprived of a home," as Catharine says, until late
                                            summer, 1849, as described in footnote thirteen. Finally, Catharine speaks
                                            of the weather in Indiana as better "this fall" than last.
                                            If the letter were correctly dated September, 1848, then she would have to
                                            have been in Indiana as early as the fall of 1847. However, in her letter of
                                            July 6, 1849, she says that they hope to have ten acres cleared by the time
                                            they have been on the land a year. That statement would suggest that the
                                            Skinners did not arrive in Indiana until after July, 1848.</item>

                                 <hi rend="sup">12</hi> This daughter, Emily Louisa, was the
                                            Skinners' second child. The first, a son named Wallace, died either
                                            before Emily Louisa was born or shortly thereafter. The Skinners eventually
                                            had four other children. Ruth <placeName>

                        <p>At your request I again pen a few lines to you in reply to the letter you sent by Mr
                                    Skinner I regret that he returned without calling on me I did not know that he had
                                    been here till he had been gone more than a week. I have been at Horace'es
                                    three weeks and shall remain through the remainder of my vacation which will be
                                    about two weeks more. I teach the school that I taught last winter and this summer I
                                    have $12 a month this winter I could have got more if I had not engaged
                                    so soon, but I will not regret it. The school is as good as any in these diggins. We
                                    do not have the facilities for teaching here that you do, but the pleasure of
                                    knowing that our labours are appreciated is a great satisfaction. I can do as well
                                    teaching here as there. I have become quite contented since my naturalizeation<hi rend="sup">15</hi> and think of staying here I would <list type="footnotes">

                                            "Newville, Indiana, Autumn, 1849," can be presumed from

                                    need of a home now as much as I. You requested me to write something consoling to

                                    there was something in those letters (for H[orace] wrote to) (that offnded father)
                                    If he was offended at that one I would like to know what he said to the next for I
                                    have written since I heard madam had got back. I understand he burned the first, the

                                    expected it. I would like to be at home a few days to talk [to] Bets you better
                                    believe I would ease my mind of a troublesome burthen I wish I had come down during
                                    my vacation for my things I dont want under madams supervision. You wrote to know
                                    whether you could put down my carpet I mad[e] no reply Catharine told Horace that
                                    she thought Mr S. said you had I want to know if you did. I would not have had it
                                    done for ten dollars I could not think you would do it I told you not to disturb my
                                    things without my orders I wanted the privaledge of cutting my own carpet. I want
                                    you to write all about the carpet business. I wrote to father to send my things by
                                    S. but he had started before he got it I want you to see to them and if Ira moves up

                                            "aig-yoo" but in rural dialect "ag,"
                                            "egg," or "aguer") was a malarial fever
                                            prevalent in newly settled areas of the Old Northwest. The symptoms are
                                            graphically described in R. Carlyle Buley's <hi rend="i">Old

                                            feeling of lassitude, blueness of the fingernails, then little cold
                                            sensations which increased until the victim's teeth chattered in
                                            his jaws and he `felt like a harp with a thousand strings.' After
                                            an hour or so warmth returned, then came raging heat with racking head pains
                                            and aching back." The disease was recurrent; "it often
                                            came back in season for years, until a sort of immunity was
                                            established." Emily Conine's personification of the ague
                                            is similar to that of a Michigan pioneer quoted by Buley: <p>"And

                                    this country has always been set out as one greate for young people getting married
                                    but I have not heard of so much of such buisness as at the east ther is Mr Sanford
                                    Almond Harris Maria Froun I do not think you eastern folks have any thing to brag of
                                    I was some what surprised to hear of Elizabeth Gardners getting married to that old
                                    Bach Jane dont you get married if you cant do better than that. Give Mr Jeffres
                                    people our respects and tell them we shall write to them soon we received a letter
                                    from them a short time ago but I thought I must write to you first as I have written
                                    to then Tell Nancy [Willes] and Mary Coleman to bear with me a littel longer and I
                                    shall get round to them after a while I have written 13 or 14 letters since I came
                                    here and I cannot get time to write as many as I would like to but tell them not to
                                    wate for me for if they were away from their old acquaintances in the far west I
                                    should not wait for them to write O how! I should like to have a good long talk with
                                    you &amp; Jane Mary and Nancy I do not think there would much time run to waste.
                                    I have written this Just as fast as I could &amp; have not stoped to get every
                                    word spelled right nor to use gramaticul Phrases but Just as I would talk therefore
                                    I hope all mistakes will be excused</p>

                        <salute>Dear sister</salute>
                        <p>what was my joy this morning at the reception of your &amp; Janes letters. I had
                                    long been looking for one. It is a pleasure to hear from you at all times. How sweet
                                    the tie that binds us death alone I hope will sever it. I[t] seems like an age since
                                    I have seen you I hope the time will not be as much longer as it has been. Sometimes
                                    I think of coming home in the spring and spending the summer but it is doubtful If
                                    not I shall come in the fall. I cannot wait longer than that unless it should be
                                    dangerous traveling. My health is good &amp; has been since I was sick in the
                                    spring. I[t] was only the process of naturalization. I feel quite contented now. I
                                    am teaching in Scipio again this is my third quarter I have had 54 sholars this
                                    winter. I teach Algebra Philosophy &amp; Phy[s]iology of the higher branches.
                                    One of my scholars has been through Days Algebra. As respects this school it is not
                                    much inferior to York state Schools. This is the best school I know of, but not the
                                    best house on the contrary it is only a rude pile of logs with a fireplace in one
                                    corner with very poor accommodations of every discription I board with the scholars,
                                    this you think is hard but you know nothing about this country! we have had a thaw
                                    about 2 weeks now or thaw &amp; freeze then snow a little then rain. I am

                                    think I am growing proud &amp; I think so too. You would not have thought of
                                    getting a dress as I got these I am obliged to use economy; I made a fine shirt
                                    (which by the by I am quite an adept at) I got twuo pounds of wool rolls which I
                                    spun into yarn and sold for 18 shillings, wont you put it up? I have my worsted
                                    dress yet this is my winter dress, you will laugh but if stories are true I aught to

                                        preacher. Benjamin emigrated to America in 1830, and his wife and seven children
                                        followed in the next year. After living for some time in <placeName>

                                        </placeName>, Indiana, by 1842. Benjamin Dorsey held the first religious meeting
                                        in the township, and his family, "prominent in the history of Scipio
                                        township," became "one of the most worthy in the

                                        "about August." He died March 9, 1881. Brant &amp; Fuller,

                                        7:8: "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
                                        if they abide even as I." This recommendation is tempered somewhat in

                        <p>Dear sisters</p>
                        <p>I received your very acceptable letter but a short time since. We are glad to hear of
                                    your good health. Jane says she would rathe deliver her message by the word of mouth
                                    so would I. it is much easyer talking than writing. I wish you were both here we
                                    would have a good chit-chat. I suppose Mary is thinking of something more important
                                    than writing<hi rend="sup">57</hi> is it so Mary ? you are very busy without doubt.
                                    I wish you were coming here to live, but no you cannot it seems, well we wish you
                                    good luck whare ever you go and hope you will not forget us. Since our return my
                                    health has been tolerable good<hi rend="sup">58</hi> I had 20 Ibs of wool to spin
                                    and shal finish in a few days I should have done so before now but John has been
                                    sick ever since our return, his teeth troubled him you know when we were at home
                                    they continued to grow worse until he got discouraged and tried to have it out but
                                    alas it broke off and a worse time ensued after suffering for twuo weeks after he
                                    went to the doctors and he succeded in getting out another piece and said it was all
                                    man could do for him it must get well afore it could be disturbed any more, he was
                                    so run down that we thought thare must be something more the matter but the Dr said
                                    it was caused by his teeth I never new any one who had such a dreadful time, from
                                    toothache but that was not all for since his teeth have stopped aching he has
                                    continued to grow poor so that you would hardly know him he has been a little better
                                    since takng nearly twuo bottles of Liver-wort and tar and also a bottle of home
                                    mad[e] stuff which he think is as good or better for him than the medicen he bought,
                                    you know I am half Dr my-self. He has had a very bad cough and raised a good deal I
                                    had my fears that he would soon fall a victim to the consumption<hi rend="sup">59</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope my fears will not be realized. I have great faith that he may recover through
                                    the use of roots and such things I have reason to think so on account of his being
                                    so much better while taking it</p>

                    hitched on the oxen, &amp;, with a rough board across the box for a seat, we rode the rest of
                    the way After getting fairly started, I smild audibly at the thought of what our friends at the east

                    </placeName>: Pioneer Press, 1972. Pp. xvii, 533. Notes, illustrations, selected bibliography,
                    index. $9.95.)</head>
            <p>This pioneer volume attempts to provide a brief yet comprehensive general history of the American
                    Midwest. Geographically it covers the area sometimes known as the North Central States, twelve
                    states from the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ksu">Kansas</region>

                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. Chronologically the scope extends from the ice age to 1970. More than a score of
                    topics are given special extended treatment. The book contains sixty-nine consecutively numbered
                    chapters which are organized into six major parts. Each chapter is further subdivided into
                    separately captioned sections. The first part (pp. 3–68) provides a general setting and a
                    narrative of European exploration and other events from the sixteenth century to 1800. Part VI (pp.
                    481–94) is a summary account of the Middle West since 1940. The four central parts, which
                    comprise the major portion of the book, take up "The Young Middle West"
                    (1801–1841), "The Disruptive Period" (1841–1877),
                    "The Middle West Comes of Age" (1864–1900), and
                    "Progressivism, Conservatism, and Pragmatism" (1900-194). They are structured
                    symmetrically and are of approximately equal length. Each, in general, provides a chapter or more on
                    the admission of states, political issues, and political personalities, and a dozen or so separate
                    chapters on settlement, agriculture, transportation, mining and manufacturing, labor, religion,
                    education, social and cultural life, and other topics. Emphasis is broadly distributed, with
                    politics, war and foreign affairs, and transportation receiving perhaps the greatest attenton.
                    Special features include eighty-two illustrations (seventy of them are portraits), a classified
                    bibliography of about 1,200 items, and an index. There are no tables, charts, maps, or graphs.</p>
            <p>As a pioneering effort to bring together a vast amount of material into very limited space the book
                    deserves high praise. The style is clear, simple, and direct. Several dozen errors <pb n="367" id="VAA4025-069-4-071"/> are apparently all quite trivial, although the transposition of type on
                    pages ninety and ninety-one is annoying. No explicit attempt is made to advocate any special
                    interpretation or hypothesis, and there are no sweeping spiritual or psychological generalizations.
                    The book is comparable neither to Graham Hutton's <hi rend="i">Midwest at Noon,</hi> John
                    J. Murray's <hi rend="i">Heritage of the Middle West,</hi> Horace Merrill's <hi rend="i">Bourbon Democracy of the Middle West,</hi> nor Russel Nye's <hi rend="i">Midwestern Progressive Politics;</hi> it resembles to a slight extent the major works of
                    Beverly W. Bond, Jr., R. Carlyle Buley, and Henry C. Hubbart, which covered much of the subject from
                    1788 to 1880.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">A History of the Middle West</hi> seems most admirably designed as a college level
                    textbook. The reviewer expects to try it out for that purpose during the coming year.</p>

            <p>Richard M. Ketchum is an author and a senior editor with the American Heritage Publishing Company. Of
                    the several books written and edited by him, <hi rend="i">The Battle for Bunker Hill</hi> and The
                    American Heritage Book of the Revolution illustrate his keen interest in and wide knowledge of the
                    American Revolution. In <hi rend="i">The Winter Soldiers</hi> he has attempted to demonstrate how
                    significant to the final outcome of the War for Independence was the early period from April 19,
                    1775, to January 3, 1777. Although <hi rend="i">The Winter Soldiers</hi> "is not intended
                    as a book for scholars" and although footnotes are omitted, Ketchum's narrative is
                    "based upon contemporary evidence" (p. 400). A close examination of the
                    bibliography and notes for each chapter reveals that the author has investigated most of the printed
                    sources and secondary works which cover the years encompassed by this book.</p>
            <p>Chronologically, the story extends from the battles of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Concord</settlement>

                    clarification is necessary. This time span naturally entails and highlights the following: the
                    meeting of the Second Continental Congress, the fighting at Bunker Hill (actually, Breed's
                    Hill), the events in and around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Declaration of Independence, the battles of Long Island and White Plains, and the
                    Staten Island Peace Conference. It also includes the British capture of Fort <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the abandonment of Fort Lee to the enemy, and General George <placeName>

                    </placeName>. The crisis confronting <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his ragged, poorly equipped army is emphasized. The book reaches its climax with <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s victories at Trenton and <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>When one evaluates this book in the terms of its own genre, it admirably fulfills the purpose for
                    which it was written. The history buff can profit and, at the same time, enjoy the wealth of
                    information presented. A specialist, whose research of the period has extended over two or three
                    decades and whose prose has become pedantic, will not find any startling new facts; however, he will
                    read a clean, crisp style of writing which, too often, eludes the writers of history. Ketchum shows
                    good insight on the British problems of shipping supplies, enlisting soldiers, and handling camp
                    followers. His descriptive cameos of the leading personalities are excellent; for example, he
                    describes Lord North as being "round-shouldered, corpulent, with a bloated, sleepy, piglike
                    face, and an oversize tongue which thickened his speech" (p. 63).</p>
            <p>The author should have stated his thesis before page 396. Although somewhat tenuous, it is that
                    "without [the victories at] Trenton and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName> there would have been no army to fight at Saratoga and Yorktown" and therefore
                    "the campaign <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> had just won was the decisive one of the war." <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName> accomplished "something that had to be done or the cause of independence was
                    lost irretrievably."</p>
            <p>This is a handsome book, relatively free of typographical errors. The maps and illustrations are
                    exceedingly helpful. Those who enjoy well written history will not be disappointed by <hi rend="i">The Winter Soldiers.</hi>

               <hi rend="i">Invisible Immigrants: The Adaptation of English and Scottish Immigrants in
                        Nineteenth-Century America.</hi> By Charlotte Erickson. (Coral Gables: University of Miami
                    Press, 1972. Pp. vi, 531. Maps, notes, illustrations, index. $17.50.)</head>
            <p>More than two million Englishmen and Scotsmen entered the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> practically unnoticed in the nineteenth century. Their similarity to the bulk of
                    Americans rendered them virtually invisible. Standard immigration texts and most of the recent works
                    on immigrant groups neglect them. No study has searched so deeply into the effects of emigration
                    upon these migrants or questioned so effectively the assumption that they were assimilated rapidly
                    and easily into American culture as this volume by Charlotte Erickson.</p>
            <p>Dr. Erickson, a recognized historian of British emigration, presents twenty-five short collections of
                    previously unpublished, nineteenth century Scottish and English emigrant letters. Each minimally
                    edited, thoroughly annotated collection is preceded by a biographical history of the family
                    involved. Unlike the more literate, upper class letters and memoirs which have appeared elsewhere,
                    these represent the aspirations and attitudes of former farmers, handicraftsmen, small traders, and
                    common laborers. Erickson's analysis, based upon these and other emigrant letters, portrays
                    a people who adapted to American society but disdained assimilation. Their language and religion
                    made them compatible with most of their American neighbors but denied them the shields against
                    association which other immigrants possessed. They seldom faced discrimination by nativists or
                    racists, yet, when possible, chose to segregate themselves among fellow countrymen. Early Scottish
                    and English immigrant farmers remained aloof, thinking themselves superior to Yankees. Many joined
                    colonies ("rural ghettos"), as at Albion, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and Saundersville, Indiana. Those in farming and industry made American friends slowly
                    and married Americans only as a last resort. They participated little in politics and often waited
                    long to seek naturalization.</p>
            <p>By organizing the collections of letters into three categories representing the American occupations
                    of the writers—agriculture, industry, and business and the
                    professions—Erickson compares and contrasts the emigrants' motives <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-069-4-074"/> for leaving Britain, their distribution in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>, and their socal, economic, political, and psychological adjustments. Her well
                    documented introductions to each categorical grouping both support and challenge older
                    interpretations. First, she argues that the opportunities of farming in America "served as
                    a safety valve for urban and industrial workers in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>" (p. 62), but she does not allay the doubts that have undermined the parallel
                    concept that the availability of western land effectively relieved urban, industrial tension in
                    America itself. Second, she asserts that "Frederick <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jackson</settlement>
                    </placeName> Turner's schematic model of successive waves of specialized settlers, from
                    pioneer to capitalist farmer, is wrong. The letter-writers were not mainly fillers-in." On
                    the contrary, most of them "spent years clearing and bringing land into cultivation for the
                    first time" (pp. 45–46). Third, she maintains that private emigrant letters
                    rather than the often touted advertisements of community founders, companies, and speculators were
                    the chief stimulant to English and Scottish emigration.</p>
            <p>The central problem of this book, as of all such works in the social sciences, is the degree to which
                    small samples truly characterize the whole. Critically aware of this and of the pitfalls of using
                    emigrant letters as a source, Erickson prefers to call her sample of fifty-three letter writers
                    "historical cases, whether typical or not" (p. 6). Since her conclusions are based
                    upon a scant percentage of all Scottish and English immigrants, one hopes others will extend her
                    pioneering explorations, especially in American repositories, and reveal more about these invisible
                    immigrants.</p>

            <p>"North America for Christ" seems to have been the theme song of Northern Baptists
                    from the founding of the American Baptist Home Mission Society in 1832 to the enactment of the
                    National Origins Act in 1924. Throughout this period Baptists were faced with the problem of the
                    immigrant—was he to be ignored or cultivated? Davis discusses <pb n="371" id="VAA4025-069-4-075"/> this question in all of its ramifications, particularly as it applies
                    to Northern Baptists but generally as reflected in the attitudes of other denominations, which he
                    calls the Protestant Mind.</p>
            <p>Beginning with a good succinct statement of Baptist belief and polity, the author briefly traces the
                    early history of Northern Baptists through their initial attempts to evangelize the frontier and the
                    split over the slavery issue in 1845, which caused the creation of the Southern Baptist Convention.
                    The latter is omitted in this study, as are other Baptist sects.</p>
            <p>On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society in 1882
                    Northern Baptists were faced with a new concern—immigration. The Chinese Exclusion Act
                    which had become law that year prohibited the entrance of Chinese workers for ten years. This
                    national policy was continued in the following years. Baptists, however, had maintained foreign
                    missions in <placeName>
                        <country reg="cc">China</country>
                    </placeName> for many years, and now the Chinese question assumed priority on the domestic front,
                    although Baptists were not entirely united on this issue. Davis asserts that no major religious
                    group was as torn asunder over the Chinese question as were the Baptists.</p>
            <p>With the coming of large numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe after the turn of the
                    century, another major issue faced the Baptists. Most of the newcomers were of the Catholic faith,
                    and anti-Romanism was a powerful force in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. There was fear that the radicalism of some eastern Europeans would jeopardize belief
                    in Anglo Saxon superiority. Yet many Baptists felt that such immigration was a part of Divine <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Providence</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s plan, not only for the good of the immigrants themselves but ultimately for
                    the welfare of the nation. Some believed the newly arrived aliens were creating many of the domestic
                    social problems which began to appear in ever increasing numbers. Labor riots of the 1880s and 1890s
                    were blamed on the foreign population. To others, however, such incidents offered a challenge to
                    implement the Social Gospel, although most Baptists were not yet ready for this step. Other
                    denominations, especially the Presbyterian and Methodist, were equally confused.</p>
            <p>The road from fear to friendship was long and hard, but Baptists forged ahead in their work among
                    immigrant <pb n="372" id="VAA4025-069-4-076"/> groups, particularly with the Germans, Swedes, Poles,
                    Hungarians, and Italians. Walter Rauschenbusch, Shailer Mathews, and others led the crusade for
                    social justice, although many Baptist journals were opposed.</p>
            <p>During World War I, one of the leading Baptist papers claimed that the fidelity of nine tenths of the
                    persons of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> origin in America was unquestionable. Davis concludes that in this testing time for the
                    American nation and its ideals, Baptists on the whole honored their long held precepts of religious
                    liberty, the equality of all men before God, and the worth of each individual. In this respect, he
                    asserts, the years from 1914 to 1925 constituted one of their finest hours.</p>
            <p>Davis has written a very interesting and readable book. It is well documented, although the sources
                    are understandably limited. The footnotes are conveniently arranged at the bottom of the pages.
                    Perhaps others will be challenged to do similar work for other denominations.</p>

            <p>Professors Graf and Haskins have compiled here the third of a projected ten volume collection of the
                    correspondence, speeches, and official documents relevant to the life of Andrew Johnson. Covering
                    the years 1858 through 1860, this volume treats the major concerns and activities of the
                    tailor-politician as he was emerging to national prominence as a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senator from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>It was during these years that Johnson became the chief advocate for passage of a national homestead
                    law, and his letters and speeches reveal a considerable variety of arguments designed to attract
                    disparate elements to his dream of opening up the West to the common man. His capacity for invective
                    is also evident in his response to President James Buchanan's veto of his Homestead Bill.
                    Ironically, the Republican <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-069-4-077"/> party, not Democrat Johnson, would
                    receive ultimate credit in the textbooks when the Homestead Law later became a reality.</p>
            <p>Although Johnson usually remained aloof from the raging debates in the Senate over the issue of
                    slavery, he did become passionately involved when the Congress reacted to John <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s raid at Harper's Ferry. His stirring oration against the
                    Republicans, who he thought had encouraged <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s actions, and his arguments in defense of the slave labor system, reveal much
                    about the man and his attachments to the South.</p>
            <p>Johnson's letters and public pronouncements also indicate a definite interest in the
                    presidency. Although he appeared to be fishing for support, he made it clear that he would not
                    personally initiate action to get his name before the 1860 Democratic National Convention in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charleston</settlement>
                    </placeName>: "If it goes there it must be the act of others not mine" (p. 292).
                    Nor did he rule out the possibility of second place on the ticket. In January, 1860, he remarked
                    privately: "There could be no Safer positin [<hi rend="i">sic</hi>] to Secure the first
                    place four years hence than Second place on the ticket now" (p. xxvi).</p>
            <p>Although Johnson possessed a strong states rights commitment and staunchly defended the slave labor
                    system, the prospects of secession in 1860 deeply troubled him. It was at this juncture that he
                    became a leading spokesman for moderation, pleading with his southern colleagues that their
                    interests could best be served within the Union. Johnson even turned to efforts to alter the
                    governmental system in order to accommodate northern and southern views through a series of
                    constitutional amendment proposals that he hoped would forestall secession. One of these proposals
                    urged a rotation of the presidency between proslavery and free soil states. Another sought to
                    balance the Supreme Court with equal representation, North and South. It appears Johnson was already
                    manifesting some of the characteristics that would appeal to Abraham <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lincoln</settlement>
                    </placeName> and his Union party ticket four years hence.</p>
            <p>With reference to the mechanics of the work—the symbols, abbreviations, short titles, and
                    index are constructed in a manner that clarify and illuminate the volume. Elaborate, factual notes
                    place the documents in historical perspective. The editors had a high standard to uphold, as the
                    first two <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-069-4-078"/> volumes received much praise from the historical
                    profession. Volume III is equally impressive.</p>

               <hi rend="i">The Credit Merchants: A History of Spiegel, Inc.</hi> By Orange A. Smalley and
                    Frederick D. Sturdivant. Introduction by Harold F. Williamson. (Carbondale: Southern Illinois
                    University Press, 1973. Pp. xvii, 336. Tables, illustrations, appendix, notes, index.
                    $12.50.)</head>
            <p>This is a well written book dealing with the complex history of one of the best known mail order
                    firms. The work amply documents the Spiegel family's considerable success in merchandizing.
                    It is a substantial contribution to the literature of business history, complimenting an existing
                    study of Sears, Roebuck and Company and surpassing a company history of Spiegel. That first Spiegel
                    history, in fact, was produced from Orange A. Smalley's original manuscript in 1965, after
                    Smalley's death in 1964. The present book, sponsored by Northwestern University's
                    Committee for Business History and completed by Frederick D. Sturdivant, is also based upon
                    Smalley's decade of research, which had received support from the Spiegel Company through
                    the same committee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="i">The Credit Merchants</hi> depicts the endurance and audacity of three generations of the
                    Spiegel family in maintaining their family firm. Joseph Spiegel of the immigrant generation survived
                    a Confederate prison and ran high quality retail furniture stores in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> until he stumbled suddenly into bankruptcy in 1892. Modie Spiegel, his eldest son,
                    immediately led his doubting father and others into high pressure sales of low quality furniture to
                    working class Chicagoans on credit. This venture proved quite successful, despite the depression of
                    1893, and endured until liquidation in early 1929. Long before, in 1905, the youngest son, Arthur,
                    initiated an experiment coupling mail order sales and installment credit which was the Spiegel
                    firm's innovative contribution to retailing. The company preceded both Sears and Montgomery
                    Ward by some years in the use of credit. Well before <pb n="375" id="VAA4025-069-4-079"/> World War
                    I mail order credit became the mainstay of Spiegel's profits.</p>
            <p>Spiegel managed to take both the recession of 1914 and the postwar depression in stride; the second
                    generation management, chiefly Modie, grew mildly complaisant during the 1920s. The
                    authors' most intriguing discussions are of Spiegel's near discovery of the
                    possibilities of add-on (modern revolving credit) in 1908 and again in 1917. Both times the second
                    generation management drew up short after successful experiments produced rapidly mounting short
                    term debt and receding customer maturities. The practice of revolving credit was not adopted by them
                    and their competitors until the 1930s.</p>
            <p>The third generation, led by Modie Spiegel jr., took charge during the depression of the 1930s.
                    Spiegel throve, first by enlarging their quest for customers geographically and numerically, later
                    by improving their product lines to tap a more discerning market. World War II brought an end to
                    "no downpayment, no interest" credit terms; since then hidden charges have become
                    more visible. After the war Modie jr. took Spiegel on an ill fated decade long effort to match
                    Sears' success with new retail outlets. After a decade of apparent success with mail order
                    and notable moderization of technology, the Spiegels sold their firm to Beneficial Finance
                    Corporation in 1965.</p>
            <p>As a work of business history this book has considerable merit. It could have been improved by closer
                    attention to comparisons with Montgomery Ward and Sears, by analysis of the importance of locational
                    factors (<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName>) in the success of all three (or just Spiegel as the newest), and by analysis of the
                    dependence of all three (or just Spiegel as the smallest) on bankers for short term debt needs to
                    offset customer credit. As a scholarly work the book is marred by missing notes for one chapter, by
                    an added and threadbare final chapter, by inadequate research beyond the Spiegel archives, and by
                    the lack of a bibliography. As a study of the family and its firm from a conventional
                    historian's point of view, it is suggestive but scarcely definitive. It largely overlooks,
                    or stops short of adequate inquiry into, the company's dealings with labor, its attitudes
                    on blacks as customers and as workers, and its feelings about anti-<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">German</settlement>
                    </placeName> and anti-Semitic prejudice. Matters like reasons for incorporation <pb n="376" id="VAA4025-069-4-080"/> under West Virginia laws and instances of lobbying in various eras are
                    simply not plumbed.</p>

                    bibliography, index. $10.95.)</head>
            <p>This very readable study of General Pershing's career prior to World War I is based on
                    massive scholarship. Donald Smythe has consulted more than eighty manuscript collections (including
                    sixteen separate collections of Pershing papers), interviewed some one hundred persons and
                    corresponded with even more, read newspapers ranging from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Boston</settlement>

                    <hi rend="i">Globe</hi> to the Manila <hi rend="i">Times,</hi> and mastered the vast array of
                    literature on the "old Army" before 1917. The result is first rate military
                    biography, and Smythe's Pershing will sit well along side of Edward Coffman's
                    Peyton March, Clayton James' Douglas MacArthur, or Forrest Pogue's George
                    Marshall.</p>
            <p>The man chosen to command the American Expeditionary Force to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> in 1917 had, ironically, spent his entire military career in command of small units.
                    Smythe's focus is on Pershing as frontier cavalryman—"guerrilla
                    warrior"—chasing Apaches in Arizona and Sioux in the Dakotas, pacifying Moros in
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName>, and leading the famous Punitive Expendition against Pancho Villa in northern <placeName>
                        <country reg="mx">Mexico</country>
                    </placeName>. During the 1890s Pershing fought in the Spanish American War in the battles around
                    Santiago and also commanded cadets at the University of Nebraska and at West Point. It was at West
                    Point that he earned the nickname "Black Jack" or "Nigger Jack,"
                    an uncomplimentary epithet resulting from his excessive concern for discipline. Indeed, the Pershing
                    of those early years was very much a "professional's professional," an
                    ambitious and capable soldier who won jungle campaigns through diplomacy as well as through force
                    and who rose in rank through good connections as well as through good deeds. Smythe proves that
                    Pershing did not owe his rapid promotion to direct political influence; nonetheless, it did not hurt
                    that his father-in-law was chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee. Similarly,
                    Pershing's <pb n="377" id="VAA4025-069-4-081"/> selection to command the AEF was aided by
                    his proven ability during the Villa campaign to follow political orders without
                    protest—even when he disagreed with those orders. Better than most professionals,
                    especially his chief rival, Leonard Wood, Pershing knew how to be diplomat as well as warrior.</p>
            <p>Smythe is also very good at probing Pershing's personality. The man was certainly stiff and
                    forbidding, something of a martinet, respected but unloved by his troops. But the general could
                    loosen up among friends, and his marriage to Frances Warren was supremely happy. The anguish that
                    Pershing suffered in 1915 when his wife and three of their four children perished in a fire must
                    have been devastating, and Smythe demolishes the legend that Pershing, unflinchingly, survived the
                    tragedy with his "iceberg" demeanor intact. Smythe even suggests that
                    Pershing's irritability and willingness to risk war in his pursuit of Villa may have
                    resulted from pent up emotions following the tragedy.</p>
            <p>One minor complaint: Smythe rarely criticizes the military milieu in which Pershing lived. He
                    describes the battles, the campaigns, the military values, but he rarely asks why. For example,
                    young Lieutenant Pershing was in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sdu">South Dakota</country>
                    </placeName> in the winter of 1890–1891 when the incident at Wounded Knee Creek occurred.
                    The discussion ignores the perspective of the Indians. Smythe does show that Pershing's
                    later campaigns in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="ph">Philippines</country>
                    </placeName> were bloodless in comparison to other efforts at "pacification." But
                    were they justified? On the other hand, he does give a full view of the Mexican side in his chapters
                    on the Punitive Expedition.</p>
            <p>Volume two is eagerly awaited.</p>

            <p>William Vaughn Moody is commonly acclaimed the best American poet between the end of the nineteenth
                    century and the arrival of the new poetry in the 1915–1925 period. Born in New <placeName>

                    </placeName>, and devoted most of his short life to traveling, teaching, and writing. He had the
                    good fortune to meet a brilliant group of poets and critics—George Santayana, Edwin
                    Arlington Robinson, Trumbull Stickney, Percy MacKaye, and Ridgely Torrence—and he was a
                    close friend of Robert Morss Lovett, Ferdinand Schevill, and Robert Herrick. In his later years he
                    moved easily in <placeName>

                    </placeName> intelligentsia, devoting himself first to masques and lyrics employing mythological
                    themes and subsequently to realistic drama with overtones of symbolism. His <hi rend="i">The Great
                        Divide</hi> was a spectacular stage success of 1906–1907.</p>
            <p>Maurice F. Brown's book, heralded as the first full scale biography of Moody, is richly
                    documented. The author has not only drawn upon the large collections of Moody materials at
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Harvard</settlement>, <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> but has utilized the extensive correspondence—much of it still in
                    manuscript—of Moody's friends and associates. Nevertheless, the
                    author's interest focuses on the literary work so that we are given less a revelation of
                    Moody's personality than a careful exegesis of his poetry with at times a pedestrian
                    summary of the contents of the longer works.</p>
            <p>Moody's position as a leading poet in a rather fallow period remains unchallenged. Poems
                    like "Gloucester Moors," "The Menagerie," and "An Ode
                    in Time of Hesitation" are standard anthology pieces and suggest that Moody was
                    occasionally conscious of public affairs, although his natural instinct led him to mythology and
                    themes from classical antiquity. His devotion to the poetic drama was sincere and honorable. But
                    poems like "The Death of Eve" and closet drama like "The
                    Fire-Bringer" won him scant audiences; and the ample quotations provided by Professor <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName> only confirm a reader's recollections that Moody's verse was all too
                    often pretentious, flatulent, and otiose. It was only a few years after Moody died in 1910 that the
                    imagist movement burst upon the American consciousness. Compared to the bright, firm images of the
                    newer poets, the casualness and ease of free verse, the colloquialisms and paradoxes of an Ezra
                    Pound or a T. S. Eliot, Moody's poetry seems like the last grasp of the genteel tradition
                    and his careful attention <pb n="379" id="VAA4025-069-4-083"/> to rhyme and metre the rather sterile
                    exercise of a formalist.</p>
            <p>Moody gave up the writing of verse about 1905 and succumbed to his fascination with the stage. <hi rend="i">The Great Divide</hi> proved him competent in theatrical technique and demonstrated his
                    skill in dialogue. <hi rend="i">The Faith Healer,</hi> an earlier play which he revised after his
                    first real success, failed to hold audiences, however, and a brain tumor cut short his career at an
                    early age. Given a longer life Moody might have won an imposing position as a playwright able to
                    combine realistic and symbolic technique in the manner of Henrik Ibsen. But it is also possible that
                    Mark Van Doren was correct in his contention that Moody's real genius was in letter
                    writing; the fragments from Moody's correspondence in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brown</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s book seem to support this theory. At any rate most of Moody's
                    poetry has not worn well. The present biography is valuable as a record of an intellectual life and
                    as a chronicle of a literary period. It is unconvincing in its effort to make of Moody a significant
                    poet with a message for the present generation.</p>

            <p>This short interpretative work examines politics during the years of Warren G. Harding's
                    presidency and Calvin Coolidge's completion of Harding's term. Based on research
                    even more extensive than that for the author's earlier <hi rend="i">The Harding Era,</hi>
                    it depicts these years not as beginning a hiatus between Wilsonian crusades and F#2 D.
                    Roosevelt's New Deal but as a formative historical period setting a positive pattern in
                    governmental philosophy and operation for the rest of the decade.</p>
            <p>In 1920 the nation was suffering from a complexity of ills: inflation (followed by rapid deflation),
                    unemployment, the Red Scare, and international uncertainty. It seemed to many that Woodrow
                    Wilson's innovative program had not <pb n="380" id="VAA4025-069-4-084"/> lived up to its
                    promise, and, as the once aggressive President lay ill in the White House, the Democratic
                    administration appeared to founder. Normalcy provided "traditionally understandable and
                    historically acceptable methods" (p. 2) for meeting problems, and Harding personified the
                    calmness of deliberate conciliation and compromise which would follow consultation with the
                    "best minds" and result in restoration of a "proper"
                    relationship between the executive and legislative branches. Once in office, however, Harding found
                    it no easy task to work with a Congress divided within itself and well trained in conflict with Ms
                    predecessor. Despite the obstacles—and his short tenure—Harding produced much
                    of the normalcy program he had promised, and before his death in 1923 he seemed to be moving toward
                    positive leadership to achieve what was yet pending.</p>

                    of this period as is usually claimed. Senatorial investigations proceeded not only because of
                    apparent irregularities but also because of political animosity and congressional desire to limit
                    presidential authority and independence. These motivations—as well as publicity in the
                    sensation seeking press—produced a "rhetoric of corruption" which <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Murray</settlement>
                    </placeName> believes was more damaging to Harding's image than was any revelation of
                    wrongdoing on the part of his subordinates.</p>
            <p>It is easy to come away from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Murray</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s book with the impression that Harding almost alone produced the spirit of
                    his administration. Certainly he did personify its goals and methods, but other leaders were also
                    pursuing the ends of peace, harmony, and unity. Of course, this is a minor
                    criticism—evaluation of an administration's efforts necessarily must center on
                    the President—as is the point that not all quotations are perfectly accurate and at least
                    two (pp. 54–55, 75) are paraphrases rather than the quotations cited. The
                    author's purpose is to understand the politics of the Harding administration in its
                    historical setting. In this he succeeds. <hi rend="i">The Politics of Normalcy</hi> is a welcome
                    addition to the studies of the early 1920s not only because it explodes myths—some of
                    which have been exploded before, yet persist—but because it is suitable for use in
                    undergraduate courses. Such use will speed a more accurate understanding of the period and may <pb n="381" id="VAA4025-069-4-085"/> also provide useful insight into how historical interpretations
                    are formed.</p>

            <p>For those who still question the wisdom of granting women the right to vote on the eve of a national
                    election involving Warren G. Harding, this book should offer the final answer. J. Stanley Lemons of <placeName>
                        <country reg="riu">Rhode Island</country>
                    </placeName> College seeks to explore the role played by activist members of the fair sex in a
                    decade currently undergoing general historical reexamination. He admits his effort is part of that
                    reexamination and contends the feminist movement by no means ended with the ratification of the
                    Nineteenth Amendment. Rather, it spilled over into the 1920s and became one component in a surviving
                    progressivism which linked the era of Woodrow Wilson to the era of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Roosevelt.</p>
            <p>Early in this work Lemons draws a distinction between "hard core" feminists and
                    social feminists. The former gave first priority at all times to rectifying the subordinate status
                    of the American woman. The latter sympathized with this goal, yet often became disillusioned with
                    the means utilized by extremists and even more often with their disregard for other social reforms.
                    Social feminists believed that by working for all progressive legislation they would simultaneously
                    advance the status of women. It is this latter group that most concerns the author, and it is the
                    one he thinks was most influential in the 1920s.</p>
            <p>A case in point is the Shephard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Protection Act of 1921. In spite of
                    attempts by a reluctant Congress to bury the bill, an aroused group of social feminists representing
                    numerous women's professional organizations mobilized support and eventually forced the
                    passage of this first federal social security act. They then joined other reform groups in similar
                    though less successful efforts for legislation granting national unemployment compensation, health
                    insurance, and enforced limitations on wages <pb n="382" id="VAA4025-069-4-086"/> and hours. But the
                    defeat of the child labor amendment in 1925 signalled a decline in the influence of social
                    feminists. Thereafter, the author contends, constant squabbles with, hard core feminists, a rapid
                    increase in the number of groups claiming to represent women's interests, and charges that
                    feminists were part of the Spider Web (a series of leftist organizations whose alleged objective was
                    to promote bolshevist principles) all combined to subdue the social feminist movement.</p>
            <p>All this Lemons weaves into a coherent, well written study, in which he admirably covers the large
                    number of professional women's organizations existing in the 1920s. His research is
                    extensive, impressing the reader that <hi rend="i">The Woman Citizen</hi> was not quickly composed
                    to take advantage of contemporary reading interests. It is a solid effort which ably supports
                    revisionist scholarship on the 1920s. It also shows that a large number of women voters cast their
                    ballots in the 1920 presidential election for reasons much more valid than the physical
                    attractiveness of one of the candidates.</p>

            <p>Henry Wallace is an important figure, not only because he might have become President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> had not F#2 D. Roosevelt dropped him from the ticket in 1944 but also because of the
                    ideas of social liberalism that he supported. The major thesis of this work by N#2 D. Markowitz is
                    that Wallace offered an alternative to the American liberal, both in the domestic and foreign areas,
                    that was not only viable but could have prevented the excesses and solved the dilemmas that were to
                    lead to the anti-Communist liberalism of the years after 1945. Wallace as an old Progressive and New
                    Dealer wanted to continue and expand those traditions into an American social service state that
                    would culminate in the Century of the Common Man. But Roosevelt turned his back on his own domestic
                    program, and <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-069-4-087"/> Harry S Truman destroyed any chances of its
                    resuscitation by his disinterest and the appointment of political cronies whose dispositions were
                    clearly not liberal. In the area of foreign relations Wallace wanted to continue the close wartime
                    cooperation with Russia. Here, too, Wallace was thwarted, as the cold warriors of the Truman
                    administration, aided and abetted by such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., aroused the Democratic
                    liberals to the dangers of Communism and what they considered the foolishness of Wallace. Wallace in
                    a last attempt to recapture his vision broke with Truman, became the editor of the <hi rend="i">New
                        Republic,</hi> and later resigned to run for President on the Progressive ticket in 1948. But
                    alas, Gideon's army had too many colonels and not enough privates who voted, and Wallace
                    suffered a disastrous defeat as his whole movement was tarred with the brush of Communism.</p>
            <p>The author has a compelling thesis that has been ably researched and well presented, but the book is
                    marred by a gradual dropping off of the tone and level of objectivity. The implication is strongly
                    left that if Democratic liberals had only followed Wallace that the problems of postwar America
                    might have been solved and that Democratic liberals faced a choice of only two strains of thought.
                    At no time does the author consider what the possible results of following the proposals of Wallace
                    might have led to, or whether there were other alternatives within the liberal stream (both Democrat
                        <hi rend="i">and</hi> Republican) that Wallace might have tapped for broader support. As it
                    stands, Professor Markowitz' book is an important contribution to a growing camp of
                    revisionist literature on the years from 1941 to 1948.</p>

                        <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-069-4-088"/> This interesting, informative work surveys the communalism
                    of the nineteenth century, and his conclusions with respect to those utopias are likely to be
                    repeated when the history of twentieth century communitarianism is written. Those earlier Utopians
                    were frequently obsessed with sex, often wrestled vigorously with the institution of the private
                    family, and usually sought to eliminate private property. Nearly all failed. However, a few groups
                    lasted for a long time and even persist today. Certain characteristics were found in the successful
                    ones: the Ephrataites, Shakers, Rappites, Zoarites, True Inspirationists (Amana), Perfectionists,
                    Mormons, and Hutterites. They were usually religious dictatorships which either abolished or greatly
                    modified the usual institutions of private property and familism. One may guess that current groups
                    like the Black Muslims, the Children of God, or the Church of Armageddon will outlast the
                    psycho-politico-economic utopias of the disciples of B. F. Skinner, Timothy Leary, the Black
                    Panthers, or the counter culture.</p>
            <p>The principal cause of the failure of the nineteenth century utopias was the inability of the members
                    to put community interests above individual interests. One of the most fundamental, most ancient of
                    social institutions, which caused more concern among communitarians than any other thing, was the
                    private family. Victorian America believed that the family was the cornerstone of civilization, that
                    woman's sphere was the home, and that her role was motherhood. Therefore, communitarian
                    efforts to alter the family meant a fundamental change in the role and place of women. Muncy argues
                    that female dissatisfaction was a major factor in the failure of nearly all utopian experiments:
                    adjustments fell most heavily upon women. The only long lived communities were those, like the
                    Ephrata, Shaker, and Amana communities, which developed <hi rend="i">theologies</hi> that required
                    and justified major changes in marriage and the family. The secular utopias promised more rights for
                    women, but all failed in short order. The situation of women in the religious communities ranged
                    from complete subordination with the Mormons to complete equality at Oneida. Generally, however, the
                    sectarians were patriarchal.</p>
            <p>Scholars who have kept up with work on American utopianism will learn little new general information
                    but will find Muncy's selection and emphasis quite helpful. In addition <pb n="385" id="VAA4025-069-4-089"/> to a wealth of detail about sex and marriage, one learns about a number
                    of little known, even bizarre Utopias. The entire book is clearly written and well organized. A
                    topic which could have been handled so as to produce leering snickers is treated with sympathetic,
                    sober understanding. This reviewer was troubled by the absence of either a bibliography or some note
                    on sources. While Muncy seems to have read everything in the printed sources, he seems to have used
                    only one or two manuscript collections.</p>
