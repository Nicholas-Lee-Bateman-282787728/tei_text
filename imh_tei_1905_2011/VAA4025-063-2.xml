            <p>In the history of the reform heritage of the American people the Progressive Era has loomed large,
                    Here was a reform drive which operated on all levels of government, included large segments of both
                    major parties as well as the most important third party movement in this century, and introduced
                    significant reforms in the social and economic realms as well as the political world. The movement
                    included most of the familiar names of the pre-World War I era—Theodore Roosevelt,
                    Woodrow Wilson, Robert M. La Follette, Albert J. Beveridge, Charles Evans Hughes, and George W.
                    Norris-and created so favorable a climate of opinion that such diverse figures as William Howard
                    Taft and Eugene V. Debs both claimed to be progressives.</p>
            <p>The Progressive Movement had several unusual aspects in contrast to other reform eras. Progressivism
                    thrived during an era of prosperity. The movement developed under intellectual leadership and
                    claimed the support of farmers, trade unionists, the small business middle class, and even an
                    occasional millionaire. It had many faces which varied according to the time or geographical
                    location as well as the leader. Progressivism was also relatively free from the rancor which has
                    characterized other liberal reform drives. There was none of the hostile desperation which marked
                    the internal upheaval during the American Revolution; one fails to find the bitter moral
                    recriminations of the antislavery crusade that dominated the fervor of reform of the Jacksonian Era;
                    nor does one find any of the gloom, pessimism, and sense of crisis which ushered in the New Deal.
                    This is not to say that the progressives were not sincere or that their leaders were not
                    hard-hitting champions of the cause; but Progressivism was moderate, its leaders were accepted and

            <p>In general the progressive was a planner. He advocated expansion of government for general social
                    welfare, for economic opportunity, and for political democracy. He had shifted his views from the
                    Jeffersonian philosophy of "liberty against government" to Theodore
                    Roosevelt's New Nationalism concept of "liberty through government" in
                    order to control big business and big labor. Essentially he was a pragmatist, ready to accept a
                    mixed economy if it could advance the general welfare. He saw nothing incompatible between the
                    federal postal system, the Panama Canal, or indeed the <placeName>

                    </placeName> Valley Authority, and the capitalistic free enterprise system. He was optimistic,
                    confident, and certain that the future belonged to democracy, and that the "cure for the
                    ills of democracy was more democracy."<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If these generalizations have any validity, the question immediately arises, what happened to the
                    Progressive Movement? Why was such a reform drive, seemingly so well-equipped with
                    leaders, amply supplied with issues, and buttressed with an optimistic liberal philosophy, so
                    short-lived? The traditional assignment of dates for the Progressive Movement places it
                    generally between 1901 and 1917, barely more than a decade and a half. As the latter date also
                    denotes America's entrance into World War I, the question is frequently asked in its
                    balder form: "Did the war kill the Progressive Movement?" Admittedly,
                    the war shattered the progressive organization, destroyed a part of the progressive leadership, and
                    left the progressive rank and file wandering in the wilderness, confused concerning causes and goals
                    for the better part of a decade. It is the purpose of this paper to examine the breakup of the
                    progressive coalition, to trace the continued <list type="footnotes">

                    twenties, and to note the role of progressive leaders and issues among the sources of the New Deal.
                    If these are substantial, it would indicate the existence of a "bridge" between
                    the reform eras of the Progressive Movement and the New Deal.</p>
            <p>As Wilson scholar Arthur S. Link has suggested, there were several causes for the decline of the
                    progressive reform drive. First, the progressive elements were never able to create or gain
                    permanent control of a political organization capable of carrying them into national office. Instead
                    they were forced to rely on temporary combinations which would allow them to dominate one of the
                    major parties such as the Republican party in 1904 or the Democratic party in 1916. The effort to
                    create a Progressive party in 1912 had been short-lived and had by no means attracted all the
                    progressives into its ranks. This lack of a political vehicle continued through the twenties with
                    the Republican party patently impossible for progressive purposes, the third party movement of 1924
                    doomed to failure because of national prosperity and inertia, and the Democratic party so torn by
                    internal strife that it almost ceased to be a national party. Second, the tensions which had wrecked
                    the progressive coalition of 1916 not only persisted but grew during the twenties. The alliance
                    between farmers and organized labor broke up. The rural-urban split often left these two groups more
                    opposed to each other than to their erstwhile foes. Third, these tension-ridden reformers were never
                    able to agree on a program that could form the basis of an effective revival. Some intellectuals
                    repudiated progressive ideals, and many of the urban middle class defected, thoroughly frightened by
                    the aftermath of the war. Fourth, for a time the progressives suffered from a lack of effective
                    leadership. The twenties, with its climate of contentment, materialism, and prosperity was an
                    unpropitious time to launch a new progressive crusade. Many of the old leaders were still on the
                    scene, and the younger generation who had served its apprenticeship under Theodore Roosevelt and
                    Woodrow Wilson had not yet emerged. These reasons help explain the decline of Progressivism after
                    the war, but they do not adequately provide a clue for the continuing reform sentiment evident
                    during <pb n="86" id="VAA4025-063-2-004"/> the twenties nor the remarkable resurgence of the
                    progressive temper in the early thirties.<hi rend="sup">3</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps more should be said about the nature of the progressive split. The progressive leadership
                    differed violently over the issue of the war itself. Theodore Roosevelt would have entered the war
                    enthusiastically and early; Wilson entered reluctantly and at the eleventh hour; La Follette and
                    Norris would have remained neutral. Even after war had been declared, the methods of prosecuting it
                    divided still other progressives. By some strange alchemy of public opinion, both pro-war,
                    pro-league Wilson and anti-war, anti-league La Follette were discredited for a time during the
                    twenties. The orthodox and preferred position seemed to be the pro-war, weak-league (really
                    anti-league) stance which had characterized Henry Cabot Lodge and the bulk of the conservative
                    Republicans. Until the wounds made by this issue had healed, no regrouping of progressives was
                    possible.</p>
            <p>Wilson's home front policies engendered deep antagonisms among many progressive
                    supporters. Such measures as the espionage and sedition acts; his winking at the atrocities of the
                    vigilante mobs that harassed first, second, and even third generation immigrant families under the
                    guise of patriotism; and his partisan call for a Democratic Congress in 1918 alienated large
                    segments of the population. Men who had enthusiastically voted for Wilson in 1912 and 1916 became so
                    broodingly hostile that his name became anathema to them. The war became Wilson's war,
                    the treaty Wilson's treaty, and the league Wilson's league. The shortcomings
                    of the <placeName>

                    foredoomed the Democratic party as a vehicle of reform in the immediate postwar years.
                    Wilson's physical collapse, the evidences of his increased rigidity in the months that
                    followed, and his "dog in the manger" attitude preceding the Democratic convention
                    of 1920 only completed the debacle.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>Perhaps the very successes which Progressivism enjoyed prior to 1917 help explain its subsequent
                    decline. The initial reforms on the state level proposed by such leaders as La Follette, Hughes,
                    Joseph Folk, Albert Cummins, and Hiram Johnson had largely been written into law. Such
                    accomplishments as the direct primary, effective railroad commissions, reform of the state tax
                    structure, regulation of big business, labor legislation, water power and conservation programs, and
                    corrupt practices laws had exhausted the reform zeal of the moderate progressive. When one adds the
                    reforms which characterized the Square Deal and the New Freedom on the national level and the
                    concerted drive for improved education which was a hallmark of Progressivism in the South, the list
                    of innovations was indeed long, and many men of liberal and reasonable persuasion were willing to
                    see how the new reforms worked before launching out on new crusades.<hi rend="sup">5</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not to intimate that the progressive program was complete. Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana,
                    for example, carried on a long and frustrating fight to ban child labor from American industry. But
                    not for another generation would the public and the courts accept this much needed reform. La
                    Follette and other advanced progressive leaders raised new issues and proposed new reforms which
                    were oriented to the increasing urbanization of American society. From a large part of the American
                    people these new calls brought forth only a limited response. Perhaps a period of pause and
                    consolidation was needed.<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not all of the progressive reforms were either wise or successful. An outstanding case in point was

                    "bone-dry" enforcement law at the end of the war. The entire prohibition issue
                    soon split the remaining progressive forces. Though there had been twenty-two states dry by their
                    own action prior to 1917, the reaction in them had given no clue which could have anticipated the
                    rise of the bootleggers or the organization of gangster syndicates that often superseded the elected
                    law enforcement officers of a city. Nor could prohibition advocates have foreseen the shabby
                    enforcement policies of the Harding administration and the lethargy of the states. Die-hard
                    supporters of prohibition and other progressives who were ready to scrap the "noble
                    experiment" early in the twenties split on this issue to the exclusion of all else. The
                    tensions and friction engendered by prohibition kept progressives in all parts of the country
                    mutually hostile and largely prevented any coalition on other issues. Not until the end of the
                    decade did a majority of liberal and progressive-minded citizens, interested in social reform and
                    good government, agree that the prohibition experiment had been a failure and should be scrapped.
                    Even then repeal had to await a new administration.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>

            <p>Not all of the intellectuals abandoned Progressivism during the twenties. True, Lincoln Steffens had
                    been seduced by a more radical solution to man's ills and for a time was certain that he
                    had seen the future and it worked. Brooks Adams had retired to meditate on his <hi rend="i">Degredation of the Democratic Dogma</hi> and to contemplate Oswald Spengler's essay
                    on <hi rend="i">The Decline of the West.</hi> John Chamberlain had despaired of the success of
                    democratic reform and looked to the coming revolution. But these are merely examples of the split
                    which existed within the liberal ranks.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most influential progressive intellectuals who were active in the twenties were John
                    Dewey, Charles A. Beard, Thorstein Veblen, Walter Lippmann, and Herbert Croly. All had been
                    prominent in the prewar era, and each had made a contribution to progressive thought. Dewey provided
                    his philosophy of experimentalism or instrumental-ism, Beard his political analysis and history,
                    Veblen his pragmatic economics, Lippmann his practical political moderation, and Croly the morale

                    reformulation of democracy in terms of the changes taking place in American society. To Dewey the
                    democratic public was still largely unorganized, and the solution was some form of democratic
                    collectivism. His influence was great among the general public as well as in educational circles.</p>

                    "A Five Year Plan for America," and "Conservatism Hits Bottom"
                    all foresaw optimistically the future promise in American life built on the American past. Man as a
                    rational animal, Beard argued, would have to impose rationality upon politics and force upon society
                    an even larger area of planned conduct.<hi rend="sup">11</hi>

                    preoccupation with profits rather than production and distribution seemed to be an endorsement of
                    the new technology and even earned the endorsement of some industrialists. Veblen's
                    disciples, John R. Commons, Selig Perlman, and Edwin Witte, made economics more meaningful and

            <p>In <hi rend="i">Public Opinion</hi> Lippmann argued that the "Great Society" had
                    grown so "furiously and to such colossal dimensions" that the average citizen
                    (including the average lawyer) lacked the competence to direct its affairs. The public had been
                    forced to call in experts who were trained (or had trained themselves) to make parts of this great
                    society intelligible to those who managed it. The social scientist, said Lippmann, had been one of
                    the last of these; but he, too, had to participate in the planning if the society were to function.
                    In A Preface to Morals he insisted that men, if they were civilized, must become humanists. By
                    restrained and voluntary reciprocal actions Lippmann would use only democratic processes to achieve
                    the desired social goals. Still later in The Good Society Lippmann formulated a balance between
                    liberty and order which would promote the best in American society. His proposals included

                    seemingly lost interest in current politics. The task of the liberal, thought Croly, was to acquire
                    social education and knowledge of human behavior and to put this new learning into use by means of

                    boss-controlled city. Steffens had written an article on <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Boss Cox in which he had asked Cox if he was the boss of the city. "I
                    am," replied Cox. "Of course you have a mayor, and a council, and
                    judges?" queried Steffens. "I have," responded the boss,
                    "I have a telephone, too." This brief, laconic statement, as Steffens said, summed
                    up the truth about <placeName>

                    to call on the mayor when he was gathering material for his story; the mayor could not and would not
                    have helped him—he was a mere puppet.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> Despite a halfhearted effort
                    at reform after the publication of Steffen's article, the city remained under the
                    domination of Boss Cox and the machine. This was still the situation after Cox died, and it
                    continued unchanged through the war and into the decade of the twenties. Then suddenly in 1924
                    something happened.</p>

                    proposals—right down to the individual ward, precinct, and block. On election day the
                    voters adopted the new city charter and authorized the establishment of a city-manager type of
                    government. Under the new manager, who was both an army engineer and a graduate lawyer, the city
                    proceeded to clean house. Out went the grafters, corrupt police officials, and known criminals.

                    reforms and promising to reduce the service and regulatory commissions which the La Follette
                    organization had set up. Philipp held office for three terms until 1920, and though he was far from
                    an unenlightened governor, by no means could one describe him as a near-progressive. He had opposed
                    the primary election system, the state income tax, and the increased welfare program of the state.
                    His most liberal actions involved his staunch defense of civil liberties against the

            <p>Smith's record as governor was thoroughly liberal. In his first term during the Red Scare
                    of 1919-1920, he opposed the repressive Lusk bills, denounced the Palmer raids, and spoke against
                    the expulsion of Socialists from the <placeName>

                    demonstrated his broad bipartisan interest in good government by nominating and securing the
                    appointment of Charles Evans Hughes as chairman of the commission. Due largely to Smith's
                    efforts the report was completed, adopted, and in 1927 went into effect. In other reforms he
                    systematically eliminated grade crossings in the state, established a state health laboratory,
                    expanded the state park system, and pushed public ownership and operation of the state's
                    waterpower facilities. He sponsored labor legislation to protect women and children, liberalized the
                    workman's compensation law, and secured the adoption for <placeName>

                    Follette could throw the election into the House of Representatives. A temporary third party
                    movement, especially one organized in July of the election year, with no grass-roots candidates for
                    state and local offices, could not expect to unseat one of the major parties. Rather, and without
                    denying La Follette's sincerity and dedication, the Progressive campaign of 1924 was more
                    a race for the record: to make an effective protest against the conservatism and lack of vision of
                    both major parties, and to keep the various reform elements together against the day that the
                    political tide would turn liberal again. La Follette, at sixty-nine, could hardly have been expected
                    to take over and to run effectively the federal machinery of government even had he been elected.
                    The aftermath of the election, when the Republican leadership stripped La Follette, Ladd, Frazier,

                    "lame duck" amendment as early as 1922, a proposal to strengthen the Federal
                    Reserve System and guarantee bank deposits, and a continuing drive to stop the excessive use by the

                    with the Soviets as a member of the family of nations than as an international outcast. Brookhart
                    stressed the possible commercial advantages that might accrue from restoration of normal relations
                    as the Russians were in need of the very types of goods which America had to export. La Follette
                    argued that the Russian people could establish any type of government that they liked, and the
                    Communist state was at least as respectable as <placeName>

                    Borah introduced resolutions into the Senate calling for the immediate recognition of the <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Though these proposals never came to a vote, Borah used the hearings as an opportunity
                    to explain the arguments for recognition to the general public. In this he received wide publicity
                    in the nation's press.<hi rend="sup">35</hi>

                    </placeName>. The number of advocates of resumption of normal diplomatic relations with Russia
                    steadily grew. Bronson Cutting, William King, Wheeler, and Norris all came out in favor of
                    recognition. The fact that a private Russian trading company, Amtorg, was steadily increasing trade
                    with the <placeName>

                    Pont were doing business in this fashion lent an economic argument to the drive for recognition.
                    With the coming of the depression many progressives, including Borah, came to look upon Russian
                    recognition as a means to stimulate trade and to help bring a return of prosperity to the <placeName>

            <p>There remains the task of describing the bridge whereby the progressives of the twenties, together
                    with their intellectual and political baggage, made their way across to the New Deal in 1932 and
                    1933. The way is rather clearly marked. George Norris had, as he called it, "crossed the
                    Rubicon" in 1928, abandoned the Republican party, and supported A1 Smith. In 1932 he was a
                    close and respected advisor of FDR, especially on matters of public power. Burton K. Wheeler, La
                    Follette's running mate in 1924, came out for Roosevelt in 1930, saying that the <placeName>

                    than anyone else in public life. Harold Ickes, the old Bull Moose Progressive of 1912, had deserted
                    the Republicans in 1928. In 1932 he actively campaigned for FDR and organized the Western
                    Independent Republicans for Roosevelt.<hi rend="sup">38</hi>

            <p>Most of the survivors of the La Follette Progressive campaign of 1924—La Follette, Jr.,
                    Wheeler, Cutting, and others—were ready to join in the drive to restore a liberal
                    government under Roosevelt. Norris had drawn cheers and applause when he told the audience at the
                    Progressive Conference in 1931 that the country would not get progressive legislation until it got a
                    progressive president, "another Roosevelt." They agreed with Norris that FDR was

                    they had no other place to go. Progressivism became respectable again in high places, liberalism was

                    Progressivism was not dead but simply temporarily interrupted, divided, and lacking in effective
                    leadership. In many areas reform continued to display surprising vigor. Progressives, found in
                    intellectual circles, in city reform crusades, in state administrations, and in an outspoken
                    minority in Congress, provided a bridge for the ideas and ideals of the Progressive Era to cross
                    over the twenties to the New Deal. Then with the rise of new and dynamic progressive leadership, the

            <p>In 1912 the Republican party was in serious trouble both on the national level and in such key states
                    as Indiana. The difficulty was rooted in the growing insurgency within its ranks. Some of its most
                    important leaders were dissatisfied with the party leadership and particularly with President
                    William Howard Taft. The conflict became so acute that before the end of the year it split the
                    Republican party into two organizations, the regular Republicans and the new Progressive party. Each
                    offered a slate of candidates and a platform.</p>
            <p>One of the significant converts to the Progressive party caught up in the turmoil was former
                    Republican Senator Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana. Beveridge had become a <placeName>

                    </placeName> Senator in 1899, won re-election in 1904, but in 1910 experienced defeat at the polls.
                    In that year Beveridge found that he could not control his own party organization. The national GOP

                    party "regulars" intrigued against him, eroding intraparty cooperation.</p>
            <p>By 1912 it appeared that Beveridge's political career was at a crossroads. The Republican
                    nominating convention again chose Taft as its presidential candidate and endorsed conservatism.
                    Former president Theodore Roosevelt, who had become disillusioned with Taft's policies,
                    bolted the Republicans and formed the Progressive party. Roosevelt became the new party's
                    presidential nominee and the Republican split was complete. Beveridge now faced the alternative of
                    either leaving the Republican party or abandoning his political future with the increasingly
                    progressive-minded Indiana electorate. Theodore Roosevelt's new party afforded a possible
                    solution. Thus, the former senator seized upon the opportunity to promote various reform ideas and
                    thereby salvage and advance his political career. Beveridge's need to keep <list type="footnotes">

                    reform wave to victory. The Progressives never recovered from their defeat and in 1916 Beveridge
                    returned to the Republicans, thus ending a short and futile chapter in his political career.</p>
            <p>Beveridge's difficulties with his Republican colleagues began in 1904. In both the state
                    and national organizations these conflicts destroyed political cooperation and opened a breach
                    between Beveridge and Taft's administration.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> These differences
                    centered on federal patronage and on the Hoosier's tendency to align himself with the

                    Beveridge's commitment to Theodore Roosevelt, due to their similar political philosophies
                    and bond of personal friendship, also damaged the senator's political relationship with
                    Taft. These issues contributed to Beveridge's defeat in November, 1910. His memory of the
                    bitter conflict during the campaign tended to make the senator more critical of his party and
                    promoted an inclination to doubt his future in it.</p>
            <p>Beveridge encountered his first major problem in Indiana in 1910. He met the wrath of the
                    administration when he opposed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff. Taft had promised a lower tariff, but when
                    it emerged the rates were higher than Beveridge honestly could support. He stated that <text>

            </p>
            <p>Beveridge worked for a resolution condemning the Payne-Aldrich Tariff at the Indiana Republican State
                    Convention. Anything less than condemnation would indicate a lack of unity and support for the
                    senator. He knew that the regular wing of the party, the Taft supporters, would oppose such a
                    resolution and he feared their success because of their close connections to powerful
                    "interests" with a "good deal of money."<hi rend="sup">6</hi>
                    Moreover, he thought his enemies would even try to secure an endorsement of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff
                    in the state platform.<hi rend="sup">7</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Republican state convention met in April, 1910, Beveridge delivered a speech in which he
                    condemned the stand-pat element of the party for allegedly destroying the essence of his proposed
                    non-partisan tariff commission. The senator went further in attacking the Payne-Aldrich Tariff as an
                    unjust measure.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> In assailing administration legislation and the regular members
                    of the party, Beveridge carried the convention in the battle against the pro-Payne-Aldrich forces,
                    but he opened a political breach for himself that would never entirely heal. The "Old
                    Guard" in the party would remember its defeat.</p>
            <p>After his success in gaining a rejection of the tariff act at the state convention Beveridge
                    experienced defeat and embarrassment. The party leaders of each of Indiana's thirteen
                    districts met separately in March to consider an endorsement of the state platform. Under the
                    influence of party regulars, three of the thirteen districts endorsed the tariff act rather than the
                    state platform's resolution condemning it.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>

            <p>Within the GOP nationally, the senator's insurgency on the tariff made him unpopular with

                    Speaker of the House Joe Cannon concluded that all the insurgents were out to "make

                    Cannon's legislative support for his programs.<hi rend="sup">14</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In June, 1910, the rift between Taft and Beveridge broadened. In a personal confrontation the
                    President angrily denied the senator a patronage request, stating it was because Beveridge had
                    opposed his administration.<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The Hoosier pretended he could not
                    "fathom Administration patronage policy" and branded it "alien and
                    repugnant." Up to this point he had not encountered much patronage discrimination, but that
                    experience was an ominous indication that he was "to suffer from this time on."<hi rend="sup">16</hi>

            <p>As the 1910 campaign approached, the breach between Beveridge and the regular wing of the party
                    threatened to grow wider. The senator, understandably, feared the power of the regulars. He thought

            <p>Under the circumstances Beveridge turned more and more toward Theodore Roosevelt for both direct and
                    indirect help. The Hoosier tried to get the former president to join other anti-administration
                    forces in opposition to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff but failed to get this support.<hi rend="sup">18</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Roosevelt agreed to give Beveridge only one day of his campaign time but when he reached Indiana
                    unscheduled delays forced him to pass up several meetings. His trip was a fiasco for another reason.
                    Before campaigning in Indiana, Roosevelt declared his support for the tariff act at the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nyu">New York</region>
                    </placeName> Republican State Convention.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Moreover, he later declared his
                    support for an administration regular, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> Thus Roosevelt's influence probably was not
                    beneficial.</p>
            <p>The campaign was bitterly fought and centered around the question of who was the truer progressive.
                    Beveridge's strategy was to attract the votes of progressive Democrats, but the record as
                    a progressive of the Democratic nominee, John Worth Kern, prevented the senator from diverting these
                    votes to himself.</p>
            <p>After Kern defeated him in November, 1910, Beveridge assessed his role in the GOP and concluded that
                    regular Republicans impeded his success.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> He thought the defeat was partially
                    his party's and Taft's responsibility. In a more cynical mood he wrote that
                    "the administration did not throw us more than six or seven billion votes."<hi rend="sup">22</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kern's victory reaffirmed Beveridge's earlier views of the trend in American
                    politics. Beveridge believed in the power of "progressive" ideas. He thought his
                    constituents supported policies which would end corruption and tended to give greater opportunity,
                    protection, and security to the individual. Any candidate who supported these ideas would have the

                        way."<hi rend="sup">24</hi> The Indiana voters were not completely in accord with these
                    views since they were not as committed to progressive ideas as were <placeName>

                    </placeName> voters, for example. Then, too, Beveridge's isolation from Taft prompted him
                    to inflate the power of Progressivism. Nevertheless, progressive ideas did have appeal in Indiana
                    and the profession of such concepts was necessary for political success. Beveridge realized this
                    fact, especially after his 1910 defeat.</p>
            <p>Throughout 1911 and into 1912 Beveridge insisted that he had retired from politics. He spent part of
                    1911 vacationing in <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName>. Publicly he maintained a neutrality in political feuds. When questioned about possible
                    presidential aspirations, Beveridge replied that he had been commissioned to write articles, had
                    little time for politics, and considered such speculation as an "absurd
                        proposition."<hi rend="sup">25</hi> "I am out of politics," wrote
                    Beveridge, "and hope to be permitted to stay out." He would not return unless the
                    "call of sheer duty" compelled his return.<hi rend="sup">26</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Beveridge's private actions were not those of a retired politician. In
                    December, 1910, he had tried to restore his relations with the administration. He met with
                    Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock in an attempt to solve patronage problems and thought he had been
                        successful.<hi rend="sup">27</hi> The next month he met with President Taft, and the
                    senator's advisors felt this discussion had improved their political relations.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> But by December, 1911, relations between the President and the former senator
                    had deteriorated again. Taft ignored Beveridge and his supporters in Indiana, an affront which
                    Beveridge thought unreasonable. "Nobody," wrote Beveridge, "knows why Mr.
                    Taft does the things [he does] and admits to other things he does not do."<hi rend="sup">29</hi> As a result, the Hoosier was "not feeling too friendly to Mr. Taft."<hi rend="sup">30</hi>

            <p>The ex-senator's friends thought Taft's future with the national electorate
                    would be a poor one and considered him an unsatisfactory choice as the Republican standard-bearer in

            <p>Beveridge did not want to lose the influence he had acquired in Indiana. He proposed that the
                    Republicans in the state assembly develop their own legislative program based upon such popular
                    ideas as the initiative, referendum, and direct primary; and he implied a willingness to lead the
                    campaign for the adoption of these principles in Indiana.<hi rend="sup">33</hi> None of these
                    actions depicted a retired politician.</p>
            <p>In 1911 the party schism in the state organization continued. Beveridge's goal in these
                    factional feuds was to remain aloof. John Hayes, Beveridge's secretary and one of his
                    most trusted advisors, made a suggestion. He feared Beveridge would become involved in controversies
                    that could only work to his disadvantage if he were in Indiana. The secretary thought there was a
                    regular Republican plot to "annihilate" Beveridge politically. Hayes counseled him
                    to stay in <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> until October to preserve his political independence and Beveridge followed this
                        advice.<hi rend="sup">34</hi> Even when he returned to Indiana in mid-October 1911, Beveridge
                    remained formally uncommitted to any course of action that might jeopardize his independent
                    position. Nevertheless, rather than becoming less involved in political action, the Hoosier became
                    committed to a reorganization of his Indiana corps of followers.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> This was not
                    political retirement.</p>
            <p>Beveridge's activities from 1910 to 1912—his grip on his organization, his
                    avoidance of feuds and commitments—portrayed a politician waiting to see the direction in
                    which the political winds blew. Yet he continued to insist that he had retired from the political
                    arena. He had not the "slightest thought of being a candidate … for any other
                    office." "Public questions interest me profoundly," he wrote,
                    "but the pulling and hauling of politics interests me not at all."<hi rend="sup">36</hi>

            <p>By February of 1912 the pressures on Beveridge to declare his political stand began to increase. He
                    clearly could not support Taft. Senator Robert M. La Follette, the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> progressive Republican, also had presidential ambitions, and his campaign managers had
                    been trying to persuade the ex-senator to support their candidate. But La Follette's
                    momentary illness took him out of the race. Even after Roosevelt declared himself a candidate for
                    the Republican presidential nomination on February 21, the ex-senator remained uncommitted to any
                    course of action. Theoretically, the choice was Taft, Roosevelt, or true retirement. Since Beveridge
                    was personally attached and politically indebted to Roosevelt, there was, in reality, little choice.
                    On February 29, 1912, Beveridge declared his support for Roosevelt's Republican
                        candidacy.<hi rend="sup">37</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beveridge soon completed the break with Taft. He commented acidly on his belief that Taft forced his
                    officeholders to oppose Roosevelt with the threat of dismissal from office.<hi rend="sup">38</hi> In
                    one particular speech Beveridge declared that he owed Taft no support because the President had
                    failed to become an adequate party leader.<hi rend="sup">39</hi> "The trouble is not with
                    Mr. Taft's conservativism," Beveridge wrote, "but with his peculiar
                    variability and his inability to get things done."<hi rend="sup">40</hi> With these remarks
                    Beveridge made it almost impossible ever to regain the President's confidence were Taft
                    renominated.</p>
            <p>Aware of the fact that his image would suffer if Taft received the nomination, and he were tied to
                    the President, Beveridge could not support him. A man who could neither lead nor win votes for the
                    party deserved no consideration. Beveridge was "absolutely convinced" that Taft
                    could not "possibly be elected."<hi rend="sup">41</hi> "The Lord
                    knows," he wrote, "how I am going to line up for Taft if he is nominated
                    … but doubtless [the Lord] will show me."<hi rend="sup">42</hi> It seemed
                    nothing could force Beveridge to commit the political suicide that would almost certainly ensue
                    after a rapprochment with Taft.</p>

            <p>In March, 1912, Indiana held its state primaries in which each of the thirteen districts elected two
                    delegates to the national party convention. The initial results showed Roosevelt delegates
                    outnumbering Taft supporters by a five to four ratio, but both Taft and Roosevelt managers contested
                    the count in several districts. Although he had no evidence, Beveridge blamed the Republican
                    regulars for the lack of a clear-cut Roosevelt victory and accused them of corrupt and unethical
                        practices.<hi rend="sup">43</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indiana Republican State Convention met in April and chose four Taft delegates-at-large to attend
                    the national Republican convention. Beveridge ascribed this choice to questionable political
                    practices, but again he could not prove his allegations.<hi rend="sup">44</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the end of April and in early May Beveridge went on a campaign tour for Roosevelt through the
                    western states. Upon his return the Hoosier stated that he thought he had fulfilled his obligations
                    to Roosevelt and repeated his assertion that he was "through with politics."<hi rend="sup">45</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Beveridge wished to remain in politics, as his actions seem to indicate, the realities of the
                    situation required alliance with Roosevelt. "I decline [to campaign]," Beveridge
                    wrote, "then comes Theodore Roosevelt himself and there is nothing to do but to
                        consent."<hi rend="sup">46</hi> As the Republican national convention approached,
                    Beveridge reaffirmed his loyalty to Roosevelt. "I shall stand by Roosevelt," he
                    wrote, "until the last gun is fired and the last ounce of powder is exhausted."<hi rend="sup">47</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The nomination of Taft in June, 1912, at the Republican National Convention threw Beveridge into a
                    quandary. Despite his desire to remain in politics, his split with the regular Republicans seemed
                    irreparable. Since his future with the Taft wing of the Republican party was very insecure, the only
                    successful political future available to Beveridge seemed to be alliance with Roosevelt. The
                    latter's decision to bolt the Republican party and form the Progressive party added <list type="footnotes">

                    it presented Beveridge with a clear choice: remain with a politically unattractive candidate and
                    party from which he had been alienated, or join a colleague to whom he had a personal and political
                    attachment and the new Progressive party. In view of what Beveridge believed about the public
                    opinion of his constituents, the Republican platform was too conservative for political success.</p>
            <p>Edwin Lee and Leo Rothschild, two of Beveridge's political lieutenants, contributed
                    contradictory opinions to him. Lee suggested that to avoid joining Roosevelt's party
                    would be a tacit alignment with the "Old Guard" machines, and to refuse a
                    commitment either way would certainly mean political death.<hi rend="sup">48</hi> Rothschild
                    counseled Beveridge to "lay low for a considerable time" since his decision would,
                    in reality, depend upon whom the Democrats might nominate. Rothschild distrusted Roosevelt and he
                    even urged the former senator to avoid news interviews. The regulars figure, wrote Rothschild, that
                    if you leave the Republican party, "it will put you in such a position that they will not
                    have to contend with you in the future."<hi rend="sup">49</hi> Beveridge temporarily chose
                    to follow Rothschild's advice while deciding upon whom he would support. Although
                    hesitant, there was no question of his involvement; he had not retired.</p>
            <p>With the Democratic convention's nomination of Wilson in July, 1912,
                    Beveridge's friends and advisors pressured him for a decision. One supporter felt that to
                    remain silent would be tantamount to "playing politics."<hi rend="sup">50</hi> Lee
                    continued to encourage Beveridge to join Roosevelt's Progressives. "Your silence
                    at this critical time," wrote Lee, "will be taken advantage of by your enemies and
                    the seeds of suspicion against your sincerity will … be sown."<hi rend="sup">51</hi> In a second letter Lee indicated that in Indiana the Progressive party could expect between
                    80 and 95 percent of the Republican vote, 10 to 30 percent of the Democratic vote, and a majority of
                    the independent vote.<hi rend="sup">52</hi>

            <p>Beveridge continued to postpone a decision. Throughout early July he received letters either urging
                    him to join the new party or requesting his reasons for remaining silent. In answering these letters
                    he revealed some of his real political motives. The former senator had joined Roosevelt's
                    campaign for the Republican nomination because his constituents believed in progressive ideas. He
                    was also well aware of the political debt he owed Roosevelt as a result of the former
                    president's aid in his 1910 senatorial campaign. But he protested that he had stood by
                    Roosevelt only because of the ex-president's pressures and appeals.<hi rend="sup">53</hi>
                    Beveridge admitted that he feared the Progressive party had only one unifying base: Theodore
                    Roosevelt. The Hoosier concluded his thoughts with a statement that he wished to remain inactive.<hi rend="sup">54</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still Beveridge was inclined to adhere to the new movement because it carried a greater promise of
                    political success than if he remained in the Republican party. In late July the Hoosier sought
                    guarantees from the Progressive party leadership that the new party would develop an appealing
                    program of social reforms and become a permanent party, whatever the November election results. His

                    Beveridge's decision to join the Progressive party.</p>
            <p>On July 25 Beveridge made his decision public. He published a letter in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Star setting forth the reasons for his decision. He justified his choice on idealistic
                    grounds. He stated that frauds in the old party and the promise of a better system through
                    Roosevelt's party were in part responsible. The Progressive party presented the
                    opportunity to join a truly national, liberal, and nonsectional party. The contemporary party
                    organizations based on sectionalism, without a coherent and consistent philosophy, and influenced by
                    boss systems, were illogical and dangerous. Because of these considerations Beveridge wrote that he

            </p>
            <p>These reasons, viewed critically, were designed for popular appeal. Almost all were the remarks of a
                    politician skilled in appealing to his constituents. The historian, however, on the basis of such
                    evidence, must be careful in ascribing motives. Those which Beveridge professed had some bearing on
                    his decision, but they must remain secondary. Nor is the fact that some of Beveridge's
                    closest friends were involved in the new party enough to account for his choice. Beveridge split
                    with his party at the state and national levels and refused to accept Taft as the party's
                    presidential nominee. He became politically attached to Roosevelt and acquired a strong belief in
                    the power of progressive ideas and programs with his constituents. These factors, plus an abiding
                    desire to remain a politician, and his belief that political success could now come to him only in
                    the Progressive party certainly must have carried more weight than his professed motives. To remain
                    in the Republican party would have appeared to the electorate as an abdication of principle. If he
                    were to continue in politics Beveridge really had no choice but to join the new party. First and
                    foremost he was a politician. It is closer to reality to believe that it was primarily for these
                    latter reasons, rather than those he publicly professed, that Albert J. Beveridge joined the
                    Progressive party of 1912.</p>

                    probably nothing was more truly American in that era than Fourth of July celebrations. The

                    "Our country—May she never doubt the fidelity of her absent sons in the hour of
                    danger." There was also an energetic saluate to "Brother Jonathan—May

                    historian and already an ardent nationalist, delivered a fervid oration; and James Patton read an
                    appropriate poem. "I am sure of it," wrote Bancroft, "never did two
                    Americans deliver a more patriotic oration or more exalted poem, or think toasts more full of love
                    of country than these two forlorn pilgrims at Gottingen." Especially did the young patriots
                    want it understood that their exposure to European culture could not lessen their devotion to
                    "the land where freedom has planted her standard." "My countrymen, we are
                    Americans," Bancroft cried at the close of his oration. "The arts and sciences of

            <p>If Fourth of July celebrations abroad were sometimes so boisterous as to provoke foreigners,
                    Americans themselves could become incensed at the failure of foreigners to show proper respect for
                    the birthday of their Republic. Yankees in Honolulu, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>
                    </placeName>, were so irritated at the holiday conduct of local officials in 1847 that they accused
                    the Hawaiians of blatant "anti-American prejudice." It seems that on the Fourth of
                    July the American commissioner lowered the small <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> flag which ordinarily flew over his residence, replacing it with "a large
                    magnificent one" more suitable for the happy occasion. Immediately afterwards the large
                    royal standard at the palace was lowered, and "the very smallest and meanest"
                    Hawaiian banner was raised in its stead. Moreover, local officials failed to fire any Fourth of July
                    salutes from the fort guns. When they recalled the respect accorded the British on their holidays,
                    the Americans were even more provoked. On the anniversary of Queen Victoria's birth,
                    there had been on the local flagpoles "a display of the largest and richest Hawaiian flags
                    and royal standards that are ever seen to float." On the anniversary of her coronation,
                    there had been "joyful demonstrations," including the firing of salutes in respect
                    to the British ensign by order of the native government. To the patriotic Americans this was proof
                    aplenty that <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="hiu">Hawaii</region>

            </p>
            <p>Yankees also "kept the day" aboard ship. Henry Bradshaw Fearon, an Englishman,
                    noted that the anniversary was observed in 1817 on board the <placeName>

                    by the singing of several songs of 1776 vintage. The Briton reported that John Quincy Adams and his
                    family, returning home from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">London</settlement>
                    </placeName>, joined in the merrymaking. Even Fearon was not immune to the Fourth of July fever.
                    "I felt warm in the cause," he candidly confessed, "viewing that
                    declaration as the common property of every friend of freedom."<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    pistols, and by cheering for liberty to the top of their voices. The passengers, most of whom were
                    immigrants bound for the young nation in the West, were no less enthusiastic and "joined in
                    the strongest expressions of their devotedness to the democratic form of government … and

            </p>
            <p>A most elaborate Fourth of July celebration was organized by Yankees aboard the mail steamer <hi rend="i">USS Hermann</hi> in 1853. When the bells began ringing and the guns began firing at
                    midnight on July 3, many of the startled passengers believed that the boiler had burst or that the
                    ship had sprung a leak. Chuckling at the consternation of their sleepy fellows, a few of
                    "the initiated" assembled in the smoking room "and drank the health of
                    the seventy-seven years old child in a bumper of champagne." At sunrise the cannon were
                    fired again, and at noon there was a thirteen-gun salute. Then followed a markedly cosmopolitan
                    observance of "the birthday of Freedom." "There were representatives of
                    almost every nation; but all alike, Americans and foreigners, joined heart and hand in doing honor
                    to the occasion." To be sure, the ceremony began with the singing of <hi rend="i">Hail <placeName>

                    oration in English. It soon took an international turn, however: a German song was followed by an
                    oration in German given by a Russian. After another German song, there was "a most
                    appropriate and eloquent address in French." Given the occasion, the solemnities had to end
                    on an American note, and so Americans, Germans, Russians, and Frenchmen blended their not so
                    melodious voices and tried valiantly to sing <hi rend="i">The Star-Spangled Banner.</hi> That
                    evening a piano was hoisted on deck, a violinist was summoned, and the ball began. After

                    nation was an occasion calling for manifestation of this ardor. Whether on land or on sea, Yankees
                    met to revel in the sheer joy of being citizens of "the world's only
                    Republic," and could well shout with George Bancroft, "Thank God we are

            <head>The Papers of John Marshall</head>
            <p>A scholarly edition of the papers of Chief Justice John Marshall (1755-1835) is being prepared under
                    the sponsorship of the College of William and Mary and the Institute of Early American History and
                    Culture. While Marshall's letters, political writings, diplomatic corespondence, and
                    legal papers have long been of interest to American scholars, it was not until grants from the
                    National Historical Publications Commission and the Commonwealth of <placeName>

                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> John Marshall made a permanent contribution to the development of American
                    institutions. It is sometimes forgotten, however, that his earlier career placed him in the
                    mainstream of our history—as an officer in the major campaigns of the Revolutionary War,
                    member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName> ratifying convention and of the General Assembly, member of Congress, diplomat, and
                    Secretary of State. The major portion of the published papers will consist of legal notes, briefs,
                    and judicial opinions—possibly five of eight or nine volumes now projected; but careful
                    attention to materials bearing upon his personal and political life is demanded in an authoritative
                    edition.</p>
            <p>Because many of John Marshall's papers have been destroyed or scattered it is imperative
                    that meticulous care be exercised in attempting to recover all that remains of the manuscript and
                    printed record. Information concerning documents written by or addressed to John Marshall or other
                    records bearing directly upon his life will be gratefully received and permission to edit and

                    </placeName> Library Company covers the meetings from February 4, 1839, to February 5, 1883. Between
                    these dates the company passed through stages common to many mid-nineteenth century subscription
                    libraries—a gradual decline in membership, smaller attendance at and less regular company
                    meetings, fewer book purchases, and extended periods of suspended activity, followed by the formal
                    absorption of the library's collection by a larger institution, in this case by <placeName>

                    </placeName> University.</p>
            <p>The company's vitality continued strong into the 1840's, but within a decade it
                    began a rapid decline. The annual shareholders' meetings were held but poorly attended;
                    and the number of board meetings declined to the point that none were held between 1849 and 1852.
                    The last sizable purchase of books, forty volumes, was recorded in February, 1847.</p>
            <p>By the eve of the Civil War the circumstances which had inspired the founding of the library company
                    and sustained its growth were gone. Such factors as the scarcity of books and funds for their
                    purchase, remoteness from publishing centers, transportation costs, and the like were no longer
                    operative, or were operating with much less impact on the people of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. The demise of the company was also attributable, at least in part, to the interests
                    and energies attracted (and services rendered) by the Maclure Library, the Library and Lecture
                    Association, the Workingmen's Institute, and the Moral and Social Reading Room, all of
                    which were functioning within half a dozen years after the war. In short, as a cultural institution

                                faithfully the spelling and capitalization of the handwritten document. The spacing of
                                the original minutes has been somewhat modified and standardized. For example, space
                                limitations have prompted the listing of members present at a meeting, results of
                                elections, and books recommended for purchase in series instead of the columns which
                                usually appear in the minutes. Paragraphs have been indented consistently even though in
                                the document many were not indented. Frequently items of business—especially
                                motions and resolutions—were recorded on separate successively indented
                                lines; these have been reproduced in standard paragraph form. The openings and closings
                                of minutes and locations of headings also have been standardized. Punctuation has been
                                reproduced as it appeared with the following exceptions: periods have been added where
                                necessary at the ends of paragraphs, closings of minutes, and after abbreviations and
                                initials; commas and semicolons have been added when columns of names are reproduced in
                                series; a colon has been added after the word "present" when it
                                precedes a list of members attending a meeting, after the word "viz."
                                when it introduces a series, and occasionally where it clarifies the intent of the
                                secretary; decimal points have been inserted where they were missing in prices; and
                                hyphens have been used consistently between inclusive numbers in lists of numbered
                                books. Flourishes have been omitted or translated as periods; underlining of signatures,
                                dates, and the like has been considered a flourish except where it clearly indicates
                                italics. Raised letters have been brought down to the line. Unintentional repetitions of
                                words or phrases have been omitted, as have marks in the margins and words, phrases, or
                                subtotals used in making transitions from one page to the next in the original minutes.
                                No attempt has been made to give biographical data on individuals whose names appear in
                                these minutes.</item>

                    <p>Frederick W. Veihe, the librarian called the meeting to order, and stated that Willis W. Hitt,

                        in order. George G. Reily then nominated Smily N. Chambers as chairman, and there being no other
                        nominations he was by unanimous consent called to the chair and presided as chairman of the
                        meeting. Mr. Reily then moved that the librarian report the names of the several share holders

                    by the artist's grandson, Theodore L. Steele, is based largely on the
                    painter's journals, notebooks, and correspondence. Born on a farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen County</region>
                    </placeName> in 1847, Steele spent most of his youth in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Waveland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, becoming interested in drawing and painting at an early age. After his
                    graduation from the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Waveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> Collegiate Institute and his marriage to Libby Lakin, the Steeles lived for several
                    years in Battle Creek, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, where the artist painted portraits and conducted drawing classes. By 1873 Steele had
                    moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> where his work soon won recognition. In 1880, with the help of friends there, he left
                    the city for five years to study painting at the Royal Academy in Munich. On his return to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> he busied himself with teaching and portrait painting. His Munich years had increased
                    his interest in painting landscapes directly from nature and he was soon spending much of his time
                    in this field in the Muscatatuck, Mississinewa, and Whitewater valleys. In 1897 Steele and Ottis J.
                    Adams bought the "Hermitage" in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Brookville</settlement>
                    </placeName> for their studio-homes. There Steele painted for many years while maintaining his <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> home for wintertime. In 1899, after failing health for several years, Libby Steele
                    died.</p>
            <p>Sometime before 1907 Steele had explored <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> in search of a new "painting ground." In the spring of that year he
                    bought land there and began construction of the studio-home which is now preserved by the state of
                    Indiana as the T. C. Steele Memorial. In August he married Selma Neubacher, and they began their
                    married life together in their new hill country home.</p>
            <p>The second part of the book is a reminiscence of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> period of Steele's life from 1907 until his death in 1926, written by Selma
                    Steele several years before her death in 1945. Adjusting to their new life in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, at that time a very remote and backward area, was both trying and at times amusing.
                    However, the painter found the rural scenery there was to supply him with inspiration and motifs for
                    his paintings for years to come. Other artists shortly followed Steele to the county, and an art
                    colony soon formed around <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Nashville</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the county seat. Steele's paintings, widely exhibited in Indiana and
                    nationally, did much to start the influx of both artists and tourists to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> which continues today.</p>
            <p>Until their home was adapted for year-round living, the Steeles spent their winters in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was then that he arranged exhibits and fulfilled many of his portrait commissions.
                    He continued doing portraits throughout his life, but in these later years landscape <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-063-2-074"/> painting, which Steele considered "the most distinctive form
                    of American art" (p. 142), was of prime interest to him. With his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName> studio so close to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>
                    </placeName> the painter had long enjoyed a close relationship with Indiana University, where he had
                    earlier been presented with an honorary degree, the Doctor of Laws. He had also painted portraits of
                    many of its presidents and faculty members. In 1922 he accepted an invitation to become an honorary
                    professor of art, and much of the last four years of his life was spent on campus as a resident
                    artist.</p>
            <p>The final section of the book—"The Work"—is a critique by the
                    late Wilbur D. Peat, for many years director of the John Herron Art Museum of <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Peat also assisted in selecting the many paintings that are well-reproduced in this

                    and Sharon C. Smith in 1967. It covers some four million pieces acquired, arranged, and catalogued

            <p>The collections, ranging from the papers of jurist Charles L. Aarons to journalist Helen Zotos, are
                    alphabetically arranged and described in terms of subject matter content. The manuscripts, some as
                    early as the seventeenth century, may be organized chronologically, topically, or alphabetically.
                    The over eight hundred entries vary in size from a few lines to several pages. The size, types of
                    documents, whether photocopies (with the location of the original manuscripts designated), any

            <p>The present guide reflects the special collecting interests of the state historical society over the
                    last decade and the systematic way in which it is concerned with many facets of the contemporary
                    scene as well as the past. One of the emphases has been on the papers of organizations with direct
                    or indirect concern for some aspect of education (e.g., the Methodist Church, the United World
                    Federalists), as well as the personal papers of educators themselves. The role of mass
                    communications in modern America has been another emphasis. This has resulted in many significant
                    additions in such fields as public relations and advertising, radio and television, and stage and
                    screen (e.g., papers of H. V. Kaltenborn, records of the National Broadcasting Company). Another
                    major concern has been to augment the already sizable holdings on labor, as with the papers of the
                    Textile Workers Union of America and of the American Federation of Labor.</p>
            <p>The range of interest is clearly not confined to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>

                    </placeName>-related subjects. Historians have long recognized the holdings of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> society as significant to the study of many facets of American history. Those whose
                    primary interest is Indiana history will find much of importance in the acquisitions of the last
                    decade. For example, in the territorial period are records of the Continental Congress and the
                    papers of Arthur St. Clair and William Henry Harrison. Correspondence of mid-nineteenth century
                    Indiana congressman John Givan Davis and the papers of Benjamin Harrison are included. The
                    manuscripts of Bradley R. Taylor contain his correspondence of 1952-1967 on behalf of the memorial
                    section of the American Legion Library in <placeName>

            <p>Merton Dillon has surveyed the extant writings of Benjamin Lundy and produced this well-written,
                    lively drama, the first full-length biography of the pioneer abolitionist. Little is known of
                    Lundy's rural <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName> upbringing; but about 1809 the small, slender youth became a saddler in Wheeling,
                    western <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, where, after flirting briefly with worldly amusements, he rededicated himself to
                    Quakerism. The sight of slave traders herding chained Negroes down city streets caused him to vow to
                    God to "break at least one link of that ponderous chain of oppression" (p. 7).</p>
            <p>In 1821 Lundy established the <hi rend="i">Genius of Universal Emancipation</hi>, the only abolition
                    newspaper to function throughout the twenties. It was first located in small towns in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, then in Greeneville, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>, and later in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Baltimore</settlement>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Envisioning that Negro colonization would dispel the southern fear of troublesome
                    freedmen and would prove his argument that free Negro labor could outproduce <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-063-2-076"/> slave labor, Lundy supported the American Colonization Society and
                    traveled several times to Negro colonies in upper <placeName>
                        <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="ht">Haiti</country>
                    </placeName>. In addition to writing, editing, and printing the Genius, he organized abolition
                    societies and spoke for antislavery political action.</p>
            <p>Although Lundy excoriated slaveholders as "too depraved to blush, and too wicked to
                    repent" (p. 53), he rarely if ever doubted that political action was the only feasible way
                    to end slavery. Dillon argues that both the irrational impulse for reform prompted by the Great
                    Revival and the apparent failure of gradualist appeals influenced abolitionists of the
                    1830's. Led by Lundy's ex-printing apprentice, William Lloyd Garrison, a new
                    generation of radicals opposed Lundy's gradualism and demanded immediate emancipation.
                    Countering Garrison's moral appeals, Lundy persistently predicted that "economic
                    coercion … would work where moral argument had failed" (p. 179). To give life to
                    his faith, he acquired a land grant in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> where he planned to demonstrate the successful use of free Negro labor and to supply
                    free-labor stores with the produce necessary to compete with southern goods. When Garrison
                    caustically attacked his plan, Lundy asserted that economic arguments must accompany moral-religious
                    appeals in order to persuade "not only the preachers, but also the moralizers, the
                    political orators, and even bankers and planters" (p. 211). Many abolitionists scorned such
                    ideas; the circulation of the Genius dwindled; and, after a brief imprisonment for debt, Lundy
                    turned from moralizing abolitionists to profit-seeking businessmen for money to support his
                    colonization schemes.</p>
            <p>Dillon finds a fundamental continuity in the abolition movement from the 1820's through
                    1840. Lundy and Garrison, for example, differed in "style rather than in the substance of
                    their thought" (p. 147). Lundy's inability to motivate change indicates to
                    Dillon that the "highly individualistic" spirit of the age nullified arguments
                    predicated on "the welfare of the community" (p. 77). Morally and materially
                    dependent upon slavery, southerners were beyond the reach of verbal persuasion. Dillon attributes
                    Lundy's persistent gradualism largely to a faith in reason inherited from the
                    Enlightenment.</p>
            <p>Lundy had more faith in reason than does Dillon. In 1824 the gentle <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> helped to convince <placeName>

                    </placeName> voters, some with a southern orientation, to defeat an important pro-slavery measure.
                    Were nonslaveholding southerners immune to Lundy's varied appeals? An
                    examination of firsthand accounts of their reactions to his arguments might answer this question.</p>

                    such works: it was biased; the treatment was uneven; and the style often revealed more about the
                    author than about the subject. Yet Yates' "ordeal" also had its merits.
                    Since the political careers of both men were similar-ch served as governor of <placeName>

                    </placeName> and in the national Congress-the son could appreciatively interpret his father, the
                    politician. Extensive quotations from the elder Yates' papers clearly revealed
                    "the walking and talking, living and loving man" (p. 49), which was the
                    author's hope for his biography. The letters, newspaper items, and speeches also
                    presented the full flavor of thirty years of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and national political history.</p>
            <p>In 1969 Mrs. Pickering asked John H. Krenkel to prepare her father's manuscript for
                    publication. Considering the extent of the Yates Collection, he has done an excellent job. He has
                    conformed to all the rules of editorial procedure; and although this reviewer would have liked his
                    comments to be more interpretative, Krenkel's extensive footnotes and bibliography
                    adequately supplement the original text. Indeed, the editor's lack of interpretation
                    pinpoints the major fault, which may also be the major strength, of this volume. Richard Yutes:
                    Civil Wm Governor is an appetizer; it leaves the reader hungry for a more complete, more objective
                    biography. The younger Yates was not explicit about the political shenanigans which occurred during
                    his father's gubernatorial career; the contemporaries of Richard Y a k , Sr., do not
                    emerge as real people; and the coverage of Yates' senatorial years is sketchy. Krenkel,
                    as editor, cannot be blamed for these omissions; rather, he should be praised for providing his
                    readers with even this incomplete glimpse of Yates and his era.</p>
            <p>This volume will also prove interesting to Hoosiers who wish to compare the <placeName>

                    </placeName> executive to their own Civil War governor. Yates, as his son described him, was suave,
                    sophisticated, Sristocratic-a gentleman. In comparison, Oliver P. Morton was a blunt, pugnacious,
                    tactless plebian. Yet both were skilled political strategists who thought well of their own
                    abilities. Both were sincere patriots who dealt ruthlessly but competently with opponents who they
                    felt would harm the Union, and, incidentally, the Republican, cause.</p>

                    ordinary soldier's feelings and attitudes toward eastern generals, Negro troops,
                    Copperheads, the threat of capture, and life in prison camps. Most of the data used are based on
                    information found in regimental histories and soldiers' diaries, memoirs, and
                    reminiscences.</p>
            <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-063-2-078"/>
            <p>Hicken has extensively examined the personal papers of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> General John A. McClernand and considers the Battle of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Post as both a turning point and high mark of his career. Grant's
                    biographers have stressed McClernand's faults, but Hicken believes that "few
                    have attempted to understand the nature of the man they are so quick to label a political
                    general" (p. 153). Hicken's portrait of McClernand reveals "an
                    impulsive, overly ambitious, and genuinely patriotic man who was frustrated at every turn by men who
                    knew the ritual of the military profession better than himself" (p. 153). In the final
                    analysis the author agrees with Robert R. McCormick that "it is plain that faith was not
                    kept with him [McClernand] and that his indignation was just" (p. 153).</p>
            <p>Hicken ascribes the rapid increase in desertions from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> regiments following the winter of 1862-63 to the emancipation and arming of Negroes and
                    the military reverses of 1862. By April, 1863, desertion was so widespread that the <placeName>

                    </placeName> State Journal reported that "Democratic Boys … gre coming home
                    every day" (p. 139). Desertions from <placeName>

                    </placeName> totaled 13,046 for the entire war. (Ella Lonn, in her study of this problem, gives the
                    figure as 16,083). In his analysis of Copperhead influence on desertions, Hicken tends to minimize
                    the particularly violent nature of many of the Copperhead activities, such as a mob attack at Du
                    Quoin in July, 1863, when some four hundred men attacked a deputy provost marshal and seized the
                    deserters that were being guarded.</p>
            <p>The most serious fault in this study is the nebulous and often confusing method of footnoting. Two
                    sources are frequently cited without making clear from which one a particular quotation or
                    interpretation came. In many cases the citations are clearly not relevant to the discussion but
                    serve only as a supplemental guide to further study. For example, on page 355 Hicken discusses
                    General John H. Winder, the commander of Union prisoners in <placeName>
                        <country reg="gau">Georgia</country>
                    </placeName>, and lists twentyseven pages from Hesseltine's book Civil War Pvisons and
                    thirteen pages from This Was Andersonville as the sources. References such as these should have been
                    inserted in the bibliography. On page 87, Hicken refers to McClernand's ambitions to
                    obtain an independent command and cites Wood Gray's study of Copperheads (p. 216), which
                    is a description of opposition to the draft in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>

                    </placeName>. There are numerous other examples of careless and inaccurate craftsmanship throughout
                    the book which seriously restricts its value for the Civil War scholar. The book will, however, have
                    appeal for those who are interested in a popular account of the everyday life of the men in blue

                    and stress is recounted in a manner that bears witness to the larger struggles of the American
                    Negro, and that is a theme of such exceptional importance to contemporary national existence that
                    any part of the story that contributes to an understanding of the whole deserves commendation. If
                    Strickland fails at all in this endeavor, it is only at the highest level where all aspects of the
                    American experience are harmonized. But that is a characteristic failing of monographic studies,
                    particularly of those that begin as doctoral dissertations.</p>
            <p>An agonizing and enormo'lsly important question haunts the pages of this history,
                    imparting unity and purpose to the book: to what extent was the league compromised by its system of
                    patronage? The author makes it abundantly clear that from the outset a few wealthy
                    patrons had the league by the throat and that these patrons were not loathe to lay down terms for
                    their continued support. So it was that the league came to be "considered the
                    ‘citadel’ of ‘accepted’ leadership" (p. 110),
                    but at a price that kept its well-intentioned executives in a continual state of tension as they
                    strove to satisfy both their patrons and the urgent needs of their clients. Here is the source of
                    the discontent with the league latterly voiced by younger Negro militants; and indeed what finally
                    gave it some freedom of action was precisely the civil rights explosion generated by the militants.
                    Still, Strickland concludes, "without the ‘old’ Urban League, there
                    could have been no ‘new’ Urban League" (p. 264).</p>
            <p>Stokely Carmichael and Julian Bond might not agree. They might argue that the new posture of the
                    Urban League is qualitatively different from that of the old, and they might very well point to the
                    evidence arrayed by the author himself as proof of that contention. What makes this argument of more
                    than marginal interest to American historians is just that it is a refined version of the argument
                    over the continuity of American reform, so that the author's data concerning the
                    particular history of a particular aspect of American reform is finally applicable to a wider realm
                    of events. It would have been helpful to the author in his search for the meaning of the league
                    experience in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Chicago</settlement>
                    </placeName> if he had seen these broader implications of his study. Perhaps then he would have been
                    able to conclude that the withdrawal of Rosenwald funds during the late twenties was more than a
                    product of personal eccentricity, but more meaningfully an expression of a general retreat from
                    reform that characterized those years. Strickland might also have seen some connection with
                    Progressivism in the league's origins, as he might have noted the substantially different
                    orientation toward the league in the New Deal era.</p>
            <p>But let these final reservations merely stand as an indication of the usefulness of this excellent
                    study. That usefulness is considerably enhanced by a judicious application to the sources, by clear
                    writing and good organization. Strickland's work will certainly appear in the citations
                    of other writers.</p>

            <p>This book of readings on the American Revolution is considerably enhanced by a forty-page
                    historiographical Introduction by Esmond Wright. In this Introduction the author in turn discusses
                    accounts of the Revolution from the Revolutionary age itself, the Nationalist interpretation
                    typified by Bancroft, the Imperial school which reached its peak in Charles M. Andrews, the Beardian
                    "Progressives," the modern "Neo-Whigs," and the British
                    "Conservative" view of Sir Lewis Namier and his followers. This is a concise,
                    perceptive account which concentrates on causes rather than consequences of the Revolution. It is
                    followed by a useful bibliography divided into the same categories, with the addition of a section
                    on "State Studies."</p>
            <p>The remainder of the book does not exactly follow the pattern laid down in the Introduction. Wright
                    has taken his selections from articles published in scholarly journals and in books and has divided
                    them into the two broad categories of "Causes" and
                    "Consequences." His selections on the causes of the Revolution are only from the
                    Imperialist, Progressive, Neo-Whig, and Conservative interpretations. Yet, the most important
                    historians of these groups are well represented: <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Osgood</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Andrews, and Gipson from the Imperialists; Schlesinger and Hacker from the
                    Progressives; Davidson, Harper, and Morgan from the Neo-Whigs; and Namier and Wright from the
                    Conservatives. Wright prefaces each selection with a brief note on the author and his views. Such
                    notes are useful, but perhaps could have been improved for students by a little more information on
                    the historians themselves.</p>
            <p>The third section of Wright's book, which contains selections under the general head of
                    ‘LConsequences," is not really dealt with in the Introduction. It begins with
                    Richard B. Morris’ well known article on "The Confederation Period and the
                    American Historian," and then has sections on consequences for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and for the world. The theme here is of necessity not as consistent as in the section
                    on causes. Perhaps the most interesting selections are Frederick B. Tolles ‘re-evaluation
                    of Jameson and Louis Gottschalk's discussion of the American Revolution in relation to
                    the French Revolution.</p>
            <p>All in all, this volume is superior to many of the books of readings that appear on the market and
                    provides a very useful introduction to historical writing on the American Revolution.</p>

            <p>Although Billington in his voluminous writings has produced monographs on many phases of American
                    history, his first love is American frontier history. In addition to this work, he has authored <pb n="163" id="VAA4025-063-2-081"/> four other major works on the frontier, the most comprehensive
                    of which is Westward Expansion. At present he is engaged in editing an eighteen-volume series
                    entitled the Histories of the American Frontier of which this is the fifth volume.</p>
            <p>America's Frontier Heritage is in the tradition of Michel-Guillaume St. Jean de
                    Crevecoeur's Letters From An Ammecan Famner, Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy
                    in America, and Frederick J. Turner's, The Frontier in American History. Although
                    Billington essentially is in agreement with the basic Turner thesis, he does attempt in this work to
                    indicate the modifications and complexity of the frontier influence as it merges with other factors
                    in the creation of the "American." Generally, however, whenever a historian
                    attempts to balance historical factors, he leaves the thesis muddied and less striking, and this is
                    the case in America's Frontier Hehtage. Probably Billington's best
                    generalization on the influence of the frontier on Americans is as follows: "To say that
                    three centuries of westering made the people of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> more democratic or more nationalistic is to invite the criticism of scholars who can
                    prove that this group or that in America was less democratic or nationalistic than such and such a
                    group beyond the seas. Yet one generalization seems justified : the pioneering experience helped
                    exaggerate certain traits until the differences were observable to visitors from other
                    lands" (p. 219).</p>
            <p>In America's Frontier Heritage, Billington has attempted to identify attitudes and
                    behavioral traits that were judged to be distinctively American by overseas visitors. Traits
                    discussed include social mobility, political democracy, individualism with a sprinkling of
                    cooperation, nationalism, wastefulness, resourcefulness and inventiveness, physical mobility,
                    optimism, ethnocentrism, inquisitiveness, braggadocia, antitraditionalism, belief in hard work,
                    anti-intellectualism, materialism, and deference for the female.</p>
            <p>As Billington attempts to present the pros and cons on the origin and presence of these behavioral
                    traits in Americans, he encounters some built-in obstacles. First, to prove conclusively the origin
                    of a people's character traits is virtually impossible. Second, it is equally difficult
                    to attain the objectivity necessary to analyze scientifically the behavioral traits of a people.
                    Third, it is perhaps even harder to generalize on the average characteristics of millions of people.
                    Considering the magnitude of the problems inherent in research of this nature, Billington on the
                    whole has done a very commendable job in describing and delineating the heritage of the American
                    frontier.</p>
            <p>Billington's exploration of sources relating to the frontier has been thorough and
                    comprehensive. Sources which he particularly scrutinized include travel accounts of European
                    visitors to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and writings of sociologists, anthropologists, and demographers. One of the most
                    significant portions of this work is the sixty-five pages of "Notes" and
                    "Bibliographical Notes" which is the best bibliography on the American frontier
                    that the reviewer has seen. The book has no index, but in light of its content, an index would
                    probbaly have been of very little value.</p>
            <pb n="164" id="VAA4025-063-2-082"/>
            <p>It is possible that the Indian played little or no part in the development of the character traits of
                    Americans, but if he did, America's Frontier Heritage sheds little light on his role.</p>
            <p>Overall, America's Frontier Heritage is an excellent work that should be in most libraries
                    and of great interest to all students and general readers who desire to know more about the origins
                    and peculiarities of the American character.</p>

            <p>Shortly after Lincoln's tragic assassination a torrent of biographical writing began that
                    has not yet run its course. As of 1939 Jay Monaghan's standard Lincoln Bibliography
                    listed some four thousand separate titles concerning Lincoln, not including articles. By now five
                    thousand or more such works exist. Although the earliest of the Lincoln biographers were generally
                    the weakest, in 1890 his two former secretaries, John G. Nicolay and John Hay, published their
                    notable tenvolume Abraham Lincoln, A History. It was the result of more than twenty years of
                    personal knowledge and careful note-taking by alert and intimate observers of Lincoln's
                    role as president. Furthermore, Lincoln had cooperated with his secretaries in gathering relevant
                    manuscript materials. Although Nicolay and Hay had every possible opportunity to present a biography
                    of the "inner Lincoln," particularly in times of great national stress, they
                    fashioned instead a conventional history of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> from Lincoln's birth until the end of the Civil War, serialized first for
                    Century Magazine. In its pages he emerged as the central figure of a
                    "life-and-times" approach. The original volumes encompassed the major facets of
                    Lincoln's career but did so in a conventional way, reprinting documents and letters to
                    which Nicolay and Hay alone had access--until these manuscripts were much later made available to
                    scholars.</p>
            <p>Immersed as the authors were in the political atmosphere of post- Civil War Republicanism, a
                    conservative and highly proper Lincoln, quite different from William Herndon's damaging
                    caricature, emerged. The Nicolay and Hay work, authorized by Lincoln's son, Robert Todd
                    Lincoln, possessed both the merits and defects of an official biography. Though exhaustive, its
                    argument was marred by party bias and was lacking in fundamental interpretive skill. Nevertheless,
                    Nicolay and Hay's detailed volumes remain indispensable to the serious Lincoln scholar.
                    His two secretaries were dedicated and loyal men whose exhaustive writings mirrored their close
                    personal association with and adulation of their chief.</p>
            <p>Abridged and edited now by Paul M. Angle, the original ten volumes are made available to modern
                    readers in manageable form. An introduction <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-063-2-083"/> precedes the
                    digested text. How successful this condensation into a single volume is remains a matter of
                    individual opinion. In this reviewer's judgment, the results are commendable. Yet it is
                    doubtful that Nicolay and Hay should now be labeled "classic" or
                    "great" historians and thereby included in the company of Prescott and Parkman.
                    They were hardly skilled practitioners of historiography, although they performed a valuable service
                    for posterity.</p>

                    published in seven volumes between 1892 and 1906, is one of the great works of American historical
                    writing. Rhodes, a <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> businessman turned historian, was an honest researcher and a good judge of character
                    who brought much hard common sense-as well as the prejudices of his age-to his account of the
                    politics, diplomacy, and fighting of the Civil War era. He, more than anyone else, gave historical
                    substance to the view which thoughtful Northerners generally and Republicans in particular held of
                    the causes, course, and consequences of the war. His picture of these heroic years, altered in so
                    many particulars by subsequent study, is now being replaced in its entirety by an even more massive
                    and sweeping narrative, more gracefully written, more thoroughly researched, and better balanced, by
                    the greatest living American historian, Allan Nevins. Thus Rhodes ‘ work, superseded by a
                    great historical synthesis and lacking in the literary power of some of our other classical American
                    historians, seems doomed to the ever deepening oblivion of being respected but not read.</p>
            <p>This is unfortunate. The first five volumes of Rhodes ‘ history (taking the story to 1866)
                    offer one of the more pleasant surprises in store for readers of American history. One is
                    continually amazed at how good Rhodes was: how reasonable his explanations, how sharp his character
                    portraits, how much he knew about the era, how much closer his conclusions come to recent
                    scholarship than do those of many writers who came after him. And the prose, if not brilliant,
                    remains solid and serviceable. Rather than a musty period piece, one discovers, as Nevins writes in
                    introducing his abridgement of the first five volumes, "a magnificent piece of narrative
                    history that offers a larger combination of enjoyment and profit than any but a few historians
                    provide" (p. xxvi).</p>
            <p>The volume under review provides historians with an excellent introduction to Rhodes ‘
                    history-which is not to say a sufficient acquaintance. <pb n="166" id="VAA4025-063-2-084"/> For the
                    general reader, it distills the essential Rhodes. The well-chosen format-long uncut selections with
                    most footnotes omitted-shrinks over 2,300 pages in the original volumes to a neat 569 pages of
                    excellent reading. Nevins ‘ introduction is informative and offers a judicious assessment
                    of the work. The chapter introductions, a few paragraphs each, are gems. They summarize, raise
                    questions, and place Rhodes ‘ narrative into the context of subsequent historical writing
                    in a graceful manner and in amazingly few words. In all, this in an excellently executed book in a
                    very well-conceived series designed to make the classic American historians available to the general
                    reader. It should do that. But one hopes that among serious students of the American past this
                    volume whets more appetites than it satisfies.</p>

            <p>With publication of Volume I of The Papers of Woodrow Wilson, Arthur S. Link and his associates, John
                    Wells Davidson and David W. Hirst, embark on the first comprehensive documentary record of the life
                    and thought of the twenty-eighth President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>. Wilson "rarely threw away anything he thought to be of possible
                    importance" (p. ix), say the editors; thus, the record he left of his own life is more
                    complete than that of most twentiethcentury political figures. Much of this material has not been
                    previously available, even to scholars. The editors hope to publish a comprehensive edition (forty
                    volumes) to include all important letters, articles, speeches, interviews, and public papers by
                    Wilson to make available to readers "all the materials essential to understanding
                    Wilson's personality, his intellectual, religious, and political development, and his
                    career as educator, writer, orator, and statesman" (p. xiv) .</p>
            <p>This first volume covers the period from Wilson's birth in 1856 to his withdrawal from the
                    University of <placeName>

                    </placeName> Law School in 1880. The editors point out that the ‘documentary record
                    before 1873 is virtually non-existent" (p. xxii) , and they print nothing from that period
                    except one letter and some notes from the family Bible. The papers are sparse for the short time
                    Wilson attended Davidson College, but become increasingly numerous and rich through the years at <placeName>

                    </placeName>. Accessible for the first time are the shorthand notes Wilson used in his diary and in
                    the classroom. Wilson taught himself the Graham system of shorthand, now obsolete, but the editors
                    secured the help of an aged expert to transcribe the notes. Other documents accessible for the first
                    time include Wilson's contributions to the Princetoniun; his father's
                    Presbyterian journal; academic notebooks; outlines of speeches; and three constitutions-for the

            <p>Letters comprise only a small portion of the text. The editors have only 29 Wilson letters (there are
                    30 diary entries) for the years before 1880, but they have 166 letters received by him. The bulk
                    (111) of the incoming letters were from his parents. The papers are arranged chronologically with
                    helpful cross references. There is an excellent index and an analytical table of contents.</p>
            <p>Wilson's papers show him, among other things, to have been pious (he concluded nearly
                    every diary entry with "Thank God for health and strength to live and learn") ;
                    rather human under his cold exterior ("A good many pretty girls at church tonight
                    … . This very warm weather makes it difficult for me to keep awake during
                    service" p. 138; "I've had no chance of attaching myself to any fair
                    maid this Summer. At the Cove, alas1 although there was every advantage of situation that a lover
                    might desire, there was no one to lovel-except one young damsel who was as harmless as she was
                    unattractive" p. 641) ; ambitious ("… we should, I think," he
                    wrote a classmate following graduation from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>, "lose no opportunity offered US by leisure moments to improve ourselves in
                    style and knowledge … in order that when the time comes for us to write and work for a
                    cause we may be able to command a hearing …" p. 488).</p>
            <p>He also favored the British form of government over the American. "One hundred years ago
                    America conquered <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> in an unequal struggle and this year she glories over it," Wilson wrote in his
                    diary July 4, 1876. "How much happier [?I she would be now if she had <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName>'s form of government instead of the miserable delusion of a
                    republic… . I venture to say that the country will never celebrate another centennial as
                    a republic. The English form of government is the only true one" (pp. 148-49). And he was
                    critical of universal suffrage. "Universal suffrage is at the foundation of every evil in
                    this country," Wilson stated in his diary on June 19, 1876 (p. 143), and he refused to
                    defend universal suffrage in a debate at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Princeton</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His father thought he was "perfectly right" not to enter the debate,
                    and his mother was sorry they had chosen a question "that made it impossible" for
                    him to do so (pp. 479-80).</p>
            <p>The editors have set very high standards for the remaining volumes, and they are to be praised for
                    the great contribution they are making.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 1861, Edmund DeWitt Patterson, a handsome and well-educated young man of nineteen
                    from <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>

                    </placeName> classical learning and short terms of indifferent success in book selling and school
                    teaching. Ahead were four years of war, followed by a successful career as lawyer and judge in
                    Savannah, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="tnu">Tennessee</region>
                    </placeName>. As the testament of a youth well-endowed, somewhat lucky, and entirely devoted to his
                    southern friends and his adopted southern home, Patterson's war journal is an arresting
                    personal document.</p>
            <p>As source material for the history of the war, the journal has limited but definite value. Patterson
                    was at <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Gettysburg</settlement>
                    </placeName> where he was captured. Beginning as fourth corporal in the Ninth <placeName>

                    </placeName> Infantry, he was elected lieutenant. He was severely wounded in a suicidal charge at
                    Frayser's Farm (June, 1862); recovered from ghastly, primitive surgery; enjoyed the
                    nursing of an heroic <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Richmond</settlement>
                    </placeName> woman; and returned to experience the "terrible beauty" of the
                    bombardment of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fredericksburg</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He suffered the boredom of a winter's picket duty relieved by such
                    unmilitary activities as snowball fights, fraternization with Union pickets, and homesickness. At
                    the Federal prison for Confederate officers on Johnson's Island in <geogName>Lake
                    Erie</geogName>, he spent more than a year trying to follow the war through rumor and contradictory
                    dispatches, and waiting to get back to his men.</p>
            <p>In the story of the war, however, Patterson illuminates no dark spots, draws no curtains aside. A
                    clue to the most impressive aspect of the journal is the fact that after the war and for as long as
                    he lived, Patterson never thought of publishing it and never took any interest in
                    veterans' affairs. On Johnson's Island he seems to have learned that the most
                    important thing about the journal was the feeling of personal awareness and growth that came with
                    its composition. Not that any great original genius is in evidence, although the rhetoric is
                    strikingly "literary," complete with quotations from Homer and Shakespeare and
                    even a burst of original poetry to celebrate leaving the Federal prison. The descriptions of battle
                    and bloody death have a high-pitched, romantic excitement that is most disturbing taken out of
                    context, but is balanced by a similar intensity in descriptions of bitter sorrow and disillusionment
                    over the horror of war. Wit, contemplation, and frustrated puzzlement are also here. Some scenes
                    have a poignancy that seems artificial, like that of a cheap novel- Patterson's head held
                    in the lap of a very young Union boy-soldier through a night of fear and pain, for example; or
                    Patterson in prison, lonely and hungry, only a few miles from where his Union family lived in safety
                    and comfort. But in spite of the schoolboy rhetoric and the atmosphere of fact sliding into fiction,
                    the journal rings true and Patterson gains the reader's respect, not only for being true
                    to a very worthwhile self, but for apparently recognizing that this self was outgrown in the heat of
                    war and in the process of writing the journal. As an adult Patterson seems to have been largely
                    silent on the war and the "Lost Cause." One can only hope that one hundred years
                    has been long enough to wait, for such silence deserves respect.</p>
            <pb n="169" id="VAA4025-063-2-087"/>
            <p>Unless breaking the silence is deemed in itself disrespectful, this edition is reliable and in good
                    taste. Barrett's notes are all the help needed by anyone with the sketchiest knowledge of
                    the Civil War, and the essay by Patterson's grandson, Edmund Brooks Patterson, is very
                    helpful in putting the journal in focus.</p>

                    </placeName> Orman's book is one of a growing company that sees the history of the West
                    as something other than saddle leather and war paint. After all, most of everyone's time
                    in the Old West, as elsewhere, was concerned with the ordinary business of living, and a large part
                    of this was aimed at putting food on the table and a roof over one's head. For the part
                    of western life that involved people on the move—and it was a goodly
                    part—-inns and hotels were of considerable importance in the matter of locating the
                    night's bed and board. <hi rend="i">A Room for the Night</hi> tells the story of how this
                    need was satisfied.</p>
            <p>The book is based mainly upon printed sources, mostly books of traveler's recollections.
                    The notes contain only four citations from manuscript collections, six from contemporary newspapers,
                    and two from actual hotel registers. Of the numerous traveler's accounts used, a large
                    proportion are those of foreigners, chiefly British. Since tourists, whether foreigners or
                    easterners, would tend to remember and write about the most vivid episodes in their journeys, the
                    use of many such sources probably explains the emphasis in the book on the bizarre and the extreme.</p>
            <p>Most of the book is organized around the device of recapitulating topics region by region. This might
                    have made for repetitiousness were it not for a stream of sprightly anecdotes which lend variety to
                    the narrative. The style is clear and readable; and the last chapters, on hotel men and employees,
                    hotel meals, and hotel life contain some delightful vignettes.</p>
            <p>While providing an entertaining survey of an interesting aspect of western social history, there are
                    one or two caveats about the book as history that should be mentioned. Much of what it implies to be
                    western could as easily be identified with other sections of America in similar stages of
                    development. The generalizations on western hospitality, for example, could as well hold for the Old
                    South, the Middle West, and elsewhere, and appear to reflect more a part of general rural American
                    values than something uniquely western. Moreover, the generalizations on the place of the hotel in
                    western history are rather sweeping. While these hotels undoubtedly had unique features, the author
                    seems to overstate the case when he says, "The history of the West would be incomplete
                    without the dimension given to it by the Western hotel" (p. 139). Dimension implies
                    something <pb n="170" id="VAA4025-063-2-088"/> basic—as the length, width, and breadth
                    that enclose space; an historical dimension by analogy ought to be equally basic. To see hotels as
                    basic in this sense to western history is to force the point. Embellishment, yes; dimension, hardly.</p>
            <p>This book would have been strengthened by giving more attention to the economics of the business in
                    the West, for instance, to the pursuit of the interesting suggestion that hotel building as well as
                    railroad promoting helped bankrupt many western communities.</p>
            <p>In sum, this is a pleasant, diverting book about a little-known side of western history. Its
                    greatest. appeal will be to buffs and any others having a general interest in the western scene.</p>

               <hi rend="i">This Almost Chosen People: Essays in the History of American Ideas.</hi> By Russel B.
                    Nye. ([East Lansing]: <placeName>

            <p>
               <hi rend="i">This Almost Chosen People</hi> consists of seven unrelated essays on ideas that
                    "have given an ideological backbone to American thought and activity" (p. ix). The
                    author has attempted "to sketch out some of the changes these basic cultural
                    presuppositions have undergone from their beginnings to the present" (p. ix). In a truly
                    impressive display of erudition accompanied by extremely helpful bibliographies the ideas pass in
                    review before the reader. Out of many themes or concepts the author chose to examine the idea of
                    progress, the American view of nationalism, the tradition of free enterprise, the sense of mission,
                    the place of the individual, the view of nature, and the idea of equality. For the sake of brevity
                    this reviewer has been inconsistent in condensing the titles of the essays, but he has only followed
                    the example of the author who felt obliged to entitle Chapter V "America and the
                    Individual" instead of "The American View of Individualism."</p>
            <p>Unless one is a Curti or a Persons, he will find it difficult to comment meaningfully on the broad
                    panorama of ideas and on the sources upon which the discussions are based. In a general way the
                    author seems to be on surer ground in discussing the earlier expressions of the ideas. This seems to
                    be an entirely reasonable result of his scholarly studies of the cultural history of the late
                    eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Again he seems to be more at home with the literary
                    exponents of the ideas than with the business men and politicans who sometimes adopted them. Clearly
                    the essayist was confronted with a monumental task of compression, synthesis, and generalization.
                    Inevitably he exposes himself to the criticism of the specialist who has a particular interest in
                    one of the ideas. This reviewer is inclined to the belief that the influence of the frontier has
                    been overemphasized particularly with respect to the idea of individualism. He would suggest that
                    since attention is paid to Charles A. <hi rend="i">Beard's The Myth of Rugged
                        Individualism</hi> some mention should have been made of Mody C. Boatright's <hi rend="i">The Myth of Frontier Individualism.</hi> On a related topic the reviewer recalls that
                    there was a fairly strong conservation <pb n="171" id="VAA4025-063-2-089"/> movement in the
                    1850's when the use of charcoal threatened the timber resources of certain eastern
                    states.</p>
            <p>But a more basic question needs to be raised. This concerns the validity of literary, forensic, and
                    journalistic expressions of ideas as indicators of "American" sentiments. Even
                    granting the superb accomplishment of the author in fulfilling his purpose, for whom were the
                    relatively small group of persons speaking? Judging from the index entries <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Emerson, Jefferson, Lincoln, Whitman, Wilson, Theodore and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Roosevelt, and Kennedy were among the most articulate transmitters of American ideas.
                    Even if this list were expanded tenfold, would it be representative and extensive enough to form the
                    foundation for valid generalizations? For one thing there is an assumption of broad
                    circulation of the ideas and general literacy on the part of the public.</p>
            <p>The inclusion of an errata list is of dubious value. It suggests that eight errors are all that
                    appear in the book. This is not quite the case. The metamorphosis of John O'Sullivan into
                    John L. Sullivan is not listed, and it is not quite accurate to say that the Fourteenth and
                    Fifteenth amendments placed "these rights" (the referrent of these is not entirely
                    clear) immediately "under national jurisdiction." But even ten instances of
                    misspelling or slight errors of fact do not lessen the value of the book as an excellent source of
                    information for the general reader, a stimulating piece of collateral reading in a general course,
                    or perchance the principal basis for a more specialized venture into the history of American ideas.</p>

                    Auerbach. (<placeName>

                    $6.60.)</head>
            <p>Auerbach's monograph is a study of the so-called La Follette Civil Liberties Committee
                    (1936-1940). Despite its name, the focus of the committee's investigations was upon
                    employer interference with the right of workers to organize and bargain collectively. Several
                    interrelated factors were responsible for this emphasis. The inspiration for the establishment of
                    the committee came from National Labor Relations Board officials, who found their hands tied by
                    court challenges to the constitutionality of the Wagner Act and hoped that the exposure of employer
                    anti-union activities would rally public opinion behind the NLRB. The pro-union bias of the
                    committee's staff-many of whom were Communist party members or
                    sympathizers—was reflected in the committee's acceptance, and propagandizing,
                    of the class warfare theme. And the coincidence in time of the most active phase of the
                    committee's work with the CIO's bid to organize the mass production industries
                    resulted in the committee's becoming an adjunct of the CIO's organizing drive.</p>
            <p>Auerbach reviews in detail the evidence uncovered by the committee of employer union-busting
                    activities: the use of labor spies, strikebreakers, company police, and munitions. He concludes that
                    despite <pb n="172" id="VAA4025-063-2-090"/> its lack of substantive legislative achievements, the
                    committee exerted significant influence. It helped to create a climate of opinion favorable to the
                    Wagner Act and the NLRB. It materially assisted the CIO in its drive to organize the steel, coal,
                    and automobile industries. Most importantly, it played a crucial role in the transformation of the
                    civil libertarian credo. Before the New Deal, Auerbach writes, "Civil libertarians remained
                    inveterate worshipers at the shrine of Thomas Jefferson and adhered to a tradition that measured
                    individual liberty by government abstinence" (p. 24). At the same time most had a deep
                    commitment to labor unionism. Thus they were faced with a dilemma when the federal government
                    stepped in as the protector of labor's right to organize. Thanks in large part to the La
                    Follette Committee, the author contends, civil libertarians abandoned their traditional antipathy to
                    federal power. "The La Follette Committee's findings foreshadowed a new civil
                    libertarian formula: Federal power, so long the source of libertarian fears, might be needed to
                    counteract local, and private, power, which in fact … often acted as the final arbiter of
                    the Bill of Rights" (p. 138).</p>
            <p>Auerbach has done thorough research in manuscript collections, government documents, and contemporary

                    the page. His prose is fluent, though not scintillating. At times, the reader suspects padding; the
                    heart of his argument was set forth in his article in the December, 1964, issue of the <hi rend="i">Journal of American History.</hi>

            <p>Although not uncritical of some aspects of the committee's activities Auerbach is on the
                    whole sympathetic. Too much so, this reader would suggest. Thus he excuses the
                    committee's failure to deal with the intimidation of nonunion employees by union members
                    and strikers on the ground of labor's underdog position. The moral dilemma implicit in
                    this argument disturbed a minority in the American Civil Liberties Union at the time, and their
                    strictures against such a double standard is no less pertinent today. Second, the La Follette
                    Committee represented a major step in the transformation of congressional investigations into
                    fishing expeditions for publicity. Not suprisingly, the Dies Un-American Activities Committee was
                    the conservative reaction. Even more dangerous—to this reader's thinking at
                    least—was the abandonment by too many libertarians of their suspicion of the too powerful
                    state. Recent evidence abounds that the welfare state is not an unmixed blessing so far as
                    individual rights and liberties are concerned.</p>

            <p>In this history of the American Legion, Raymond Moley, Jr., has made a considerable effort at doing
                    the impossible. This is a kind of history difficult to do well. In the first place it is easy for a
                    history of an organization to become tedious and dull. More important is the <pb n="173" id="VAA4025-063-2-091"/> greater difficulty of preparing a satisfactory history of an
                    organization which is so large, which has touched the lives of such a considerable part of the
                    nation's population, and which often has been at the center of controversies which have
                    divided large segments of the population. But on the whole, Moley has done well. This is not to say
                    that the book is not a friendly or a partisan account, for it is—whether from a personal
                    preference for the positions which the legion has taken, or from the natural sympathy of a
                    biographer who, coming to know and understand his subject, comes to be altogether forgiving.</p>
            <p>Readers having any personal interest in the legion, or in twentieth-century <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> history, will be attracted by the accounts of its founding. Indiana readers will be
                    especially interested in the contest which made <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> the national headquarters.</p>
            <p>In its origins the legion developed a policy of non-partisanship. It would learn to fight and lobby
                    for causes and might show voting records of legislators, but it would avoid endorsing parties or
                    candidates and thus avoid the kind of political affiliation which came to be associated with the
                    Grand Army of the Republic in its "bloody shirt" campaigns.</p>
            <p>A good deal of study and hard work have gone into the promotion of the legion's views.
                    Through the years it has advocated military preparedness, including an adequate navy, an independent
                    air force, and an army based upon universal military training rather than a large standing army; but
                    it also has been an advocate of peace. In foreign policy it was friendly toward the League of
                    Nations, favored membership in the World Court (at least for a time), and favored the United Nations
                    (but not the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization or the International
                    Labor Organization). It probably was ahead of the rest of the country in abandoning its isolationist
                    position in 1940. Later the legion favored the Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty, and foreign
                    military assistance. But then, curiously, it called for the resignation of one of the men chiefly
                    responsible for those landmarks in postwar foreign policy, Dean Acheson. Moreover, the book adds
                    another page to the Yalta myth of unpardonable concessions to the Russians.</p>
            <p>One of the most controversial aspects of the legion's public career has been in connection
                    with its attitude toward subversion. In this connection it is noted that the legion was determined
                    not to become involved in vigilante activities, and it had no major part in the "Red
                    Scare" of 1919-1920. But later the legion discredits the State Department as being infested
                    with communists and traitors, sharing with many others the exaggeration of suspicion based upon the
                    established revelations of the Alger Hiss case. Very curiously, however, the name of Joe McCarthy
                    and his assault upon the army is not even mentioned.</p>
            <p>As the author says at the outset, "The Legion's story is a human story, an
                    integral part of any full account or appraisal of our country's progress in the twentieth
                    century" (p. 3).</p>

            <p>The American Association for State and Local History invites nominations for Awards of Merit or
                    Certificates of Commendation for 1967. The statement below indicates the basis for these Awards and
                    Certificates.</p>
            <p>All nominations must be made on the "Awards Nomination Form" and <hi rend="i">postmarked by not later than June 23, 1967.</hi> Each nominator must include a supporting
                    letter which is explicit in indicating why the Award or Certificate seems merited. Each nominator is
                    also responsible for making certain that at least two or three other persons send similar statements
                        <hi rend="i">directly to the undersigned.</hi> Finally, each nominator should send relevant
                    supporting material such as pamphlets, newspaper clippings, programs, scripts, books, etc.</p>
            <p>The Indiana competition for Awards and Certificates will doubtless be keen for 1967. Hence,
                    nominations cannot automatically be approved even though they indicate worthy achievements. Such
                    achievements should be varied, continuing, and quite significant. The views and evaluations of a
                    number of persons will be obtained regarding the nominations received.</p>
            <list type="simple">
               <item>1. <hi rend="i">Certificate of Commendation.</hi> The Certificate of Commendation is given for
                        outstanding achievement by an individual or an organization in the field of state, provincial,
                        and local history, but with that achievement judged in the light of local limiting circumstances
                        rather than on a basis of over-all excellence in the <placeName>
                            <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                        </placeName> and <placeName>
                            <country reg="-cn">Canada</country>
                        </placeName> as a whole. This is an award of encouragement and commendation to a person or group
                        which by great effort has accomplished something that is really outstanding within its own area.
                        It matters not that the accomplishment is less than the achievements of similar groups in
                        wealthier or more sophisticated areas of the country. The Certificate is a pat on the back, and
                        says to the individual or organization that receives it: "We think you are doing a
                        wonderful job in your area, and we want to recognize you for it."</item>
               <item>2. <hi rend="i">The Award of Merit.</hi> This was the original award of the Association and is
                        still the backbone of the Association's award competition. It is given for excellence
                        of accomplishment <pb n="175" id="VAA4025-063-2-093"/> or program in the field of state,
                        provincial, and local history, and is in no way judged relative to local limiting circumstances.
                        The giving of the Award of Merit is the same as saying to everyone: "This is public
                        acknowledgement by the American Association for State and Local History that this accomplishment
                        or this program, in comparison with all similar accomplishments and programs in North America,
                        deserves the adjective excellent." In using the term "excellent" we
                        do not employ it in the archaic sense of excelling all others, but in the modern sense of
                        extremely good, first class, of great inherent worth. This distinction is important because it
                        should be clearly understood that an award to one organization for a particular kind of program
                        does not bar another organization from receiving an award for a similar program, if both
                        programs are indeed excellent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>It should also be clearly understood that a nominee rejected for an Award of Merit will not
                    necessarily be given a Certificate of Commendation. It is not the intention of the Committee on
                    Awards that the Certificate of Commendation will become a runner-up prize for those who failed to
                    receive the Award of Merit. The two awards are designed to accomplish different purposes.</p>

                    Library at Ellettsville was dedicated as the Henry F. Schricker Library. In naming this school
                    library after Governor Schricker, Ellettsville citizens gave merited recognition to the only Hoosier

                    indicated their affection for and appreciation of the many visits and long-time participation of the
                    Schrickers in Ellettsville's annual fall festival.</p>
            <p>The librarian of the Henry F. Schricker Library, Miss Frances Harding, is eager to develop and

                    the early days to the present. Individuals having items which they are willing to donate to such a
                    collection should write Miss Harding and indicate the type of material available for possible
