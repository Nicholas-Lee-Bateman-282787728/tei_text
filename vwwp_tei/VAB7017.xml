                <salute>DEAR MR. DE FONBLANQUEâ</salute>
                <p>In asking you to accept the dedication of this book, I do not wish to make it
                    appear that you either share its opinions or sympathize with its aim. I merely
                    wish to claim you as one who, like Christopher himself, loves honesty and
                    practises sincerity, and who will therefore forgive even his defence of
                    vivisection, to which you are so notoriously opposed. Neither do I seek to
                    entangle your assent to that profound respect for man as the highest thing we
                    knowâthat belief in his glorious future and infinite progress,<pb n="v" xml:id="VAB7017-002"/> by the law of moral evolution working from
                    withinâwhich is my hero's support and consolation. This optimistic belief is a
                    matter of faith; and faith, the result of temperament, is out of the control of
                    the individual. The Pessimists, who see only the hopelessness of man's misery
                    and the limitation of his powers, count as many strong brains among them as the
                    Optimists, who judge of the future by the past, and recognize no barriers which
                    may not be overcome. Each school is as sincere as the other in its creed; and as
                    neither can prove its doctrines, neither has the right to scorn the other for
                    its special gospel. Wherefore I trust that, differing in certain essentials
                    though we do, you will none the less accept this dedication as an expression of
                    my friendship and esteem.</p>

                <head>PREFACE.</head>
                <p><hi>IT</hi> is impossible to write an absolutely candid autobiography. Our
                    relations with others, and the artistic proportions of events, forbid that
                    completeness which, to be perfect, should include every circumstance of the
                    life. For just as plants and organisms are built up and developed by microscopic
                    cells, so are our characters and minds formed by all the circumstances which
                    surround us, how minute soever each may be in itself. At the best then, no more
                    can be given than those salient points of thought and action which furnish an
                    intelligible outline but do not include fractional detailsâwhich<pb n="vi" xml:id="VAB7017-004"/> show the completed fabric but not the whole process
                    of construction.</p>
                <p>Within these limits every autobiography which is clear and symmetrical so far as
                    it goes, has its value. As no human being is absolutely unparalleled, but each
                    embodies in his degree the moral and intellectual characteristics of certain
                    orderly types already established, it necessarily follows that no personal
                    history can be without the interest which comes from sympathy and likeness. The
                    ways by which some have arrived at certain landing-stages must needs be those by
                    which others have gone or are going; and the experience of one serves another as
                    warning or guidance, according to the secret bent of his nature and his dread or
                    desire to be led to the right or turned to the left.</p>
                <p>For this reason, I, a pilgrim rapidly nearing the great Mecca of the grave, write
                    here as faithful an autobiography as I may<pb n="vii" xml:id="VAB7017-005"/> or
                    can. It will not be useless to show where a man who has ardently desired to know
                    the Truth, and who has been neither afraid of his own conclusions nor ashamed to
                    confess his convictions, finds himself at last. The Isis at whose feet he stands
                    will hold in her hand, or a torch to light forward or a flaming sword to stay,
                    the advancing steps of those who read, as they may sympathize with the process
                    or be repelled by the result.</p>

                    or the penny post; and when society in the remote country districts of England
                    was very little changed from what it had been a hundred years before. In those
                    days living was simple, locomotion both difficult and restricted, and absence
                    from home a rare event, save for<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7017-007"/> the grandees
                    who were bound to be in London for their place in Parliament or for their
                    attendance at Court. Women of the upper middle class kept their houses and
                    looked after their children with more vigilance of personal superintendence than
                    now; and if there was less taste there was less finery, nor was extravagance
                    made into an Ã¦sthetic virtue as it is in these present times. The religious
                    revival had not begun for the nation at large; for all that Wesley and Whitfield
                    had done good work among the rough men of the West, and had transformed a large
                    proportion of the Cornish miners and fishermen from brutalized savages and
                    wreckers, among whom the King's writ did not run, into God-fearing and
                    law-abiding citizens. Education was at its lowest possible ebbâthough local
                    grammar-schools in the North were plentiful, kept up by old-time grants and
                    bequests from former founders and benefactresses;<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7017-008"/> though Robert Raikes had established Sunday-schools here and there, where
                    minds had begun to awaken to the need of saving souls; though Joseph Lancaster
                    had got a fair trial for his system of teaching; and though even infant-schools,
                    which we generally believe to be emphatically of modern establishment,
                    languished feebly in certain populous places. Still, none of these waves of
                    progress, as yet slow and sluggish, though gathering, as they went, the volume
                    and power we know of, had stirred the stagnant shallows of remote country places
                    at the time of which I write; and society, as found on the moors, in the dales,
                    and in the villages among the mountains, was satisfied with the most elementary
                    knowledge for the so-called educated classes and absolute ignorance for all the
                    rest.</p>
                <p>The Reform Bill, Catholic emancipation and the emanacipation of slaves, the
                    political rights of the Jews, free trade and a free<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7017-009"/> press, were all as yet the golden apples of liberty
                    and justice held in the closed hand of Time. The press-gang was a recognised
                    institution; felony was punishable by deathâand stealing sheep, as well as any
                    article the value of thirteen-pence halfpenny from the dwelling-house, was
                    felony. Though Howard's remonstrances had had some effect, and Coldbath Fields
                    prison had been built in accordance with his views, our gaols were in general a
                    disgrace to civilization, and our laws were still justly stigmatized as âwritten
                    in blood.â Monday morning hangings were part of the week's ordinary work; and my
                    father just remembered to have seen thirteen men hanging in a row at Tyburn,
                    with never a murderer among them. Besides slaves in Jamaica, we had
                    climbing-boys, who were substantially slaves, for our chimneys at home; and
                    apprentices were still greatly needing the protection they did not get till
                    comparatively the other day.<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7017-010"/> Gipsies and
                    vagrants were laid by the heels at the will of the authorities; and to be
                    homeless was of itself a qualification for the stocks. Belief in the divine
                    right of Kings; in the saintly martyrdom of Charles I.; in the criminality of
                    Cromwell and the hypocrisy of Puritanism; in the good cause of Charles Edward;
                    in the diabolical origin of the French Revolution, of which the echoes still
                    reverberated through the awakening world; in the infinite iniquity of Bonaparte;
                    in the capacity of any one Englishman to lick three âmounseersâ single-handed;
                    as well as belief in the damnable instincts of the âmany-headed monster,â as the
                    people proper were generally calledâformed part of every true gentleman's creed.
                    He who thought differently was either a traitor to his order or no true
                    gentleman at all. Party spirit in the country ran as high as it ever ran in
                    Florence or Verona, when Guelfs and Ghibellines slew peace and humanity between
                        them;<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7017-011"/> and no man with a soul to be saved
                    would have consorted in friendship with a wearer of the hostile colour. As well
                    ask Juliet for Romeo, as ask of a Tory father his daughter in marriage for the
                    son of a Whig, when the one sported blue and the other purple and orange, while
                    brickbats were flying and bribery stalked about the contested town with never a
                    mask to hide its face nor a cloak to conceal its hands.</p>
                <p>Our family house was for many years in one of the most primitive of those
                    untouched country districts of which I first spoke; and the recollections of the
                    elders of my own generation carry us back to a wonderful state of things.</p>
                <p>My father was a clergyman and the holder of two livings. The second, of which I
                    shall speak farther on, was one of the most beautiful places in England, where
                    the ordering of life was simple and homely, but not more than this. The other
                    was a<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7017-012"/> large, rambling, sparsely-populated
                    parish, where the people were half-savages, and where the very elements of all
                    that makes our modern civifization were wanting. Not a school of any kind was in
                    the place, though there was one at the quaint old market-town some few miles
                    away; but in return, for a village of about three hundred inhabitants, there
                    were seventeen public-houses and jerry-shops; and the man who did not get drunk
                    would have been the black swan which the white ones would soon have pecked to
                    death. No one, however, tried the experiment of sobriety. There was no sense of
                    public decency, no idea of civic order and as little private morality. The
                    parish-constable would have thought twice before taking up a crony for any
                    offence short of murder; and then he would have left the door of the lock-up
                    ajar. Not a man would have held himself justified in marrying before the woman
                        had<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7017-013"/> proved her capacity for becoming a
                    mother; and when the lovers were united according to the law of the landâjust in
                    time to legitimize the childâthe customs and ceremonies of the day were almost
                    as brutal as, and certainly more drunken than, those of the North American
                    Indians or Tierra del Fuegians. Indeed, they were evident survivals of those
                    primitive times when the bride was taken from her tribe by force and compelled
                    to submit to violence, before dawning civilization made the whole matrimonial
                    transaction a matter of sale and barter. But for the most part the young people
                    slipped by night across the border to Gretna Green, preferring, as they said,
                    the blacksmith's forge to the joiner's shop, and liking the mock romance of a
                    pseudo-elopement which saved the parson's fees and the wedding-dinner, and thus
                    âgave folk less cause for clack.â</p>
                <p>If the people were thus uncivilized, their<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7017-014"/>
                    appointed pastors and masters in the off-districts were very little better.
                    About eight miles from Braeghyll, my father's parish, was a God-forsaken
                    moorland incumbency, the âpriestâ of which was in no wise beyond his flock
                    either in refinement or morality. As Braeghyll was the mother-parish, our
                    village was naturally the local metropolis where the inhabitants of the
                    surrounding hamlets found their pleasures and excitements. These were for the
                    most part âmurry-neetsââdances in barns and public-houses, where the men got
                    drunk, the women fuddled, and the marriage ceremony was discounted all roundâand
                    the Saturday-night fights, which came as regularly as the Sunday-morning shave.
                    To these fights the priest of Moss Moor, of whom I have spoken, came more
                    punctually than he went to his own little chapel the next day. He was a fine,
                    stalwart fellow, who kept up his muscle by week-day working in the fields,<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7017-015"/> like any hired herd or ploughman; and,
                    âstripped to buff,â as the phrase was, he took his turn like a man, did his
                    fighting gallantly, then got drunk with the best; and so was trundled home to
                    his stone cabin in the wilds, to sleep off his intoxication in time for his
                    ragged duty to-morrow morning. My father's curate himself brought his unwedded
                    wife to the parish and married her about three weeks before the child was born.
                    No one thought the worse of them for their impatience; and, âNae, what!â they
                    said with the broad charity of moral kinship, âyoung folk will be young; and men
                    and women are kittle cattle to shoe ahint!â</p>
                <p>Accustomed to such ministers as theseâmen who were intellectually in advance of
                    their flock only in so far as they could read and write, but whose example was a
                    direct encouragement to both lawlessness and viceâthe people of these wild
                    districts would<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7017-016"/> not brook interference nor
                    admonition from such gentlemen as might be appointed to the mother-parishes. My
                    father tried to bring about a better state of things when he first undertook the
                    care of these shaggy souls at Braeghyll; but the men swore at him, and
                    threatened to do him a mischief if he did not hold his noise, when he rebuked
                    them for their intemperance or tried to stop their brutal excesses; and the
                    women jeered him, for a Molly who put his nose where he had no concern, when he
                    would have taught them a little modesty as maidens and decency as wives. Thus
                    the heart was taken out of him; and, being naturally indolent, he soon dropped
                    the reins which at first he had attempted to hold, and the parish went on as it
                    would without let or hindrance from him. They were more respectful to my mother,
                    who was sweet and gentle and very beautiful; and who was, moreover, assimilated
                    to the every-<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7017-017"/> day experience of her sex by the
                    rapid âbairn-bearingâ which never left her without a child in the cradle and
                    another at her breast. But she had too much to do at home to carry her energies
                    abroad; and district-visiting, mothers'-meetings, Bible-classes, and all the
                    other modern circumstances of parochial organization, were then things unknown.
                    Besides, there were no educated women to have âworked the parish,â even if there
                    had been the thought or the endeavour. There was only one gentleman's family
                    besides our own; and as the squire's lady bore child for child with the
                    parson's, she was naturally as much tied at home.</p>
                <p>Things were no more satisfactory in the church than they were in the parish. Not
                    more than twenty people came to the service, for the fullest attendance. The
                    average was about fourteen. On afternoons, when folks were late, the old clerk
                        would<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7017-018"/> ring the bell for a short three
                    minutes, then shut the church door in a hurryâeven if he saw some one coming in
                    at the lych gateâglad to be quit of his irksome duty for that day.</p>
                <p>âNay, what, i' fegs, we bain't agoing to maunder through t' service for yon,â he
                    said one day contemptuously to my father, when remonstrated with for shutting
                    the church door right in the face of Nanny Porter.</p>
                <p>According to old Josh, souls counted by the gross; and the parson's own household
                    did not count at all; and it was a wicked waste of force to spend the means of
                    grace on a unit. So Nanny Porter had to go home again and leave her prayers
                    unsaid; and old Josh took the responsibility on his own soul, and swore a big
                    oath that hers would be none the worse for the lapse.</p>
                <p>This morally unsatisfactory living was pecuniarily valuable. The rector was
                        Lord<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7017-019"/> of the Manor as well as rector; and
                    heriots and fines on the death or displacement of tenants, together with tithes
                    in kind, rent-charges and compensations, raised the income to a good round sum
                    when all was told. There was always bad blood at tithing time, when the parson's
                    tenth âsteukâ was sure to be the largest of the row; the parson's tithe-pig the
                    fattest of the litter; while the geese, ducks, fowls, etc., driven into the
                    rectory back-yard for the service of the church and in payment of these despised
                    and neglected functions, were beyond compare the finest of their respective
                    broods.</p>
                <p>When I grew old enough to understand how things were, I confess I felt both
                    ashamed and revolted when my father, as he sometimes did, went about the fields
                    himself, and chose his own tenth âsteuksâ in the face of the world of reapers
                    and before the eyes of the farmer. They thought<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7017-020"/>
                    nothing of it; and as my father did his doubtful work naturally, cheerily and
                    genially, he lost no honour, but on the contrary gained in personal favour as a
                    âgood 'un of his kind,â though his kind was bad enough. It was only my own
                    callow sense of personal dignity and democratic justice that suffered.</p>
                <p>Our place used to overflow with produce at tithing-times. At Easter, eggs came in
                    by the hundred, and at âshearing-timeâ wool was by the cartload. Everything else
                    was in like quantity. The tithers' supper made a supreme holiday for us young
                    ones. They always had hodgepodge, plum-pudding, and a glass of punch to follow;
                    and sometimes a cracked fiddle was put into requisition, when our maids used to
                    dance with the men, threesome reels or foursome, and jigs where the women held
                    their aprons (âbratsâ we called them) by the two corners, and flourished them,

                    jigged. There was a grand quarrel between my father and his parishioners when
                    the Tithe Commutation Act came in force; and the seven years' average, which had
                    to be struck as the basis for the consolidated income, differed considerably in
                    the estimate of the one who was to be the recipient and the others who were to
                    be the paymasters. Things quieted down at last; and when Mr. Blamire's labours
                    came to an end, the new system was felt all round to be better than the old, as
                    giving less occasion for subterfuge here, suspicion there, and heartburnings on
                    both sides alike.</p>

                <p><hi>EDEN</hi>, the second living to which my father had been presented, just
                    before I was born, was by no means so rough and riotous a place as Braeghyll. It
                    was as drunken and immoral, but it was less ferocious and uncouth. There were
                    more resident gentry to keep civic order and restrain the lawless impulses
                    natural to strong-bodied and uneducated men. There was too, a tolerably fair
                    High School under the management of twelve âstatesmen,â which knocked the
                    rudiments of knowledge and some small sense of discipline into the <choice>

                    attended or played truant at their parents' pleasure and their own will. There
                    was a great deal of honest moral courage and sturdy personal independence among
                    the people, mainly owing to the large number of these same âstatesmen,â or
                    peasant proprietors, who owned no master and were no man's hire. Some of them
                    had title-deeds dating from the time of Edward VI. and were both nominally and
                    substantially the âkingsâ of their respective dales:âI say were, for now they
                    have almost disappeared as a class; not all to the gain of the country. But, as
                    I said, the drunkenness of the men and the lax virtue of the women kept about
                    even step in each parish alike; and though manners were less barbarous, morals
                    were no purer at Eden than at Braeghyll.</p>
                <p>In those days a South-going coach ran twice a week through Eden; and the<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7017-024"/> journey to London took three days and two
                    nights. A letter from London cost thirteen-pence halfpenny; andâas once happened
                    to ourselves, when we were told the contents of a brother's letter as it was
                    handed to us through the little window of the house in the square where the post
                    office stoodâif of likely interest to the public, it was quickly read by our
                    sharp-tongued Mailsetter before delivery to those whom it concerned. As
                    envelopes had not then been invented, and the folded sides of the sheet were
                    always closely written over to get the whole worth of the postage, a little
                    practice in peeping made the process of deciphering easy enough; and the main
                    threads of all the correspondence afloat were in the hands of our Mailsetter
                    aforesaid. The franking system mitigated the severity of these postal expenses
                    to the rich. It was only the poor who suffered without any mitigation. They had
                    either to pay a formidable proportion of their week's slender<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7017-025"/> earnings, or to go without hearing from the absent
                    ones at all. For it was a legal offence, carrying large penalties, to make the
                    carrier do duty as a postman and take, for twopence, what the Post-Office
                    charged sixpence or eightpence to deliver at the next town, some ten or twelve
                    miles away. People evaded the penalty by making the letter into a parcel and
                    tying it round with string well sealed; but, if discovered, the evasion did not
                    hold good, and the penalties were enforced as a warning to others.</p>
                <p>All the carrying trade was done by these carriers, who were often men of shrewd
                    wit and keen observation, and who brought a breath of larger life into the small
                    places, as they passed through and told what they had seen and heard elsewhere.
                    A great part of the commerce too, of the time, was in the hands of pedlers, who
                    came at stated seasons to tempt the weak, profit by the savings of the thrifty,
                    and supplement<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7017-026"/> the poverty of the mouldy little
                    shops where the shopkeeper was the tyrant and the customer was his slave. I
                    remember to this day the kind of Arabian Nights' splendour of gems and
                    jewellery, silks and shawls and âfarliesâ of every description, which little
                    Pedroni, the Swiss-Italian who wore huge rings in his swarthy ears, used to
                    bring out of his cases with a certain mysterious reverence, as if each article
                    was worth a king's ransom. What a good fight my eldest sister made for that
                    green shawl with the kincob pattern!âand how I inwardly resolved to save up my
                    money when I should be a man, and become the proud possessor of that monstrous
                    silver watch, as big as a small warming-pan!</p>
                <p>Beside our punctual pedlers with their packs, we had also our recognised
                    gaberlunziesâour established tramps of either sex. These also came in their
                    appointed seasons, and were hospitably entertained<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7017-027"/> with a bed in the outhouse, a supper at the kitchen
                    door, and sixpence or a shilling at parting in the morning. My father always
                    added to his generosity a little homily, for the honour of the cloth and the
                    tradition of good things. Also we had our village idiots, who could do nothing
                    but sit in the sun and make mouths at those who passed; and our half-witted men
                    and women, who could scramble through a rough day's work of a purely mechanical
                    kind, were as happy as kings and queens with sixpence for their âdarrack,â and
                    who married, had children, and stuck peacocks' feathers in their ragged hats and
                    bonnets. We had our poachers and suspected smugglersâgenerally the handsomest,
                    strongest and swarthiest men of the districtâwho were looked on with profound
                    respect by us boys, and a deadly animosity by the gentryâwhich to us seemed
                    infinitely unjust. Why idealize and honour Will Watch if Black<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7017-028"/> Jack Musgrave was a scamp? And we had our scares,
                    when the maids were hysterical and moonyâscares which now meant burglars and now
                    âbogles,â and now again Burke and Hare, a report of whose sudden appearance in
                    the Lime-pots ran like wild-fire among us, and made the women afraid to venture
                    over the threshold, even so far as the stick-house, after dark.</p>
                <p>Our church was a fine old Norman structure, choked with barbarisms. The frescoes
                    had been whitewashed over by successive generations of churchwardens; so had the
                    magnificent freestone pillars. The stained-glass windows had been taken away and
                    plain squares, among which were interspersed a few bulls' eyes, had been put in
                    their stead; the pews were the familiar old cattle-pens of every size and shape,
                    wherein the congregation sat in all directions and went to sleep in the corners
                    comfortably. The choir was composed of a few<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7017-029"/>
                    young men and women who practised among themselves as they liked and when they
                    liked, and sometimes essayed elaborate anthems which resulted in vocal
                    caricatures. The orchestra was a flageolet, on which the clerk, as the official
                    leader and bandmaster, gave the key-note; and at the feet of the choir, in the
                    dark at the west end, the High School boys and girls sat on benches which every
                    now and then they tipped up or overturned, played marbles, had free fights,
                    laughed aloud, and were dragged out by the hair, kicking and yelling, when their
                    conduct was too obstreperous for even the lax reverence of the rest to bear.
                    With all this we had a peal of bells which was the pride of the parish and
                    acknowledged to be the best in the county; and our bell-ringers were renowned as
                    past masters of their craft.</p>
                <p>In my early youth, two families only among us kept a carriage or a footman;<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7017-030"/> and no one thought of hiring a car, as our
                    tubs on wheels were called, for anything short of a day's excursion to the
                    neighbouring lakes and waterfalls. When evening parties were on handâwe never or
                    rarely gave dinners at Edenâthe ladies tucked up their skirts and the men turned
                    up their trousers, and walked gaily through the snow in winter and the dust in
                    summer, lighted by lanthorns when there was no moon, and wearing wooden-soled
                    clogs shod with iron when the roads were âclarty.â Picnics on the lake, where
                    each family contributed its quota, were the grand summer amusements of Eden; and
                    walking expeditions up the more practicable mountains, all returning to the
                    proposer's house for tea and supper and a dance or a round game in the evening,
                    took the place of modern tennis-parties. Without question, things were merrier
                    for us than our children have known how to make them for themselves.<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7017-031"/> There was less luxury and more simplicity; people
                    were easily amused because not worn out by premature experience; and there was a
                    greater sense of homeliness and friendliness than can be found anywhere now.</p>
                <p>Perhaps some among us went a little too far in the way of simplicity and
                    homeliness, as when the Roberts' girlsâthe daughters of the great literary light
                    who shone at Edenâtook down the soiled house-linen to mend in the drawing-room
                    at Rydal Mount, where they were on a visit, to give Mrs. Hemans, who was also
                    there on a visit, a practical lesson on the value of good house-wifery and no
                    nonsense. Mrs. Hemans was somewhat superfine and lackadaisical; and these girls,
                    the youngest of whom was famous for a certain quiet hardness which amounted to
                    calm brutality, thought that to darn dirty linen before her eyes would be a
                    useful counterpoise to her Rosa Matilda proclivities. The result was that the
                        poetess<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7017-032"/> fled from the room in dismay, and
                    ever after cherished the most profound horror for the uncompromising Marthas who
                    had so wounded her delicacy.</p>
                <p>My father and that great literary light did not get on quite well together. I
                    have never understood why. There had been no quarrel that I know of; the
                    respective children were playfellows; and Dr. Roberts was as orthodox as my
                    father himself, and notoriously a dutiful son of the Church. But they were not
                    the friends one might have expected two cultured men would have been; and though
                    Dr. Roberts came regularly to church, as any other decent body might, when the
                    prayers were over he ostentatiously folded his arms, shut his eyes, and sat
                    during the sermon in a state of frigid indifferentism, like one no more
                    interested in the proceedings. He had done his duty to God and the Establishment
                    by saying his prayers and following the <choice>
                        <orig>ser-</orig>
                        <reg>service</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7017-033"/> vice; to the sermon, which was purely
                    personal, he openly refused to give his attention.</p>
                <p>At the other side of the vale, and not in our parish, was a very notable
                    familyâincomparably the most liberal and enlightened of all we had. Thoughtful
                    and large-minded, they were remarkable, among other things, for the quiet
                    dignity of their lives; their inflexible sense of public duty; their orderly
                    management as proprietors and masters; their close friendships with the best
                    thinkers and foremost men of the time; and the determination with which they
                    discountenanced all local gossip and petty scandal. The father, and his son
                    after him, were men who make the unwritten but vital history of England, and
                    furnish the solid material of English greatness. The other son, however, belongs
                    to the written history of our time, and has left a name and done such work in
                    literature as will never die out.</p>
                <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7017-034"/>
                <p>This family belonged, unfortunately for me, to the elder section of my
                    generation; so that I was not able to profit by them in the forming period of my
                    life, as I might have done had I been fifteen years or so older. It was only
                    when I was a grown man that I came to know and recognise the moral greatness
                    which was their inheritance. And then I was made. But to this day I have a
                    curious feeling of loyalty and clanship towards the survivors of the
                    houseâespecially towards one, the last of the elder generation, whose wonderful
                    charm can be as little described as the perfume of a flower or the melody of a
                    song. Indeed, she is very like a human flower or incorporate melodyâand of all
                    emblems the Daisy and the Pearl suit her best.</p>
                <p>Then there was a county magnate, whose house by the Bay where the water-lilies
                    grew, was a kind of sentimental Paradise to my elder brothers. Three beautiful
                        girls<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7017-035"/> made the charm of those woods and
                    gardens; and three of my elder brothers fell in love, as was but natural; and
                    the tears shed in vain by these poor young erotic Tantaluses were matters of
                    family history for many years after. Besides these, were retired officers of
                    both services, who had come to Eden because the country was lovely and living
                    was cheapâwith here a gentleman living on his estate, and there an outsider who
                    only rented and did not possess, and who never took quite the same place as the
                    autochthones by inheritance, or even the naturalized by purchase. We were also
                    in those days tremendously exclusive; and when the rich Leeds manufacturer
                    bought the estates of our historical attainted Lord, he was considered decidedly
                    below the salt, and there were anxious consultations among the impecunious
                    well-born as to the propriety of visiting him and his. I have lived to see all
                    this nonsense knocked out of<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7017-036"/> the place; which
                    maybe has been converted to the compensating worship of wealth somewhat over
                    zealously.</p>
                <p>Beyond these again, were the local odditiesâthe old maids with sharp tongues
                    renowned for queer sayings; the well-endowed widows with large heartsââmothers
                    in Israel,â as they were called when the days of cant came upon us; the Will
                    Wimbles who played the flute were âcharactersâ and flighty, not to say more; the
                    hunting parsons who rode to hounds whenever they could, and when they could not,
                    did the best they could for themselves by riding into Eden, jack-booted and
                    spurred, to meet the coach and talk horseflesh with Tom and Arnold; the
                    scientific recluses who got a name of terror because of their anatomical
                    studies, whereby they were supposed to be too friendly with the Evil One; the
                    retired sea-captains, choleric and litigious; the Scotch doctors,<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7017-037"/> drunken and clever, who performed wonderful
                    operations when half-seas over; the men-servants and maid-servants who were part
                    of the family and called by the master's name, as Birkett Tim and Crosthwaite
                    Molly; the maiden shopkeepers, who were the humbler members of the society,
                    greatly respected and esteemed, with whom the aristoi would sometimes take a cup
                    of tea and not hold themselves as condescending unduly:âthese were as
                    individualized, and some were as queer, as anything to be found in Sterne or
                    Smollett. But the queerest of all were the incumbents of the small
                    chapelries-of-ease made off the mother-parishâall of whom were St. Bees men,
                    while many were as drunken as our old priest at Moss Moor, and none were men of
                    education and refinement. I remember how, at a visitation dinner at the
                    vicarage, one of these outlying pastors stood up in his place, and, asking the
                    Bishop familiarly if<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7017-038"/> he would be served, carved
                    the cabbages before him with his own knife and fork. He had already eaten
                    generously with his knife. They all did in those days.</p>
                <p>Our own way of living was simple in the extreme. Our servants wore short woollen
                    petticoats; cotton bedgowns and blue-checked aprons; huge caps with flapping
                    borders and flying strings; and thick-soled shoes, with which they wore out the
                    carpets and made a hideous clatter on the bare boards. We had a gardener who had
                    been a soldier, and who, in memory of his past glory, always wore a scarlet
                    waistcoat on Sundays; and we had a hay-field, a farmyard, and two cowsââCushieâ
                    and âHornieââwhich in the summer evenings we used to go with the cook to bring
                    home from the field to the milking-byre. I think I could replace every dock and
                    ragwort and plot of nettles and mayweed in that ragged bit of pasture-land,
                    sloping down to the little<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7017-039"/> brook where the
                    minnows were. Our food was oatmeal-porridge, night and morning. For dinner we
                    were allowed meat only twice a week. On the âbanyan daysâ we had large tureens
                    full of milky messes of exquisite savour, or enormous paste
                    puddingsââroly-polysââof fruit, jam, or undecorated suet. It was simple fare,
                    but it made a stalwart, vigorous set of boys and girls; and out of the whole
                    dozen, only two were relatively undersized and only one was delicate. The rest
                    averaged six feet for the men and the full medium height for the women.</p>
                <p>My mother, who was of higher social standing than my fatherâfor he was a simple
                    vicar and she was then the Dean's daughterâhad married him against the consent
                    of her own people. She died when my eldest brother was fifteen years old and
                    when I, the youngest of the brood, was five months. Ten rapidly recurring
                        steps<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7017-040"/> between these two limits filled the
                    quiver to overflowing.</p>
                <p>My grandfather, at first violently angry, at lastâwhen he had been made a
                    Bishopâproved his forgiveness of his daughter's disobedience and my father's
                    presumption by giving him, in succession, the best two livings in his gift; as
                    well as certain sinecures which the lax ecclesiastical conscience of those days
                    made it possible for an otherwise honest man to hold. But this liberality, added
                    to the original sin of the marriage, only served to alienate the rest of the
                    family more completely from us. For, as all my uncles were in orders, and all my
                    aunts had married clergymen, and plurality was then in force, and nepotism the
                    first duty of a patron-parent, it was but natural that they should resent this
                    apportionment of the big plums to the least desirable of the sons-in-law, rather
                    than to the more commendable who had the<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7017-041"/> better
                    claim, or to the sons who had the most right.</p>
                <p>This professional jealousy, backed by social disdainâfor the family, as a family,
                    was one of the proudest, most exclusive, and most worldly in Englandâand my
                    father's total want of kindred on his own side, explain the isolation in which
                    we lived, and why, after my grandfather's death, we knew none of that kindly
                    superintendence which the children of a dead sister so often receive from those
                    still living. While my grandfather lived we were taken care of at the Castle;
                    but after his death we were abandoned; and my father was left to bring us up as
                    he would, unhelped and unchecked by the influence of his wife's kinsfolk. He
                    chose the rough and ready way of corporal punishment for all offences. He
                    believed in Solomon and the rod, and put religious conviction as well as
                    muscular energy into his stripes. It was a brutal<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7017-042"/> system. But the times were brutal all through; and my father was neither
                    worse nor more enlightened than his generation. He sincerely believed that he
                    was doing his imperative duty when he thrashed us in accordance with the
                    inspired command; and that were the rod spared the child would be indeed spoilt.
                    And when a passionate temper takes with it divine sanction, the punishment it
                    inflicts is softened by no misgiving as to its wisdom or its humanity.</p>
                <p>My stately grandfather himself set an example of almost incredible severity in
                    his family. His sons never called him anything but âSirâ or âMy Lord;â and he
                    was never known to kiss one of his daughters, save by rare grace, or on supreme
                    occasions of marriage or departure, coldly on the forehead. Sometimes however,
                    he allowed them to kiss his hand. He gave his wife half-a-crown at a time for
                        pocket-money;<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7017-043"/> andâlike Mrs. Primrose, with
                    the guinea she âgenerouslyâ let each of her daughters have âto keep in their
                    pocketsââshe was exhorted not to break into it nor spend it. It always went in
                    âgoodiesâ for the grandchildren. When the sons were beneficed clergymen and
                    married men with children, they dared not have asked for a glass of wine at
                    their father's table; and he would have been a bold man who should have
                    addressed my Lord without first being spoken to.</p>
                <p>A dark and terrible family tradition was whispered from each to each, under the
                    bond of absolute secrecy, how that once, when one of my aunts had reached the
                    ripe age of eighteen, my Lord Bishop had whipped her bodily with his own august
                    prelatic hands. He was a tall and dignified-looking man; famed for botany and
                    scholarship, and held to be the handsomest Bishop on the bench; but he was a
                    queer successor<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7017-044"/> of the Fishermen; and I doubt
                    if the Master would have recognised him as a wholly satisfactory representative.
                    Yet it was told of him that once, in a rare fit of humility confessing some
                    trivial weakness of character, he said to my father with admirable condescension
                    to the frailty of a common humanity: âAfter all, Mr. Kirkland, a Bishop is only
                    a man!â</p>
                <p>Naturally indolent and self-indulgent in his habits, but a man of the strictest
                    temperanceânever once in his whole life, in that drinking age, having exceeded
                    the bounds of absolute sobriety; fond of shining in society, where he knew how
                    to make his mark, but almost impossible to drag out of his study for any form of
                    social intercourse; flattered by the notice of the great when it came to him,
                    but neglecting all his opportunities and too proud to accept patronage even when
                    offered; a Tory in politics and a Democrat in action; defying his diocesan<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7017-045"/> and believing in his divine ordination;
                    contemptuous of the people as a political factor, but kind and familiar in
                    personal intercourse with the poor; clever, well read and somewhat vain of his
                    knowledge, but void of ambition and indifferent to the name in literature which
                    he might undoubtedly have won with a little industry; not liberal as a
                    home-provider, but largely and unostentatiously generous in the parish; fond
                    like a woman of his children when infants, but unable to reconcile himself to
                    the needs of their adolescence and refusing to recognise the rights of their
                    maturity; thinking it derogatory to his parental dignity to discuss any matter
                    whatsoever rationally with his sons, and believing in the awful power of a
                    father's curse, yet caressing in manner and playful in speech even when he was
                    an old man and we were no longer young; with a heart of gold and a temper of
                    fireâmy father was a man of strangely<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7017-046"/> complex
                    character, not to be dismissed in a couple of phrases.</p>
                <p>With a nature tossed and traversed by passion, and a conscience that tortured him
                    when his besetting sin had conquered his better resolve once more, as so often
                    before, he was in some things like David;âfor whose character he had the most
                    intimate kind of personal sympathy. âFor I acknowledge my faults, and my sin is
                    ever before me,â was the broken chord of his lament. But to us children, the
                    echo of his loud midnight prayers, waking us from our sleep and breaking the
                    solemn stillness of the nightâthe sound of his passionate weeping mingled in
                    sobbing unison with the moaning of the wind in the trees, or striking up in
                    sharp accord with the stinging of the hail against the windowsâgave only an
                    awful kind of mystery to his character, making the deeper shadows we knew too
                    well all the<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7017-047"/> more terrible by these lurid
                    lights of tragic piety.</p>
                <p>My poor dear father! The loss of my beautiful mother, and, a year after her
                    death, that of the eldest girl, who seems to have been one of those sweet
                    mother-sisters sometimes found as the eldest of the family, had tried him almost
                    beyond his strength. His life henceforth was a mingled web of passion and
                    tearsânow irritated and now despairingâwith ever that pathetic prostration at
                    the foot of the Cross, where he sought to lay down his burden of sorrow and to
                    take up instead resignation to the will of Godâwhere he sought the peace he
                    never found! He had lost the best out of his life, and he could not fill up the
                    gap with what remained.</p>
                <p>There was one thing I have never understood:âwhy my father, so well read and even
                    learned in his own person, did not care to give his children the education
                    proper to<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7017-048"/> their birth and his own standing. The
                    elders among us came off best, for the mother had had her hand on them, and the
                    Bishop too, had had his say; but the younger ones were lamentably neglected. I
                    do not know why. We were not poor. Certainly, we were a large tribe to provide
                    for and my father often made a âpoor mouth;â but his income was good, the cost
                    of living was relatively small, and things might have been better than they
                    were. At the worst, my father might have taught us himself. He was a good
                    classic and a sound historian; and though his mathematics did not go very deep,
                    they were better than our ignorance. But he was both too impatient and too
                    indolent to be able to teach, and I doubt if the experiment would have answered
                    had he tried it.</p>
                <p>So time went on, and he allowed neither a responsible tutor for us boys nor a
                    capable governess for the girls, nor would he send<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7017-049"/> us to school. He engaged, as a very perfunctory kind
                    of crammer for two of my brothers, the son of a small hamlet hand-weaver, a
                    young St. Bees man whose parents denied themselves almost necessaries that they
                    might give their son a good education and see him in the ministry. This young
                    man, who was both plain in person and ungainly in manners, fell in love with my
                    eldest sister, and inspired her thereby with a physical horror that became
                    almost a constitutional antipathy, such as certain people have for cats. When
                    she was quite an old woman she used to say she should feel if Mr. Donald came
                    into a room at her back, where she could not see him. She would feel him in a
                    shudder down her spine and goose-flesh over her skin.</p>
                <p>When my father had engaged this young man, he thought he had done all for his
                    boys that was demanded of him by duty or need. If ever the subject was
                        broached<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7017-050"/> to him, he used to lose his
                    temper, and always ended by saying that self-educated people got on the best. He
                    forgot the pithy saying that a self-taught man has had a dunce for his
                    master.</p>
                <p>One of our family traditions, rounded off of course by repetition and the natural
                    desire to make a good story, tells how that, after our mother's death, my
                    grandfather sent for my father and urged him to do such and such things, whereby
                    he might increase his income and provide for the fitting conduct of his family.
                    To each proposal my father found insuperable objections. At last the Bishop,
                    losing patience, said angrily:</p>
                <p>âIn the name of heaven, Mr. Kirkland, what do you mean to do for your
                    children?â</p>
                <p>âSit in the study, my Lord, smoke my pipe, and commit them to the care of
                    Providence,â was my father's calm reply.</p>
                <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7017-051"/>
                <p>And he acted on his decision. He did emphatically commit us to the care of
                    Providence; and he was satisfied with his trustee.</p>
                <p>Practically, this meant the control of the younger by the elder. The eldest
                    brother was the master of the boys, the eldest sister the mistress of the girls;
                    with intermediate gradations of relative supremacy according to seniority. Hence
                    there reigned among us the most disastrous system of tyranny, exercised by these
                    unfledged viceroys of Providence over their subordinatesâa tyranny for which
                    there was no redress, however great the wrong. It was of no use to appeal to my
                    father. Had he sided with the complainant, things would have been worse in the
                    end, and there would then have been revenge and retaliation to add to the
                    original count. It was better to take things as they came, or to fight it out
                    for one's self. And there was always some one still younger<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7017-052"/> to whom it could be passed on; which was so far a
                    comfort! Our house, in those days, was like nothing so much as a farm-yard full
                    of cockerels and pullets for ever spurring and pecking at one another. It was
                    the trial of strength that always goes on among growing creaturesâespecially
                    among young males; but it was bad to bear while it lasted. Add to this a still
                    more disastrous system of favouritism, and the knowledge that no justice was to
                    be expected, from my father downwards, if such a one were the plaintiff and such
                    another the defendantâand the breaking up among ourselves into pairs of sworn
                    friends and devoted alliesâand this slight sketch of the moral rule that
                    obtained during the early days of my childhood is complete.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                <p><hi>WE</hi> all suffered much from the want of intelligent supervision, but I, by
                    the inherent defects of my character, as well as by my place as youngest,
                    suffered most. Quick to resent and sensitive to kindness, rebellious and
                    affectionate, wilful and soft-hearted, I was ever in tumult and turmoil,
                    followed by disgrace, punishment and repentance. But I must say in
                    self-exculpation, that, tiresome as I must have been, I was as much sinned
                    against as sinning.</p>
                <p>Easily provoked and daring in reprisals, but as the youngest the least
                        formidable<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7017-054"/> and the most defenceless, I was
                    too good fun to be let alone. I was like the drunken helot told off to
                    self-degradation for the moral benefit of the young Spartans; for I was teased
                    and bullied till I became as furious as a small wild beast, and when by my
                    violence I had put myself in the wrong, I was held up as an example to Edwin and
                    Ellen to avoid, and flogged as the practical corollary. I do not suppose a week
                    passed without one of these miserable outbreaks, with the rod and that dark
                    closet under the stairs to follow.</p>
                <p>These repeated floggings did me no good. Physically, they certainly hardened me
                    to pain, but morally they roused in me that false and fatal courage which breeds
                    the dare-devils of society and makes its criminals die game. But I was subdued
                    at once when anyone, by rare chance and gleam of common-sense, remonstrated with
                    me lovingly or talked to me rationally. I<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7017-055"/> well
                    remember my ambition to prove myself worthy of his trust, which was like
                    sunlight in my tempestuous young life, when my father, instead of accusing and
                    threatening me, relied on my promise to do what was right and to my word when I
                    said I had not done what was wrong. Nor he, nor anyone who trusted to me, ever
                    found me even then a defaulter. Like a faithful dog, I would have stood to have
                    been hacked to pieces before I would have broken faith or forfeited my childish
                    honour.</p>
                <p>These halcyon days of moral dignity were painfully exceptional; and my father's
                    confidence in me was that gift of God for which I longed more ardently than for
                    anything in my life before or sinceâand how seldom granted! I only remember two
                    occasionsâonce when I was believed about that broken drawing-room window, of
                    which I had not been the ball-playing cause; and once when I was allowed to
                        pick<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7017-056"/> red currants for preserves, and my
                    father trusted to my promise not to eat nor filch. As things were, I was always
                    being guilty of some act of mischief, some flagrant disobedience to rules, or
                    some outburst of temper which gave those in authority reason when they thrashed
                    me, if they were in the wrong when they misunderstood me. So much I must say for
                    my past turbulent self:âI never remember being flogged for an act of meanness
                    nor for a lie; and I do remember twice taking his punishment for Edwin and not
                    betraying him. I never told tales of the others, and I was always ready to brave
                    danger and its consequences if asked to do a service. Thus, though I was
                    undeniably the black sheep of the flock, I was the one trusted to when a
                    steadfast agent was wanted.</p>
                <p>At this moment there comes before me a little scene which must have taken place
                    when I was a very small boy.</p>
                <pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7017-057"/>
                <p>I was sent to steal some sacred apples for some of themâI forget who they were
                    now. As I shook the tree by means of a light garden-rake hitched up on the
                    branches, it fell and cut open my head, covering my neck-frill with blood. But I
                    gathered up the apples in my pinafore, and took them to my brothers or sisters
                    hiding behind the wall on the little bank which to this day is golden with the
                    âshoes and stockingsâ I remember so well; and then I marched sturdily into the
                    house, where Mary the nurse cut my hair, strapped up the wound, and put me to
                    bed. The next day I was taken to my father and flogged. But I would not tell for
                    whom I had stolen the apples, nor would I plead in mitigation of my punishment
                    that I had had none myself.</p>
                <p>Our then âviceroy,â the second brotherâthe eldest being away at collegeâwas a
                    young fellow of eighteen, with a violent temper<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7017-058"/>
                    and a heavy hand. He was generous and affectionate at bottom, but he was
                    irritable, jealous and tyrannical to an overwhelming degree. One day, a
                    Punch-and-Judy show came on the lawn before the dining-room windows. We were all
                    there, watching the raree-show. I suppose I was excited and in one of my
                    impudent moods, for I persisted in calling my brother âDicksy,â a name he
                    disliked and specially forbade the smaller fry to use.</p>
                <p>âIf you say that again I will thrash you,â he said to me angrily.</p>
                <p>I looked up into his face. How clear the whole thing is before me! The squeaking
                    and unintelligible Punch; the sunshine on the grass; the close throng, clustered
                    like flies against the window; and my sense of my brother's towering bigness and
                    formidible ferocity. But I was a daring young rascal, and always ready to brave
                    the unknown.</p>
                <pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7017-059"/>
                <p>âDicksy!â I said defiantly.</p>
                <p>Whereupon Richard was as good as his word, and then and there beat me
                    severely.</p>
                <p>The brother who stood next to Richard, with one sister between, was three years
                    his junior. He was as tall, but naturally not then so strong; as passionate in
                    temper, but of a deeper nature and finer mental and moral quality altogether.
                    These two were natural foes and rivals, and were always fightingâthe one
                    tyrannizing, the other rebelling. Before this day I do not remember this brother
                    Godfrey. He is lost in the crowd of the elders, from whom we little chaps were
                    separated as entirely as if they had been lions or we had been mice. After this
                    day he became one of the enduring loves of my life. I distinctly remember how he
                    turned upon Richard and fought him for his cruelty to such a little fellow as I
                    wasânot quite five years old, and still in frocks like a baby; for I can yet see
                        the<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7017-060"/> weals on my shoulder made by Richard's
                    vigorous fingers. After the scuffle Godfrey took me on his knee, and kissed me
                    to comfort me. From that moment there woke up in me a kind of worship for this
                    brother, just ten years my seniorâa worship, which, old man as I amâstill older
                    as he isâI retain to this hour. We have lived apart all our lives. In over forty
                    years I have seen him for two at a stretch. But when I realize the ideal of
                    knightly honour and manly noblenessâof that kind of proud incorruptibility which
                    knows no weakness for fear nor favourâI think of my brother Godfrey far beyond
                    the seas; he who as a boy braved his elder brother for the sake of a little
                    fellow who could not defend himselfâas a man calmly faced an excited mob yelling
                    for their blood, to place under the shadow of the British flag two trembling
                    wretches who had only his courage between them and death.</p>
                <p>The early life and adventures of this<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7017-061"/> brother
                    are a romance in themselves. Had he lived in mythic times he would have been
                    another Amadis, a second Wallace. He is like some offshoot of heroic days,
                    rather than a man of a commercial generation; and in him the grand old Roman
                    spirit survives and is re-embodied.</p>
                <p>Godfrey was my lord, but Edwin was my natural chum. Some eighteen months younger,
                    I was the stronger and bigger of the two. He had always been a delicate boy; and
                    the nursery tradition about him was that when he was born he was the exact
                    length of a pound of butter, was put into a quart-pot, and dressed in my eldest
                    sister's doll's clothes:âthe ordinary baby-clothes were too large, and her doll
                    was a big one for those days. I was his slave and protector in one. He had none
                    of the emotional intensity, none of the fierceness of temper, the foolhardy
                    courage, the inborn defiance, neither had he the darkness of<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7017-062"/> mood nor the volcanic kind of love which
                    characterized me. He was sweeter in temper; more sprightly as well as more
                    peaceful in disposition; more amenable to authority; of a lighter, gentler, more
                    manageable and more amiable nature altogether. He was the family favourite and
                    the family plaything. Long after my sisters had left off taking me into their
                    laps they would let Edwin sit on their knees for hours; and when my brothers
                    would have kissed a hedgehog as soon as me, they kissed him as they kissed Julia
                    and Rosamond and Ellen. He was never in mischief and never in the way. He cared
                    only to play quiet games in the garden when it was fair, or to sit in the
                    embrasure of the window when it was wet and we were forced to keep the house. In
                    consideration of his delicacy he had been taught wool-work and netting; and his
                    supreme pleasure was to sit on his âcopyâ (a kind of stool), in a<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7017-063"/> âcupboardy houseââthat is, in the midst of a ring of
                    chairs forming a defence-work against intrudersâwhile I told him stories âout of
                    my own headâ or Ellen good-naturedly read to him.</p>
                <p>Besides this constitutional delicacy to make those in authority tender in their
                    dealing with him, he was the most beautiful of us all. Godfrey was incomparably
                    the handsomest of the grown boysâdid not his beauty once save his life?âbut
                    Edwin was the loveliest of the children. He was like one of Sir Joshua's
                    cherubs. His head was covered with bright golden curls, his skin was like a pale
                    monthly rose, and he had big soft blue eyes which no one could resist. Everyone
                    loved and petted him, as I have said. Our father, who saw in him the
                    reproduction of our dead mother, had even a more tender feeling for him than for
                    any of his other favourites; my own hero, Godfrey, loved him ten thousand<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7017-064"/> times more than he loved me; and Richard, our
                    tyrannical âkingling,â who spared no one else, spared Edwin. But no one
                    sacrificed to him as I did, and no one loved him with such fanatical devotion.
                    It was but natural, then, that he should lord it over me with that tremendous
                    force which weakness ever has over loving strength; and that I, the born rebel
                    but the passionate lover, should give to that weakness the submission which no
                    authority could wring from me. Also it came into the appointed order of things
                    that I should bore him by my devotion, and that he should pain me by his
                    indifference. It was a preface to the life that had to comeâthe first of the
                    many times when I should make shipwreck of my peace through love.</p>
                <p>Yet had it not been for this devotion to Edwin, and the feeling that I was of use
                    to him for all his coldness to me, my life would have been even more painful
                    than it was.<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7017-065"/> I was so isolated in the family,
                    so out of harmony with them all, and by my own faults of temperament such a
                    little Ishmaelite and outcast, that as much despair as can exist with childhood
                    overwhelmed and possessed me. Three years after his defence of me, when he was
                    eighteen and I eight, Godfrey left home; and I lost the Great-Heart of my loyal
                    loveâthe one I always felt was somehow my own special suzerain, if I were but a
                    despised kind of Dugald creature to him. But even at the best, the difference
                    between our ages prevented anything like friendship or companionship. He was my
                    lord, but he was never my familiar.</p>
                <p>I remember how, after he had left, and though I knew that he was out of England
                    and countless miles away, I used to expect him to return suddenly and by
                    miracle; and how sometimes I used to look for him about the placeâin the
                    cupboards and unused<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7017-066"/> lofts. And I remember,
                    too, a strange horror that used to seize me, of expecting to find a pool of
                    blood in the place where I looked for him.</p>
                <p>Perhaps this odd kind of horror was due to a terrible scene which had had a great
                    effect on me. Our two brothers, Richard and Godfrey, were shooting in a field
                    not far from the vicarage, and we were watching them from the windows. Suddenly
                    there was a tremendous report, a large volume of smoke, a cry and the hurrying
                    of men together; and then we saw a body carried on their shoulders, and brought
                    up to the vicarage. It was Richard, the barrel of whose gun had burst. The stock
                    had wounded him severely in the stomach, and covered him with blood. Godfrey was
                    safe, but singed. Perhaps it was some obscure association of ideas which added
                    this ghastly horror of expected blood to my grief for Godfrey's mysterious
                    flight and my insane<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7017-067"/> belief in his miraculous
                    returnâunable as I was, like all devotees, to accept the unalterable law when
                    dealing with love.</p>
                <p>In these outcast days I used to dream a strange dreamâstrange, considering my
                    ageâhow that I was not one of themânot my father's child at allâbut a foundling,
                    some day to be reclaimed and taken home by his own who would love and understand
                    him. I had a favourite hiding-place in the lime-trees at the foot of the garden,
                    where I used to lose my time, my strength and mental health in this fantastic
                    idea. Granting all the difficulties my family had to contend with in me, I do
                    not think the desolation of a young child could go beyond the secret hope of one
                    day finding himself an alien to his ownâof some day being claimed by the
                    unknownâstrangers coming out of space sure to be more gentle and sympathetic
                    than those others! But I always added, as a codicil to this testament<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7017-068"/> of despair, that if ever I did find these unknown
                    dear ones, Godfrey should still be my king and Edwin my beloved, and that no new
                    tie should break these two golden links of the old sad heavy chain. As another
                    proof of my childish desolation, if also of my intemperate nature, I remember
                    how once, in a fit of mad passion for some slight put on me by my eldest sister,
                    whereat the others had laughed and jeered me, I first fought them all round,
                    then rushed off to a large draw-well we had in the coach-yardâwe were not then
                    at Eden, but at my father's private house in Kentâintending to throw myself down
                    and end for ever a life which was at the moment intolerable and emphatically not
                    worth living. The heavy cover was over the mouth, and I could not move it. While
                    I was trying the gardener came along; and, seeing that I had been crying, he
                    good-naturedly took me to the apple-loft, where he filled my pockets with golden
                        russetsâwhich<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7017-069"/> consoled me grandly, and
                    lifted me over that little stile of sorrow into a flowery field of content. I
                    was then ten years old.</p>
                <p>If Edwin had died when he was a child, the spiritualists would have had a case.
                    He woke one night sobbing piteously, and woke me, sleeping with him, by his
                    crying. When I asked him what was the matter, he said that he had just seen
                    âpoor mamma.â He was on one side of a broad black river, and on the other, in a
                    garden full of flowers, stood our mother draped in white with wings like an
                    angel. She held out her arms and called: âLittle Edwin, come to me! Little
                    Edwin, come!â Then he woke, and cried because he had again lost the mother whom
                    he, of all the children, most desired to have had and known. For not even those
                    who remembered her regretted her loss so much as did Edwin, who was not quite
                    two years old when she died, and who did not remember her at all. He had<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7017-070"/> no illness after this, nor did he die. Thanks
                    to the pure blood we have all inherited, notwithstanding his early delicacy he
                    is alive and well to this day. But had he died then, this dream would have been
                    accounted a supernatural vision, and he would have been held to have been called
                    to death and paradise by his mother's spirit.</p>
                <p>If all the failures in presentiments and warning dreams were recorded, I fancy
                    they would considerably outweigh the co-incidences.</p>
                <p>I had not Edwin's pathetic yearning for our mother. I found her substitute in
                    Nurse Mary, whom I loved with overwhelming force, and got into trouble as the
                    result. As, once when she had been away for a week's holiday and had returned at
                    night, I was wakened up out of my sleep and taken to her bed. I was so glad to
                    see her that I cried; and finally cried myself into what was, I suppose, a fit
                    of hysterics;â<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7017-071"/> when they whipped me as a useful
                    nervous counteraction.</p>
                <p>This nurse was an undisciplined kind of woman, who now hugged us till she nearly
                    squeezed us to death, and now beat us black and blue. But I suppose my own
                    volcanic nature understood her violent one, for I could not live out of her
                    sight, and she was good enough to me. I am afraid she drank, poor Mary! Things
                    dark then are clear now; and those mysterious and sudden illnesses which she
                    used to have pretty often were, I fancy, due to brandy rather than to disease.
                    She left us when I was nine years old.</p>
                <p>I was about eleven years of age when the first distinct stirrings of my mental
                    life began to make themselves felt. Godfrey's adventuresâfor he had returned
                    after two years' imprisonment in Russiaâhad something to do with the new light
                    that began to dawn in my young brain. I had<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7017-072"/>
                    always had a passion for books and pictures, and I knew almost by heart those
                    few that we possessed. In contrast to the wealth of modern days, it will not be
                    uninteresting to give the full catalogue of our special library. Mrs. Sherwood's
                    âLittle Henry and his Bearerâ; âWilliam and the Woodmanâ; âSandford and Mertonâ;
                    âPaul and Virginiaâ; âEvenings at Homeâ; âThe Arabian Nights' Talesâ; âTales of
                    the Castleâ; âTales of the Geniiâ; âRobinson Crusoeâ; âPilgrim's Progressââwhere
                    the occasion was generally improved for my benefit, as I was identified with
                    Passion, while Edwin was Patience; Miss Edgeworth's âMoral Talesâ; and
                    âElizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia,â formed our whole stock of profane
                    literature. For Sunday-reading we had âMrs. Barbauld's Hymnsâ; the âDairyman's
                    Daughterâ; âFox's Book of Martyrsâ; âThe History of all Religionsâ; âThe Life of
                        Christââ<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7017-073"/> of which I remember only the
                    pathetic pictures of the Agony in the Garden and the Crucifixion, where two
                    little angels held up cups to catch the blood; and sometimes we were allowed to
                    look at the coloured plates of the âsafeâ volumes of the âEncyclopÃ¦dia
                    Londinensisââthe battle-horse of the study library. When we grew older we had to
                    read one of Sherlock's sermonsâSherlock was my father's favourite divine; or he
                    read to us in the evening, before prayers, a chapter out of Doddridge's âFamily
                    Expositor,â when all of us youngsters invariably fell asleep and were scolded
                    for our irreligious drowsiness.</p>
                <p>But, as I say, when I was about eleven years of age, almost suddenly I seemed to
                    leap out of this narrow circle and to demand a larger mental area altogether.
                    There woke up in me the most burning desire to Know. With all the<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7017-074"/> intense physical enjoyment of life given me by my
                    keen senses and strong animal natureâwith all the delight I felt in putting out
                    my strength and learning how to increase and sharpen my growing bodily powersâI
                    had a dim consciousness that life meant more than mere pleasure; and that it was
                    as important to know history and geography, and what the problems of Euclid
                    proved, and what those unintelligible books in strange tongues said to those who
                    could read them, as it was to know how to swarm up a smooth-boled tree, jump
                    standing and leap running, and clamber like a goat over the crags and rocky
                    places. All these things were necessary and delightful; but higher and beyond
                    them all stood Knowledge.</p>
                <p>By this time our family at home had decreased by death, marriage and absence, to
                    fiveâless than half the original number; and things educational were worse for
                        us,<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7017-075"/> the youngest two boys, than they had
                    been for the elders. Edwin's health was too frail for school-life; and as he
                    could not go, neither could I. I was wanted at home to be his companion. It was
                    in vain that I begged my father to send me to school. He would not; and I vexed
                    him by my entreaties. Nor would he give us masters nor a tutor at home. He
                    promised, but he never fulfilled his promise. All the instruction I ever
                    received was of the pot-hook-and-hanger degreeâthe mere elements; the rest I did
                    for myself. And so years passed on, and still Edwin and I were kept at home to
                    do what we liked, provided we did not get into mischief and did not bother.</p>
                <p>Part of that liking with me went into learning for myself what there was no one
                    to teach me. I took up languages; beginning with French. Year after year I
                    attacked one after the other, till I had got<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7017-076"/>
                    hold of a good many. But, as I learnt only to read and was not phenomenally
                    laborious, I scamped the grammar and devoted myself to translationâthat is, I
                    neglected rules and learnt only words. This is the reason why, when I could read
                    with ease and translate aloud rapidly while I read, French, Italian, German,
                    Spanish, with a little Latin and less Greek, I could neither parse any of these
                    languages correctly nor speak one fluently. I learnt without method, and I have
                    never been able to disentangle my mind from the false order of the start.</p>
                <p>This want of early training explains all my persistent intellectual
                    deficienciesâmy want of dialectical skill, my want of scientific accuracy, and
                    how it is that I know nothing analytically, from the foundations upward, but
                    only synthetically, concretely, as it stands. This must needs be, seeing that I
                    have never built up any study brick by brick, nor chamber by chamber, but<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7017-077"/> have only entered on the results of other
                    men's workâinhabiting where they have created. Essentially self-educated as I
                    am, that self-education began at an age when the elemental drudgery, which
                    always seems useless to ignorance, is naturally shirked for the more interesting
                    results. Learning, with me, was only a means to an end. For instance, I learnt
                    French out of curiosity to read an old illustrated âTelemachusâ that we had, and
                    thus to understand what the pictures meant; Italian to know about Petrarch and
                    Dante, whose conventional portraits in our encyclopÃ¦dia had fascinated me;
                    German, for âFaustâ; Latin, to understand those brown-leather folios in the
                    study library; Spanish for âDon Quixoteâ; and Greek in the vain hope of
                    following Homer in the originalâthe awakening touch here having been given by
                    Godfrey telling me about the âfar-darting Apolloâ and the âsilver-ankled
                        Thetis.â<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7017-078"/> And being by the nature of my
                    intellect quick to understand, and by temperament impatient to possessââa
                    temperament founded on ultimates,â as my friend Garth Wilkinson said of me in
                    later timesâI had not mastered the rudiments when I plunged into the middle
                    term, and bounded on to the end. Thus, never subjected to that severe mental
                    discipline which is but another form of moral control, I grew up in absolute
                    mental unrestraint; and I have never been able to put myself into harness
                    since.</p>
                <p>This independence of thought is not presumption nor vanity, nor any of the hard
                    things believers in authority say of the self-reliant. It is the result of
                    antecedent conditions, for which a man is no more responsible than he is for the
                    size of his skeleton. And he can change the one as little as the other. Those
                    who are to be disciplined must be taught their drill and<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7017-079"/> made to obey; and no one can be at once self-reliant
                    and submissive.</p>
                <p>This then, was how things stood in my early boyhood, after the stage of childhood
                    proper was passedâsay from between eleven to seventeen. In my mental life,
                    undirected and unhelped, save by oppositionâwhich has always been a powerful
                    stimulus to meâI strove to learn, to know, to possess. So far I was justified by
                    my conscience and at peace with myself; and if I lost my time, took things by
                    the wrong end, and amassed a world of rubbish which did me no good then nor
                    since, I did not know my mistakes, and my ignorance was my bliss.</p>
                <p>In my family I was still under the old cloud. I was snubbed by my father, whom I
                    constantly worried and often angered; roughly handled by my brothers, whose
                    authority I defied when they came home for their vacations from college; sent to
                    Coventry by my sisters whom I<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7017-080"/> revolted by my
                    violence and affronted by my impertinence; made his slave by Edwin, who did not
                    really love me in those days; but with all this I knew that I tried to do right,
                    however poorly I succeeded, and that I would have died rather than I would have
                    done what seemed to me mean or false, or cowardly or selfish. And ever and ever
                    I longed with a hungry passion that ran into pain, for the love which my own
                    turbulence of nature made it impossible for others to give me.</p>
                <p>If our dear mother had lived, things would have been different. She would have
                    understood each and would have done justly by all. Under her wise management
                    there would have been none of that neglect in direction and harshness of
                    punishment when things went wrong which had been the rule of our upbringing. And
                    her gentle influence would have tamed the tempers and regulated the actions of
                    all alike. All our<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7017-081"/> troubles were due to her
                    death; and my poor father was as much to be pitied as were we.</p>
                <p>I have dwelt so long on the early life of my childhood because it gives the clue
                    to all the rest. The boy is father to the man, and the first chord contains the
                    key-note of the whole succeeding harmony.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                <p><hi>AT</hi> seventeen my future profession was undetermined and my real education
                    had never been begun. My father's constitutional indolence had greatly increased
                    of late years, and nothing was so difficult to him as to take a resolution,
                    excepting to act on it when taken. Hence, Edwin and I were still hanging about
                    at home, doing nothing that should in any way equip us for the life in which we
                    had to take our place and pull our pound with the rest.</p>
                <p>Though we two were incomparably the worst off for tuition, our elder brothers<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7017-083"/> themselves had been but slenderly furnished,
                    all things considered. Therefore they had failed to make for themselves such
                    positions as might have helped us youngsters against the dead weight of my
                    father's inertia. It was as much as they could do to fend for themselves and
                    struggle into comparatively good places. And some of them, in revolt against
                    their difficulties, had flung up the attempt here at home, and had cast their
                    lines in the dark but brisker waters of emigration and exile.</p>
                <p>There never was a family with so much power left to run so cruelly to waste for
                    want of timely cultivation as was ours! It is no vanity to say that we were an
                    exceptionally fine set all through, and that, had we been properly trained, each
                    one of us would have made his mark. There was not a dunce among us, nor a
                    physical failure. All my sisters were pretty; all my brothers were well-grown
                    and handsome; and Edwin,<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7017-084"/> who was the least
                    robust in person, was the most beautiful in face and the most lovely in
                    character. I have often lamented the waste of good material in our family, and
                    the loss to the world that it has been. When I see the elaborate education given
                    to boys and girls with brain-power of the most ordinary calibre, and note what
                    careful training has made of them, and then remember the large amount of mental
                    and physical vitality among ourselves, and what ordinary care might have made of
                    us, I confess I feel heartsickâfoolish as it is to look back, like Lot's wife,
                    over the irrecoverable past. All the same, it was a misfortune; and it has been
                    a real loss.</p>
                <p>It might have been so different! My father's office and position made him an
                    influential person in society; my mother's family kept us abreast with the
                    county magnates, at least in theory, if, owing to my father's disinclination to
                    society, scarcely in<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7017-085"/> practice; and we had
                    friends who might have helped us if they would. There was, for one, the great
                    Tory member whose historic name was like a battle-cryâhe had power enough, if he
                    would have used it for gratitude without being entreated. For my father would
                    have cut off his right hand before he would have asked a favour of living man.
                    When an election was on hand, and every vote was of consequence, Sir James used
                    to come to our house, make much of his dear friend Mr. Kirkland, praise his
                    Latinity and his poetry, admire the girls, kiss the children, and hint at
                    substantial services for the boys. When he was returned he forgot all about his
                    dear friend as cleanly as if he had never existed, and did not lift a finger to
                    serve the sons of his faithful partisan, who were also the grandsons of his old
                    master, the Bishop. His want of gratitude never touched my father's political
                    fidelity; for no man was<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7017-086"/> ever less a
                    self-seeker than he. He did his duty at a personal loss quite as stoutly as if
                    it brought him grist and grain; though he suffered from ingratitude, as any man
                    of sensibility would. But he never complained, even in the privacy of home. I
                    have never known anyone more entirely free from all spite and bitterness than
                    he.</p>
                <p>By this time I had formed my theory of the universe. What thoughtful boy of
                    seventeen has not? I was firmly convinced that I held the fee-simple of all
                    great truths in my hands, and that no views other than those which seemed to me
                    right were worth consideration. All were the outcome of either ignorance or
                    falsehoodâof either blind superstition which could not see the light, or wilful
                    tyranny, conscious of its iniquity but determined to hold on for the oppression
                    of truth. No question could have two sides; no opponent could be an honest man;
                    no ultimate development<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7017-087"/> of my own theories
                    could eventuate in evil. Does not every individual, like concrete society, go
                    through this phase of bigotryâtyrannous and unjust by its very intensity of
                    conviction?</p>
                <p>I was comically proud of being an Englishman. I had no doubt that we were God's
                    modern chosenâHis eldest sons and peculiar favourites; that the English
                    Protestant Church was the very Delos of Truthâthe ark of the Christian covenant;
                    that even Christian prayers said in a foreign tongue were not heard with so much
                    pleasure, nor answered with so much precision, as oursâwhile prayers said to a
                    Being who did not existâto Allah or Brahma, Vishnu or Buddha, not to speak of
                    the Madonna and the saintsâwere neither heard nor answered at all; that we were
                    the best gentlemen, the bravest men, the most enlightened and most virtuous
                    people on the face of the earth; and that every departure from our special<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7017-088"/> ways of living and thinking was a wandering
                    into the desert with destruction at the far end. That is, I was bounded by my
                    own circumstances, and could not travel beyond my experience.</p>
                <p>Also, I was an ardent Republican and a devout Christian. Indeed, I was the one
                    because the other; and, in spite of that injunction to pay tribute to CÃ¦sar, on
                    which my father so much insisted, I could not see a âvia media.â Nor could I
                    understand the compromise between faith and practice, consistency and
                    expediency, made by the believing world; nor yet how men, who would have roasted
                    alive an infidel had the law permitted, could deliberately break all the
                    commands given by the Saviour. That fine satirical problem of how to hold
                    together, on the principles of the Sermon on the Mount, an empire founded on the
                    breach of all the Ten Commandments, had not then been formulated. But the spirit
                    of it was<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7017-089"/> in my own young head, and the
                    difficulty involved was one that puzzled me as it has many more than myself, and
                    will continue to puzzle others for some time yet to come.</p>
                <p>For my own part, full of youthful zeal and the logic of consistency, I determined
                    to live the Christian life so far as it was possible; helped thereto by the
                    influence and example of the strong old heathen times. I, at least, in my own
                    person would be faithful to the Lord and a man among men.</p>
                <p>I began by renouncing all the pleasant softnesses and flattering vanities of my
                    youth, and made myself a moral hybrid, half ascetic, half stoic. I accustomed
                    myself to privations and held luxuries as deadly sins. Sensual by nature, I cut
                    myself off from all sweets of which I was inordinately fond; and because I was a
                    heavy sleeper and fond of that warm <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7017-090"/> vating morning doze which made me
                    always late for breakfast, for a whole year I lay on the floor and despised bed
                    as an unrighteous effeminacy. Never cowardly to pain, I taught myself to bear
                    mild torture without wincingâas, when I one day dug out a tooth with my knife as
                    a good exercise of fortitude. Because I once saw myself in the glass with a
                    strange and sudden consciousness of the beauty of my youth and personality, I
                    turned that offending bit of blistered quicksilver to the wall, and for six
                    months never saw my face again. During that time I had to undergo many things
                    from my sisters because of the untidiness of my general appearance; for though I
                    had become scrupulously clean by now, as part of the physical enjoyment of
                    lifeâclean even to my long brown freckled hands, surely the test-piece of a
                    boy!âI was but a sloven in the decorative part, and never knew the right side
                    from the wrong, and scarcely the<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7017-091"/> back of things
                    from the front. I gave away all the âtreasuresâ I had accumulated since my
                    childhood, in imitation of the Apostles and according to Christ's injunctions to
                    the rich young man; and no one but myself knew of that little altar which I had
                    built up in the waste-place behind the shrubbery, where I used to carry the
                    first of such fruit as I specially liked, to lay it thereon as my offering to
                    Godâto wither in the sun or be devoured by insects and birds. I set myself
                    secret penance for secret sins. I prayed often and fervently, and sometimes
                    seemed to be borne away from the things of time and space and carried into the
                    very presence of God, as it were in a tranceâa still living Gerontius. I
                    realized my faith as positively as if it had been a thing I could see and touch.
                    My confirmation was a consecration; and when first I received the communion, I
                    felt as if I had tabernacled the Lord in my own<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7017-092"/>
                    body, and that I was henceforth His, so that I could never sin again.</p>
                <p>In these days of boyish fervour, had I fallen into the hands of a Roman Catholic
                    I should have become a monk of some severe disciplinary order. My whole inner
                    life was one of intense religious realization. God was far off, the paternal
                    King and inexorable Judge of all, and His âunlidded eyeâ ever watched me with
                    awful attention. This thought was sometimes so oppressive that I used to shrink
                    and cower under the consciousness of being always looked at; when I would cover
                    my face in my hands and say aloud:</p>
                <p>âOh! if I could but be sometimes aloneâif I could but hide myself and be able to
                    think as I liked and not be watched nor heard!â</p>
                <p>And then I felt that I had spoken blasphemy and committed the unpardonable
                    sin.</p>
                <pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7017-093"/>
                <p>My consciousness of Christ was softer. He was my gracious Prince, to obey whom
                    brought the joy of loyal serving. To disobey pained rather than angered Him, and
                    caused Him that âcrucifixion afreshâ in which I believed as firmly as I believed
                    in Gethsemane and Golgotha. The angels were my invisible companions, of whom I
                    was not afraid; and I felt the grim presence of the devil at my back and in the
                    corners of the room, as one feels the presence of a murderer in the dark. In a
                    word, I lived in the Christian's sanctified egotismâbelieving that all the
                    forces of heaven and hell were mainly occupied with the salvation or destruction
                    of my one poor miserable little soul; and that the most important thing between
                    earth and sky was, whether a hot-blooded lad with more sincerity than judgment
                    flew into a rage when he should have curbed his temper, or heroically checked
                    his impulses of sensuality in the<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7017-094"/> matter of
                    jam-pudding and the fruit garden.</p>
                <p>But during all this time of my faithful endeavours after a higher life I was just
                    as intolerable to my family as before, and my passions were still my masters. My
                    anger blazed out in the old fierce way at the smallest provocation; and when the
                    blood mounted to my head, then I was again the helot self-degraded I had always
                    been. Heaven was shut against me, and I was spiritually in the Hell I was
                    predestined to eternally inhabit.</p>
                <p>I was vehemently penitent when the fit was over, and resolved in my wild way of
                    repentance to bear with Christian patience the next affront put on my sensitive
                    pride. Alas! nature was too strong for me, and my progress in self-control was
                    like nothing so much as the twirling of a squirrel in his cage. For all my
                    efforts to deliver myself, I was up to my neck in the Slough; and my prayers
                        brought<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7017-095"/> me no more spiritual grace, no more
                    godly fruitage, than so much water poured out on sand. The boiling blood I
                    called on God to calm boiled ever as madly as before; and with all my faith in
                    the Divine presence and power, I was conscious that I was not answered.</p>
                <p>What agony I went through! What an infinite sense of being fated to sin,
                    foredoomed to perdition, possessed me, as I felt that I was left to fight with
                    my wild beasts unhelpedâto struggle to get free, that I might take refuge in
                    God, and to be hopelessly in the clutch of the devil! It was as if some monster
                    held me bodily, while I was striving to deliver myself that I might rush into
                    the outstretched, loving arms of the Saviour opposite. But that Saviour waited
                    for me to go to Him. He did not and would not help me. Only those who have gone
                    through a like period of spiritual endeavour and frustration can realize my<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7017-096"/> sufferings at this time, which, I remember,
                    threw an awful kind of light on the myths setting forth the endless labour of
                    Sisyphus and the fruitless work of the DanaÃ¯des in hell.</p>
                <p>Clergyman though he was, all this ebullient zeal and youthful extravagance of
                    aspiration annoyed my father as if the translation of faith into practice had
                    been an impiety, and not an effort after godliness. We will grant the clumsiness
                    of the methodâstill, the effort was always there. Logical Christianity seemed to
                    him a dream as fanatical as it was inconvenient. All that was necessary for our
                    salvation wasâto believe the Bible, obey our parents, say our prayers night and
                    morning, go to church regularly, and keep ourselves free from forbidden sins.
                    More than this was to fall on the other side and go over into presumption.</p>
                <p>He venerated the saints and martyrs of<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7017-097"/> past
                    times; but he maintained that the past was not the present, and that the age of
                    enthusiasm, like that of miracles, had died out. Had persecution been revived,
                    he would have stood firm for his own part, and he would have exhorted others to
                    a like fidelity. But as no more fires in Smithfield would be lighted, at least
                    in our generation, and no one would now call out: âChristianos ad leones!â he
                    held spiritual assent more valuable than practical imitation, and quiet walking
                    in the cleanly parts of the broad highway better than scaling eccentric heights
                    and shouting âExcelsior!â from the clouds.</p>
                <p>It was useless for me to turn to him for guidance. He repulsed me with coldness,
                    or testily chid me with arrogance, when I carried my difficulties between faith
                    and practice to him. He accused me of presumption in thus questioning the lives
                    of men older, better, wiser than myselfâsuch<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7017-098"/> a
                    mere unformed lad as I was! And ever, with perfect justice and uncompromising
                    logic, he pointed out the inconsistency of my aspirations after superior piety
                    with my acted life of passion and misconduct. My conscience told me he was right
                    when he thus flung me back with the argument âad rem.â What had I to do with
                    good or godlinessâI, the child of sin, whose very love was a tempest, whose
                    quarrels were volcanic eruptions, whose repentance was a tropical storm, and
                    whose virtues themselves were as unsettling and disturbing as were his faults?
                    If I could just scrape in by conformity, that was all I need hope for. To
                    attempt more was as irrational as if a lame man who could not walk should try to
                    leap.</p>
                <p>The wave of religious revivalism, just beginning to break on the arid shores of
                    ecclesiastical indifference, was to my father a sign of storm and shipwreck, not
                    of healthy<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7017-099"/> movement. He stood apart from both
                    Evangelical enthusiasm and Tractarian authority with equal dislike for each.
                    Through the former, moreover, he had received personal annoyance of a grave
                    kind. During his five years' absence in Kent, his curate, one Mr. Black, had
                    âawakenedâ and âconvertedâ the parish of Eden to a high pitch of evangelical
                    fervour. A schism in the place was the natural consequence. The Evangelicals
                    said that my father had not been a faithful minister of the Word, and that the
                    Gospel had never been preached to them before the advent of Mr. Black; and the
                    sleepy old souls, who disliked innovations, stood by their kind-hearted vicar
                    who did so much quiet good in the place, though he did not âpan outâ on free
                    will and prevenient grace, baptismal regeneration and faith before works. They
                    scouted the new order as fantastic and extreme; and thought evening parties,
                    where prayers took the<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7017-100"/> place of the former
                    round games, and expounding recondite doctrines that of the old forfeits, not
                    only monstrously dull but also unseemly.</p>
                <p>Their sheet-anchor was Conservatism and keeping things as they were. What had
                    done for their fathers was good enough for them, and ought to be good enough for
                    their children. No improvements, however much they were needed, met with their
                    support. They saw no good in the Sunday-schools, which had been built and were
                    kept up by a rich adherent of the energetic curate; and the ârestorationâ of the
                    old church by the same generous hand was an offence to them. Munificence had a
                    hard fight with chronic obstructiveness before it got leave to bestow; and every
                    stone that was laid and every ornament that was added was subjected to hostile
                    criticism and opposition.</p>
                <p>Naturally my father was not so backward as this. He recognised the good and
                        beauty<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7017-101"/> of all these changes. The restored
                    church was really magnificent; and the fine organ, with its organist and
                    well-trained choir, was a decided advance on old Adam and his pitch-pipe. The
                    Sunday-school teachers too, kept those unruly children in order; while the low
                    pews, all looking one way, held the congregation together and prevented the
                    sleepy-heads from snoring. But the finer surroundings demanded a more stately
                    method; and in his heart my dear, indolent father, when he came back into
                    residence, regretted the old familiar ways, and felt strange in all this new
                    niceness, where he had to be for ever on parade and always alert and in order.
                    If the glory of God could have been fitly set forth without so much ado, it
                    would have been more pleasing to him. He thought it just a little in excessâas
                    he thought my poor, purblind efforts very greatly in excess.</p>
                <p>My father and I, not in harmony on <choice>
                        <orig>reli-</orig>
                        <reg>religious</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7017-102"/> gious matters, were at issue in
                    politicsâHigh Tory, according to his age and training, as he was; Republican of
                    the crudest academic type as was I. We had many a stormy scene; for I was such
                    an impulsive fool I could never hold my peace, and when my mind teemed with
                    thoughts that knocked at the door of my lips, they had to come forth, for good
                    or ill.</p>
                <p>âI would rather see the devil himself let loose on the earth than the Radicals
                    get the upper hand in the country!â my father said to me one day in a paroxysm
                    of rage, when I had rashly introduced the subject of the first Chartist
                    petition, just then presented to Parliament.</p>
                <p>âAnd I hold all kings and tyrants as direct emissaries of the devil, and that
                    âVox populi, vox Dei,ââ was my defiant reply.</p>
                <p>For which piece of impertinence my father called me a puppy and incontinently
                    knocked me down.</p>
                <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7017-103"/>
                <p>In those days O'Connell was my political idol; and I seriously thought of running
                    away from home to offer myself to him as the servant and soldier of liberty,
                    good for any work he might give me to do. Had not Godfrey, that best and noblest
                    of us all, gone to join the Poles in their rise against Russia? and was not the
                    freedom of a country beyond one's own small nationality? Wherefore, for all my
                    patriotism, I rather inconsistently longed for the Irish to take up arms, that I
                    might imitate my brother's splendid example and fight their
                    tyrantsâourselvesâfor their liberties. I thought Byron's âIrish Avatarâ the
                    finest bit of poetry the world had ever seenârun hard, however, by Campbell's
                    âSong of the Greeks;â and I used to declaim these two poems with a ferocious
                    energy which made my sister Ellen call me, in her quiet way, âa perfect
                    monsterââwhile Edwin added: âYou are just a maniac, Chris, and ought to be put
                    into a madhouse.â</p>
                <pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7017-104"/>
                <p>If I found in O'Connell my Leonidas, my Brutus, my Tellâany one you like who
                    shall best express the anax andrÅn of history and libertyâSheil was my
                    Demosthenes; and I used to devour his speeches as if they had been the text of a
                    new Gospel. In the smaller men, of whom our own Liberal county member was the
                    natural chief, I saw the modern representatives of the immortal Three Hundred.
                    The French Revolution was the divine birthday of European libertyâI am not far
                    from the same belief now! Lafayette, thin and respectable mediocrity that he
                    was, took, in my ardent imagination, heroic proportions and colossal merits; and
                    I undutifully rejoiced over the discomfiture of my country in the American War
                    of Independence. I believed in Greece and abjured Turkey. I adored Poland and I
                    hated Russia. Joan of Arc, the Maid of Saragossa and Charlotte Corday, were my
                    feminine ideals; but the old Judaic heroines,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7017-105"/>
                    such as Judith and Jael, were even then abhorrent, and I marvelled much how God
                    could have found them worthy.</p>
                <p>I envied the dead of all times and in all places who had known how to die for
                    Liberty; and I held the apotheosis of humanity to have been reached in Old
                    Greece and Republican Rome. I burned as with fever when I read of old-time
                    tyrannies, and shouted to the skies when they were avenged;âfor the past was as
                    the present to me, and my vivid imagination bridged the gap with the living
                    lines of sympathy. I raged dumbly, or broke out into stormy deprecation when my
                    father, as he often did, read aloud the most pungent bits of the âAnti-Jacobinâ
                    and I held Canning as no better than Judas Iscariot. All of which means that I
                    was as intolerant as the men whose intolerance I reviledâas arbitrary as the
                    tyrants who had oppressed free thought and slaughtered independent action.</p>
                <pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7017-106"/>
                <p>And I tried to indoctrinate Edwin with all this burning hatred of oppression, all
                    this admiration for the assassins of tyrants, all this sympathy with revolt
                    which filled me as with a divine afflatus. But when my proselytism was more
                    noisy and aggressive than usual, he simply shook his fair curly head with his
                    favourite little action of disdain, and told me that I was an ass for my
                    painsâfor we were a plain-spoken lot, and did not mince our terms among
                    ourselves. And when I bothered him too much he lost his patience and got
                    annoyed, telling me that I was the most unendurable nuisance and the biggest
                    idiot going, and that if I did not hold my tongue he would leave the room. Then
                    I stormed at his civic and political indifferentism, which to me was a real
                    crime; and probably tore out of doors to work off my anger and cherish may sense
                    of isolation by long lonely rambles among the mountains, where<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7017-107"/> I felt like some exile banished for the sake of
                    libertyâfriendless among men, but supported by the immortal justice of his
                    cause.</p>
                <p>It was towards the beginning of this political phase in the âSturm und Drangâ
                    period of my life that the Chartist riots were on hand. With what vague dread
                    and sympathy combined they filled me! I was quite sure that their cause was holy
                    and that their demands were just; but the thought of danger, when brought home
                    to my own people, froze the blood in my veins with horror. I might shout âThe
                    Song of the Greeksâ to wind and sky for as long as I liked, but I had no fancy
                    for seeing the beaks of our home ravens crimsoned with the precious blood of
                    friends and family! Still, if there were to be a general revolution, I used to
                    assure Edwin, I would protect them all. Of course I should join the insurgents;
                    but, if the worst came to the<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7017-108"/> worst, my
                    Brothers the Chartists for my sake would hold harmless all I loved. And they
                    would place an armed guard at our gate, who would require the password from all
                    who came near, and allow no one to enter with evil intent. And we would receive
                    into the rectory all our best friends, and I would be their saviour. For myself,
                    if the royalists won, I would not take my life at their hands at a gift.</p>
                <p>I do not think my assurance had a very tranquillizing effect on my brother or my
                    sisters, who somehow, with the illogicality of youth, made me responsible for
                    their terror. How young it all was!</p>
                <p>I shall never forget my strange emotion when, one day, we heard the guns over by
                    Carlisleâwe were then at Braeghyll, which was at the back of the mountains. We
                    were walking on the high moor which runs into the plain where Carlisle stands.
                    My father said it was the Chartists firing at and<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7017-109"/> being fired on by the soldiers; and he looked grave
                    and anxious, and did not abuse the poor fellows. His kind heart carried it over
                    his political passions, and he was sorry for the men who would have to suffer.
                    And how vividly I too realized the fact of war being within this measurable
                    distance of our home; but oh! how my blood leapt for hope that the cause of
                    Liberty would prevail! But I dared not speak. When my father was in such a mood
                    as to-day, I was awed by loving reverence into silence.</p>
                <p>About this time a party of about thirty men one day surged in at the rectory
                    gates, and came up to the house, demanding bread and money. My father chanced to
                    be from home this day; which was as well; for the men were at first inclined to
                    be blustering and rude, and my father's quick temper âflewâ at insolence as
                    quickly as the seed-vessel of the balsam flies at the touch. He<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7017-110"/> would have been kind enough to them had they been
                    respectful; but he would have braved all consequences had they been brutal. The
                    sight of my pretty sisters, however, and of us two young boys, soon soothed them
                    into a pleasant frame of mind; and when I went out boldly among them, and
                    fraternized with them, joining with them in their general abuse of all
                    aristocrats and mill-owners, and talking seditious nonsense with the best, they
                    grew quite friendly and confidential. One of them justified my former boasts by
                    assuring me, with an oath, that when their day came we should have no cause to
                    be âafeard.â The rectory should be marked with white chalk, and not a hair of
                    our heads should be harmed.</p>
                <p>âFor thy sake, my brave lad!â said the speaker, laying his hand on my shoulder
                    kindly.</p>
                <p>So the adventure passed off without more<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7017-111"/> damage
                    than that which came from a temporary domestic famine. For the men generously
                    refused to take any money from such a young, irresponsible set as we were: âNay,
                    we isn't rogues!â they said; and after their bread and cheese and beer, they
                    left us with a ringing shout, and âGod bless the parson's childer!â flung back
                    as their parting words, when they passed through the gate.</p>
                <p>Another time we got into an excited crowd as we were driving back from Carlisle.
                    There had been a mass-meeting of the mill-hands there, and they took my brother
                    Godfrey for Feargus O'Connor. They swarmed over the carriage in noisy and rather
                    inconvenient enthusiasm, insisting on shaking hands with us all; till Godfrey
                    grew angry with their familiarity to our sisters, and, knocking one drunken
                    fellow down, drove off at a smart pace. His ideas of fraternity did not include
                    grimy paws thrust into Ellen's pretty hands; and half-drunken <choice>

                <p><hi>HOW</hi> bitter-sweet life was to me in this forming-time of my character!
                    and how violent the contrast between my mental troubles and the keenness of my
                    physical enjoyments! No one who drew in the sweet breath of flowers or stood
                    against the storm-winds, glad in his youth and rejoicing in his strength,
                    enjoyed the great gift of Life more than I. And no one suffered more. My
                    recollection of all my young life is that of a tempest. I never knew rest, never
                    compassed the outermost circle of serenity. I was always either violently elated
                    or as <choice>

                    </choice><pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7017-114"/> lently miserableâalways one with the
                    gods or down among the demons who people hell. But, full of unrest and turmoil
                    as was the present, how resolved I was that the brilliancy of the future should
                    repay me with more than compound interest! Once give me my liberty, my majority,
                    and my share of the small fortune left us by our grandfather, and let me go into
                    the world for myself, and I <emph>would</emph> be happy. I always said to
                    myself: âI will not be like other men, miserable and discontented, because
                    failures and weak-kneed. When I am my own master I will be happy, because I will
                    conquer fate and compel fortune; and I will then make friends who will love and
                    understand me.â</p>
                <p>For I would be famous and do great things. I would cover my name with glory, and
                    all those who had not believed in me with confusion; and my own should be proud
                    of me. I used to dream of the senior wranglership at Cambridge and of the<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7017-115"/> leadership of the House of Commons. I would
                    go to the bar and be Lord Chancellor, or remain a free lance and be Prime
                    Minister. I would make a name; I would be great. Whatever I did I would succeed.
                    And I felt as if I could not fail.</p>
                <p>I also felt as if I could not dieâas if there were no forces in nature which
                    could destroy that strong vitality, that passionate outstretch and possession by
                    which I knew how the gods of old were framed and fashioned. Belief in
                    immortality is the correlative of strength and youth. It is only when we are old
                    and tired that eternal rest seems possible and unbroken sleep desirable.</p>
                <p>At one time I had been undecided whether I would be an artist or an author. I was
                    intensely fond of painting, and âAnch'io son pittoreâ was a phrase that had rung
                    in my ears like the sound of a golden bell. It struck a chord which has vibrated
                    ever since in the pride and joy I take in my profession,<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7017-116"/> and I well remember, the first time I walked to the â
                    office with my first commanded leader in my pocket, I said to myself aloud:
                    âAnch'io son pittore! I also am one of the leaders of public opinion and the
                    makers of modern thought.â But I was very short-sighted; and when I thoroughly
                    realized the disadvantages of this defect, I gave up the idea of being a second
                    Raffaele and stuck to that of over-topping Gibbon or Scott instead.</p>
                <p>Many things helped on this final decision. I had always had the power of âtelling
                    stories out of my own head,â and I could imagine things so vividly, I was not
                    always sure whether I had seen or only fancied that I had seen them. Fired by
                    the thrilling adventures of my beloved Godfrey, who had returned from Russia and
                    imprisonment when I was about ten years old, I had already begun a novel to be
                    called âEdith of Polandââthe idea of which had come into<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7017-117"/> my mind during a dull sermon at our parish church of
                    Shorne, when we were in Kent. And was not that a sign by which to steer? A book
                    published by the Christian Knowledge Society, and I think called âDifficulties
                    of Genius,â had greatly influenced my mind. It had given stability to my hopes,
                    and, as it were, a practicable backbone to my ambition, by the example of others
                    who, as untaught as I, had yet by their own industry and resolve risen to be the
                    shining lights of their generation. Thus directed and encouraged, after long
                    wandering round the outer circle of possibilities, I finally gravitated to the
                    centre, and chose the profession of literature as more within the range of my
                    powers than any form of plastic or pictorial art. And as the most useful
                    preparatory tools were languages, I had devoted myself to the study of tongues,
                    with this graver end more or less consciously underlying the pure delight I felt
                    in the<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7017-118"/> mere acquirement of words and the
                    ability to read what else would have been so many sealed books.</p>
                <p>It was about this time that a curious bit of hallucination came to me. It was All
                    Halloween, and we of the North still believed in spells and charms. My sisters,
                    Edwin and I were melting lead, roasting nuts and wasting eggsâwhereby the white
                    drawn up by the heat of the hand through water might determine our futureâwhen I
                    was dared to that supreme trial:âto go upstairs into my bedroom, lock the door,
                    and, with the candle set on the dressing-table, deliberately pare and eat an
                    apple, looking at myself in the glass all the while. I would in those days have
                    accepted any challenge offered meâto go into a lion's den, if need be:âthis bit
                    of fantastical bravery was easy enough! Jauntily and defiantly I bounded up the
                    stairs, locked the door, pared and began to eat my apple, with my eyes fixed<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7017-119"/> on the glass. And there, suddenly out of the
                    semi-darknessâthe eyes looking into mineâpeered a face from over my shoulder;âa
                    dark, mocking, sinister face which I could draw now as I saw it thenâhow many
                    years ago! Broad in the low, flat brow, with dark hair waved above the arched
                    eyebrowsâthe eyes deep-set, dark, and piercingâthe nose long and pointedâthe
                    thin mouth curled into a sneerâthe chin narrow, but the jaw wideâit was all so
                    vivid that I turned sharply round, saying: âWho is there?â</p>
                <p>No one was there, of course; and I spoke into a void more gruesome than that grim
                    Presence would have been.</p>
                <p>The vision did not return, and I ate my apple to the last pip steadily; but when
                    I went downstairs they all laughed and said I was as white as if I had seen a
                    ghost; and they were sure I had; and what was it like?</p>
                <pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7017-120"/>
                <p>âThe devil,â I said gruffly; on which Ellen said mildly:</p>
                <p>âUpon my word, Chris, you are more like a bear than a boy.â</p>
                <p>Long after this I had in my ears the sound of rushing wings. They were so loud
                    that I used to wake from my sleep with the noise as of large wings about my bed.
                    And with these were mingled whisperings and voices; but no intelligible words
                    ever came to me; though I made no doubt they were the same voices as those which
                    haunted Christian when passing through the Valley of the Shadow. I was studying
                    very hard at this time, and in the full swing of all my private penances and
                    eccentric self-discipline; and my nervous system was for the moment strained,
                    despite my powerful constitution.</p>
                <p>Our lives at Eden, whither we had finally returned, were not remarkable for
                    variety. There was little incidental amusement for<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7017-121"/> us, and we had to make our own pleasures in the best
                    way we could. On the whole we managed pretty well, and never knew the want of
                    artificial aids. Boating in summer; skating in winter; riding; long mountain
                    rambles and more distant excursions; picnics in the daytime and âtea-partiesâ in
                    the evening, helped to make our young existence glad and to redeem the monotony
                    of the hours. And as time went on, and the new influx of life and motion through
                    railroads and the penny post stirred even our stagnant little stretch of
                    backwater, we became more like the rest of the world. But we lost in
                    individuality what we gained in catholicity. No longer great ladies, like the
                    Duchess of St. Albans, travelling post with multiplied precautions, sent up a
                    message, which was a command, requesting my father to go down and spend the
                    evening with them at the hotel. This was to do honour to the cloth, while <choice>

                    hours after dinner.</p>
                <p>No longer distinguished strangers from afar, unendorsed, came among us as
                    superior beings to whom the whole community was cap-in-hand. On the contrary, we
                    were taken up by men of authentic name and acknowledged light and leading, and
                    we became vastly more critical and less credulous than we had been. Knit up into
                    closer communion with the larger world outsideâfor we had now daily coaches and
                    a railway-station not more than twenty miles awayâwe were less the countrified
                    âhoodie-crowsâ we had been; and Eden became one of the favourite show-places of
                    the kingdom, and as luxurious and polished as the rest.</p>
                <p>The most important to us of the âstrangers,â as the summer visitors were
                    generally called, were the reading-partiesâthe collegiansâwho came down for
                        the<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7017-123"/> Long, sometimes to vagabondize and get
                    into mischief, and set the place in a flame by reason of their rowdyismâ<choice>

                    street on Sunday, when the decent folk were coming home from morning churchâand
                    sometimes to read hard and walk mightily, according to their traditional
                    intention. We used to get acquainted with them through the tutors, who generally
                    managed to know my father; and we found them delightful variations to the main
                    theme of our existence. My sisters had their love-affairs which began with roses
                    and ended with thorns; and we boys had a glimpse of other lines of thought which
                    did us infinite good. But the circumstances which most influenced my own life at
                    this time were the creation of a new ecclesiastical district taken off the old
                    parish and the strange influence which certain books and stories had over my
                    thoughts.</p>
                <pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7017-124"/>
                <p>The incumbent of this new district of St. Mark's, Henry Grahame, was a man of
                    wide cultivation of mind and great sweetness of manner. He was essentially a
                    Coleridgean, able to reconcile Faith with Reason by the higher way of the
                    Understanding, just as now certain of the Broad Church reconcile Genesis and
                    Darwin by the elastic theory of Development. He was a âmade,â as opposed to an
                    instinctive and natural man; one who held art to be superior to nature, and the
                    intellect a greater thing than emotion. Of the ancients, Platoâof the moderns,
                    Goethe and Coleridgeâwere his âdii majores;â and the schools of Sappho and
                    Pindar, Schiller and Byron, he abhorred. My first introduction to Coleridge was
                    through him, and he made me also read Wordsworth and Carlyle. For himself, he
                    was eminently eclectic. What he could not receiveâas, for instance, following
                    his friend and teacher, Maurice, the doctrine of eternal<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7017-125"/> punishment and the personality of the devilâhe
                    rejected as mistranslations of meaning and the misdirection of mediÃ¦val
                    ignorance. Other doctrinal difficulties he accepted, as I said, by that
                    Understanding which Coleridge makes our spiritual Universal Expositor.</p>
                <p>Satisfied as he was with his own interpretation, it was perhaps natural that he
                    should be intolerant to the mistakes of others. He was serenely confident that
                    he knew. Those who differed from him were therefore ignorant. And ignorance is
                    not a state that demands respectâpity, if you will, and enlightenment, but not
                    respect. Thus, those whom he undertook to teach were bound to be humble and
                    obedient, as their first step towards true knowledge. They must accept without
                    cavil such dogmas as he offered them. He who knew, and they who were dark and
                    denseâwhat else could be demanded but <choice>

                    them the living truth?</p>
                <p>Liberal as he was, in reference to the ecclesiastical section to which he
                    belonged, Henry Grahame was like all other unscientific men who believe in
                    spiritual enlightenment, void of proof. Personal conviction stood with him for
                    so much tangible and ponderable reality; and that mental state to which he had
                    attained was therefore the absolute norm for others. He could not tolerate
                    divergence; for all divergence meant to him error, and error was Apollyon.
                    Humane, gentle, loving by temperament, this consciousness of culture superior to
                    the mass, and of the secure possession of Truth, made him intellectually both
                    exclusive and scornful. He was a moral Brahmin who drew away his skirts from the
                    Pariah. He despised the common run of men and minds, and looked on the majority
                    as his inferiors, thinking humanity but a poor job at the<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7017-127"/> best. To be sure, Christ had died for men of all
                    degreesâthe Gurths and Wambas as well as the Platos and Aristotles of the
                    Christian world; but Henry Grahame put aside the inferential respect which it
                    would seem but consistent for Christians to have for the creatures who once
                    produced their God; and, standing on the heights of his own intellectual Pisgah,
                    judged calmly, but condemned inexorably, all who were inferior to or different
                    from himself. He reverenced only culture, and despised ignorance as much as he
                    shrank from vice and ugliness.</p>
                <p>His wife was a woman of like mind to himself; but also, sweet and good as she
                    was, with a little more artificial stillness of manner, and a little more
                    conscious effort after grace. She had been born and bred a Unitarian, but had
                    now come into the Church; and the effects of her early training, in its chilly
                    Ã¦stheticism and self-subdued purity, still clung to her. Both showed that<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7017-128"/> they felt themselves here, among us
                    unawakened and unÃ¦sthetic creatures, like Crishnas among the cowherds. They were
                    of another order of intelligence, another school of thought altogether; and
                    their sense of mental isolation was manifest.</p>
                <p>They did not like my father, nor did he like them. They found him arid,
                    unenlightened, fossilizedâa leafless stick in a stagnant pool. He found them
                    unsound, fanciful, unrealâpainted sparrows passing for birds of price. There was
                    very little intercourse between them and him; and soon the new incumbency became
                    as completely differentiated from the old parish, as is the frog from the
                    tadpole. Thoughts, doctrines, modes and hours of conducting the service, all
                    were different; and though St. Mark's created no schism among us, it made a
                    complete division between the old and the new. Meanwhile both Mr. and Mrs.
                    Grahame were very kind to us young<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7017-129"/> people; and
                    especially so to me, whose turbulent nature and now troubled thoughts they set
                    themselves to calm and guide.</p>
                <p>They also introduced us to some notable people. I remember once meeting Mr. Carus
                    at their house, and how frankly shocked I was by the joyous, buoyant tone and
                    manner with which he announced that he had just left the death-bed of his
                    dearest friend.</p>
                <p>âI was so glad to know that he was with Jesus! It was one of the happiest days of
                    my life to feel that he was safe in the arms of the Saviour!â he said, a smile
                    of supreme satisfaction beaming over his face.</p>
                <p>I was too instinctive to understand this queer pleasure, which seemed to me both
                    false and strained; and I felt a disgust for the man I never got over.</p>
                <p>Another notability met at the parsonage was Whewell. This was when my faith had
                    begun to fall away at the base; and<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7017-130"/> I see
                    still the satirical smile with which he accompanied this coda of a long speech
                    setting forth the necessity of faith in the unprovable:</p>
                <p>ââSceptic and septicâ âthere is only the difference of one letter between
                    them.â</p>
                <p>Also I saw Carlyle, at the house of our dear local chieftain, spoken of before. I
                    had then begun a classical romanceâmy most important book; for I am antedating
                    in these fragmentary recollections; and Carlyle thundered in his deep bass
                    against the foolishness of going back on the past and writing about trouserless
                    heathens, when so much work was lying to be done in the present for honest
                    Christiansâand how young fellows who maundered about bull-god Apis, or Pericles
                    and his Impropriety-Aspasia, had better be set to break stones by the
                    road-sideâwhich at least was useful for the mending of the highway we all had to
                    travel on.</p>
                <pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7017-131"/>
                <p>Another of my almost friends at this time was poor Hartley Coleridge. I say
                    mineâfor all that I was but a unit, a fraction, in the family sumâbecause he
                    distinguished me from among the others with special attention, and talked to me
                    more than to the rest. He had the habit of gathering piles of books under his
                    arms, walking about the room while he declaimed on all things under heaven, or
                    read aloud as he went. His reading was charming. He had the Coleridgean
                    sweetness and rotundity of voice, and read with perfect graceânot too
                    theatrically, and without affectation; in both of which snares his brother
                    Derwent ran his feet and trippedâbut with just enough artificiality to make it
                    art, and lift it from commonplace into beauty.</p>
                <p>Because of his besetting sin he could never be kept long on a visit anywhere; and
                    his comings and goings were therefore always cometic and unsatisfactory. But
                        I<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7017-132"/> like to remember him and to picture him
                    at his best, and as he always was whenever I saw him; for I loved him with a
                    strange pride in his special notice of me and his evident affection for me,
                    unformed, uncouth hobbledehoy as I was then. He and the Grahames were the first
                    persons who distinguished me by their special attention, and who thus brought a
                    certain sense of light and companionship into the dim and lonely chamber in
                    which my soul had hitherto lived.</p>
                <p>Now I must go back to the main thread of my story, and to the troubled perplexity
                    of my thoughts.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                <p><hi>I WILL</hi> give, so far as I can, the genesis of my first change in
                    speculative thought.</p>
                <p>Undirected in my studies and unhelped in my thoughts, I read where I listed and
                    came to such conclusions as seemed good to me. In the superstitious and
                    pre-scientific period of life, when marvels are accepted as of the established
                    order of things, I was inclined to the mysterious and the weird at all four
                    corners of my being. Thus, I believed in magic of a stately and learned kind; in
                    alchemy and astrology; in the Rosicrucians and second-sight; in fortune-<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7017-134"/> telling, magic crystals, and the Egyptian
                    boy's power of seeing the past and future in a few drops of ink held in the
                    hollow of the hand; in mesmerism, ghosts and spiritual visitations generally;
                    but by some good luck of latent common-sense I did not believe in vulgar
                    witchcraft, though I did in the Witch of Endor. But then, she was not vulgar;
                    and she was in the Bible. The supernatural powers of such men as Cornelius
                    Agrippa and Albertus Magnus I took to be undeniable. The charmed circle
                    surrounded by smoke wherein the demons appeared to (I think) Benvenuto Cellini,
                    was a fact; and I had no doubt but that Surrey did see Geraldine in the magic
                    mirror. The Indian jugglers, of whom my eldest sister sent home such thrilling
                    accounts, were evidently mighty magicians; and he who had the courage could, if
                    he would, conjure up the devil even to this day. I remember how greedily I
                        devoured,<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7017-135"/> and half-ashamedly,
                    half-defiantly, believed in the notes to Sir Walter Scott's works, telling of
                    the wonders that had been. Gilpin Horner the goblin, crying: âTint, tint!â and
                    Thomas of Ercildoune, who lived with the fairy queen and was sent for by her
                    again when his time had come; the âBook of Mightâ and its strange glamour; the
                    magic potency of that shadowy Virgilius whom I could never reconcile with the
                    more solid humanity of the Virgil who wrote the âEclogues;â the egg on which
                    Naples is built; the naked child running three times round the barrel; the
                    Mauthe Doog; Sir Kenelm Digby's sympathetic ointment; the Irish banshee and the
                    Scottish seerâall were cherished faiths with me; while the historical mysteries
                    of the Vehmgericht and the secret worship of Bafomet seemed to put a backbone
                    into the more purely imaginary qualities of the rest.</p>
                <pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7017-136"/>
                <p>Other things of an unprovable nature also troubled my imagination. I was
                    intensely fond of mythology, in which I saw neither the sun nor the dawn, nor
                    yet the ark, but simply the divine and the human.</p>
                <p>How dear that little idyl of Philemon and Baucis was to me! Its simplicity and
                    realism made it almost Scriptural; and though I did not dare to bracket it with
                    the visit of those three divine beings to Abraham and Sara, still, I thought the
                    one account as true as the other. No poem ever written equalled in my eyes the
                    loveliness of that sweet picture where Endymion lies asleep on the heights of
                    Mount Ida, and the virgin goddess leans over him lovingly; and the majesty of
                    Minerva was equalled only by the beauty of Apollo. Aurora and her dappled steeds
                    surrounded by the Hours casting flowers as they fly; rash Icarus and rasher
                    Phaethon; the deluge of Deucalion<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7017-137"/> and the
                    dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowedâthey were all products of the border-land
                    lying between romance and reality, and I was never quite sure of the line of
                    division.</p>
                <p>The stories also of the Greek maidens who met the Gods among the reeds, in the
                    court of the temple, in the woods, gave me cause for much crude speculation.
                    Like our own sacred mystery of how the Sons of God came down and loved the
                    daughters of men, they woke up in me incessant wonder at the difference between
                    those old times and the present day, and made me ask myself: âWhere are the Sons
                    of God now?â and with more faith than critical faculty: âWhy should not be again
                    that which his already been?â I remember when I first read Byron's âHeaven and
                    Earth,â how the characters of Anah and Aholibamah, and the superhuman yet
                    manlike beauty of Samiasa and Azaziel struck me with living<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7017-138"/> force, and coloured my dreams for many nights. But
                    the story which impressed me most was that wild and weird account of
                    Gilli-Doir-Magrevollich, the Black Child, Son to the Bones, found in the notes
                    to the âLady of the Lake.â</p>
                <p>I cannot say why this strange unwholesome legend took such hold of me. Perhaps
                    because it was unwholesome. I could not shake myself clear from it; and I had a
                    haunting kind of prevision that more hung on it than its own superstitious
                    fancy. I had just heard, too, of Joanna Southcote; and altogether my mind was,
                    as it were, fascinated by this subject of virgin birthsâtheir possibility now as
                    their certainty in times pastâand by the whole range, indeed, of divine
                    interposition in the works and ways of manâwhether it were in the assumption of
                    the human form or in the gift of prophetic insight, or inversely in the<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7017-139"/> darker mysteries of magic and the power of
                    conjuring up the devil. This was a different thing from belief in spiritual
                    communion. It was what one may call the materialistic form of
                    supernaturalismâbelief in which belongs to all unscientific and uncultured
                    minds, and the abandonment of which is the first step outward towards
                    enlightenment.</p>
                <p>One early summer's day, I was sitting where I had no business to be, under the
                    hedge of the as yet unmown hayfield at the foot of the garden. I had taken with
                    me to read in quietness, Ovid's âMetamorphoses.â If my father had seen it in my
                    hands he would have forbidden it to me; which was why I went where I was not
                    likely to be found even if looked for. I was digging away at the myth of Nisus
                    and Scylla, and the purple lock wherein the old king's strength lay, when, for
                    the first time, I was struck by the likeness of this story to that<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7017-140"/> of Samson and Delilah. Hitherto all the Bible stories
                    had been on a raised platform apart, and there was no analogy with them to be
                    found elsewhere. I knew my Ovid pretty well by now; and immediately, on the
                    discovery of this point of resemblance, there flashed across me also the
                    likeness between the story of Myrrha and that of Lot's daughtersâof Iphigenia
                    and Isaac for the one part, in the substitution of a doe for the one, of a ram
                    for the other; and of Iphigenia and Jephthah's daughter for the other, where the
                    human element is alone retained. With this my mind went off on the now familiar
                    track of the virgin births, when suddenlyâin that strangely rapid and vivid
                    manner in which such things come to me, as if it were really the quick opening
                    of a closed door and the headlong rush into a newly-furnished and
                    brilliantly-lighted chamberâthere shot through my brain these words which<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7017-141"/> seemed to run along the page in a line of
                    light: âWhat difference is there between any of these stories and those like to
                    them in the Bible?âbetween the loves of the Sons of God for the daughters of
                    men, and those of the gods of Greece for the girls of Athens and Sparta?âbetween
                    the women made mothers by mysterious influences, and those made mothers by
                    divine favour?âbetween the legends of old times and the stories of Sara, Hannah,
                    Elizabeth,âand the Virgin Mary?<corr>â</corr></p>
                <p>When this last name came, a terrible faintness took hold of me. The perspiration
                    streamed over my face like rain, and I trembled like a frightened horse. My
                    heart, which for a few seconds had beaten like a hammer, now seemed to cease
                    altogether. The light grew dim; the earth was vapoury and unstable; and,
                    overpowered by an awful dread, I fell back among the long grass where I was
                    sitting as if I had been struck<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7017-142"/> down by at
                    unseen hand. But this physical faintness soon passed, and my mind went on
                    following the line of thought I had begun, as if I were talking aloud to some
                    one at hand.</p>
                <p>âNo one at the time knew anything about the miraculous conception of Mary's
                    child. Joseph himself was only warned in a dream not to doubt her, for that she
                    was with child by the Holy Ghost, as announced to her by the Angel Gabriel. Does
                    any one know more now than was known then? If this Christian marvel is true, why
                    not all the rest? Why should we say that Mary alone spoke the truth and that
                    every one else has lied? But spirits do not come to women; there were no such
                    beings as those old gods who were said to have come down from Olympus to mingle
                    in the affairs of mortals; that passage in Genesis about the Sons of God is a
                    mystery we cannot fathom. And we know that there is such<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7017-143"/> a being as the Angel Gabrielâsuch a Divine person as
                    the Holy Ghost. Do we know this? Have we more certainty than had the old Greeks
                    when they believed in the power of Jupiter and the divine manhood of Apollo, and
                    in the celestial origin of those fatherless sons brought into the world by
                    maiden mothers, who swore to their womanly innocence for the one part and their
                    human exaltation by divine favour for the other? Surely yes! The Miraculous
                    Incarnation has been affirmed by all the churches; and the proofs areâthe star
                    which guided the Magi, and the song of the angels in the sky to the shepherds
                    watching their flocks. But who can certify to these proofs? Why did not others
                    see that star as well as the Magi?âand who knows whether the shepherds heard the
                    song, or only imagined it?â</p>
                <p>These thoughts clung to and left me no peace night nor day. Ever and ever the
                    Mystery of the Incarnation became more and<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7017-144"/>
                    more a subject of perplexity and doubt, and of dread lest that doubt should
                    broaden into denial. Brought into line with these legends of former
                    timesâcontrasted with the old classic myths and the stories in the very Bible
                    itselfâit suddenly seemed to lose its special character and to be merely one
                    like others. It was no longer exceptional and divineâit had become historic and
                    human. Therefore, it fell within the range of criticism and might be judged of
                    according to its merits and the weight of evidence at its back. What was that
                    weight? Outside its own assertionâabsolutely nil. No contemporaneous testimony
                    vouched for the story of the Virgin Birthâfor the Annunciation of the Angel
                    Gabrielâfor the Star or the Song; and Mary herself alone knew the truth of
                    things. All therefore rested on her word only. Sweet, beautiful and pure as was
                    her personalityâGodlike as was that Christ she boreâwas that word of more<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7017-145"/> intrinsic value than that of the Greek girl
                    who told how she had met the god in the reeds by the river side?âor than that of
                    the nameless mother of the Black Child, Son to the Bones, denying human
                    knowledge and accusing the unseen? Was it? Had there been more miraculous births
                    than one?âor no miraculous birth at all, and the laws of nature interrupted for
                    no oneâfor one no more than for another?</p>
                <p>While my mind was torn and tossed by these terrible questions, I was one night
                    looking at the stars from my bedroom-window, wondering at the mystery and glory
                    of creation and speculating on our relations with the universeâwhen again in
                    that same sudden way these words came to me as distinctly as if I were reading
                    them in a printed page:</p>
                <p>âHas God in very truth ever become man? We, the inhabitants of only one out of
                    such countless millions of worldsâour world of<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7017-146"/>
                    a lower order of cosmic splendour than so many, and ourselves of conscious
                    mental deficiencyâwhy were we singled out for such a transcendent act of mercy?
                    Why should God have cared so much for us, vile and troublesome as we have always
                    been? Was it true? Has the great Incommunicable First Cause ever clothed Himself
                    with fleshâborn, living, suffering, dying as a mortal man, and all the time very
                    God?â</p>
                <p>Then, as vividly as if I had seen Him in the body and spoken with Him face to
                    face, I saw Christ as a peasant translated to our own time. I realized the
                    minutest circumstances of His humanity; when a loud voice, like the rushing
                    wind, seemed to echo from earth to skyâto fill all space and to command all
                    time, till I was conscious of nothing but these words: âManânot God; manânot
                    God!â</p>
                <p>The voice was so loud, the words were so clear, I wondered the whole house did
                        not<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7017-147"/> wake to listen. And how bright the
                    stars were! Each star grew to be like a sun which changed the darkness of the
                    night to almost overpowering glory; and I seemed to hear the weaving of the
                    great web and to understand the complexity, but the unity, the universality, the
                    rush and pressure and stream of lifeâeverywhere life, even as here!</p>
                <p>Why did they not all hear and see as I did? But no one moved. I turned to look at
                    Edwin. He was tranquilly asleep in bed at the other end of the roomâa beautiful
                    child rather than a youth of nineteenâinnocent, troubled by spiritual doubts no
                    more than his favourite cat which was curled up on the pillow beside him, and
                    desiring to learn no more of the great mysteries than he had been taught in his
                    childhood. No! he saw and heard nothing. The voice and the glory and the great
                    weaving of the web of life did not exist<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7017-148"/> for
                    him. It was only I who heard and saw and knew.</p>
                <p>But now, coming up from the study, over which our bedroom immediately was, my
                    father's voice broke out in prayer; of which I heard these words: âO Thou, who
                    came into the world to save sinners, have mercy on me!â</p>
                <p>Then all my exaltation passed, and I was once more alone in the dimness of the
                    starry nightâalone, in the dark, and ignorant.</p>
                <p>I flung myself on my knees and asked pardon of Him whom I had crucified afresh by
                    my doubtsâlonging only to die and to have done with all this ignoranceâlonging
                    to die, that I might then Know and sin no more.</p>
                <p>The light under the door betrayed me. My father, passing along the passage, saw
                    it and came inâto find me in this state of spiritual anguish and contrition.</p>
                <pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7017-149"/>
                <p>When he asked why I was not in bed? and what ailed me? I could not confess to
                    him. I knew of old how unsympathetic he was with this part of my life; and my
                    wound was too sacred to lay bare to eyes which could not understand and would
                    probably rasp it afresh.</p>
                <p>My silence, which looked like sullenness, angered him.</p>
                <p>âWhy was I ever cursed with such a son!â he said vehemently. âLook at your
                    brother thereâwhy cannot you be like himâa reasonable creature who gives no
                    trouble to anyone? Why are you so foolish, so irritating? Not Job himself could
                    have patience with you, Christopher!â</p>
                <p>He went up to Edwin's bed, leaned over him and kissed him fondly; and my brother,
                    roused by the light and the action, opened his eyes and smiled, putting up his
                    hand to our father's face with the caressing gesture of a child.</p>
                <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7017-150"/>
                <p>I was too much moved to resent or defy, as I should have done in my ordinary
                    mood. I only longed to receive the same love as that which was given to
                    othersâto be includedâto be taken out of the solitude and banishment in which I
                    lived.</p>
                <p>âKiss me, too!â I said, holding out my hands. âFather, dear! kiss me too!â</p>
                <p>âNo,â he said coldly; âI cannot kiss you, for I neither believe in you nor
                    respect you.â</p>
                <p>So there it was again!âthe old bitter contrastâEsau and Jacob; Ishmael and Isaac;
                    Cain and Abel; and the poor goat, laden with sins, sent into the wilderness,
                    while the sheep fed about the Master's feet and the lambs were carried in His
                    bosom!</p>
                <p>For all this I could not stop my thoughts. They came as of their own will, and I
                    was forced to listen to them.</p>
                <p>Bracketed with the more human difficulty<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7017-151"/> of the
                    Divine Incarnation came one yet more mysterious. Christ, to whom we pray under
                    the name and form of; and as actuated to pity by His experience as, a manâwas He
                    always Jesus Christâthe Divine Man from all eternity? Was then the Godhead
                    always tripartite? The Jews were taught the unity of the Divine Essence in the
                    one supreme Jehovah, and knew nothing of this division. When did it come
                    about?âwhen Mary conceived? Did that which had been from the beginning take a
                    new form at a moment of time?âand was heaven, in point of fact, acted on by
                    earth, and God determined by humanity? If not, why then was Christ hidden so
                    long behind the overwhelming personality of the Father?âHis very name and being
                    concealed until He had taken the form of man? Was He powerless till then? and
                    did God, the great Spirit, need to become flesh before He could save flesh? Was
                    the Athanasian<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7017-152"/> Creed wrong, and were the
                    Persons unequal?</p>
                <p>Again, was the grace which lies in Christ Jesus, the crucified Saviour, dormant
                    for all these countless generations? But why? Why should not the world have been
                    redeemed before? There was no manifest historic reason why that special moment
                    should have been chosen; and for the worth of the men savedâsurely Plato and
                    Aristotle, Socrates and Aristides, Buddha, Confucius, Marcus Aureliusâand how
                    many more!âwere as worthy of redemption from the eternal doom meted out to
                    ignorance as those nameless lepers and minor disciples who had neither
                    commanding intellect nor enduring influence!</p>
                <p>I carried my troubles to Mr. Grahame, and he set himself to resolve them. He took
                    the last first, but refused to admit that this was a subject which fell within
                    the range of discussion.</p>
                <pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7017-153"/>
                <p>âThe reason for that moment When is hidden with Christ in God. Why, Wherefore,
                    How, and the need which God in Christ has of the love of man, are of the
                    mysteries whereof no man knoweth,â he said reverently âIt is a waste of time,
                    and the encouragement of spiritual presumption, to speculate on them.â</p>
                <p>âWould you have said that to a Greek wanting to know why Chronos devoured his own
                    children?â I asked.</p>
                <p>âThe cases are not parallel,â he answered.</p>
                <p>âParallel in so far that we are the children of God, and He let us be lost for
                    all eternity because He delayed His salvation,â I answered. âThe only difference
                    is that which lies between the active and the passive.â</p>
                <p>âThings which are beyond reason are beyond dialectics,â he returned. âWe have to
                    deal with completed facts, not with energizing causes nor yet with reasons why.
                        The<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7017-154"/> fact of the Miraculous Conception is
                    all that concerns us.â</p>
                <p>âHow do we know that it is a fact?â I asked; and again went over my roll-call of
                    analogies.</p>
                <p>âTo compare the Divine Child and His Mother to the absurd legends of a rude
                    people in a rude age, when the most monstrous myths were accepted without
                    examination, and the laws neither of nature nor of evidence were understood, or
                    to the patent falsehoods of a few unfortunate girls!â said Mr. Grahame with
                    gentle contempt. âHave you so little sense of proportionâbeautyâverisimilitude?
                    But we need not go farther on this line. It pains and revolts me. So far then, I
                    take it that the ground is clear. The Mystery of the Trinity is beyond our
                    comprehension; the virgin mothers of men are myths; but the Incarnation of the
                    Divine in Jesus of Nazareth stands four-square to all the winds of doctrine. It
                        is<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7017-155"/> the one Great Fact on which humanity
                    can rely and by which it is saved.â</p>
                <p>âWhy this more than those others?â I asked. âTo assert is not to proveâis it?â I
                    added hurriedly, a little frightened by my own audacity in standing up against
                    one so infinitely my superior.</p>
                <p>He was sweet and gentle and mild.</p>
                <p>âBy its own internal evidence,â he said. âI disregard the external, about which
                    you trouble yourself so much, and take my stand on the character and life of
                    Christ alone; and on the results of Christianity in history. We want nothing
                    more to prove the divine origin of our faith. Such a being as Jesus of Nazareth
                    must have been divine, seeing how far He was beyond humanity, both in His life
                    and teaching. And the work which Christianity has done in the world could only
                    have come through a God-given revelation. I ask you to look at nothing else but
                    the life of our Lord,<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7017-156"/> and the influence of
                    Christianity on society.â</p>
                <p>âYet Buddha's life was pure and holy, and Mohammed redeemed the Arabs from gross
                    idolatry to the spiritual worship of the One God,â I said.</p>
                <p>âAnd Buddha and Mohammed were both divinely inspired and divinely led,â was his
                    reply. âRivers are fed by many streams, and the river of righteousness with the
                    rest. Buddha, Mohammed, Luther, Cromwell, Savonarola, Galileo, Newtonâall the
                    great men who have taught great truths of any kind, have had their portion of
                    inspiration, the perfect fulness of which is found only in our Lord. The
                    instruments of God are manyâthe melody from each is the sameâand the Hand which
                    masters all is the Only One. Study the character of Christ. Trace the influence
                    of His teaching on the morality, the history, of mankind, and then you will
                    realize for yourself the<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7017-157"/> Divinity which needs
                    no circumstantial evidence to substantiate it.â</p>
                <p>This argument did not satisfy me for long. At first I thought I had found in its
                    deeper insight and wider outlines the resolution of all my difficulties and a
                    sure harbour of glad refuge. But after a time I slipped back into my painful
                    groove of doubt, and, with doubt, of despair.</p>
                <p>There were certain things in the character and doings of Christâbeautiful as was
                    the one, benign and loving as were the othersâwhich seemed to me simply and
                    purely human: as, His wholesale denunciations of the Pharisees and Sadducees;
                    His cursing the fig-tree for its natural and normal barrenness; His sending the
                    devils into a herd of swine, so that the innocent brutes were all drowned, while
                    the devils were presumably not damaged, being of the nature of immortal spirits;
                    and a few more of those elementary difficulties over which all<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7017-158"/> inquirers stumble. And as for the effects of
                    Christianity on societyâdivorced from civilization, surely these have been more
                    disastrous than beneficent! Religious zeal has only added another and still more
                    pungent ingredient to the fierce compound of the natural man, by adding
                    fanaticism to cruelty. It has made of a peaceful paradise a reeking hell in
                    South America; devastated the Low Countries; set Catholics to shoot down
                    Huguenots, Episcopalians to massacre Covenanters, and all dominant sects to
                    destroy all nascent ones; it has deluged the earth with blood wherever the Cross
                    has been raised and the Beatitudes have been preached in the name of the Prince
                    of Peace and the God of Love.</p>
                <p>And then the popes and bishops, the cardinals and abbots, the Roderick Borgias
                    and Balfours of Burleyâmen who have wallowed in sensuality or waded through
                    bloodâwhere was the Sign of the Lamb on<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7017-159"/> them?
                    Were popes like Hildebrand and Innocent III. true Vicars of Christ? Was Thomas Ã 
                    Becket or was Wolsey a fit successor to the sweet St. John or the humble-minded
                    St. Andrew? And was our own prelatic Church, with its worldly wealth, political
                    influence and social dignity, the same Church as that which the Twelve Apostles
                    planted when they went forth without scrip or purse to preach the poverty they
                    practised? âLe grand sansculotte!â Was my grandfather, the Bishop, a Christian
                    after the Archetype? Indeed, were any of us who lived daintily and fared
                    sumptuously, while our brothers wept and starved, Christians such as Christ
                    would own?</p>
                <p>I said all this in my headlong way, vehement in manner, crude in method. And to
                    Mr. Grahame I must have seemed as unphilosophic as the chalk scrawl on a
                    barn-door would have been inartistic to Etty or Maclise. I had no logical
                    method; no reserve force;<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7017-160"/> no critical
                    discrimination of values. I flung my bricks on the ground without order or
                    constructive endeavour, unskilfully, rudely, where he pieced his mosaic bit by

                <p>Still, he was very kind to me, and let me talk myself out; sitting with his eyes
                    half-closed, his white hands touching each other by the finger-tips, and a
                    serene smile just lighting the curved corner of his bland mouth; while I,
                    heated, excited, my rough hair tossed and tumbled, my lank face crimson with
                    emotion, stood before him pouring out my fiery thoughts like lava that scorches
                    as it flows.</p>
                <p>Yes, he was very kind. For a fastidious scholar as he was, to whom method was as
                    valuable as matter; for a philosopher who had overcome all dialectic
                    difficulties and supplemented the darkness of Reason by the light of
                    Understanding; for a <choice>

                    God, and could map out, as it were a chart, the whole plan and order of divine
                    dealing with man through Christ and the Church; for an intellectual master where
                    I was but a hodman, he was marvellously patient. It fills me with wonder now,
                    when I remember how long-suffering he was, as I can measure the provocation I
                    must have given him both by my want of scholarly finish and by my
                    intractability. For neither his eclecticism, urging me to put aside as
                    non-essential all those points which troubled me, nor Maurice's books which he
                    lent me, removed the doubts by which I was harassed. And the internal evidence
                    on which he dwelt so much was no more convincing than the external.</p>
                <p>And now another thought came to me. Like the running loops of a chain, whereof
                    the first has broken, my doubts were multiplying and these unanswerable
                        questions<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7017-162"/> were increasing. This was my new
                    difficulty: If Christ were Godâthat is, Omniscient as well as Omnipotentâwhy did
                    He not teach things that could be tested by man and proved by experiment, rather
                    than those which are assertions only? Why, for instance, instead of telling us
                    about Lazarus in heaven, leaning on Abraham's bosom and separated by a great
                    gulf from Dives in hell, did He not give us a form of political government
                    whereby men might have been made happy, with equal justice to all? Why did He
                    not tell us that the earth is not the centre of our system, and that our system
                    itself is not the all-important part of creation we have imagined it to be?
                    Galileo would not then have been subjected to the Inquisition, and Giordano
                    Bruno would not have been burned. Why did He not tell us about electricity and
                    steam; and reveal the law of gravitation and that of optics and of<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7017-163"/> dynamics; and show us at least the way to the great
                    chemical discoveries that have since been made? How many crimes would have been
                    prevented, and how many falsehoods would never have been believed, if He
                    had!</p>
                <p>To say that man has to find these things out for himself, and that to reveal
                    would be to destroy endeavour, seemed to me but a weak argument. For, at the
                    best, only one man finds out, while all the worldâafter they have persecuted him
                    and perhaps put him to death as a blasphemerâquietly accept his discovery
                    without any endeavour at all. And was it worth while to leave the whole human
                    race in ignorance, that Copernicus should centralize the sun or Newton formulate
                    the law of gravitation, when Christ could have done both? Surely, in view of a
                    Divine Teacher who might have told us in one moment of time what it has taken so
                    many generations to learn, the argument for the necessity of<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7017-164"/> searchâwhich only means isolated teachers and delayed
                    discoveriesâis an excuse rather than an argument! And, on the plea of help to
                    the race to be savedâis not intellectual truth as necessary for the
                    right-mindedness of a man as the spiritual is for the salvation of his soul?</p>
                <p>I said all this to Mr. Grahameâeach question a doubtâbut his answer was:</p>
                <p>âAll this is immaterial. Christ came to teach us only spiritual truth; His
                    kingdom is not of this world.â</p>
                <p>And I was to him as dense-witted as a buffalo, when I answered as before:</p>
                <p>âBut the spiritual life is not divorced from the intellectual. The crimes
                    committed by superstition and ignoranceâwitness the crime of witchcraftâmight
                    have been prevented by a little timely enlightenment. Would not that have been
                    more to our good than telling us about the turning of the moon into blood, and
                    the falling of<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7017-165"/> the stars from the sky? Yet the
                    very Apostles themselves believed in witchcraft, and their words gave an impetus
                    to the terrible persecution which disgraced our humanity and only proved our
                    hideous ignorance.â</p>
                <p>I did not say this with irreverence. It was simply because the present and
                    material good of man seemed to me more important than something to happen in the
                    far-off, undated future. And also because I was beginning to think that the
                    Teacher was not divinely omniscient, and knew no more than His epoch.</p>
                <p>One day the fragmentary benevolence of the miracle of healing wrought on the
                    blind man suddenly struck me with a sense of incompleteness and partialityâand
                    therefore not as divine, but purely human. By my reading I knew that ophthalmia
                    is, and always has been, one of the physical curses of the East; and: âSurely,â
                    I thought, âit would<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7017-166"/> have been more like the
                    act of an impartially benevolent Deity, had Christ taught how this evil might
                    have been removed for all time, rather than simply opening the eyes of this one
                    man. Why did He cure only that one? To set forth His power by a miracle, and
                    thus compel the halting faith of those who would not receive Him? Would not a
                    universal remedy have done that as well as this one event only, besides
                    benefiting the whole human race?â</p>
                <p>Reminded that I, a young creature with a finite intellectâand even what I had of
                    intelligence neither well-trained nor well-developedâhad no right to question
                    the modus operandi of Divinity, I could only answer by my one cuckoo-note of
                    evidence:</p>
                <p>âThis modus operandi has been manifested to us by human media. We therefore have
                    the right to examine into the credentials of these mediaâand part of these
                        credentials<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7017-167"/> lies in the moral harmony of
                    the account. If things are said of God which shock our own conceptions of
                    justice and generosity, we are not blasphemous in refusing to believe that they
                    are true.â</p>
                <p>Reminded again that some of the greatest minds and acutest intellects have
                    believed implicitly both the Old Testament and the New, I answered, as others
                    have answered before me:</p>
                <p>âWhat men have believed is no measure of external truth, however great the
                    individual intellect. Plato and Socrates believed in the Gods of Olympusâwould
                    you support yourself on their authority?â</p>
                <p>âIn the confession of the Divine Life within man?âYes,â he said.</p>
                <p>âNo; in the special manifestation,â I answered; âin the then mystery of the armed
                    Minerva springing from the head of her father, Joveâin the unborn Bacchus
                    carried about in the great God's thigh.â</p>
                <pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7017-168"/>
                <p>âYour parallels, my dear boy, never run on all fours,â said Mr. Grahame
                    mildly.</p>
                <p>âWhy not these manifestations of divine power as well as our own?â I asked.</p>
                <p>âThe world has settled that long ago,â he answered.</p>
                <p>âSo perhaps, the world of the future will settle our questions,â I said. âIn
                    their day the doubters of Jupiter and Bacchus and the whole hierarchy of Mount
                    Olympus were held as infidels and treated as criminals.â</p>
                <p>âAnd justly; if they had no better faith to put in the place of the old!â he
                    flashed out quickly.</p>
                <p>âWe must destroy before we can rebuild,â I said.</p>
                <p>âMeanwhile the unhoused souls starve,â was his reply. âMan must have a faithâthat

                <p>âBut Unitarianismâwhich is our modern Monotheismâconfesses the divine life in

                <p>âWe must judge by the Understanding,â he said. âThe Hidden Wisdom is felt, not
                    demonstrated. You have it, or you have it not. You cannot argue about it as you
                    might argue about a philosophic theorem or a painted picture. It is a thing
                    which the Best have agreed to accept as final and fixed.â</p>
                <p>âNo question can be called final, Mr. Grahame, while there are dissidents and
                    doubters. We do not deny that two and two make four, nor do we question the
                        laws<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7017-170"/> of gravitation. While two opinions
                    exist on a subject it cannot be called provedâgranting these two opinions to be

                    education.â</p>
                <p>When I said this, Mr. Grahame, smiling softly, first shut his eyes, and then
                    opening them full in my face, asked mildly, as if seriously demanding
                    information:</p>
                <p>âMy dear boy, are you one of those men of intellect and education qualified to
                    judge for yourself on these abstruse points, and to argue with me?â</p>
                <p>âNo,â I said, ânot if I stood alone. But others think as I do. It is a question
                    of schools, not individuals.â</p>
                <p>âThere have always been schools,â he answered, still smiling. âOne of these
                    schools once believed in Simon Magus; one gave glory to Cagliostro; and one
                    denied the Copernican theory.â</p>
                <pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7017-171"/>
                <p>âThat was the Church,â I said, yielding to the temptation.</p>
                <p>âOf Rome? Yes. That was the Church of Rome,â was his calm reply.</p>
                <p>âBut Rome is Christian,â I said.</p>
                <p>âAnd Sir Matthew Hale was a Christian, too. Christianity has never assumed to
                    include scientific illumination.â</p>
                <p>âNo; and that is just my point,â I said. âIf it had! If it had given us a test by
                    which we could judge of the unknown by the proved!â</p>
                <p>âIn which case there would have been no room for faith. And without faith there

                    ignorance. âIt is the seed and the flowerâthe root and the tree; the one cannot
                    exist without the other. Here we have faith and the higher series of religious
                    researchâthere we shall have love and knowledge. The two are different notes on
                    the same stringâa simple question of vibration.â</p>
                <p>âAnd for those who have not faith?â I asked.</p>
                <p>âThe loss of time consequent on straying on wrong roadsâthe condemnation due to

                <p>âIs any ignorance wilful, Mr. Grahame?â I asked. âDo we not all do the best we

                <p>âNo; some do the worst, and some ignorance <emph>is</emph> wilful,â he answered.
                    âAs with you now. You have the truth offered you and the light is all around
                    you. You will not<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7017-173"/> accept the one nor open your

                <p>âWill not or cannot?â</p>
                <p>âThe one is only a mask to hide the other. âVelle est agere.â You say that you
                    cannot, and I, that you will not. You might if you chose. It is because you will
                    not choose that you do not, You are not the first half-educated youth who has
                    fallen into the sin of unbelief through presumptionâwho has lost his better
                    reason through the pride which accompanies ignorance so dense as to mistake
                    itself for knowledge. And I suppose you will not be the last. It is a spiritual
                    disease which has to be gone through, like measles or small-pox. Pity that
                    sometimes the eyesight goes for ever and the scars remain ineffaceable to the
                    day of death! Absit omen! Be wise in time and heal yourself while you can. I
                    fear, however, you will not. I know your kind; and your training has been too
                    disastrous.â</p>

                <p>This was the first time that Mr. Grahame had spoken to me with harshness. In
                    general he had dealt with me tenderly, as one in error trulyâbut, though erring,
                    one sincerely desirous of knowing the truth, and therefore to be in a certain
                    sense respected. And this sudden dogmatic condemnation wounded me to the quick.
                    For I could not feel that I was wilfully wicked. I was merely conscious of a
                    desire to know the truth and the corresponding dread of believing a lie. If I
                    were in the wrong, might God forgive me and lead me aright! I had not
                    intentionally gone astray. And if it is part of the function of Divine Grace to
                    keep souls straight, why had mine been abandoned?</p>
                <p>There was no more impiety in asking this question than there was in acknowledging
                    the fact. If faith comes by grace, and divine illumination is necessary for
                    salvationâis it the wilful fault of the individual when this grace is withheld,

                <p>I was far as yet from the materialism which makes certain thoughts the necessary
                    results of certain conditions of the brain. I believed in mind as a thing apart
                    from and uninfluenced by matterâthe soul as something that both controlled and
                    was determined by thought. And the shape of my head, the depth of the
                    convolutions, the arrangement of the molecules and the quality of the grey
                    matter, together with the state of my blood and nerves, had no part in that
                    which I held to be essentially spiritual and super-sensualâinspired by heaven or
                    dating from hell.</p>
                <p>Hell? Was there such a place as hell?âsuch a being as the devil? I began to doubt
                    even these two points, cardinal as they had hitherto been. The Incarnation, the
                    Atonement, Eternal Punishment and Satanâthese four corner-stones of the<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7017-176"/> Christian Church had loosened so much that
                    the slightest movement more would shake them down altogether. And thenâwhat
                    would be my state?</p>

                <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                <p><hi>ABOUT</hi> this time, however, came a lull in my speculative troubles, for
                    trouble of another kind began to possess me. There had lately settled among us a
                    certain Mr. and Mrs. Dalrymple, who had already won the goodwill of the
                    neighbourhood by their charm of manner and general delightfulness. They had
                    established themselves on a scale of what was to us rather unusual luxury; and,
                    as Mr. Dalrymple was known to one of our magnates, there was no cause to doubt
                    the solidity of their condition. We had had before now our jackdaws pranked<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7017-178"/> in peacocks' feathers, and we had been
                    punished pretty severely for our want of discrimination; but here we stood on
                    safe ground, and no one hung back because no one was afraid.</p>
                <p>It may be that the idealizing power of youth created more than existed, and that
                    the golden mists of time have added their magic to that idealization; but even
                    now, with my imagination sobered by age and chastened by experience, Mrs.
                    Dalrymple stands in my memory as something unapproachable and supreme. Her image
                    is that of the most exquisite creature under heavenâof a woman more like an
                    impersonate poem, or embodied music, or a spirit half-transparently incarnate,
                    than a living, solid flesh-and-blood reality. She was about twenty-sevenâtall,
                    slender, with a cream-white skin, and dark eyes full of inconceivable pathos and
                    a kind of far-away spiritualized listening look, as if she saw what we did not.
                    Her eyelashes<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7017-179"/> were the longest I have ever
                    seen, and she had a fabulous abundance of jet-black hair. She dressed, too, as
                    no one dressed in Eden; with more elegance and refinement than that to which we
                    were accustomed from even our grandest ladies. She had lived much abroad; and
                    from her Polish mother she had inherited the subtle charm which is given by the
                    foreign element, as well as having that which comes from home good-birth and
                    perfect breeding.</p>
                <p>She was in delicate health; languid in her movements; indolent in her habits; but
                    she had an almost feverish activity of mind, an almost dangerous energy of
                    thought. She could do everything. She was an admirable linguist, and spoke the
                    principal four Continental languages as well as she spoke English itselfâwhich,
                    by the way, was coloured with the daintiest little dash of foreign accentâa
                    certain Italianized lingering on the letters that was like a caress.<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7017-180"/> She was a musician of rare force and an artist far
                    beyond the average. She could talk of men, books, places, things, ideas. She
                    knew all that others knew and worlds beyond. She was the most
                    graciously-educated and the most gracefully-minded woman I have ever seenâI use
                    the terms advisedlyâand from my father to myself we all yielded to her charm and
                    adored her.</p>
                <p>From the first the Dalrymples were very friendly with us. We saw a good deal of
                    them; and the more we saw them, the more we loved them and the more they seemed
                    to like us. For myself, it soon came to be that the day when I was not with them
                    seemed to be blank and colourlessâa day of deadly dulness, to be lived through
                    only for the sake of the morrow, when I should go up to Windy Brow, where they
                    lived, as a half-frozen creature creeps to the fire to be warmed back into life.
                    Gradually these<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7017-181"/> new arrivals became the world
                    to me. When I was not with them, I was thinking of themâlonging, pining,
                    restless, dissatisfied; oppressed with untranslatable sorrow; burning with
                    hidden fever; finding no pleasure save in the books which Mrs. Dalrymple had
                    lent me, whereof I learnt all the marked passages, and repeated them to myself
                    with somewhat the same reverence as that with which I said my prayers. Or I made
                    Edwin or Ellen play again and again the music she played and had given
                    themâcertain pieces of Mendelssohn and Beethoven which were to me like poems or
                    picturesâas full of thought and dramatic fervour as the one, and of visible
                    beauty as the other. Or I begged for that long-drawn sigh of Pestel's
                    prison-hymn, which I cannot hear even now without a swelling at my heart and
                    something that feels like tears behind my eyes.</p>
                <p>When they played these things to me I<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7017-182"/> used
                    often to find, to my own surprise, my eyes wet with real tears as I sat, my
                    elbows on my knees, my face buried in my hands, lost in a dream of nameless
                    yearningâa kind of nebulous haze of formless sadness, where nothing was distinct
                    save sorrowâwhich yet was also beauty.</p>
                <p>Then I used to dash out of the room, generally leaping through the window into
                    the garden, to hide from my brother and sisters the strange effeminacy that had
                    overtaken me. My abrupt departure naturally enough offended them, and was
                    counted to me for ingratitude, after they had done something to please me; so
                    that when I returned I received a lesson on my sin of rudeness and bearishness
                    in general, which, with my fiery temper, was sure to involve me in a
                    quarrel.</p>
                <p>I was both too intense and too inexperienced in those days to realize how things
                    must necessarily look from the outside. I<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7017-183"/> was
                    only conscious of what I felt. And when looks and feelings were at variance, I
                    took my stand on the latter, and held myself unjustly treated when condemned for
                    the former. Were more allowance made for this inability to realize the world
                    outside one's selfâthis inability to understand that we are not so transparent
                    as we imagine ourselves to be, and that what we do and not what we feel is the
                    rule by which we are measuredâlife would be far better for us all, and
                    especially for such young creatures as I was;âyoung creatures of impulse and
                    sincerity, as yet incapable of that ethical diagnosis which can criticize
                    self.</p>
                <p>Our new friends did us all good. Mrs. Dalrymple helped Edwin and my sisters with
                    their music and lifted their taste into a higher sphere; and Mr. Dalrymple led
                    them to practise drawing on a better method than they had done before. He taught
                    them to sketch from nature and to draw from the<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7017-184"/> round, and he gave them hints about their colours and perspective; so that
                    their efforts grew to be of better quality all through than when they had been
                    content to reproduce in pencil, with smooth and servile fidelity, this stag's
                    head from a wood-cut by Bewick, or that child and dog from a steel engraving
                    after Corbauld.</p>
                <p>To me, neither a musician nor an artist, they lent booksâchiefly the poets in
                    various tonguesâwhich widened my horizon and added to my knowledge. I had always
                    been passionately fond of poetry, so that I had felt as if our common
                    possessions had belonged by right of appreciation to me alone; but it seemed to
                    me that I had never understood the true meaning of even those I had loved best
                    until now. Shakespeare and Schiller and Goethe, Shelley and Byron, Dante and
                    Tassoâall took a different meaning and gained an added value after Mrs.
                    Dalrymple had repeated such and such <choice>
                        <orig>pas</orig>
                        <reg>passages</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7017-185"/> sages, or given a new interpretation
                    to such and such thoughts. And whatever I read now, it was with her voice, her
                    inflection sounding in my ears, and her divine eyes following mine on the page.
                    Her mental influence was about me like the sunlight, and there was no hour of
                    the day when I forgot herâno occupation which made me unconscious of her. She
                    was the soul of all things to me; and I felt like that picture of the
                    half-uprising man in whose nostrils she was gently breathing the breath of
                    lifeâlike the dumb Memnon when the first rays of the sun touched the soulless
                    stone.</p>
                <p>All the thoughts which had hitherto held me, and which I had elaborated for
                    myself, seemed to me crude, unformed, unbeautiful; without life or artistryâall
                    but my love of Liberty, and that I think must come from the formation of my
                    brain from birth. I had been such a rude clod up to now; and now I was fining
                    down, like Dryden's<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7017-186"/> Cymonâwas I becoming the
                    inversion of Pygmalion's statue?</p>
                <p>Again another help onward. Mrs. Dalrymple taught the rest new steps and new
                    dances. I say the rest, for though she tried to teach me as one of them, I could
                    not learn. Yet she took as much trouble with me as with them, and I did my best
                    to do as she told me. But something held me. âA spirit in my feetâ kept me
                    stupid and clumsy.</p>
                <p>I could have walked safely over a foot-wide ledge with a precipice on each side
                    of me, but my head swam when Adeline Dalrymple laid her long white hand on my
                    shoulder and I put my arm round her supple stayless waist; and I was faint and
                    giddy before I had made a couple of turns round the room. What anguish it was to
                    stop, and yet how impossible to go on! Why was I so weak? I, the strong one, par
                    excellence, of the familyâthe young<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7017-187"/> lion of
                    the broodâthe Esau, the Nimrod, the savageâto be unable to waltz twice round a
                    room not more than twenty-four feet square! It was inconceivable and
                    humiliating; but also it was unalterable; and I never conquered the strange
                    physical weakness which touched me only when waltzing with Mrs. Dalrymple, but
                    which overpowered me then.</p>
                <p>She too was sorry. True to her Polish blood, for all her delicacy of health and
                    general indolence of habit she was enthusiastically fond of dancing; and she
                    would have liked me for a partner, she said with her faint sweet tremulous
                    smile, and that look in her eyes which was like the very glory of the heavens
                    opening.</p>
                <p>If, however, I could not waltz, I could talk and listen. And in our little
                    evenings together, when I was finally pronounced hopeless, not to let me feel
                    neglected and shut out, Mrs. Dalrymple generously forbore<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7017-188"/> to dance with the others, so that she might sit and
                    talk to me on the window-seat. And on the whole I felt that I had the best of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Up to now I had never known the sentiment of jealousy against Edwin. He was the
                    family favourite, caressed by all where I had ever been cold-shouldered and
                    repulsed. At an age when education was the one essential of my life, and
                    idleness the ruin of my whole future, I had been sacrificed in my best interests
                    and denied my natural rights simply to be kept as his companion at home. Yet I
                    had neither grudged him myself nor been jealous of what the others had given
                    him. I had sometimes broken my young heart over the difference made between
                    usâthat was only natural; but I had never carried the blame to him, nor made him
                    suffer because I was wronged and he was favoured.</p>
                <p>Now there were times when I almost<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7017-189"/> hated him
                    for what he was; though I hated myself much more in that I was not like him. I
                    was furious against myself because I was tall and lean and strong, large-boned,
                    and with a shock of thick brown hair disturbed by that unmanageable wave which
                    broke it in heavy flocks that never would lie straight; while he was slenderly
                    framed and almost as round-limbed as a girlâhis head a nest of close-growing
                    golden curlsâhis skin like a child'sâand his blue eyes like limpid lakes beneath
                    the long fine arch of his narrow brows. He was of the Cherubino type, and women
                    treated him pretty much as they would have treated one of themselves. And when I
                    saw Mrs. Dalrymple let him put his arms round her waist while she kissed him as
                    if he had been a child, I confess I was sometimes more really mad than sane. If
                    I could have changed my physique for his, I would at this time. I, who had
                    always gloried in<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7017-190"/> my strength, would have made
                    myself now a weakling, if Adeline Dalrymple would have treated me as she treated
                    my brother. And there were times when, as I say, I hated him; and felt that I
                    could have struck him like a second Cain.</p>
                <p>I did my best to conceal this jealous rage against the one whom hitherto I had
                    loved best of all in the world. But people who live together, especially young
                    people, are quick to note differences of feeling; and Edwin saw the change in me
                    and taxed me with it. Of course I denied that there was any change at all; and,
                    because his charge was true, I grew irritable and sullen under the accusation.
                    But once, when the tears sprang to his eyes, and his small mouth quivered as he
                    said: âI never thought, Chris, that you would have behaved like this to me: and
                    what have I done to deserve it?â I was conquered. After all, he was my first
                    care, and I would give him<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7017-191"/> even Mrs.
                    Dalrymple's preference. I would give him, if need be, my life!</p>
                <p>For all answer to his reproaches, which meant affection, I threw my arms round
                    his neck, and bursting into one of those violent floods of tears which used to
                    characterize me as a child, I kissed him, as also I used to kiss him when we
                    were children together, and dashed out of the house in a tumult of emotion which
                    made me feel as if I had been caught in a typhoon.</p>
                <p>I was in that stage of feeling which makes fetishes of inanimate objects and
                    carries into things the divinity centred in persons; which energizes symbols and
                    vivifies relics, which then it adores. I remember pushing this fetishism so far
                    as to envy the very clothes that Mrs. Dalrymple woreâwhich clothes also had a
                    special character of their own to help on my folly. That old wish of being the
                    glove on her hand was no mere literary conceit to me; it was what I myself<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7017-192"/> realized. I endued with a kind of
                    consciousness all that belonged to this divinest woman; and consciousness
                    included love. She had a certain ermine cloak, lined with pale pink satin
                    through which ran gold and silver threads. If I had made a new religion, with
                    her for the Paraclete, I would have taken that cloak for my standard, as
                    Mohammed took the blacksmith's apronâI would have venerated it as Catholics
                    venerate the handkerchief of St. Veronica.</p>
                <p>When I look back on the passionate idealism, the unreasoning sentiment of this
                    time, and test it by scientific principles, I can understand how myths
                    crystallize and religions are made. I dreamt of Mrs. Dalrymple night after
                    night; but never as an ordinary womanâalways with a halo of divinity about her
                    which took her out of the ranks of common humanity and lifted her heaven-high
                    above the rest. She was to me what the Madonna is to the Neapolitanâ<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7017-193"/> what his guardian angel is to the young seminarist.
                    She was the divine part of humanity; the incarnation of all its beauty; the last
                    expression of all its poetry and purity and inner wisdom. She was the seraph of
                    the hierarchy; and to worship her as a goddess was the necessary corollary of
                    knowing her as a woman. For her sake I loved the meanest creature that belonged
                    to her; and to meet and speak to one of the servants of the house, to caress one
                    of the dogs in her absence, made me comparatively content. That ârose and
                    potââhow true all real poetry is!</p>
                <p>Her husband, Mr. Dalrymple, was in his way a clever as well as an eccentric man,
                    at once charming and less than charming. He had a passion for little dogs, which
                    he called his children and made his idols. He had exactly twenty; all of rare
                    kinds and of perfect breeds. It was one of the sights of the place to see this

                    coloured under-waistcoat showing a narrow band of rose or blue, gorgeous stock,
                    white hat, hair and whiskers artificially curled and highly perfumed, scented
                    handkerchief and superb jewellery, as if he were in Bond Street, not among the
                    Cumberland mountainsâdaintily picking his way on the rough roads, with his
                    twenty little dogs, all in pairs, streaming behind him like a herd of miniature
                    wild beasts. He had the most extraordinary names for them all; of which I only
                    remember Zamiel and Lilith for the barking Pomeros; Puck and Ariel for the
                    graceful Italian greyhounds; Sambo and Sally for the pugs; the little female
                    truffle-hunter was Queen Mab, but I forget the name of her husband; and the
                    toy-terriers were Oberon and Titania.</p>
                <p>Mr. Dalrymple was his wife's husband,<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7017-195"/> and
                    therefore I held him sacred; he was also a man of cultivated intellect, perfect
                    manners, refined tastes, wide experience, and therefore I respected him. But
                    naturally for himself, in view of the man he was and the boy I was, I should not
                    have liked him. He was too effeminate for my tasteâand he did not admire his
                    wife as she deserved to be admired. He was essentially a dilettanteâjust
                    touching the borders of excellence and never attaining it. He drew well, played
                    the guitar well, wrote pretty music and pretty poetry; but he failed in the full
                    grasp and completion of any of these things. Strange stories of his personal
                    habits, and his devotion to certain occult studies, which terrified the weaker
                    minds among us, crept about the vale; but we were a scandalmongering set at
                    Eden, and we had those in our midst who would have criticized and plucked out
                    the feathers of the angel Gabriel's wings, had he<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7017-196"/> alighted at the Town-hall. All the same, Mr.
                    Dalrymple openly confessed to a belief in magic, ghosts, and all the higher
                    phenomena of mesmerism. According to him, both the witches of old and the Indian
                    jugglers of the present time, had and have mysterious powers extra to those of
                    the common run of men; and he lost his time and strength in experiments where he
                    was now the deceiver and now the dupe.</p>
                <p>He was never with his wife, save on state occasions of formal visits and dinners;
                    and they lived two entirely different lives under the same roof. He was a
                    vegetarian and a Rechabite; but he drank a great deal of strong coffee and
                    smoked incessantly; and though by no means a confirmed opium-eater, like De
                    Quincey, he was not innocent of that strange man's vice, nor of that other,
                    corresponding, of smoking hachshish.</p>

                    when I saw her sweet, pale face grow paler than before, her pathetic eyes more
                    mournful, as she had to confess that she had not seen her husband for perhaps
                    three daysâthough we might have seen him, and he had certainly been out and
                    about in the intervalâI calmed myself by remembering that I had no right to
                    thrust myself into her affairs, even by my sympathy; and that what she kept
                    secret, I and all ought to hold sacred.</p>
                <p>My worship for her was too exalted to be intrusive, too humble to take the
                    initiative. It was she who set the rule and measure of our intercourse; and I
                    should as little have dreamed of going beyond her allowanceâof asking a question
                    on things which she had not already explainedâas I should have spoken with
                    levity of my dead mother. But I was unhappy all the same, in more ways than one;

                    most part in a state of torment which nothing soothed but her voice and
                    presence, and nothing effectually charmed away but some signal act of gracious
                    kindness and special distinction.</p>
                <p>In the midst of all this feverish unrest I had some divinely happy hours. As time
                    went on, and our intimacy increased, not a day passed when we were not with the
                    Dalrymplesâwith her more often than with him, and seldom with both together. We
                    used to row across the lake and land at some favourite spot where there was a
                    fine view, or a waterfall, or perhaps a rare fern or orchid to look for and
                    never find; and where there was sure to be one of those wide wet tracts which
                    require some amount of courage and activity to pass dryshod. At such places Mr.
                    Dalrymple, if he came<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7017-199"/> at all, had enough to do
                    to take care of himself, having the most extraordinary horror of dirt and damp.
                    My sisters were mountaineers born and bred, and needed as little help as a triad
                    of goats; but Adeline Dalrymple was different. She was like a hot-house flower
                    where they were field daisies; and what was child's play to them was an
                    insurmountable difficulty to her. Such a feat as springing from one loose stone
                    to another over a mountain ghyll, or picking her way from tussock to tussock
                    through a bog, was simply impossible. And I was glad that it was so. For then I
                    used to take her in my strong young arms and carry her safely across and far on
                    to the dry ground. I could not dance with her, but I could bear her through
                    difficulties such as these, and feel as if I had the very universe in my arms.
                    It was the epitome of all divinityâthe possession of all humanity. It did not

                    Israelite to whom had been given the sacred ark to defendâthe very essence of
                    God made helpless to guard.</p>
                <p>I used to want to kneel to her, to kiss the hem of her garment, to make myself
                    her footstool, her slave, so that I could be of use to her. I would have liked
                    to have spent my life in ministering to her, as if she had been a living goddess
                    in a temple and I her sole servitor. Sometimes I had the criminally selfish
                    half-wish that some great loss should befall her, when the world would desert
                    herâall but Iâand I would carry to her the same homage, the same reverent
                    worship as before. Discrowned by evil hands, she should ever be sole queen to
                    me! And sometimes I had a morbid kind of wonder, if she would be sorry were I to
                    die, and if she would ever come to look at my grave and lay flowers on the turf.
                    If she did, I knew that down there beneath<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7017-201"/>
                    dead and dumb as I might be, I should know the touch of her hand, hear the tread
                    of her feet, and feel on my face the quick-drawn breath of her parted lips. I
                    could never die so that I should not be conscious of her; and I could only die
                    in her service. To know her, to love her, was of itself the warranty of
                    immortality. She was already, herself, immortal; for the body which held her
                    spirit was emphatically only a veil, a shell, a medium of communication. The
                    true reality was the angel within her form.</p>
                <p>The strange deifying reverence that I felt for Mrs. Dalrymple was due partly to
                    my age and temperament, and partly to her own philosophy. She belonged to a
                    school of thought quite unlike any I had ever met with. And, as she interested
                    herself in my religious difficulties, she naturally gave me her own views to
                    help my cruder thoughts. She was emphatically a transcendentalist, and in a
                    certain sense a pantheist. To her<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7017-202"/> the things
                    of the spiritâthe unseen world of the souls that had once been men, and of the
                    angels who had neither been born nor had diedâspiritual experiences and
                    realizations, and the all-pervading presence of God, were more real than those
                    things we call time and space. She believed in the interfusion of soulsâsoul
                    with soul in spiritual blending more lasting than any earthly tie, more potent
                    than any physical circumstance of disruption or removal. She believed in the
                    oneness of God with life, of God with matter, with thought, with emotion, with
                    the cosmic forces of the universe. Like the atmosphere which surrounds us, like
                    the ether which interpenetrates all space, God is the universal medium, the
                    spiritual ether in which we float, the energizing sense by which we recognise
                    and love each other. Soul interfused with soul, and both lying cradled in the
                    Heart of Godâminds touching each<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7017-203"/> other in the
                    dark, and seeking each other through long ages and across interminable
                    distances, welded together for all time and through all eternityâwelded together
                    by and with and in the very substance of God!</p>
                <p>She was also in a sense a metempsychosist, and believed that we had all known
                    each other in another lifeâall of us who loved in this. For she maintained the
                    absolute indestructibility of love, and the impossibility of sundering those
                    whose spirits had once met each other and been united by love. Her beautiful
                    face took the rapt look of a sibyl when she spoke to me, as she often did, of
                    the glorious joy and sense of freedom and invulnerability contained in this
                    conviction; and how it dwarfed all the pains of life, and life itself to a mere
                    short day's dream not worth lamenting while it was passing. Eternity was behind
                    and before us. Why fix our minds only on the one troubled hour?</p>
                <p>âThose who believe as I do,â she said one<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7017-204"/>
                    evening to me, when we were sitting in the twilight, watching the last of the
                    day fading from the sky and the first of the stars coming out; ânoânot who
                    believe, but who knowâare never really separated from the beings they love. Time
                    and space may divide us from each other, and circumstances may be stronger than
                    our will; but thought overrides matter, our souls are ever one and inseparable,
                    and the bond of the spirit once made is indissoluble. Love is in itself
                    immortality. It cannot die; it cannot change; and no force in nature can kill
                    it.â</p>
                <p>She laid her white and scented hand on mine, so brown and large and bonyâand bent
                    her head till she looked full and straight in my eyes. I was sitting on a low
                    stool by her side; she was on the window-seat made in the embrasure.</p>
                <p>âYou, dear boy, will go into the world far away from all of us here,â she said;
                    andâwas it my fancy? or did that sweet voice which<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7017-205"/> always reminded me of pearls tremble, and something
                    as tender as tears come into her glorious eyes?ââbut, wherever you go, my spirit
                    will go with you, surrounding you, guarding you, one with your very breath, your
                    very life. Never forget that, my child. I am with you alwaysâlike God and with
                    Godâin the future always, as I have ever been in the past.â</p>
                <p>Her hand closed on mine with an almost convulsive grasp. It burnt like fire, and
                    the diamonds on her fingers and at her throat flashed as if by their own
                    internal light. Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and something seemed to
                    pass from her to me which thrilled me like electricity. I could not speak. My
                    heart suddenly swelled so that it strangled my voice and cut short my breath. I
                    only felt a dumb kind of desire to carry my life to her hands and worship her as
                    I would have worshipped the Eternal Mother of men and<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7017-206"/> things. She was beyond womanhood to meâshe was the
                    casket that embodied and enclosed the Divine.</p>
                <p>As I looked at her, she still bending down her head and looking into my eyes, I
                    felt a strange rapture and loss of myself in her personality. Her eyes were as
                    mysterious as those stars overheadâworlds where I was, as it were, engulfed, but
                    wherein was contained all the beauty, the love, the secrets of the universe. It
                    was the unveiling of Isis to her priestâthe goddess revealing herself to man. I
                    scarcely lived; I did not breathe; I was as if spiritually carried away into
                    another sphere; and for the moment I was not human but immortal. It was a
                    sensation beyond mere physical excitement; and it would have been appalling from
                    its intensity, had I had enough consciousness left to examine or reflect.</p>
                <p>What was in my face I do not know, but there must have been something which
                        did<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7017-207"/> not displease Mrs. Dalrymple. One hand
                    still clasped mine, the other she laid on my forehead, pushing back my hair and
                    bending my head a little backward.</p>
                <p>âDearest child,â she said, âGod has given you to me. You are mine in spirit now
                    and for ever. Never forget this moment, Christopher, when our souls have met and
                    recognised each other once again across the long ages which have separated
                    them.â</p>
                <p>She stooped her gracious face to mine, and lightly kissed me on the eyes and
                    forehead.</p>
                <p>It was the first kiss any woman, other than my sisters, had given me since I was
                    a child; and it was the birth-hour of a new life to me. Henceforth all things
                    were transformed for me, and life meant a new existence as it had a new message.
                    The sunrises and the sunsets, the song of the birds, the flowers in the fields,
                    the shadows of the clouds on the mountains, the reflections<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7017-208"/> in the lake and the ripple of the blue waves, the
                    voice of the waters making music in cascades, the budding and the fall of the
                    leaves of the treesâall were the circumstances of a more beautiful world than
                    that in which I had hitherto lived. Nature had a secret language which was
                    revealed to me, and I understood the hidden meaning of things which hitherto had
                    had no meaning at all. I, like Adeline Dalrymple, felt and saw God
                    everywhereâbut when I thought of God, she stood ever foremost at His hand.</p>
                <p>How I lived then, I do not know. I remember nothing very distinctly outside my
                    being with Mrs. Dalrympleâour sunlit noonday walks in her gardenâour
                    speculations beneath the starsâher eyes, which looked more eloquently than
                    wordsâher words, of which I sometimes lost the meaning because her voice filled
                    my ears with too much music. When I was not with<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7017-209"/> her, I was away in the lonely mountains, where I could think of her without
                    interruption and associate her with the beauty of all about me. I carried my
                    secret joy like a bird in my bosom, hidden from the eyes of all; and not even to
                    Edwin did I reveal what was in my heart.</p>
                <p>Of him I was no longer jealous. I had no cause. For I noticed that of late Mrs.
                    Dalrymple had ceased to treat him so familiarly as she used to do in the early
                    days; and on this side I was at peace. I lived in my enchanted island, so far as
                    I knew alone and undiscovered. And if any one suspected my state, no one spoke
                    to me about it. But indeed I have forgotten all the details of my family life at
                    this time. I suppose I ate and drank and slept and lived among them as usual;
                    but I do not remember the fact nor feeling of a day, save once, when I looked at
                    Edwin and thought: âHow much I know that you do notâand<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7017-210"/> how different the world is to you and me!â</p>
                <p>The strain at this moment must have been severe. I had not done growing, though I
                    was six feet as it wasâbut I am six feet two now; and my big bony frame took a
                    great deal of rest and nourishment to keep it in serviceable condition then and
                    to make a strong man of me in the future. Under the excitement of my present
                    rapturous life I lost both my sleep and my appetite, and became as thin as a
                    grasshopper. It was impossible not to see that I was changing; and my sisters
                    were always commenting on my eyes, which they said looked as if they had been
                    picked out by hawks and put in again by a chimney-sweep; while my face was
                    whiter and leaner than ever, and I was altogether uglier and even more like Don
                    Quixote than I used to be. But as I was certainly less violent and less
                    irascible, they were too glad of a change which was a<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7017-211"/> respite to fall foul of the cause, whatever it might
                    have been.</p>
                <p>By degrees the rapture of my first content faded and the old unrest took
                    possession of me and ruined all. To be with Mrs. Dalrymple was ecstasy, but to
                    be away from her was torture and despair. And how could I be always with her?
                    Still, absence from her was like passing into the darkness of the grave; and my
                    old impatience of sorrow made me furious and wild against the obstructions which
                    kept us apart. I used to get out of our house at night by a side door that no
                    one ever looked after, and wander about her garden on the chance of seeing her
                    at the bedroom window, or perhaps of seeing only her light, burning far into the
                    dawning day. There was no danger of being discovered. Mr. Dalrymple slept at the
                    other side of the house altogether, and the big watch-dog knew me. I used to
                    stand among the laurestinus bushes, looking<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7017-212"/> up
                    at her window; and I was grandly rewarded when, as she sometimes did, she came
                    all in white and drew back the blinds, opening the window, and sometimes
                    stepping out on the balcony and looking at the sky. I never let her know that I
                    was there. That too was my secret which I kept sacred; till one night, as if
                    attracted by some magnetic influence, she came down the outside steps which led
                    from her bedroom to the garden, and walked straight to where I was standing in
                    the shadow of the bushes.</p>
                <p>âI knew you were here,â she said, as she came up to me. âI was conscious of you,
                    and could not sleep. Child! what have you done to me to draw me to you? What
                    strange power have you over me?â</p>
                <p>I trembled as if in fever.</p>
                <p>âHave I any power over you?â I said.</p>
                <p>âYou see it,â she answered simply.</p>
                <p>I cannot describe the curious sense of <choice>
                        <orig>in-</orig>
                        <reg>inversion</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7017-213"/> version which these words created.
                    I, who had been the slave, the worshipper, the subordinate, to be suddenly
                    invested with powerâto be even so prepotent as to compel obedience from the one
                    who had hitherto been supremeâit was a change of parts which for the moment
                    overwhelmed me with a sense of universal instability; and to the end of my life
                    I shall never forget the strange confusion of pride and pleasure, of pain in
                    loss yet joy in the sensation of a newborn power which possessed me, as the
                    goddess thus became a woman, and made of me, who had been her slave, her master
                    and a man.</p>
                <p>I did not speak, nor did she. It was like an enchanted spell which words would
                    have broken; and we walked in the dark alleys of the shrubbery in a silence that
                    was at once divine in its blessedness and painful in its vagueness, and more
                    like a dream than a fact. I did not know what it meant,<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7017-214"/> and yet I dared not break it; and she did not. We
                    went into a small summer-house at the end of the garden, and sat there hand in
                    hand, till the morning broke. Then the faint flush on the mountain-top and the
                    first stirring of the birds told us it was time to part.</p>
                <p>âSee how I have trusted you!â she said as she stood up to go. She laid both her
                    hands on my shoulders, then drew my face forward and kissed me as she had done
                    once before, on the forehead and the eyes. âYour consecration,â she said; âthe
                    seal of our eternal oneness.â</p>
                <p>Overpowered by an emotion so powerful as to be physical pain, I knelt on the
                    ground at her feet; and I think that for a moment I died.</p>
                <p>This was the first and only time we met thus by night in the garden. But after
                    this I passed the best half of every night in the shadow of the laurestinus
                    bushes, praying<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7017-215"/> for her to come down to me as
                    she had done on that night of ecstasy and silence. And as the hours passed and
                    she gave no sign, I used to feel as if I must inevitably die as I stood thereâas
                    if this agony of vain longing and ruthless disappointment took from me my very
                    heart's blood.</p>
                <p>At last the strain grew too intense, and nature gave way. I had a sharp attack of
                    brain-fever, when I was for many days in danger. Through the dark tempestuous
                    trouble of the time, I vaguely remember a sudden influx of peace and rest when
                    there came to my bedside some one who spoke to me softly, in what seemed to me a
                    language I had once learned and now vainly tried to remember; bending over me
                    and breathing on me. I remember how my face was cooled and refreshed by what I
                    thought was water from a Greek fountain, and how, with a subtle scent of roses,
                    it was softly dried. I thought it was my mother who had come<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7017-216"/> out of heaven, or poor Nurse Mary who had returned;
                    then that it was the Divine Virgin who had made me her second Christ; then that
                    it was the goddess Isis, she whose awful beauty no man had unveiled; and then I
                    had a confused dream of Diana and Endymion, which changed into that of Juno and
                    Ixion, as the vision faded and the form melted away into mist.</p>
                <p>It was none of all these. It was Adeline Dalrymlple; and the tears on my face,
                    which seemed to have fallen from some divine source, were those shed because of
                    the sorrow which had no healingâbecause of the love which had had no past and
                    could have no future.</p>
                <p>When I recovered I found that the Dalrymples had left Windy Brow, and no one at
                    Eden knew where they had gone. Years after I heard of them as living at Venice,
                    where Mrs. Dalrymple was a confirmed invalid and never seen, and Mr.<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7017-217"/> Dalrymple was wholly given up to mesmerism, opium and
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>Thus then, began and ended the first love of my life; and in this manner the
                    Great Book was opened and the page turned downâhalf-read but ineffaceable. And
                    ever and ever a fragrance steals from that closed page which neither length of
                    time nor deeper knowledge of life can destroy. Adeline Dalrymple remains in my
                    memory as the impersonation of all beauty and all delightâa woman more heavenly
                    than humanâever the saint in her shrine, the goddess in her temple, her white
                    robes unstained and her divine glory undiminished through all time and for all
                    eternity.</p>

                <p><hi>WHEN</hi> I had fully recovered, it seemed to me impossible to go on living
                    at home. I had lost all that made life sweet on the outside, and the monotony of
                    existence within was intolerable. If I had had the hope of a settled future and
                    the occupation of preparing for it, things might have been better; but even such
                    lame endeavours after self-education as I had made now failed me, and I seemed
                    to have lost the key to all the holy places of the past, and to have let the
                    fire on the sacred altar burn out.</p>
                <p>I was listless, inert, uninterested. All<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7017-219"/> hope,
                    all joy, all secret ambition of future success, all passionate thrill of living,
                    all delight in books, all intellectual vitality, had gone from me. I wanted but
                    to be left alone, not spoken to and not noticed. Even the companionship of Edwin
                    was distasteful to me; and their cheerfulness under what I felt to be our
                    irreparable loss made my sisters seem the very incarnations of ingratitude.</p>
                <p>Everything had gone from me. I could have shrieked for the torture given me by
                    music. I dared not read a poem which was associated with Mrs. Dalrympleâand all
                    were associated with herâand the zeal with which I had dug down into the arid
                    wells of the âEncyclopÃ¦dia Londinensisâ for that fantastic learning with which I
                    had crammed my brain, had gone with the rest.</p>
                <p>What a wretched time this was to me! I had recovered my life and lost that which
                    had made it beautiful. It was the husk<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7017-220"/> without
                    the kernel, the shell without the pearl; and I was like the Garden when the Lady
                    who had been its Soul had died. I have gone through the fire more than once
                    since then, but I have never had a more painful period than this of that drear
                    dead winter, down among the mountains, after Adeline Dalrymple had left.</p>
                <p>The Grahames did what they could to help me. I think they saw what was amiss and
                    were sorry for me. But I had lost all interest in those subjects which had been
                    common to us, and cared nothing for the theological difficulties which, a year
                    ago, had so much disturbed me. Things might be, or might not. What mattered it
                    to me? I went back to that languid acquiescence in doctrines as they are taught,
                    which is neither faith nor voluntary acceptance. It is simply letting things
                    slip and taking no trouble. I had lost, too, my political ardour; and from
                    passion and enthusiasm<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7017-221"/> and turbulence all
                    round had passed into the silence of indifference, the quietude of death.</p>
                <p>Thus I droned through the days, dreaming rather than doing; sheltering myself
                    behind the false plea of study, because I wanted to be left alone, but,
                    destitute of either purpose or vigour, in reality doing nothing. My books lay
                    open before me, but I, with my face in my hands, was thinking of all that
                    Adeline Dalrymple had ever said to meârecalling all that she had ever
                    doneâremembering her eyes, her voice, her hair, her handsâtill I broke down into
                    such tempests of despair as frightened even myself. The consciousness of her was
                    my universe, my inseparable second selfâlike another soul possessing me. I
                    carried her always with me; and my heart was like a perfumed vase filled with
                    the ashes of the dead.</p>
                <p>She was the spirit that animated Nature<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7017-222"/>
                    âNature, who had always been my Divine Mother, my Eternal Friend. I saw her in
                    the stars and found her in the skies; I heard her in the voice of the waters and
                    traced her outline in the misty foldings of the silent hills. She was as
                    beautiful as the snow-crystals on the window-pane, as pure as the frost that
                    fringed the dead leaves of the trees. She was everywhereâeverywhere; the one
                    unchangeable circumstance traceable behind all different forms. In the night and
                    in the morning and through out the day, she was my ever-present
                    thoughtâsometimes strong and vivid as a solid fact, sometimes pale and vaporous
                    as a distant cloud, but always thereâalways!âalways! She held me and possessed
                    meâas she had said she ever would. She stole between me and heaven, and when I
                    prayed to God I thought of her. She was fire in my veins and ice in my heart;
                    but I should have been poorer through life had I not<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7017-223"/> known her. I can see now the good of the pain she
                    brought me.</p>
                <p>âWhen winter went and spring came backââhow I love that beautiful copy of Shelley
                    which she gave me! I have it yet, and can still repeat almost all the minor
                    poems I learnt as a lad, blistering the pages where I learnt!âmy blood once more
                    began to stir in my veins and my natural energy to re-assert itself. I gradually
                    got back my old feeling of power and invulnerabilityâmy old sense of certainty
                    in the future and my ability to conquer circumstances and compel happiness, no
                    matter what the obstacles to be overcome. Heart-broken though I might be, I was
                    still master of fate; and I had always the fee-simple of the future.</p>
                <p>Yet, as this sense of power returned, so grew ever more masterful that which was
                    its reflexârepugnance to my home-life, and desire to go out into the world on my
                        own<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7017-224"/> account, to work for myself and be
                    independent.</p>
                <p>But how? What could I do? I had learnt nothing thoroughly and nothing useful.
                    Even my languages, which were my battle-horses, were merely so much literary
                    furniture, and were useless for the more practical purposes of either writing or
                    speaking. I had amassed cart-loads of useless knowledgeâincluding heraldry and
                    prescientific mythologyâbut I knew nothing that represented money-powerânothing
                    which touched the fringe of any professional robe, or included the price of a
                    plate of meat at a chop-house.</p>
                <p>It had been intended that I, like my brothers, should go to Cambridge when I
                    should come of age. My father would have given me a reading-tutor for the year
                    previous to matriculation; and after that he would have held me responsible for
                    my future, and himself acquitted of all <choice>
                        <orig>obliga-</orig>
                        <reg>obligation</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7017-225"/> tion. But I was too impatient to
                    wait even the short two years that stood between me and my majority. I was now
                    past nineteen; and those two years seemed to me an eternity of ennui. Besides,
                    what could I do after I had taken my degree? I could not take Orders; and the
                    Bar was beyond my means. Where was the good, then, of widening foundations over
                    which I could never build? and why delay the more restricted building which
                    should be begun now at once?</p>
                <p>Then it was that I returned to my old love, Literatureâthat waste-pipe of
                    unspecialized powers, which no one thinks demands an apprenticeship, and wherein
                    all believe that fame and success are to be caught like wild goats, at a bound!
                    Besidesâit would be my means of communication with Mrs. Dalrymple. If I could
                    but write things which she would repeat, as she repeated that poem of Shelley's,
                    that sweet<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7017-226"/> music of Heine'sâif I could make
                    those beautiful eyes moist and stir that lofty soul with generous emotion, she
                    remembering the boy who through her had become great!âif I could! Yes: I would
                    be a literary man, pure and simple; and I would leave home.</p>
                <p>Of late I had blossomed into poetry. It is the natural expression of love and
                    sorrow, and minds, like all other things, obey fixed laws and exhibit the same
                    phenomena under the same conditions. And being only a Philistine, without real
                    insight into the true meaning of the gift of Song, I thought that, because I had
                    been able to set down a few passionate couplets with tolerable flow of rhythm
                    and harmony of rhyme, my path was clear before me, my tools were sharpened to my
                    hand, and my chaplet of bays was already sprouting on the tree. I wrote a short
                    poem, which I resolved should determine my future. If<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7017-227"/> accepted, I would at once take up my parable and
                    begin my career; if rejected, I would accept the verdict as final, and go to the
                    colonies as a sheep-farmer, or I would go to sea as a sailor before the mast, or
                    enlist as a private in the armyâtrusting to myself to be recognised as a
                    gentleman, raised from the ranks in less than a year, and made an admiral or a
                    general while still young. I was such a mere child in some things, even yet!âand
                    in nothing more than in my ignorance of the ways of the world, and the impotence
                    of the individual when brought into contact with systems. Meanwhile, I would try
                    my fate with literature; poetry and literature being to me, in those days of
                    darkness, interchangeable terms meaning the same thing.</p>
                <p>At that time the two magazines in greatest favour among us youngsters at the
                    vicarage were âAinsworth's Miscellanyâ and âDouglas Jerrold's Shilling
                    Magazine.â My father<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7017-228"/> patronized Blackwood, of
                    which some articles were delightful to me and others made me rageful. With the
                    superstition of youthful hope and fear, I determined to do a little bit of
                    private vaticination for my better guidance; and to make the best of a certain
                    number of catches on the point of cup-and-ball determine the magazine to which I
                    should send my poem. I caught forty-nine out of the fifty for Ainsworth, and
                    only forty-seven for Jerrold. To the former then I posted my rhymes, with a
                    boyish letter of entreaty which must have amused him by its fervour.</p>
                <p>To my joy he accepted my poem, and sent me an honorarium of two guineas; together
                    with a kind and encouraging letter, assuring me of success if I would persevere,
                    and promising to accept all such work as would suit the âMiscellany.â So now
                    things were plainly ordered, and my future was fair before me.</p>
                <pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7017-229"/>
                <p>Literature, as a profession, was a thing which went dead against our family
                    traditionsâour inherited ideas of respectability and what was due to our gentle
                    birth. To write in the quiet dignity of home a learned book like Burton's
                    âAnatomy of Melancholy,â or a profound one like Locke âOn the Understanding,â
                    was one thing; to depend for bread on one's pen was another. The one shed
                    increased lustre on the noblest name; the other was no better than fiddling in
                    an orchestra, acting in a barn, or selling yards of silk across the counter, all
                    of which were allied disreputabilities. It was a low-class <foreign xml:lang="fre">mÃ©tier</foreign>, let who would follow it; but for a
                    gentleman and the grandson of a Bishop, it was degradation.</p>
                <p>So at least my father said when I opened fire on him one day, and propounded to
                    him my notable scheme for leaving home, going to London, and supporting myself
                    by literature. He was opposed to the scheme from<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7017-230"/> first to last, and tried to deter me from it by sarcasm.</p>
                <p>âI thought, with your fine ideas, you had more ambition than to make yourself a
                    mere newspaper hack, a mere Grub Street poet,â he said, throwing into his words
                    that galling emphasis which impetuous youth finds so hard to bear. âDo you think
                    you can do nothing better for yourself than write poems for Warren's blacking,
                    or scratch up Bow Street details for a dinner?â</p>
                <p>âI do not intend to write poems for Warren's blacking, nor to scratch up Bow
                    Street details for a dinner,â I answeredâI honestly confess itâinsolently; for
                    my father had the fatal power, as some others have also had, of rousing the
                    worst passions in my nature. âAnd if to be a literary hack now is the way to
                    literary fame hereafter,â I continued, âI will serve my apprenticeship as others
                    have done. Sir Walter Scott was not a literary hack!â</p>
                <pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7017-231"/>
                <p>âThere is no good in talking to such an obstinate young puppy as you,â said my
                    father angrily. âI am sick to death of your whims and affectations! The best
                    thing for you would be a good thrashing to knock some of the conceit and
                    wilfulness out of you. If you go to London, as you propose, you go without my
                    consentâdo you hear?âand the curse of God rests on disobedient children to the
                    end of their lives. Now leave the room, Christopher, and never let me hear of
                    this ridiculous rubbish again.â</p>
                <p>Here then I was at the junction of those two roads of which either determines the
                    whole after-life. Opposition of my father's unreasoning kind was naturally, to a
                    boy of my violent temper, so much oil on flame and so much strengthening of
                    resolve. All the same, obedience to parents is a duty; so also is the perfecting
                    of one's own powers and leading the life for which one is best fittedâfor we all
                    have duties to ourselves as<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7017-232"/> well as to others.
                    At this moment the two clashed and made my choice very difficult. For underneath
                    the fierce temper which I could not deny, was always conscience and the desire
                    to know the right;âand to do it when known.</p>
                <p>Finally, my personal ambition conquered. I reasoned the thing out in my own way,
                    and came to the conclusion that, although self-sacrifice for the good of others
                    is absolute and imperative, the sacrifice of a real vocation for no one's good
                    and simply because of the arbitrary opposition of a parent, is not; and that in
                    my case self-assertion was not selfishness. The permission then, which my father
                    would not give me, I prepared myself to take; and I was on the point of running
                    away from home, as my grandfather, uncle, and brother had doneâkeeping quiet for
                    the moment only because Edwin was not wellâwhen, fortunately for us, Mr. King,
                    our family solicitor, came down<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7017-233"/> from London to
                    pay us a visit, and proved the âdeux ex machinÃ¢â by whom all difficulties were
                    arranged.</p>
                <p>Mr. King took a fancy to me. A sharp practitioner in his office, outside his
                    profession he was a kind-hearted man enough, fond of young people, and always
                    ready to assist undeveloped talent and help on the schemes of honourable
                    ambition. He thought that I was fit for something better than a parson's
                    petticoat, he said with his cynical contempt for all forms of faith; and, as it
                    was not possible to send me to the Bar, the next best thing was to give me the
                    run of the British Museum, and leave to prove of what stuff I was made. He would
                    help me with his advice; and he promised my father that he would look after my
                    health and morals.</p>
                <p>But, first of all, he said to me: âCould he see what I had already done, beside
                    that prancing poem in âAinsworth's <choice>
                        <orig>Miscel-</orig>
                        <reg>Miscellany</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7017-234"/> lany,â which wasâwellâwhich was
                    pretty fair, but vastly young?â</p>
                <p>Full of the pride of ignorance and the confidence of youth, I gave him some of
                    the things I thought my best; and never doubted of his verdict. Poor Mr. King!
                    Such a turgid, upheaped, colossally clumsy style as mine was in those early
                    days!ââlike a wood where you could not see the trees for the leavesââlike a
                    confused mass of ornamentation, where not a figure was detached nor a volute
                    truly drawn. But to me they were all monumentalâchaos, encumbrances, bad drawing
                    and all.</p>
                <p>Mr. King told me quite candidly what he thought of my productions. In
                    consequence, he went near to drive me mad by what I took to be his prosaic
                    aridity and deadness of touch. He cut out all my finest passages; ridiculed all
                    my best descriptions; gravely demanded what I meant by my sublimest ideas; put
                    my most high-flown phrases into<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7017-235"/> flat prose,
                    and then asked me if that was not much better?âcertainly it was more
                    intellegible!âand reduced the whole thing to pulp.</p>
                <p>But it was protoplastic pulp, after all his hacking and poundingâpulp with the
                    germ of life and the potentiality of development in itâpulp out of which, with
                    care, might be evolved some kind of vertebrate organismâfor, though he edited me
                    severely, he ended by saying he thought I had âstuffâ in me; at all events,
                    enough to justify me in my choice of literature as a profession and him in his
                    advocacy with my father. And after he had thus waded through my literary
                    Niagaras, he addressed himself again to my father and discussed the matter with
                    him philosophically.</p>
                <p>It was evident I was doing no good at home, he said. I was too big for the house;
                    too vigorous for such a life as we led down here. It was power wastedâvitality <choice>
                        <orig>run-</orig>
                        <reg>running</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7017-236"/> ning to seedâand it would be far
                    better to send me up to London, as I wished. Let me have a year's grace to see
                    what I could do. The question of permanent settlement might come after. When I
                    should come of age my small fortune would simplify mattersâuntil then, could I
                    not have an allowance?</p>
                <p>Mr. King was one of the few people who had a decided influence over my father.
                    His sharp, brisk energy; the trenchant audacity of his theories; his worldly
                    knowledge and business capacity; his respect for society, appearances, success;
                    his absolute self-confidenceâall naturally impressed a man whose indolence was
                    his bane, and who had to be stirred up if he were to be made to move. And as Mr.
                    King swore by all his gods that his sistersâhe was not marriedâshould look after
                    me and keep me out of the destruction into which my father made sure I should
                    run, the thing was at last<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7017-237"/> arranged. My father
                    gave his formal consent to my going up to London for a year for the purpose of
                    studying at the British Museum, and writing the book on which I had set my
                    heart. And he agreed to furnish me with the funds necessary for that year's
                    experience.</p>
                <p>âAfter that,â he said kindly, and yet severely; âyou sink or swim on your own
                    account. If you fail, as I fear you will, you have your home to come back to. It
                    will never be shut against you, unless you disgrace yourself so that you are
                    unfit to enter it. If you succeedâmy blessing be with you! It will be a pleasant
                    surprise if you doâbut all things are possible to God; and to His care I commend
                    you.â</p>
                <p>My leaving home in this sudden and erratic manner created a tremendous stir among
                    us. Poor dear Edwin cried like a girl, and said that he did not know what he
                    should do without me, and that it was<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7017-238"/> hard,
                    after I had accustomed him to lean on me all his life, for me now to leave him
                    alone.</p>
                <p>And when he said this, for a brief instant I felt the joints of my resolve give
                    way, and I thought I would throw it all up and be content with him and home.
                    But, like another Pharaoh, I hardened myself afresh, and, instead of yielding to
                    him, did what I could to comfort himâespecially promising to return before long,
                    and to write to him every day, faithfully.</p>
                <p>As for my sisters, they were half-relieved and half-sorry, as now the prospect of
                    greater peace by the withdrawal of my turbulent personality, and now the loss of
                    a useful kind of servant, was uppermost. As pretty Ellen drawled out in that
                    quiet naÃ¯ve way of hers, by which she was able to say the most wounding things
                    with the greatest serenity, and not get into a quarrel as the price to be paid
                    for her frankness:</p>
                <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7017-239"/>
                <p>âWe shall have no one now to do things for us; and I think, Chris, you are very
                    selfish indeed to go away. Who is to go down for the letters on the wet days?
                    and how dull it will be for Julia and me to walk out by ourselves when Edwin has
                    a cough and cannot come! How can we go up the mountains alone? Who is to drive
                    away the bulls? and how can we sail without you to manage the boat? And what is
                    Edwin to do without you?âyou, who have always pretended to be so fond of him
                    too! I must say I think you are very wicked and selfish for leaving us all like
                    this, just to go and amuse yourself in London. But you always were a selfish and
                    ungrateful boy; and it is not to be wondered at.â</p>
                <p>âAm I really selfish, Nell?â I asked.</p>
                <p>âOf course you are,' she answered, lifting her soft eyes to mine with her candid
                    look. âYou were never anything else.â</p>
                <p>Well, perhaps. Still, I thought that to<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7017-240"/> give up
                    such a chance as I had now, that I might go to the post on the wet days, take
                    care of my sisters in their mountain walks and amuse my brother when he was not
                    well, would be a disproportionate expenditure of my own life in view of the gain
                    to theirs.</p>
                <p>And more. With the return of the old strength and hope had come back the old
                    theological troubles: and my âunsoundnessâ had by now become so patent as to
                    make things less than ever harmonious between my father and myself. His method
                    of reconversion was not of a kind to bring us into closer union. Leland's âShort
                    Method with the Deists,â which he insisted on my reading, only made me angry;
                    and his unstinted abuse of all Unitarianism, Deism, and even Dissent, made me
                    angrier still.</p>
                <p>When the âVestiges of Creationâ came out, our fight was serious. Giving, as it
                        did<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7017-241"/> the first idea of cosmic continuity,
                    and the consequent destruction of the bit by bit creation of Genesis, it was a
                    priceless treasure to me, to him a deadly and diabolical sin. And in the
                    controversy between Whewell and Sir David Brewster, we of course took opposite
                    sidesâand mine was not that which adduced as the convincing proof of the
                    centralization of intelligent life on the earth alone, the astounding argument
                    that Christ had died for man only, and that no other world could, therefore, be
                    peopled with creatures of intelligence, soul, or spirit like ours.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons then, I felt that it was best to go. I had outgrown the
                    dimen- sions of the old home; and fission is the law of families as well as of
                    animalculÃ¦. I was the one inharmonious circumstance within the vicarage walls,
                    and all would be better without me. The die was cast. My choice was made.
                    Selfish, or only self-respecting, I took my place with Mr. King<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7017-242"/> in the coach which was to carry us to the railway
                    station; and thus and for ever broke down my dependence on the old home and set
                    my face towards the Promised Landâthe land where I was to find work, fame,
                    liberty and happiness.</p>

                <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                <p><hi>MY</hi> first year in London was one of strange alternation of feeling.
                    Sometimes I longed for the old placeâthe lake, the mountains, the rivers, the
                    woods, the faces I knew when passing up the street, and my own peopleâwith that
                    sickness of desire which grows into a real malady, culminating in death if
                    continued long enough. And then again I was in a world of enchantment as my mind
                    opened to new impressions and my heart warmed to new affections.</p>
                <p>This total change of scene, and the influx of fresh interests included, did for
                    me what<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7017-244"/> nothing else would have done. My
                    certainty of endless heart-break for the loss of my first love began to be as a
                    grave-mound which gently covers itself with moss and flowers as it sinks down
                    almost on a level with the plain, while sweet birds come to sing, above the
                    dead.</p>
                <p>I read daily at the British Museum, gathering material for my magnum opus, and
                    making raids into all manner of strange regionsâaccording to my old habit of
                    amassing unusable cartloads of perfectly worthless learning. Among other things,
                    I remember how nearly I made shipwreck of myself in the fascinating whirlpool of
                    Analogy. I improved my knowledge of classical times and circumstances, and
                    blessed Becker and Winckelmann; and I lost myself in the mazes of comparative
                    mythology and Higgins's âAnacalypsis.â Turned loose in this rich pasturage, with
                    only the limitation of subject which came from the<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7017-245"/> main lines of my book, I ran great risk of losing my
                    time by the very fact of over-filling it.</p>
                <p>The consciousness of living in the midst of such boundless stores, and of being
                    the potential possessor of all this wealth, acted on my brain as a
                    stimulantâsometimes as an intoxicant. I was never weary of that badly-lighted,
                    ill-ventilated and queerly tenanted old room, with its legendary flea and
                    uncleansed corners. The first to come, the last to leave, and always surrounded
                    by a pile of books, of which the number brought down on my young head many a
                    good-natured sarcasm from the attendants, I soon became known to the officials
                    and habituÃ©s, whom my youth interested and my enthusiasm amused. All were kind
                    to me; but one attendant was especially my friend. The habitual readers of the
                    Museum from some forty to a few years ago will recognise my man.</p>
                <p>With his heart in the country, and his<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7017-246"/> hope of
                    leaving his hated service in the reading-room to once more establish himself as
                    a gentleman-farmer in Norfolk ever flitting, like a Will-o'-the-wisp, before
                    him, he had to live on those narrow lines for the remainder of his life. The
                    post which had been accepted as a temporary stop-gap when he was ruined by that
                    unlucky speculation of his had to be his permanent office; and the discomfort of
                    a few months crystallized into the discontent of a life. Honest as the day, true
                    as steel, tender-hearted as a woman, he was gruff in manner and of superficial
                    surliness of temper to men; to women he was always both courteous and
                    considerate, so that he grew to be the recognised ladies' attendant of the room.
                    His delicate little wife, for whom he had the most chivalrous devotion, knew his
                    real worth; and I too learnt the intrinsic value of his nature. He and his wife
                    were my good friends, and I used often to go and see them on the <choice>
                        <orig>Sun-</orig>
                        <reg>Sunday</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7017-247"/> day afternoons, when they lived out
                    by Stoke Newington.</p>
                <p>From the firstâpartly owing to the habit of mixing with all classes, proper to a
                    clergyman's family, and to the familiarity natural in a small country place
                    towards the children whom the elders had seen grow up in their midst; partly to
                    my own natureâI have been as democratic in my ways as in my principles. I have
                    ever chosen my friends for their worth and not for their station; and, taking
                    society vertically as I have done, I have counted friends in all the strata,
                    from those born in the purple down to fishermen and servants. And I began as I
                    have gone onâstarting off with this real friendship made with the family of a
                    simple attendant in a public library.</p>
                <p>In those days Mr. Panizziânot yet Sir Antonioâwas our Deus Maximus; and on more
                    than one occasion he showed how far ahead Italian astuteness looks, and how<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7017-248"/> wise it is to have your traps in order when
                    you suspect that vermin may be about. He caught and caged one of these vermin in
                    the most masterly way in the world. The thing was done as neatly as a conjuror's
                    trick, and has left on me the impression of a nightmare. It was my first
                    introduction to the Italian character, whereof I have had wide experience
                    since.</p>
                <p>Mr. Panizzi took great notice of me. He had a watchful eye over his small world
                    both of readers and officials, and not so much as a mouse squeaked behind the
                    skirting-board but he heard it and tracked the run from end to end. Who did his
                    work of espionage no one ever knew; but some one must have been his
                    âmouse-trapââfor this accurate knowledge of all things within the domain of the
                    Printed Book Department could not have been had by direct personal observation,
                    even granting those âeye-holesâ of which there was a<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7017-249"/> dark tradition and unpleasant consciousness.</p>
                <p>One day he gave me a little wise advice about my friendliness with this good
                    attendant, of whom I have spoken. He had seen me shake hands with him on coming
                    into the reading-room, and he knew that I visited him and his wife at their own
                    home. And as he knew from Mr. King something of my inherited social position,
                    and saw for himself how young and unformed and impulsive I was, he thought
                    himself justified in warning and reproving me. As a reader, I was so far under
                    his jurisdiction; and his position gave him seigneurial rights.</p>
                <p>âYou are a gentleman,â he said; âhe is only a servant. Make him keep his place,
                    and do you maintain your position. These familiarities with low people always
                    end badly.â Then he bent his head and levelled his eyes at me from under his
                    broad bushy brows. âYou are very young,â he said with<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7017-250"/> a peculiar smile; âand you think that you can
                    revolutionize society. You will find that you cannot; and that if you knock your
                    head against stone walls, you will only make it ache and alter nothing.â</p>
                <p>But he talked to the winds. What can heady youth do, when temperament and
                    principles combine to push it in one direction, but stick to its own sense of
                    right and earn its own experience?âwith bitter weeping, if need be, but always
                    earned through constancy and conscientiousness. The young fellow whose course of
                    action or mode of thought can be changed or modified by the first dissident he
                    comes across will never be a man, morally, but will remain a bit of jelly to the
                    end. For weakness of will and plasticity of conviction, however pleasant they
                    may be to live with, make but a poor job of life on the whole; and while one is
                    young, moral steadiness is more honourable than intellectual amiability.
                        Wherefore,<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7017-251"/> acting more or less consciously
                    on these ideas, I gave no heed to Mr. Panizzi's counsel, and continued my
                    friendship with these good people as I maintained it to the end.</p>
                <p>My chief friends however, at this time, were naturally Mr. King and his family,
                    and their house was like my home. I have often wondered since, how they could
                    have been bothered with me as they were; but they were wonderfully kind to meâat
                    least, some among them. There were two sisters who did not like me; so we will
                    let them pass. It is not in human nature to speak very enthusiastically of those
                    who dislike one and make no secret of their feelings; and I wish to remember
                    only things pleasant and of good repute in connection with my old friends and
                    quasi-guardians.</p>
                <p>They were a strangely united family; not so much in personal affection as by the
                    feeling of family solidarity. When I first knew them<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7017-252"/> they were five in all; and all were unmarried. The
                    eldest brother was the master; the eldest sister was the mistress. The youngest
                    two sisters were respectively the beauty and the invalid; and the younger
                    brother was the family pet and subordinate. He was one of the best fellows that
                    ever livedâkind, unselfish, devoted, faithful; but he hated his profession, and
                    he was emphatically a round man in a square hole. He was a great athlete and
                    fond of all country exercises. He had wanted to go to sea, but had been
                    prevented for reasons of family ambition never fulfilled; so he had to sit at
                    his desk instead of climbing up shrouds and handling stays; and his brother
                    found, when too late, that to coerce a life out of its natural direction does
                    not always ensure a successful settling in another form.</p>
                <p>This brother, George, and I were great friends; and for years we spent every
                    Sunday together. We used to take long walks<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7017-253"/>
                    into the country, about London, and through the parks and public gardens; and,
                    utterly unlike in every thought, feeling and instinct, we were nevertheless
                    chums as close as if we had been brothers together.</p>
                <p>The eldest sister was the great feature of the family. She was a tall, large,
                    strikingly handsome woman, almost stone deaf, and of a singular mixture of
                    qualities. With certain virile characteristicsâwitness her personal courage and
                    her constancy; her strong sense of family duty, which led her to self-sacrifice
                    for the sake of her own; her self-respect, which ran into queenliness of pride
                    and dignity; her power to command and her ability to obeyâshe had the most
                    ultra-feminine notions of propriety, and for certain transgressions felt a
                    loathing amounting to horror. She, as well as my special chum, were curiously
                    conservative; and it was impossible to make them believe that anything which had
                        not<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7017-254"/> been in their forming-time of youth
                    was valuable or respectable. I was devotedly attached to this noble
                    creatureââQueen Bettyâ we used to call her; and she made a kind of pet of me,
                    and protected me against the animosity of her sisters.</p>
                <p>For Mr. King himself I have only kindly tender recollections; and I will not
                    dwell on the clouds which came over the future.</p>
                <p>In these days I lived at a small private boarding-house kept by a dear, good
                    woman with a magnificent contralto voice, formidable eyebrows, a decided beard
                    and moustache, and hands as large and strong as a man's. In spite of these
                    masculine accompaniments, Miss Smith had a heart as soft as swansdown and as
                    large as an elephant's. She was totally unfit for any undertaking in which she
                    had to resist encroachments and defend her own rights. Anyone could talk her
                    over. She was influenced by her affections more than by her<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7017-255"/> interests; and where she took a liking she would
                    sacrifice her gains to please the favoured him or her by extra liberalities. She
                    had generous instincts, refined tastes, indolent habits; and she kept a loose
                    hand on the domestic reins. Hence she made the most comfortable home possible
                    for those who lived under her hospitable roof. But our comfort was her loss;
                    and, when Christmas brought its bills, the two ends gaped ever wider and wider
                    and were less and less able to be strained together.</p>
                <p>I knew all this only afterwards. At the time everything seemed to stand on
                    velvet.</p>
                <p>This house was a queer experience to me. The tremendous love-affairs which budded
                    and blossomed, but never set into the permanent fruit of matrimony; the
                    friendships which began, continued, and then suddenly one day went pouf! in the
                    smoke of a blazing quarrel; the fights of the old<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7017-256"/> ladies for the footstools, the favourite easy-chair,
                    the best place by the fire, and the stratagems and wiles put in force for
                    victory and prior possessionâhow odd it all was! And what extraordinary people
                    came and went like shadows, or stayed as if they were coeval with the
                    foundations of the house, and as little to be moved as these!</p>
                <p>There was the bull-necked, bullet-headed bon vivant who kept the bill-of-fare up
                    to the mark, was inexorable on the subject of breakfast-bacon and soft-roed
                    herrings, and allowed of no stint in quantity nor scamping of quality.</p>
                <p>There was the dissipated young clerk who did nothing but count returned notes at
                    the Bank of England, and had no intellect for higher work had he been put to it.
                    He had a private income in excess of his salary; was given over to music-halls
                    and late hours; spent his money as if it were water running through his fingers;
                        dressed<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7017-257"/> gorgeously and wore a small
                    counter-full of jewellery; and, among other things, bought a fine carved
                    mahogany bookcase, which he stocked with novels, all in showy bindings, uncut
                    and never read.</p>
                <p>There was the well-conducted young solicitor, silent, reserved, methodicalâthe
                    best of them all; and the loose-lipped young fellow, who spluttered when he
                    spoke, and asked counsel of unmarried girls whether he should put on his thick
                    trousers or his thinner.</p>
                <p>There was the uxorious couple who made embarrassing love in public, and the
                    quarrelsome couple who were just as embarrassing in their fierce disputes; the
                    maiden lady of good family, whose feature was eyebrows, and who would have
                    sniffed at Venus herself as plebeian, had she not had the exact arch held by her
                    as a sign of birth and breeding; and there was the mincing prude who objected to
                    Cromwell âbecause<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7017-258"/> he was not a gentleman,â
                    kept a sharp look-out on the young men and was a very Cerberus to the girls.</p>
                <p>There were the girls themselvesâthe pretty, touzled, mop-headed ones, who turned
                    the heads of all the men, and had their own loves out of doors; the earnest ones
                    who had something in them, and the frivolous ones who had nothing in them; and
                    oneâthat girl who was my special friend and studied with me at the British
                    Museum. She was one of the vanguard of the independent women; but she did her
                    life's work without blare or bluster, or help from the outside; and without that
                    weakness of her sex which makes them cry out when they are hustled in the crowd
                    they have voluntarily joinedâwhich makes them think themselves aggrieved because
                    they are not aided by the men to whom they have placed themselves in opposition
                    and rivalry.</p>
                <p>Then there were the women of sixty and<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7017-259"/> upwards,
                    who chirped like birds and dressed like brides; the mother and daughter, who
                    came no one knew whence, did no one knew what, were pleasant companions and
                    charming entertainersâbut kept at a distance; the buxom widows of forty,
                    smiling, debonnaire and ready for their second bridal; and the sad-eyed ones of
                    the same age, whose weepers were as big as sails, and their crape of phenomenal
                    depth and blackness. There were the half-crazed members of well-known families
                    planted out to insure that peace at home which their odd ways disturbed; and
                    sometimes there were people whose antecedents would not bear scrutiny, and whose
                    dismissal had to be summarily given. Like the shadows of a magic lantern these
                    memories pass before me, and I ask myself: Was it really I, the man I am now,
                    who lived there as one of this strange menagerieâmyself, perhaps one of the
                    strangest of them all?</p>
                <pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7017-260"/>
                <p>Impulsive, shy, eager, enthusiastic, sensitive at all points, revelling in my
                    sense of liberty but scarcely knowing how to use it, I was like some big bird as
                    yet unfledgedâsome huge puppy as yet untrained. My kind landlady, however, liked
                    me, and did her best to warn and direct me as to my conduct in the house and the
                    intimacies to be formed or avoided among her people.</p>
                <p>âIt is a pity you should be spoilt too soon,â she said to me one day with a sigh.
                    âBoys are so nice, and men are such wretches! I wish you could be a boy for
                    ever, then you might be worth something.â</p>
                <p>âI shall be worth more when I am a man,â I laughed. âYou shall be proud of me
                    then, Smithy. Wait till my book is published, and then you will see.â</p>
                <p>âI would rather keep you as you are,â she answered. âWhen you are a man I<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7017-261"/> shall have lost you. Now you are like my own
                    boy.â</p>
                <p>âYou shall never lose me, Smithy,â I said. âI am not of the kind to change.â</p>
                <p>Dear, good, generous Miss Smith! She was only a boarding-house keeper; but she
                    was the most of a mother to me of any woman I have knownâsave poor Nurse Mary. I
                    got to like her and confide in her so intimately that it seemed strange I had
                    not known her all my life; and to the end we remained the perfectly good friends
                    we were now, when she âmotheredâ me and looked after me, and kept me, so far as
                    she could, from making mistakes and falling into mischief. If I have seemed to
                    give too much weight to this comparatively unimportant tract in my life's
                    journey, it is because it was my first field of personal freedom; and like all
                    first things it has left an indelible impression on my mind.</p>

                <p><hi>BY</hi> the end of the covenanted term I had accomplished my purpose and
                    written my novel. It was an ambitious undertaking for a 'prentice hand, but it
                    met with that kind of reception which means promise and opens the door to better
                    things. It gave me no money. On the contrary, the publication cost me fifty
                    pounds, which sum, advanced by Mr. King on the faith of my majority, was Mr.
                    Nâ's standing price for first books by young authors.</p>
                <p>I shall never forget the day when I read the first favourable notice of my
                        book,<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7017-263"/> which, strangely enough, was in the
                            <bibl><title>Times</title></bibl>. I seemed to tread on air, to walk in
                    a cloud of light, to bear on me a sign of strange and glorious significance. I
                    felt as if I must have stopped the passers-by to shake hands with them and tell
                    them it was I who had written the novel which the
                        <bibl><title>Times</title></bibl> had reviewed so well that morning. I
                    thought all the world must be talking of it, and wondering who was the unknown
                    Christopher Kirkland who, yesterday obscure, to-day famous, had so suddenly
                    flashed into the world of letters; and I longed to say that this veiled prophet,
                    this successful aspirant, was I! I remember the sunset as I went up Oxford
                    Street, to what was not yet the Marble Arch. For I could not rest in the house.
                    I could not even go home to dinner. I felt compelled to walk as if for everânot
                    like that poor wretch, for penance, over a dreary and interminable plain, but
                    through an enchanted garden of infinite beauty<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7017-264"/>
                    âto damp down the glad fever in my veins. I could only breathe out in the open.
                    I should have been stifled within the four walls of that house in Montague
                    Place.</p>
                <p>Since then I have watched with breathless emotion the opalescent skies of Venice;
                    the westering light which streams like visible prayer through the windows of St.
                    Peter's as you stand on the Pincio; the gorgeous sunsets of Naples, with that
                    burning bar drawn all across the horizon, stretching from Vesuvius to
                    infinitude; but I have never seen one to match the splendour of that sunset in
                    London, on the evening of the day when I first achieved success. For the moment
                    I was as a god among gods. My veins were filled with celestial ichor, not human
                    blood; and my mind saw what it broughtâthe infinity of glory because of that
                    intensity of joy.</p>
                <p>I turned into the Park and sat down on a bench, looking at this resplendence
                        which<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7017-265"/> was to me like a messageâa symbol of
                    my own strength and future lustre. Suddenly, as distinctly as if she had been
                    there in the body, I felt the presence of Adeline Dalrymple. It seemed to me as
                    if she stood before me, enveloping me in her personality as in the old days. I
                    seemed to feel her arms about meâas if she drew me gently to her bosom; and I
                    felt again her lips on my forehead and my eyes. Then she seemed to sit down on
                    the seat beside me, and I heard the murmur of that marvellous voice, saying
                    softly: âBy the power of Love you have come to the possession of Fame!â</p>
                <p>The full chord of divinest harmony was now complete. All my life and being were
                    swept away as by one great rush and flood of rapture, unfathomable,
                    irresistible. It was as if I heard the primal harmony whence all other music
                    flowsâas if I saw the archetype of all beauty, and felt the essence of all love
                    and joy. For that brief<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7017-266"/> moment I was in what
                    we mean by heaven; when a heavy hand was laid a little roughly on my shoulder,
                    and a harsh voice said rudely:</p>
                <p>âCome, none of this now! You mustn't sleep here, you know. Or is it drunk you
                    are?â</p>
                <p>The angel with the flaming sword who turned me so unceremoniously out of Paradise
                    was a park-keeper; and poor Icarus, my spirit, had a headlong tumble from the
                    empyrean to the dust!</p>
                <p>When the agreement between us came to an end, my father again wanted me to give
                    up my present life, go to Cambridge, put away my foolish doubts and take Orders
                    like a rational being. He ought to have known this last was impossible, granting
                    me the very elements of honesty. But he was so convinced, for his own part, of
                    the truth of Christianity and the perfectness of Anglican Protestantism, that he
                    felt sure if<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7017-267"/> I read in the orthodox direction
                    I should be also convinced. Thus he hoped that, by studying for the ministry, I
                    should by force of better reasoning abandon my errors, and at one and the same
                    time redeem my worldly position and save my soul.</p>
                <p>Naturally I resisted this plan; for I was more than ever in love with liberty and
                    literature. And as there was really nothing in my choice injurious to my family
                    nor derogatory to myself, I at last bore down my father's opposition and won his
                    consent:âI am bound by truth to add, never his cordial approval. Still, he
                    consented; and I was thus saved from the pain, as well as the disgrace and
                    wrong-doing, of flat disobedience to his will; and my home-ties remained intact.
                    And after my people had got rid of the daily irritation of my presence, and I
                    myself had learned more self-control by contact with the world, and had also
                    become less sore, because not so often wounded, we<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7017-268"/> were better friends than we had ever been before. My
                    bi-annual visits to the dear old place were purely harmonious; which my life
                    there had not been; and our mutual affection was strengthened, not weakened, by
                    the loosening of the links and the lengthening of the chain.</p>
                <p>My life, then, was finally arranged on the lines I had so long marked out for
                    myself. Now I had only to show of what stuff I was made. For the rest, my future
                    was in my own keeping.</p>
                <p>The first necessity was to get steady employment outside my novel-writing, which
                    was to be the sweet after the meat; and my ambition was that of most young
                    writers not specialistsâto get work on the press. This gradation of aim was the
                    natural result of experience. From poetry to novel-writing, and thence to
                    newspaper workâwhat an epitome of young ambition is here! I could not begin by
                    reporting, as Dickens<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7017-269"/> and Beard and Kent and
                    Hunt and, if my memory serves me, George Henry Lewes, had begun. I did not know
                    shorthandâwhich yet was easily learned. But I was too ambitious to like the idea
                    of work so unindividualized and a position so subordinate as are the work and
                    position of a reporter. I wanted to be a full-fledged leader-writer at once.
                    Wherefore I tried my hand at what was really a social essay rather than a
                    leader, on the wrongs of all savage aborigines. This I sent down to the office
                    of the â, with a letter stating the full presumption of my desires; and waited
                    for the result.</p>
                <p>Poor dear âSmithyâ had a bad time of it for the next few days. For that fatal
                    quality of concentration which has intensified every feeling and action of my
                    life was then more potent than it is even now; and there was nothing in heaven
                    nor earth, the past, the present, nor the future, save the acceptance<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7017-270"/> or rejection of that essay. The four days which
                    intervened between my letter and the answer were four days of restlessness
                    amounting to agonyâof alternate hope and fear rising into insanity. There was no
                    treading on air nor walking in a cloud of light now! It was going through the
                    Valley of the Shadow; with perhaps that fatal abyss at the end!</p>
                <p>On the fifth day I had wrestled through my torment and come out into the upper
                    air once more. My proof lay on my plate at breakfast; and with it was a letter
                    from the editor, bidding me go down to the â office to-day, at four o'clock
                    precisely.</p>
                <p>I was punctual to the moment; and with a beating heart but very high head, went
                    swinging up the narrow, dingy court into which the âeditor's entranceâ gave; and
                    then up the still narrower and still dingier stairs to a room whence I could not
                    see the street for the dirt which made the windows as<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7017-271"/> opaque as ground-glass. Here I was told to wait till
                    Mr. Dundas could see me. In about half an hour the messenger returned, and
                    ushered me into the awful presence.</p>
                <p>For in truth it was an awful presence, in more ways than one. It was not only my
                    hope and present fortune, but of itself, personally, it was formidable.</p>
                <p>A tall, cleanly-shaved, powerfully-built manâwith a smooth head of scanty red
                    hair; a mobile face instinct with passion; fiery, reddish-hazel eyes; a look of
                    supreme command; an air of ever-vibrating impatience and irascibility, and an
                    abrupt but not unkindly manner, standing with his back to the fire-placeâmade
                    half a step forward and held out his hand to me as I went into the room.</p>
                <p>âSo! you are the little boy who has written that queer book and want to be one of
                    the press-gang, are you?â he said half-smiling, and speaking in a jerky and <choice>
                        <orig>un-</orig>
                        <reg>unprepared</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7017-272"/> prepared manner, both singular and
                    reassuring.</p>
                <p>The little boy, by the way, was as tall as heâand that was two inches over six
                    feet.</p>
                <p>I took him in his humour and smiled too.</p>
                <p>âYes, I am the man,â I said.</p>
                <p>âMan, you call yourself? I call you a whipper-snapper,â he answered, always
                    good-humouredly. âBut you seem to have something in you. We'll soon find it out
                    if you have. I say though, youngster, you never wrote all that rubbish yourself!
                    Some of your elder brothers helped you. You never scratched all these queer
                    classics and mythology into your own numskull without help. At your age it is
                    impossible.â</p>
                <p>âIt may be impossible,â I laughed; âat the same time it is true. I give you my
                    word, no one helped me. No one even saw the manuscript or the proofs,â I added
                    eagerly.</p>
                <p>On which my new friend and potential<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7017-273"/> master
                    startled me as much as if he had fired off a pistol in my ear, first by his
                    laughter, and then by the volley of oaths which he rolled outâoaths of the
                    strangest compounds and oddest meanings to be heard anywhereâoaths which he
                    himself made at the moment, having a speciality that way unsurpassed,
                    unsurpassable and inimitable. But as he laughed while he blasphemed, and called
                    me âgood boyâ in the midst of his wonderful expletives, he evidently did not
                    mean mischief. And I had fortunately enough sense to understand his want of
                    malice, and to accept his manner as of the ordinary course of things.</p>
                <p>This pleased him; and after he had exhausted his momentary stock of oaths, he
                    clapped me on the back with the force of a friendly sledge-hammer, and said:</p>
                <p>âYou are a nice kind of little beggar, and I think you'll do.â</p>
                <p>Then he told me to go into the next<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7017-274"/> room to
                    write a leader on a Blue Book which he would send in to me. It was the report of
                    the Parliamentary Commission on the condition of the miners relative to the
                    âtruckâ system.</p>
                <p>âI give you three hours and a half,â he said, taking out his watch. âNot a minute
                    longer, by â. By that time your work must be done, or you'll have no supper
                    to-night! You must take the side of the men; butâd'ye hear?âyou are not to
                    assassinate the masters. Leave them a leg to stand on, and don't make Adam Smith
                    turn in his grave by any cursed theories smacking of socialism and the devil
                    knows what. Do you understand, youngster? I have had the passages marked which
                    you are to notice, and so you need not bother that silly cocoanut of yours with
                    any others. Keep to the text; write with strength; don't talk nonsense, and do
                    your work like a man. And now be off.â</p>
                <pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7017-275"/>
                <p>To my great joy and supreme good luck, I seized the spirit of my instructions,
                    and wrote a rattling, vigorous kind of paper, which pleased Mr. Dundas so much
                    that he called me a good boy twenty times with as many different oaths, and took
                    me home to dine with him. And from that day he put me on the staff of the paper,
                    and my bread-and-butter was secure.</p>
                <p>The next two years followed without any change in outward circumstances. I worked
                    hard for very moderate pay; but I was young, strong, energetic, and temperate in
                    my habits. To live was of itself good enough for me. I did not want the
                    adventitious excitement of dissipation nor luxury. My work was my pleasure, and
                    to do well was its own reward. I had that appetite for work which is the
                    essential of success on a newspaper; and I was to be relied on at a pinch as
                    well as for the day's steady routine. I filled the office of handy-<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7017-276"/> man about the paperâwas now sent down to describe a
                    fÃªte; now given a pile of books to review; sometimes set to do the work of the
                    theatrical critic when this gentleman was away; and given certain social leaders
                    to writeâbut never the political.</p>
                <p>For a young fellow as I was then, unfit for responsibility because wanting in
                    experience, this was all that I could expect. And occasionally it was more than
                    I was fit for. Twice I got the paper into trouble because of my unsound
                    political economy, and the trail of the socialistic serpent, which made itself
                    too visible for even the â; for all that this was one of our then most advanced
                    Liberal journals. But, as I was a favourite with the irascible editorâto whom
                    also I was sincerely attached, though I stood in wholesome awe of him into the
                    bargainâmy sins were forgiven. A sounder man than I was told off to reply to the
                    attacks I had drawn<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7017-277"/> down on our heads; to
                    explain away what could not be retracted; and to carry the â out of the fire.
                    And I had nothing worse to bear than an outburst of imprecations which let off
                    the steam and broke no one's bones.</p>
                <p>All the employÃ©s of the journal did not come off so well when hot water was
                    about; and some ran rough risks:âas, for instance, that poor fellow who brought
                    in either a wrong or an unpleasant messageâI forget whichâat whose head Mr.
                    Dundas hurled his heavy metal office-inkstand. The man ducked in time; but the
                    door was cut and indented where the sharp edge had struck, and blackened by a
                    stream of ink from the centre panel to the floor. Mr. Dundas showed me the place
                    with a peal of laughter and a volley of oaths, in no wise disconcerted by this
                    narrow escape from committing murder. He made it up to the man with a couple of
                    sovereigns; and when the<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7017-278"/> door had been scraped
                    and re-varnished, no more was heard of the matter. The men in the office were
                    used to his ways, and dodged him when he let flyâwaiting till the dangerous fit
                    was over. All forgave his violenceâsome because they really loved him, and some
                    because he paid them handsomely for their bruises.</p>
                <p>Mr. Dundas was a bad writer and a poor classic, and not especially well-informed
                    on any subject; but after Delane he was the best constructive as well as
                    administrative editor of his time, and knew how to choose his staff and
                    apportion his material with a discrimination that was almost like another sense.
                    He was indefatigable in his office, and finally broke down his iron constitution
                    by sheer hard work. What made the pity of it was, that this hard work was often
                    more superfluous than necessary. But this minute attention to details was his
                    point of honour, and he would not be beaten off it.<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7017-279"/> He used to wait at the â office till the first sheet
                    was printed offâtill five in the morningâand often he was so exhausted that he
                    had to be almost carried down the stairs.</p>
                <p>For all his violent temper and frightful language, he was able to dominate
                    himself with certain of his staffâtwo of whom are especially in my mind. They
                    were men of very different calibre and standing. One was the publisher of the
                    paperâan extremely timid man, who looked as if he would have died outright had
                    he been brutalized in any way; but he remained in absolute peace with Mr. Dundas
                    all the time the â lasted, and moved with him to those other offices where the
                    great weekly paper was established; and the other was his co-editorâa sensitive,
                    refined, cultured scholar, whose pride of gentlehood would not have brooked
                    affront nor submitted to insolence. To neither of these, so different as they
                    were but each so valuable, did Mr.<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7017-280"/> Dundas ever
                    go beyond the nicest line of moderation; and the last, like the first, held with
                    him to the end, and finally took the sole charge of that sharp-tongued Weekly,
                    when the fiery spirit which had first ruled it was laid to rest under that
                    melancholy monument on the Cornish coast he loved so well.</p>
                <p>To me, younger and in some sort defenceless, I confess he was at times
                    exceedingly brutal, though he was substantially kind and did what he could to
                    give me work. But his oaths used to curdle my blood; his violence was at times
                    appalling; and once he <choice>
                        <corr>forgot</corr>
                        <sic>forget</sic>
                    </choice> himself so far as to shake his fist in my face. That was when trouble
                    had come between us; and it may be easily understood that this day saw my last
                    visit to the office. It was the rift which was never mended.</p>
                <p>But this furiousness was his habit. He forgot himself in the same way even
                        with<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7017-281"/> ladiesâwitness that well-known scene,
                    when he ran along the platform as the train was moving out of the station,
                    cursing and swearing with all his might at the women he then loved best in the
                    world, because they would not do something he wished.</p>
                <p>All the same, he had his grand good points. He was generous and affectionate;
                    utterly devoid of all treacherous instincts; and he bore no malice. He was
                    brutal, if you will; but the core of him was sound; and his fidelity to his
                    friends was very beautiful. With so much that can be said less than laudatory of
                    this fierce Boanerges of the press, it is pleasant to record that which makes
                    for his renown and claims our more tender memories.</p>
                <p>I remember two notable crowds in which I found myself in these early days. One
                    was when my old friends the Chartists marched through London twenty thousand
                    strong, and I followedânot as a special<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7017-282"/>
                    constable. And the other was when Baron Rothschild addressed the people from the
                    balcony on the day of his futile election. He began his speech by these
                    words:</p>
                <p>âI stand here by the will of the people.â</p>
                <p>From the dead silence of the dense throng rose a voice clear and strong:</p>
                <p>âSo stood Barabbas!â</p>
                <p>But, Barabbas notwithstanding, after a fight of years the Jews won the day; as
                    the Roman Catholics had won theirs before them; and as Agnosticism will also win
                    in the near future.</p>
                <p>At this time I went much into society. My social place was that which naturally
                    belongs to a youngster of good birth, who, if he has not quite won his spurs,
                    may yet some day do great thingsâwho knows?âand who has good names at his back.
                    The tower of strength my grandfather the Bishop and my uncle the Dean were to
                    me! What humiliating snobs we are! I became <choice>
                        <orig>ac-</orig>
                        <reg>acquainted</reg>
                    </choice><pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7017-283"/> quainted with a few of the leaders
                    of thought already established, and some who were still preparing for the time
                    when they too should lead and no longer follow. Among others, I fell in with
                    that notorious group of Free-lovers, whose ultimate transaction was the most
                    notable example of matrimony void of contract of our day. But though those who
                    floated on the crest of the wave, and whose informal union came to be regarded
                    as a moral merit even by the strait-laced, had the more genius and the better
                    luck, he who made personal shipwreck, and from whose permitted trespass the
                    whole thing started, had the nobler nature, the more faithful heart, the more
                    constant mind, and was in every way the braver and the truer man. The one whom
                    society set itself to honour, partly because of the transcendent genius of his
                    companion, partly because of his own brilliancy and facility, was less solid
                    than specious.<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7017-284"/> The other whom all men, not
                    knowing him, reviled, was a moral hero. The former betrayed his own principles
                    when he made capital out of his âdesecrated hearthâ and bewildered society by
                    setting afloat ingenious stories of impossible ceremonies which had made his
                    informal union in a certain sense sacramental, so that he might fill his rooms
                    with ânamesâ and make his Sundays days of illustrious reception. The latter
                    accepted his position without explanation or complaint, and was faithful to his
                    flag, indifferent to selfish gain or social loss. And whether that flag embodied
                    a right principle or a wrong, his steadfastness was equally admirable, and the
                    constancy which could not be warped for loss or gain was equally heroic.</p>
                <p>It must never be forgotten too that he who afterwards posed as the fond husband
                    betrayed by the trusted friend, was, in the days when I first knew them all, the
                        most<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7017-285"/> pronounced Free-lover of the group,
                    and openly took for himself the liberty he expressly sanctioned in his wife. As
                    little as he could go into the Divorce Court for his personal relief, because of
                    that condonation and his own unclean hands, so little did he deserve the
                    sympathy of society for the transfer which afterwards he put forward as his own
                    justification and that friend's condemnation.</p>
                <p>This I say with absolute knowledge of the whole series of facts, from the
                    beginning. And I say it for sake of the truth and in the interests of
                    justiceâthough it be but justice to the dead.</p>
                <p>At the time when I first knew these people they were living in a kind of family
                    communion that was very remarkable. Sisters and cousins and brothersâsome of the
                    women married and with yearly increasing families, to which they devoted
                    themselves; others single, and of general domestic utility all<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7017-286"/> roundâclubbed together their individually thin
                    resources, and made a kind of family Agapemone which had its charm and its
                    romance. Among them were some who practised no divergence in their own lives,
                    and allowed of none in theory:âsuch as Samuel Lawrence, who was then vainly
                    giving his strength to discover the Venetian method of colouring; and that
                    handsome Egyptologist, George Gliddon, who might have thrown his handkerchief
                    where he would, but who was true to his first love, and married her when her
                    youth and beauty had long since gone, and only her truth and her lovely nature
                    remained. These and some others went with the broad current of ordinary
                    morality. But also there were, as I have said, certain Free-lovers mingled with
                    the orthodox rest; and of these the most remarkable was that faithful and
                    lovable man, that generous and patient, loyal and devoted friend, of whom I have
                    just spoken,<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7017-287"/> and whose individuality many
                    still living will recognise.</p>
                <p>I also became as intimate as a son with a father with the most famous
                    poet-scholar of our generation; the âold man eloquent,â whose mind was more
                    Greek than English, and whose hatred of political tyranny on the one side, was
                    balanced by his aristocratic exclusiveness and personal pride on the other. He
                    was of some use to me in helping me to polish my style; and he indoctrinated me
                    with an enduring horror of slang. But the crowning misfortune of my character,
                    intractibility, which has marred so much of my life, prevented my gaining as
                    much as I might by his lessons. I could accept only such things as commended
                    themselves to my own judgment. I could not accept them simply on authorityâeven
                    his. I therefore profited intellectually by this friendship less than I should
                    have done had my mind been more plastic and more<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7017-288"/> apt to subordination. But I gained all the same.</p>
                <p>I always look back to the times when I visited Mr. Landor as the most valuable
                    for lessons in self-control. I reverenced him so deeply and loved him so
                    tenderly, and the difference between our ages was so great, that I should as
                    little have thought of contradicting him as I should have thought of irritating
                    a lion. If I did not accept all he said, I never presumed to oppose him; and his
                    fiery temper subdued mine by the very force of my own love and respect. Had he
                    declared that the stars shone at mid-day, I would have answered: âYes, dear
                    father, they do;â and he would have returned, with his sweet smile: âMy good
                    Christopher!âmy good son!â Thus his temper, notoriously short in tether and
                    leonine in its wrath as it was, was never once ruffled during the whole of our
                    thirteen years of close and constant friendship; and the self-control I<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7017-289"/> was obliged to exercise was of incalculable
                    service to me.</p>
                <p>The affection between Mr. Landor and myself was very true and deep, and it began
                    at first sight and through my own enthusiasm. His âImaginary Conversationsâ was
                    one of my most cherished books. Edwin gave it to me when he came of age, and I
                    loved it better than all else I hadâsave Adeline Dalrymple's âShelley.â When I
                    was introduced to an ill-dressed and yet striking-looking old manâwith unbrushed
                    apple-pie boots; a plain shirt-front, like a night-gown, not a shirt; a wisp of
                    faded blue for all kerchief round his neck; his snuff-coloured clothes rumpled
                    and dustyâbut an old man with a face full of the majesty of thought, with a
                    compressed mouth capable of the sweetest tenderness, and an air of mental
                    grandeur all through, and was told that he was Mr. Landorâ<emph rend="sc">WALTER
                        SAVAGE LANDOR</emph>âI broke out<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7017-290"/> into an
                    ardent exclamation of joy, and showed such boyish delight as pleased him, and,
                    in a sense, took his heart by storm.</p>
                <p>âAnd who is this young fellow, who cares so much for an old man?â he said,
                    holding my hand, and perhaps not understanding what joy it was to me to see in
                    the flesh one of the great gods of my intellectual world.</p>
                <p>From that hour the thing was done. I became to him like his own son, and he was
                    my father. And as he loved me in that I was his child as well as his scholarâand
                    loved my love for him as much as he took interest in my professional careerâand
                    as we agreed in our abstract politics, and harmonized in our hatred of
                    tyrantsâwe got on together, as I say, with perfect accordâto the surprise of
                    everyone who knew my dear father-friend's peculiarities of impatience and my own
                    natural indocility.</p>
                <p>If some marvelled, others envied. Among these latter was John Forsterâthat
                        literary<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7017-291"/> Ghebir who worshipped all the
                    suns that shone, and grudged that any but himself should bask in their rays. He
                    never forgave me my intimacy with the Samson who had already generously endowed
                    him with the copyright of his books, and whose kindness, he was afraid, would be
                    diverted to me. Probably he thought I was as self-seeking as himself. In the
                    days to come he made me feel his enmity; and of all the queer things in my
                    strange life, one of the queerest is the determination with which he, first, and
                    then subsequent biographers of Mr. Landor, have agreed to ignore my friendship
                    with him. This grudgingness has gone on to the end; and I was deprived of his
                    bequest to me on a plea which was either a false pretence, or an act of
                    selfishness.</p>
                <p>In this fair city of palaces, where my dear âfather-friendâ had made his home,
                    lived a clever old lady who had once been a<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7017-292"/>
                    schoolmistress and had written a very pretty little story. She was cleverer than
                    her works; seeming to need the friction of conversation to bring out her own
                    latent fire. She was a picturesque old lady, and always dressed in very light,
                    soft grey with a profusion of white lace. After seventy, she said, all women
                    should dress in light grey and wear much white lace; so, giving the sense of
                    freshness and cleanliness. After fifty and before seventy they ought to wear
                    black. She was a great friend of Mr. Landor's; but she one day offended his
                    susceptibilities, and he broke with her, never to renew his acquaintance.
                    Courteous as he was to womenâtaking them downstairs and standing bareheaded by
                    the door of their carriages, according to the manners of the old school, and of
                    Italyâhe could be as vehement to them as to men when he was offended; and to
                    affront him once was to lose him for ever.</p>
                <pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7017-293"/>
                <p>My first friend in the city was that learned and fastidious Dr. Devise, who had
                    read too much for any good work of his own to be possible. He had, as it were,
                    smothered his originality by the enormous mass of other men's thoughts with
                    which he had loaded his brain. He was intent on writing a book which should
                    demolish all religious superstition; and he had already been many years about
                    it. The first chapter only was finished. This he had had printed as a âbrick,â
                    for private circulation. I cannot say that I was impressed by it. Seeking to be
                    comprehensive, it was wire-drawn and diluted. It read like a list of synonyms,
                    or a catalogue of intellectual processes and in the matter of literary style it
                    was singularly poor.</p>
                <p>Dr. Devise was a man who had extreme fascination for some people. One of our
                    greatest celebrities, when in the Ugly Duck stage of her existence and before
                    she had<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7017-294"/> joined her kindred Swans, had wanted
                    to dedicate her life to him. But too many other feminine interests were already
                    established to allow of the introduction of an outsider; and the friendship came
                    to a stormy end, after a more than ordinarily ardent beginning. His house was my
                    first sojourning place in Bath; but I annoyed him too, by my confessed
                    preference for the âFatherâ; and I fear he thought me both ungrateful and a
                    fool.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, he gave me one of those moral shocks which are the birth-hours of new
                    experience to youth, when, one day, he gently chid me for loving Mr. Landor
                    better than I loved him. Still gentle, but cynical as well as
                    half-compassionate, he went on to remind me that Mr. Landor had no money to
                    leave; that he had even given the copyright of his works to John Forsterâas I
                    already knewâand that his very pictures, of which he was so proud, were for the
                    most part rubbish.</p>
                <pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7017-295"/>
                <p>I never forgave this insinuation. And it did not mend matters when he spoke of
                    his own ampler means, and how he was able both to leave his family well provided
                    for and to remember congenial outsiders into the bargain. I never cared for him
                    after this. At no time of my life have I been self-seeking in friendship; and
                    legacies have come into my calculations as little as the chance of a peerage or
                    an offer of the Garter. And if this be so now, when I have learned the value of
                    money, what was it then, when I was still too young and impulsive to calculate
                    or foresee anything whatever? For all his learning and hospitality and undoubted
                    qualities, there was ever in my mind after this a repugnance to Dr. Devise which
                    lasted to the end.</p>
                <p>But I liked his cheerful, patient, blind wife, with her graceful little
                    courtesies, pretty flatteries, and craving for sympathy. And her energetic
                    sister-in-law, with her<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7017-296"/> strong brain and heart
                    of purest gold, was âAunt Susanâ to me, as she was to some others. She was a
                    passionate propagandist of freethought, and was never so happy as when giving
                    away the small tracts and bigger books which were her artillery against the
                    strongholds of superstition. Mr. Scott, of Ramsgate, found her a valuable
                    auxiliary; and she welcomed every new light with almost youthful enthusiasm. She
                    was one of the bravest of the morally brave; for she suffered keenly from that
                    kind of local ostracism, consequent on her unorthodox opinions, which in a
                    manner isolated her and reduced her society to a fewâfit, if you will, but few
                    all the same. Yet she never relaxed her propagandism, which was as much part of
                    her philanthropy as was her more direct benevolence in the matters of food and
                    flannel; and she dug her own social grave unflinchingly, if with some sighs and
                    not a few heart-aches.</p>
                <pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7017-297"/>
                <p>Dr. Devise's soft-voiced, fair-skinned daughter was also one of my chosen friends
                    at this time. Her charm lay in her marvellous power of sympathy and almost
                    godlike strength of consolation. She was like a younger daughter of Demeter, in
                    whose soft white arms the troubled might lie and be at rest. In my own dark
                    hour, which came upon me a little later, she was of divine and infinite
                    consolation. And others found in her the exquisite charm that was so patent and
                    potent to me.</p>
                <p>A kind of outlying member of this remarkable group was a certain refined and
                    thoughtful man who was in those days the ideal poet and studentâas he is now the
                    ideal scholar and philosopher. He was of all the men known to me one of the most
                    graceful in mind, most cultivated in intellect, most modest in bearing, most
                    accurate in learning, and of the purest kind of morale incarnate in human form.
                    He was<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7017-298"/> then in Orders. Subsequently he broke
                    his chains and came out into freedom and the light.</p>
                <p>There were also two learned sisters who lived near my doctor friend, and carried
                    to him a chilly worship like incense smouldering in a censer of ice. They awed
                    me by their fearful superiority. They were women who had the most extraordinary
                    power of dwarfing all other pretensions and degrading you both in your own
                    esteem and in the eyes of others. And they used this power unsparingly. They had
                    not lived down the softer follies and tender frailties of youth, for they had
                    never had any to live down, being of the tribe of the âunco' guidââthe âprigs in
                    petticoatsââfrom the beginning. Self-centred, bloodless, intellectual,
                    sarcastic, unemotional, they had no sympathy with the sorrows which sprung from
                    passion and no compassion for failure. They were like a couple of old
                        Egyptian<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7017-299"/> goddesses shot through with
                    VoltaireâPasht for the one, the Sphinx for the otherâwhile behind the mask of
                    each peered the keen satirical and mocking face of the author of âCandide.â They
                    thought me abominable, and I thought them dreadful; and there was always war
                    between us, such as Tieck or Hoffmann would have made between a couple of
                    Ice-maidens and the Fire-king.</p>
                <p>Here, I made the acquaintance of Mr. Empson, that pre-historic Ã¦sthete who did
                    his best to create a taste for minor ornamentation by skilfully combined and
                    original adaptations, and whose bric-Ã -brac shop was a favourite lounge with the
                    best people in Bath. My dear old âfatherâ was frequently there, and I with him.
                    Mr. Empson was eager for lengths of old brocades with which to line the covers
                    of his more valuable books, or to drape as curtains about his statuettes. He was
                    wonderfully sleek and silky in his<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7017-300"/> manners;
                    but I saw the reverse of the polished medal when, one day, he turned on me with
                    a sudden outburst of astounding ferocity, because I compassionated him for some
                    rheumatic ailment of which he complained.</p>
                <p>âHow can you, a strong young fellow in the beautiful morning of life, care for
                    what an old man like me suffers? I hate humbug!â he said savagely.</p>
                <p>On which I fired up and told him that he was both impolite and inhuman, and that
                    he had no right to question my sincerity unless he had found me already less
                    than honest. But these sleek, silky, smooth-mannered people are so often savage
                    when touched beneath the skin!</p>
                <p>Then I knew the charming family of that delightful Irish actor who went down in
                    the ill-fated <name>President</name>. The mother had a mania for birds and small
                    dogs, and the girls were among the prettiest in Bath.<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7017-301"/> They were of three distinct typesââpetillante,â
                    statuesque, elfinâRosina, Galatea, Fenella; and each was perfect in her
                    kind.</p>
                <p>There was also one man of whom I will only say that I thought him then, and I
                    think him now, one of the Best I have ever knownâone of those who make the
                    honour of their generation, and who help to keep society sweet and pure, because
                    entirely governed by principle. With him it was religious principle, which he
                    translated into practical and vital morals. He and my brother Godfrey stand side
                    by side under the measuring standard of human worth. The one has touched the
                    heights by faith, the other by honour. The one has learned self-command by
                    obedience, the other by self-respect. Neither could commit a dishonourable
                    action, were the noose knotted and life to be the forfeit; but the one would
                    gather his strength from religion, the other from heroismâthe one would die<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7017-302"/> with the fervour of a martyr, the other with
                    the fortitude of a Stoic.</p>
                <p>All the same, differences of method notwithstanding, they stand shoulder to
                    shoulder on the green plot of human nobleness; and no one can say that the one
                    is higher than the otherâthe one better or braver or stronger than the other.
                    They have come to the same point by different roads; and the modes of faith for
                    which graceless zealots fight are emphatically of no account with such as these,
                    whose lives are so eminently in the right.</p>
