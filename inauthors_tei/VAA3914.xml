                                          <p>I meant to come straight home after I left Charlecote.
                                                 I started by way of Tiddington Road and got as far

                                                 thoughts I crossed the Meadows and went up by the

                                          <p>I had heard it said the Queen and her ladies had come
                                                 for a peaceful New Year&apos;s even, and had
                                                 ridden forth for an airing. You know how I relished
                                                 the sight of our Queen at Kenilworth last July, so

                                   E. The plan derives its name from three projecting entrances in
                                   the facade, each provided with a porch. These gave the ground

                            <p>This play for children, selected from hundreds of manuscripts
                                   submitted in the contest, won the prize offered by the Drama
                                   League of America. The story is of a princess who remains true to
                                   her ideals despite the temptations of circumstances and the
                                   obstacles which seek to prevent her from fulfilling her duty to
                                   the people over whom she rules. In the end she is happily
                                   rewarded, as is natural for so steadfast a heroine. The play is
                                   of the sort which children enjoy giving as well as seeing.</p>

                                   years in the juvenile book world. The volumes have all been well
                                   planned. The authors have, without exception, known how to
                                   secure, and hold the attention of the average boy and girl. They
                                   have written entertainingly, without sacrifice of facts. Each
                                   book gives a full length picture of the particular great man with
