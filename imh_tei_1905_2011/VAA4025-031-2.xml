            <p>While engaged in some researches into the origins of civilization and culture in Indiana, the
                    writer's interest was drawn to William Maclure. The purpose in calling attention to him
                    goes beyond his connection with the origins of Hoosier culture, however, and is threefold: First,
                    his unusually varied and useful career merits discussion. Second, his relation to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> Movement and his subsequent influence within the state of Indiana deserve considerable
                    notice. Third, his ideas concerning social and economic subjects are worthy of some study, in the
                    light of contemporary developments in these fields.</p>
            <p>The record of Maclure's life reminds one of the career of that recent hero of
                    fiction—the cosmopolitan Anthony Adverse. <placeName>

                    to his adopted country he was successful. Wherever he went he observed and collected items of

                    promote state geological surveys, and those which he lived to see completed usually confirmed his

                    this Academy from 1818 till his death in 1840. About the time that he became its President, he gave
                    to the Academy his library of 1,500 volumes. Later, in 1835, he transferred to it over 2,250 volumes

            </p>
            <p>In 1816 and 1817, he, with his friend Charles Lesueur, visited over twenty islands of the West Indies
                    to collect scientific data. In 1819 he went first to <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> and thence to <placeName>
                        <country reg="sp">Spain</country>

                    returned to the church and the money he had invested in it was lost. It was with this project for an
                    agricultural school still in mind that he joined the <placeName>

            <p>The connection of William Maclure with the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> experiment has received less attention than it deserves. It is possible that the
                    attention centered by historians upon Robert Owen may have tended to obscure the achievements of
                    Maclure. Clearly Maclure was not so important to the colony as was <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName>, but he was a financial partner with him in the enterprise, and was second in
                    importance only to him. Maclure, like <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName>, was a successful business man, a philanthropist, and a social theorist. Unlike him, he
                    was not a socialist, but a man of utilitarian tendencies and a believer in democracy. His interest
                    in the colony was aroused because it offered an opportunity to introduce the Pestalozzian system of
                    education, which he had observed in Europe, and in which he was a thorough believer. He considered
                    the educational experiments to be the most important part of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> program.<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Maclure was about eight years older than <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Owen</region>
                    </placeName>, whose friendship he had gained by a visit to New Lanark, <placeName>
                        <country reg="stk">Scotland</country>
                    </placeName>. When Owen came to America, he met Maclure in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Philadelphia</settlement>
                    </placeName> and secured his promise of cooperation, which was forthcoming in several ways, even to
                    the investment of about $150,000 in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> project, a sum comparable to that supplied by Owen himself.<hi rend="sup">8</hi> To
                    Maclure must go the credit for inducing the more prominent members of "the boat load of
                    Knowledge" to join the movement. Thomas Say, Gerard Troost, Charles Lesueur and Constantine
                    Rafinesque were younger men of Maclure's acquaintance who like him were pioneer students of
                    natural science. Maclure also secured the services of Joseph Neef, a pupil of Pestalozzi, as teacher
                    in his school. It was the later influence of these men in science and education that made the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> effort of permanent importance despite its lack of success in achieving the primary
                    purpose of its founder. Robert Owen's permanent influence, it is true, was manifested in
                    the careers of three of his sons, who remained in Indiana. Yet it is worth noting that two of them
                    were geologists, <list type="footnotes">

                    state's productivity in a literary way in later times. While the evidence on this point is
                    not conclusive, there can be no doubt that the knowledge of many a frontier town was increased and
                    that the classics were made familiar to many boys and girls of studious inclinations. Thus was the
                    influence of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Harmony</settlement>
                    </placeName> felt in a lasting way over all the Hoosier State. Thomas Riley Marshall, whose early
                    years were spent in the northern part of the state, was undoubtedly speaking from personal
                    experience when he attributed the Hoosier "literary fecundity and facility of speech more
                    to the traveling library than to any other cause."<hi rend="sup">17</hi> A present day
                    historian says, with reference to the township libraries: "It became traditional in Indiana
                    that such collections helped the literary talent and the intelligence of the reading public of that
                        state."<hi rend="sup">18</hi> If there is any validity in this tradition, the ultimate
                    credit should go to William Maclure.</p>
            <p>Of particular interest are Maclure's beliefs in regard to education, economics, and
                    government. He viewed these subjects with a breadth altogether too seldom encountered among men of
                    science. In fact, he may be regarded, as one of the earliest sociologists. He entertained many
                    opinions, not widely countenanced in his day, which have a familiar sound to us today. He is another
                    of those men so often met in history who lived before his time.</p>
            <p>Maclure was an early adherent of the Pestalozzian system of education. He wished to include only
                    subjects of practical value; utility was his guiding principle. Subjects of special value he
                    believed to be Natural History, Mineralogy, Geology, Botany, Zoology, Arithmetic, Mechanics, Natural
                    Philosophy, Geography, Astronomy, and to a lesser extent, Drawing and Chemistry. In keeping with his
                    utilitarian views he argued that teachers should be paid according to their success. He was
                    especially outspoken against romanticism in literature which he held to be responsible for false
                    modesty and sickly sentiment. He pointed out that "of all the animals, man is the only one
                    that is ashamed of his own body." <list type="footnotes">

                    committing to memory without regard to content. He believed the self-educated man to be the most
                    useful, comparing time serving in colleges to the apprentice system of the middle ages.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> It may be noted that the educational leaders of today have discarded the
                    disciplinary theory, and that the recent report of the Carnegie Foundation on college education has
                    much to say in condemnation of time serving and credit getting. He believed that children should be
                    taught positive facts or truths not speculative. His objection to religion was on account of its

                    concrete situation, pointing out that "under a government of universal suffrage, there is
                    not a free school in the [western] country, though the means of defraying the expenses have been

                    "industrious millions." His social program may be illustrated by the following
                    from one of his essays: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            hewers of wood and drawers of water. Whence are the millions to expect aid or assistance?
                            From themselves—from the only class, that is interested in their welfare.
                            … Knowledge has long been considered as power.</p>

            <p>This expresses clearly his belief that democracy is a practical form of government if the masses are
                    educated to the realities of life, a belief also enunciated by Thomas Jefferson. Maclure would

            <p>Some of his economic views are equally remarkable for foresight and practical analysis. For example,
                    his opinions on the impolicy of indirect taxes. He objected to taxation of this nature for these
                    reasons: it burdens the millions unduly; expensive machinery is necessary to collect it; it is
                    uncertain, and fails when most needed; there is too much graft in collecting it; it does not fall on
                    actual property. He advocated a tax on bank shares, and dividends from roads, canals, insurance, and

            <p>By an analysis of the war of 1812, Maclure demonstrated that the rich gained by it and the poor paid
                    for it eventually though indirectly. He questioned the right of government to carry a national debt
                    for this purpose. "In an elective government, where the millions pay punctually both
                    principal and interest … it may be a query, whether any number of citizens have a right
                    to bind the rest to the payment of a debt contracted towards their fellow citizens, for the benefit
                    of those who expended it. …"<hi rend="sup">30</hi> The same query has arisen in

                    a fort built by Francois Morgan de Vincennes, probably as early as 1702, the fort which was captured

                    operation of a ferry within three miles of a toll bridge.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> The bridge had been
                    in service only a few months when it was the victim of an unusual accident. On April 19, 1869, a
                    near cyclone passed over the city unroofing many buildings and wrecking two covered spans on the
                    Indiana side of the river.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> When the bridge was wrecked, the law was in effect

            <p>Naturally there was agitation to repair or replace the wrecked spans of the bridge but apparently the
                    Company was financially unable to undertake the work as on April 19, 1869, the City Council was
                    asked to appropriate $15,000 for that purpose.<hi rend="sup">13</hi> After discussing the
                    problem until June 21, 1869, it was finally decided that the city would borrow and loan the
                    Drawbridge Company a maximum of $6,000 to be used for the repair of the bridge. The city
                    ordinance of that date specified that the Drawbridge Company was to give a mortgage on all the
                    property of the Company and that all tolls, less sums for maintenance, should be deposited each
                    month with the city treasurer until the loan should be paid. It was further required that Charles
                    Dawes, or some other mechanic, to be approved by the Council, should superintend the work. Bills
                    were to be paid by order of the Council on presentation by Dawes.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> On September

                    them. It is interesting to note that in the Council meeting of June 19, 1875, the Bridge Committee
                    was instructed to inquire if the Drawbridge Company directors had let a contract for the replacement
                    of the two weak spans by new iron spans. It was stated that the city owned more than half of the
                    capital stock, and it can be deduced that the Council felt that the members should be consulted in
                    regard to any contract. The Drawbridge Company directors later supplied the Council with data in
                    regard to the contract and specifications, and on June 28, 1875, a contract was let to the Massillon
                    Iron Bridge Company of Massillon, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>, for the replacement of the two unsafe spans. The contract price was $10,000

                    legal questions involved, but finally the City Council set January 1, 1889, as the date when toll
                    collections should cease.<hi rend="sup">18</hi> The Drawbridge Company had paid dividends from time
                    to time as is evidenced by records of the Council and City treasurer, but the amounts were not large
                    and the stockholders were willing to pass on to the general public the responsibility of maintaining
                    an aging bridge. For the next thirty-two years, the City kept the bridge in repair, but found it a
                    continual burden as various parts of the wooden structure had to be repaired or replaced from time
                    to time. In 1905, or near that time, concrete toe-walls were placed around the abutments.<hi rend="sup">19</hi>

                    </placeName> Division of Highways, in collaboration with the Indiana State Highway Commission,
                    proceeded with the preparation of plans for a high level steel truss bridge down stream from the old
                    bridge. Construction funds were not immediately available and work was indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p>The old timber spans on the <placeName>

                    the bridge itself without decreasing its strength. By 1925, the timbers at the bearing points and at
                    some other parts of the trusses had rotted badly and it was necessary to prop up the spans by
                    placing timber bents under the trusses. A bent was placed at each end of one span and at one end of
                    the other. A few months later, protecting timber cutwaters were built, bents were placed under the
                    center of each span and some of the web members in the middle of each span were reinforced.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> Late in 1926, the old timber spans, in spite of all the work done on them,
                    were no longer safe and a contract was entered into with the Vincennes Bridge Company of <placeName>

                    1929 it was found necessary to replace the swing span of the old bridge with two steel spans in
                    order to keep it in service until the memorial bridge could be completed. The two steel spans were
                    constructed by the Vincennes Bridge Company.<hi rend="sup">23</hi>

                    boat weaving drunkenly in the strong current, the ferry operators finally disengaged the drift, and
                    the ferry proceeded across the river. The replacement of the swing span was accomplished by erecting
                    the new spans alongside the old and moving them in while traffic was halted temporarily.</p>
            <p>At the present time [December, 1934], the George Rogers Clark Memorial with its attending landscaping
                    is practically completed so that a new era has begun. Let us hope that the beautiful new bridge may
                    have a span of useful life of longer duration than did the first bridge which served for sixty-four
                    years, and that the new structure may not experience the vicissitudes of that unlucky product of a
                    pioneer age.</p>

            <p>In 1867–68, the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> Drawbridge Company, with Cyrus M. Allen and <placeName>

                    </placeName> &amp; Hinckley as the contractors, constructed the Main Street bridge. In 1869 the
                    same company, with Charles Dawes as Superintendent of the work, repaired two spans of the bridge on
                    the Indiana side of the river. In 1875 the Bridge Company employed the Massillon Iron Bridge Company
                    to replace the two spans on the Indiana side at a cost of $10,000.</p>
            <p>In 1921, the Indiana State Highway Commission, acting for Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, employed Thomas J. Edwards and Son to put a new floor in the bridge at a cost of
                    $5,014.81. The materials were obtained from the Simpson Lumber Company.</p>
            <p>In February, 1925, The Indiana Commission, again acting for Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, employed the Vincennes Bridge Company to repair two spans of the bridge on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> side, at a cost of $3,118.85. In December of the same year, further repairs
                    were made on the same spans by the Vincennes Bridge Company, at a cost of $4,499.70. For
                    the repairs of 1921 and 1925, the Indiana Highway Commission furnished further materials valued at
                    about $1,000.</p>
            <p>The most extensive repairs ever made on the old bridge, were completed in 1926–27, by the
                    Vincennes Bridge Company, under the direction of the Indiana State Commission acting for Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>. Two spans on the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> side were entirely replaced, the cost being $28,043.49. The following year,
                    the Mott Core Drilling Company of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Huntington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, West <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, completed some foundation borings at a cost of $1,032. In 1929, the Indiana
                    Commission, acting for the two states, engaged the Vincennes Bridge Company to replace the
                    swing-span of the bridge with two steel spans, which cost $12,305.97.</p>
            <p>It was in the year 1931, that the State Highway Commission, acting for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> as well as for Indiana, employed the Ferguson Construction Company and Donald B.
                    Ferguson to <pb n="100" id="VAA4025-031-2-018"/> construct the new <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Vigo</region>
                    </placeName> Street. This splendid work was finished in 1932, at a cost of more than a quarter
                    million dollars, the exact sum being $259,026.94. The old Vincennes Bridge at the end of
                    Main Street was dismantled in 1932 by the Ferguson Construction Company as a part of their contract.
                    For the steel and timber salvaged from the old bridge, the Vincennes Bridge Company paid
                    $1,557, that company being the highest bidder.</p>

            <p>The truss members were designated as though each half was a simple span supported at the ends, except
                    that the change in inclination of the main web members was placed one panel point off center away
                    from the center pier. The center support was a combination of rim and center bearing. The dead and
                    live loads were transmitted to a framework of beams under the floor and over the pier. The center
                    bearing and drum were framed to the underside of the beams. The drum was supported on small
                    wide-rimed wheels turning on axles radiating from a collar around the center bearing. The wheel
                    track and rack were in one piece, the rack and pinion being on the outside. The span was turned by
                    man-power, a crank being applied to a spindle rising vertically from the pinion to the floor level.</p>

                    </placeName> in May, 1846, was determined by the vote of a farmhand in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">DeKalb County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, in the fall election of 1842. Such at least was the story told throughout the
                    state for many years after the event. Party organizers employed it in their efforts to impress upon
                    the minds of voters the necessity of going to the polls and voting on election day. The possible
                    consequences that hung upon a single vote were brought home with all the impressiveness the
                    organizer could command. Whether this assertion was or was not extravagant, the story of the
                    circumstances under which the farm hand voted and of the resultant consequences is most interesting.
                    Even if it be insisted that it is not conclusive in establishing the truth of the original claim
                    made for it, it does both "point a moral and adorn a tale."</p>
            <p>Upon the results of the Indiana State election of 1842 depended the election of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator, and this being long before the day of the primary and the seventeenth
                    amendment to the Constitution providing for the election of senators by the direct vote of the
                    people, the complexion of the Legislature then selected would determine who the senator should be
                    and the party to which he should belong. In 1842–43, the candidates were Oliver H. Smith,
                    the Whig Senator up for re-election, and General Tilghman A. Howard, a Democrat. Both men were
                    prominent, worthy and capable, and there was no other thought than that one of them would be elected
                    depending on which party elected the majority of the Legislature.</p>

            <p>Marsh contested the election, claiming that the election officers of Smithfield Township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">DeKalb County</region>
                    </placeName>, had illegally rejected the ballot of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Henry</settlement>
                    </placeName> Shoemaker, which, had it been counted, would have given Marsh an additional vote in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">DeKalb County</region>
                    </placeName>, thereby giving him a total of 361 votes in the combined returns, and a seat in the
                    house.</p>
            <p>Shoemaker was the farm-hand in the picture, and the story as brought out by the Committee on
                    Elections of the Indiana House of Representatives was that during the campaign, Candidate Marsh in
                    the course of his campaigning met Shoemaker and exacted from him a promise to vote for him on
                    election day. The story proceeds to disclose that on the afternoon of election day Shoemaker had
                    suddenly recalled his forgotten promise to Marsh. He worked on a farm about twelve miles from the
                    polling place, but in order to keep his pledge he put a saddle on a horse and rode into
                    Kendallville, arriving late in the afternoon. At the polls he asked for a ticket and discovered that
                    the one handed him did not contain Marsh's name. Proceeding with the details, it was
                    developed that the election officers did not have a ticket containing the names desired by
                    Shoemaker, who because of this, took two or three tickets which were given him by the inspector, and
                    with a pen-knife cut from one or another the names he wanted, the process resulting in his having a
                    ticket made up of four pieces. These he rolled together, wrapping three in the fourth piece, and
                    gave them to the inspector, who accepted them and put them in the ballot box. Shoemaker stayed
                    around the polls for an hour or more after voting and nothing was said by any of the election
                    officers that suggested any dissatisfaction on their part with the character of Shoemaker's
                    ticket, as finally made up. Nor was anything said of any purpose to reject the ticket when the time
                    came for counting the votes. However, the inspector threw out the Shoemaker ticket when it was
                    reached in the count, thereby depriving Marsh of that vote, which would have given him a majority
                    had it been counted.</p>
            <p>When the contest reached trial, all the circumstances attending <pb n="106" id="VAA4025-031-2-024"/>
                    the making up of Shoemaker's vote were brought out in elaborate detail by the Elections
                    Committee—how Shoemaker had to resort to the use of several tickets in order to get the
                    names of his choice because the election officials did not have the particular ticket he
                    wanted—how the inspector had loaned Shoemaker his own sharp pocket-knife for use in
                    cutting out the names, etc. Marsh claimed that the Shoemaker vote was legal, and the Committee on
                    Elections so held, in which decision it was sustained by the whole House, and Marsh was seated by
                    the adoption of a formal resolution that he was entitled to the seat.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marsh was a Democrat, and on the election of a <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator voted first for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Howard</region>
                    </placeName>, and when Howard's name was dropped he voted for Edward A. Hannegan, his name
                    having then been brought forward, thereby giving Hannegan a majority over Smith and electing him to
                    the Senate. Had Shoemaker's vote been rejected and neither Beall nor Marsh seated, neither
                    having received a majority of all votes cast, seventy-five votes in the Legislature would have been
                    a majority and Smith would have been re-elected on the second ballot.</p>
            <p>To everybody's surprise the first ballot stood <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Howard</region>
                    </placeName>, 74; Smith, 72; and Hannegan, 3. On the second ballot Smith received 75 votes, within
                    one of the 76 necessary for election. On the sixth ballot, the Democrats having then deserted
                    General Howard, Hannegan received the 76 votes necessary for election.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Thus it

                    urgent. The sentiment of the Senate as to whether such a declaration was to be made was very evenly
                    divided, and a caucus of the Democratic Senators constituting a majority was called to determine the
                    course of action. The vote was a tie, Senator Hannegan being absent. The matter was allowed to
                    remain as it was until Hannegan could be found. He was sent for and brought immediately into the
                    caucus where he promptly voted "aye," thus breaking the tie and fixing the policy

                    </placeName>, where Daniel Kelso was elected representative. Kelso was a Whig and it was never
                    doubted that he would vote for his party candidate, Senator Oliver H. Smith. However, Kelso voted
                    for Hannegan from first to last and the reason as subsequently given for his action provided
                    something in the nature of a parellel for the tale above narrated.</p>
            <p>This story was that Hannegan, as a lawyer, had defended a citizen of <placeName>
                        <country reg="sz">Switzerland</country>
                    </placeName> County against a charge of murder, and had secured his acquittal. Hannegan was a great
                    orator, and it was said of this particular trial that judge, jury, and spectators were moved to
                    tears by the eloquence of his plea for his client. The man was very poor and could pay Hannegan
                    nothing, but he recognized his great obligation to his attorney and vowed that if opportunity ever
                    presented, he would go to the ends of the earth to serve Hannegan, and duly impressed all this upon
                    his son. The client was dead before this particular election came on, but the son survived him
                    though he was himself now in an advanced stage of tuberculosis. Kelso was said to have gone to the
                    home of the invalid son whom he persuaded to go to the polls with him and to vote for him. The sick
                    man consented <list type="footnotes">

                    candidate before the Legislature, Kelso would vote for him for Senator. Kelso was elected by one
                    vote and is said to have justified his conduct in deserting Senator Smith, the candidate of his
                    party, on the ground that he could not have been elected to his seat in the Legislature had it not
                    been for the vote of the invalid to whom he had made a sacred promise.</p>

                    in 1858, a volume of very interesting stories under the title <hi rend="i">Early Indiana Trials and
                        Sketches.</hi> In a chapter of this volume he tells of the senatorial election of 1842, of the
                    defeat of himself and General Howard, and of the election of Hannegan. Singularly enough he makes no
                    mention of either the Marsh or the Kelso stories, attributing his defeat rather to what he denounced
                    as the perfidy of Senator Hoover of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Wayne County</region>
                    </placeName>, alleging the breaking of a promise, and of Kelso's desertion of his party.
                    Smith avers that while Hoover was a Democrat elected from a county having a heavy Whig majority, he
                    had repeatedly promised to vote for Smith for <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator and that he was elected only upon that definite understanding. However, after
                    having voted for Smith on the first tnd second ballots, Hoover then went to Hannegan. As for Kelso,
                    Senator Smith satisfies himself by accusing him of having treacherously deserted his party.<hi rend="sup">4</hi>

            <p>So far as is known to the writer, there was never any proof of the story regarding the murder trial
                    and consequent gratitude of the son of the accused man or of Kelso's story. J. Wesley
                    Whicker, an old friend of the writer, published a book in 1916 under the title, <hi rend="i">Historical Sketches of <geogName>Wabash Valley</geogName>
               </hi>, in which he told the Kelso
                    story about as it appears above.<hi rend="sup">5</hi> It may be true, but, if it is based upon
                    anything more than tradition, the writer has been unable to find a record of it. The story of the
                    election of Marsh is definitely and truly established in the records of the Legislature.<hi rend="sup">6</hi> The few embellishing details which are omitted in the official record were
                    supplied by the newspapers of the day. There can be no question whatever as to its accuracy.</p>

            <p>"If old houses had tongues what interesting stories they could tell!" Really such
                    houses do not need tongues—they do talk and what intriguing raconteurs they prove
                    themselves to be! <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> is full of these old residences. One of the best known is the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Sullivan</region>
                    </placeName> House, built in 1816, when James Madison was President, the first brick dwelling more
                    than one story high in the town. The great-great-grandfather of ex-Mayor Reginald Sullivan of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the builder and owner. In all the long career of this old mansion only three
                    families besides the Sullivans have dwelt in it. It is located on Second Street and, like an old
                    soldier at attention, stands proudly erect, as if with its thick walls, it is ready to defy the
                    tooth of the big bad wolf, time, for another century or two. It was restored, not remodeled, in 1927
                    by its present owners, Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Gibb, who have made an Old Curiosity Shop of it.</p>
            <p>The front, which is two full stories, faces Second Street while the third story, topped by funny
                    Siamese twin-like chimneys, runs up on the garden side like a feather in a lady's hat. This
                    old fashioned garden, enclosed by a brick wall, extends to the corner of the street. The entrance to
                    the mansion is not in the middle with a window on each side, but seems to have edged down to the
                    west end, politely giving place to the two shuttered windows, all balanced neatly by three windows
                    above, surmounted by an engaging old cornice. The brass-knobbed entrance door has an alluring fan
                    shaped transom and side windows, above which swings an antique lantern, symbol of what may be seen
                    within. The quaint little old stoop is ascended by a few curved stone steps, guarded by an old iron
                    railing that curves artistically with the curve of the steps, strangely satisfying to the eye. One
                    does not need to be told that this was the original entrance.</p>
            <p>The broad hall has queer old wall paper, a reproduction of the style it wore in its youth, and boasts
                    an historic old mirror and other hall furniture that is calculated to set the heart of the antique
                    collector a-flutter. At the right are double parlors in each of which are still the original wooden
                    mantels. Wooden cornices are over all the windows and <pb n="110" id="VAA4025-031-2-028"/> the
                    double wooden doors. The latter are nine feet high, with double crossed panelings and ornamented
                    with beautiful fine flutings—all of the Federal era. The floors down stairs are all the
                    original ones, of white ash.</p>
            <p>The hall leads into the dining room, which is long with wainscoting characteristic of the period. A
                    door opens on an immense side screened porch, twelve feet wide and some thirty-five long, which
                    fronts on the flower garden. Behind the dining room is the kitchen, the only part of the house at
                    all modernized, though it still retains its white ash floor. An enclosed back stair leads from this
                    room to the second story. But it will be best to go back to the hall and ascend the front stairway
                    with its cherry rail and easy tread and grandfather's clock, keeping watch at the head.</p>
            <p>The second floor of the building has a hall and four bedrooms, each more lovely than the last. Here
                    are the proverbial two or three steps up or down from the hall to these rooms or to the side porch
                    which is a "double decker," with an inviting old wooden settee so hospitable that
                    it costs a painful effort to refuse to stop awhile. One bedroom is a study in green with a priceless
                    old wagon-top canopy bed; another's prevailing color is blue with a Jenny Lind bed. A third
                    is in rose color and has a cherry pilaster bed, while the fourth has a rosewood four-poster and
                    built-in cupboards, almost the width of the room, with countless drawers and doors. In all of these
                    rooms the wall paper harmonizes with the quaint old pictures, rugs, coverlids, chairs and other
                    furniture. Two bathrooms are additions of a recent period.</p>
            <p>There is a third floor which is all one room—and such a room as should be an
                    artist's study. There is a plank floor sixteen feet wide at the entrance and a queer little
                    balcony off the square landing, lighted by a window. The stair doubles on itself so you can stand at
                    the bottom and look up, as through a rectangular funnel, or at the top and gaze down.</p>
            <p>The wonderful, old basement of the house is such as you find only in fine, old residences of a
                    previous era, like the Phineas <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. An enclosed, very steep stairway leads to it. With walls of limestone, sandstone and
                    Indiana granite, it has six rooms! One was evidently the kitchen in early days and still preserves
                    its gigantic open-mouthed fireplace and <pb n="111" id="VAA4025-031-2-029"/> original hearth. Here
                    is a crane with suspended kettle as if ready at any time to furnish a cup of tea since the days of
                    John Alden and Priscilla. A spinning wheel is cozily adjacent, but so are candle-molds, winding
                    blades, splint bottomed chairs, and a funny, old broom. There are rare old pieces of china on the
                    mantel shelf. An old musket rests above the fireplace and an old lantern stands ready for use at the
                    side. All bespeak the lights and shades of pioneer days.</p>
            <p>The entire house is filled with antiques. On the parlor walls are interesting old portraits, two of
                    which deserve especial attention. One of them is the likeness of Christopher Coffin, early
                    Postmaster of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and an ancestor of Mrs. Gibb. Another is that of her great-great-grandfather (a
                    traditional relative of Benjamin Franklin) who was captain of an oil whaler, and a resident, when on
                    land, of Nantucket. In an issue of <hi rend="i">Country Life</hi> of 1927 appeared pictures and a
                    description of Moore's End, the home of Mrs. Gibb's ancestors. Happy indeed are
                    those who sometimes obtain the privilege of lodging in the old <placeName>

            <p>My first recollection of my grandfather, Ulysses Philip Schenck, was as a very little girl sitting on
                    his knee braiding and unbraiding his soft white hair, which fell, with the promise of a curl to the
                    nape of his neck. He was tall and of massive frame—bone and muscle sparsley covered with
                    flesh. His head was large, forehead broad and face clean shaven, with nothing to conceal the
                    firmness of his chin and the remarkable thinness of his lips.</p>
            <p>My grandmother, Justine Thiebauld Schenck, who in her way was as big a personality as my grandfather
                    in his, was of medium height and comfortably broad. Although two years his senior, her fair hair,
                    parted in middle and drawn down over her ears, was but slightly sprinkled with grey under the black
                    lace-cap which partly covered it.</p>
            <p>The large, stately, colonial red-brick house with its white pillars and green shutters furnished a
                    proper setting for these two. Built by my grandfather in the early forties on the hillside
                    over-looking the river at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it had a dining-room and kitchen in the basement with a wide hall through the center
                    from North to South, and partitions from East to West that divided each floor into four big, corner
                    rooms with windows in two directions. This was the simple architecture of the house, but its glory
                    lay in two features: the three-story white-pillared porches facing the river; and the stairway,
                    extending in one long spiral from the first floor to the attic where it looked into a skylight.</p>
            <p>When my grandfather was having this building constructed, the architect, Mr. Francis Costigan, was
                    designing some remarkable buildings in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and other parts of the state, so grandfather sent to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName> and contracted with him to build his stairway for $1500. The house itself
                    was probably built by the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> architect, Kyle, though his name, as has been erroneously stated, is not to be found on
                    the newel post of the stairway.</p>
            <p>The yard had its own distinctive charm as well as the house. It sloped a velvety sward toward the
                    river. A neat cobble-stone walk, made of small round boulders, kept free of weeds and bordered by
                    long narrow flat stones led from <pb n="113" id="VAA4025-031-2-031"/> the wrought-iron gate to the
                    front door where it divided into two paths, one going around each side of the house down to the
                    grape arbor which extended the full length of the basement porch and far beyond at each end like
                    wings.</p>
            <p>Beneath the West end of the arbor was the deep pit where grandmother, under a glass frame, kept her
                    flowers in Winter. On the West side of the yard was also the magnolia, where it could catch the last
                    rays of the sun, nevertheless having to be swathed in straw and boxed during the Winter months while
                    the oleanders, so greatly cherished, had to be carried in their tubs to the cellar.</p>
            <p>Flowers were an important part of grandmother's life and when the voices of her children
                    were forever stilled they filled many a lonely hour making her life fragrant with their beauty. In
                    the summer time, her yard was full of them. Besides the oleanders and creamy magnolias of the sunny
                    South, there were the lilacs, snowballs and syringas of the North, along with lilies, roses and
                    geraniums of every kind. The old French ladies vied with one another in getting the rarest flowers.
                    When grandmother went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>, a visit to the florists was as much a matter of course as a visit to Shillitos, while
                    the captains of grandfathers boats had orders to bring up from the South any shrub or plant that
                    could withstand the rigors of our northern climate.</p>
            <p>On the east side of the yard was the ice house, a conical shaped brick building partly buried in the
                    ground so that the entrance was several steps down. For years it had been grandfather's
                    custom to have his ice cut in the winter and stored in saw dust in this building for summer use, but
                    that was no longer necessary. A <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> citizen found it profitable to cut and store ice to peddle to the whole community
                    during the warm months, so grandfather closed his ice house and became a customer.</p>
            <p>Opposite the chicken-house and yard was the kitchen garden with some fruit trees and a row of currant
                    and gooseberry bushes. Of these same currant and gooseberry bushes, I learned a lesson in
                    thoroughness. Grandmother always shared her fruit with her two daughters-in-law and, as the youngest
                    in our family, it fell to my lot to pick our share. Grandmother's orders were quite
                    explicit—"Pick each branch <pb n="114" id="VAA4025-031-2-032"/> clean before
                    going to the next one"—and grandmother's orders were not easily
                    disobeyed.</p>
            <p>Just below the house and garden was a pasture with a running brook for the comfort of
                    "Fannie" and the cow where they could always be watched from the sitting room
                    windows or from behind the white columns on the porch. Thus on one small space right in the heart of
                    the town was brought together many of the various things which supplied the needs and comforts of a
                    family.</p>
            <p>During my childhood, life in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was quiet and uneventful, but for one who loved beauty, the hills with their fresh
                    green foliage or autumn tints, their changing lights and shadows and soft blue haze, the winding
                    river, the blue sky with its fleecy clouds and gorgeous sunsets, the many flowers and singing birds
                    filled it full of charm. On Summer evenings and afternoons driving was the chief diversion, for many
                    of the townspeople kept a horse and buggy, and those who did not, could usually afford the price of
                    a "rig" at one of three livery stables, for a Sunday afternoon at least.</p>
            <p>One drove up the river road to the cemetery and then on to Markland, now the site of the government
                    dam, or down the river road to Lamb, just opposite Carrollton, going a little farther, sometimes, if
                    one were not particular about returning to the evening service. If provided with a good horse, one
                    might take the Mt. Sterling Pike, slowly mounting by the Horseshoe Bend to the top of the hills,
                    which formed a high ridge behind the town. The view along the way, as one slowly wound around the
                    bend through the narrow valley fully warranted the long pull, for the town below peeping through the
                    foliage of its many trees was picturesque, while the river and the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> hills were impressive. At the top, a narrow white road stretched far into the distance,
                    rising and falling with the rolling country, while on either side fertile fields extended to the
                    hills rising up from Indian Creek on the one hand and the <geogName>Ohio River</geogName> on the
                    other.</p>
            <p>One other Sunday diversion that was more exciting than driving was going to the river to see the
                    boats land. Of course, if one did not drive too far and the boats did not arrive too early one might
                    experience both pleasures on the same afternoon. There were two boats a day, "an up boat
                    and a down boat", carrying mail and passengers between <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <pb n="115" id="VAA4025-031-2-033"/> and <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was the halfway point and sometimes the boats met at its wharf. On week days the trip
                    was made at night but on Sundays the boats left the respective cities at nine A.M., and arrived at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> sometime during the afternoon, depending on the stage of water and the amount of
                    freight to be loaded and unloaded.</p>
            <p>These Sunday boat landings were often the only break in the week's monotony, and were
                    especially appreciated by the young people. It was cool by the waters edge, and a pleasant meeting
                    place for the exchange of banter, while, for some of the girls, there was the added thrill of a
                    flirtation with the river men, among whom <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName> was noted for its pretty girls.</p>
            <p>The landing of a boat was always an interesting sight. It glided toward the wharf, and when near
                    gracefully swung about facing in the opposite direction. Then the engine bells rang, the engine was
                    reversed and in the midst of a breathless silence the boat slowly nosed its way to the wharf, the
                    roustabouts standing poised on the very edge to throw the heavy cable into the grasp of the boatman,
                    who had already leaped from the boat to the wharf so he could make it fast. This accomplished, a
                    sigh of relief went up from the crowd on the upper deck who once again took up their banter while on
                    the deck below the roustabouts ran hither and yon carrying freight on and off the boat or driving
                    bellowing cattle. The mate gave sharp commands mixed with curses while passengers were hustled off
                    and hustled on by the second officer. Meantime the porter saw to the baggage winding in and out
                    through the merchandise and the hurrying roustabouts. When the last piece of freight was in place
                    and the last passenger safely landed, the gang plank swung high in the air, the engine bells rang
                    again, and the wheels churned the water while the boatman loosened the cables which held the big
                    boat fast to the wharf and then sprang back on the boat across the widening strip of water. The
                    steamer glided gracefully across the river to the Ghent landing and the excitement for the week was
                    over. The crowds then swarmed up the river bank on their return to the town.</p>
            <p>Members of our family usually watched the boat landing from between the white pillars of
                    grandfather's veranda in the shade of the purple wisteria which grandmother had <pb n="116" id="VAA4025-031-2-034"/> planted when the house was built in the forties. With its trunk now
                    grown as thick as a man's arm, it had climbd to the high ceiling of the second story where
                    it shaded the whole southwestern end of the porch, its blossoms hanging in purple festoons. With the
                    coming of the Winter months, the driving and the trips to the wharf ceased and we were confined to
                    the family circle, to the family dinner parties, where the tables fairly groaned under the quantity
                    of food, and to the church socials.</p>
            <p>The red-brick house with the sunshine of its past joys and the shadows of deep sorrows, which had
                    encompassed these two old people, always had a great charm for me both summer and winter. As I grew
                    into girlhood, the long winter Sunday afternoons spent under its friendly roof, became the red
                    letter days of the week for me. Apparently there was nothing to attract a child—just two
                    old people and a bachelor uncle. Nevertheless, there was a subtle charm, which I unconsciously felt.
                    Now as I look back, I know that this charm was the perfect peace and harmony which surrounded these
                    old people. Always sensitive to atmosphere, I felt it even in my earliest childhood when I sat on my
                    grandfather's knee. I never heard a note of discord in that household. Grandfather was a
                    gentle and even-tempered person and grandmother, with all her energy, was never hurried or cross,
                    but had that calm dignity which commands respect and obedience.</p>
            <p>On Sunday afternoons in Winter we sat by the grate fire in the living room, which was always bright
                    and cheerful. A window on the West gave us a distant view of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and the sweep of the hills which line its course, while the many small window panes
                    reflected the glow of the sun low on the horizon. To the South, a window, extending almost to the
                    floor with two small doors at the bottom opening on the porch, put us in direct touch with the river
                    and the many boats and barges passing up and down its course. In one corner of this room was a
                    curious spiral stairway connecting with the bedroom above. It was enclosed, so when the doors at
                    each end were shut it was quite dark. It had a great fascination for me partly made up of fear of
                    the unknown terrors which might lurk in its dark and winding passages.</p>
            <pb n="117" id="VAA4025-031-2-035"/>
            <p>Often we sat before the fire, grandfather reading the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Enquirer</hi> or the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Courier-Journal</hi> and giving especial attention to river news with an occasional
                    comment, while I was absorbed in some story book dug out of the old bookcase in the hall. The
                    whistles of the steamboats making their landings, the chug of their engines, and the swish of their
                    paddle wheels were the only sounds that broke the Sabbath stillness.</p>
            <p>It was strange that I, who had <hi rend="i">Chatterbox, Wideawake, St. Nicholas, Youth's
                        Companion</hi>, Mrs. Alcott's stories and many, many other interesting things to read
                    at home, should have cared for the books in grandfather's library. They were so very naive,
                    they told of trivial incidents, and they ended with long moral homilies, but they were for me the
                    bridge which spanned the space between the past and present.</p>
            <p>This house, so still in the days of my visits, had once been peopled with children like
                    myself—my father, of whom I had but a dim recollection, and his sisters, whom I had never
                    known—frail children who had come and gone like a summer breeze. They had romped in the
                    halls of the old home and the rooms had echoed with their laughter. They had sat by the grate and
                    read the books as I was doing and perhaps they too had felt the same shivery fascination in the
                    presence of the little spiral stairway. Their shadowy forms were all about me for they still lived
                    in the hearts and thoughts of the two old people and their little books left behind brought them
                    very close to me also.</p>
            <p>Always a punctual household, five o'clock found us at the evening meal in the pleasant and
                    neatly carpeted basement kitchen. The dining room across the hall, like the double parlors on the
                    floor above, was used for company on state occasions only. The meal was a simple one, for Swiss ways
                    completely characterized this home, the "hired girl", a daughter of some
                    respectable farmer, sat at table with us. Of the food, all I remember is the ginger cake,
                    grandmother's specialty, made by her old mother's Swiss recipe, and the weak tea,
                    called by grandfather "Cambric Tea," which was vastly important to me for at home
                    I was never allowed anything stronger than milk.</p>
            <p>The meal finished, the day was all but ended for me, for it was not long until the church bells,
                    Baptist, Methodist, <pb n="118" id="VAA4025-031-2-036"/> and Presbyterian, began calling their
                    respective flocks to evening worship. Like sheep we all knew our bells and responded. With the first
                    stroke of the Baptist bell, grandfather took up his lantern, and with a long paper lighter caught
                    the flame from the grate and lighted it—matches were for use in summer and at night when
                    there was no open fire. At other times, they were an extravagance. On the mantle stood a vase which
                    grandmother always kept filled with lighters, made from narrow strips of newspaper, either twisted
                    or folded and fringed at one end to catch the flame more easily. These lighters were a part of our
                    daily life, one of the first things we learned to make.</p>
            <p>When bundled up and ready to start, leaving grandmother to her thoughts by the fire, grandfather
                    gently patted her on the cheek and with his fine smile said with his quaint french accent:
                    "Good bye Mudder". She smiled back at him all aglow, for fifty years of these
                    little attentions had failed to dim their freshness or cool their warmth, so enduring was the love
                    that united these two.</p>
            <p>Then we went out into the night, stately white haired man and little girl, hand in hand, while from
                    his unengaged hand swung the lantern. The streets were dark and the way was rough. Street lamps were
                    few and scattered, and, being petroleum lamps, their light did not penetrate far into the darkness.
                    The street crossings were made of ashes with stepping stones where the mud was particularly deep.
                    There were a few sidewalks in the town and these few were made of rough limestone slabs, just as
                    they were brought down from the hills, so one was in danger of stumping one's toes and
                    falling. In consequence, Sunday nights and prayer meeting nights saw the streets full of the bobbing
                    lanterns of good church people. On other nights, only the young and frivolous ventured taking their
                    chances without lanterns as a rule.</p>
            <p>In Winter the lanterns were needed to keep out of mud holes, and in Summer to keep from falling over
                    the cows lying about in the streets and lazily chewing their cuds. Few were the inhabitants not able
                    to own a cow, but pastures were scarce. However, as the streets were wide and covered with a growth
                    of thick blue grass, they were used by the poorer inhabitants as cow pastures.</p>
            <pb n="119" id="VAA4025-031-2-037"/>
            <p>A short walk of two squares brought us to the church, where I slipped into the front pew with my
                    mother while Grandfather took his place in the amen-corner. At the Sunday morning service on
                    pleasant days, this amen-corner with its group of old folks was picturesque and characterized by a
                    quaint old world atmosphere. There was grandfather, in Prince Albert coat of finest
                    broadcloth—a week day as well as Sunday garb. Grandmother, never much out of date, was
                    dressed in black with perhaps some colored flowers in her bonnet. Aunt Augusteen, a first edition of
                    grandmother, though several years her senior, was enough like her to have been her twin. Their
                    resemblance was so striking that many little anecdotes were told about them. One was that Aunt
                    Augustine going into grandfather's store one day passed a mirror and nodded saying,
                    "Good morning Justine". After making her purchase she looked about in surprise
                    asking what became of Justine, still quite unaware that she had greeted her own reflection in the
                    mirror.</p>
            <p>There was also Aunt Zella Thiebauld who gave the note of piquancy and color to the group. She was
                    small and vivacious, interspersing French with her English while talking and at the same time
                    gesticulating with her hands and bobbing her head. She wore hooped skirts of silk in fancy stripes
                    of black, blue and tan, around not lengthwise of the skirt, and gay flowers decorated her bonnet.
                    Hoop skirts were long out of style but not for Aunt Zella, who had worn them when she was young, and
                    now that she was old she still wore them, for the silk of those days did not wear out. She always
                    carried a lantern on moonlight nights just the same as on dark nights although she lived on Main
                    Street not two blocks from the church. The fourth wife of Uncle Charles Thiebauld, and sister of his
                    second wife, she was aunt as well as stepmother to most of his children. After his death, she lived
                    with his son Jimmy, who was both merry and hospitable. Thinking to give her a great pleasure, he
                    planned a surprise party for her on one of her birthdays. Called down to meet the assembled
                    relatives and friends, she swept the room with a glance, poured out a volley of French, turned on
                    her heel, marched up stairs again, shut and locked her door to appear no more that day and her <pb n="120" id="VAA4025-031-2-038"/> birthday dinner had to be celebrated without her. Surprise
                    parties did not go with hoop skirts and she felt that this one was an insult to her dignity. She was
                    one of the most outstanding French characters in the town.</p>
            <p>Three humble figures made up the remainder of the amen-corner group which really formed the most
                    democratic part of the church. The three included an old grey-haired man, a day laborer, stooped and
                    more or less feeble, and two maiden sisters clothed in rusty black dresses with full skirts. They
                    wore bonnets, draped with thin shabby veils, a style left over from the forties. These old ladies
                    were known to the community as Aunt Lovey and Aunt Betty. They lived in a shabby, little
                    frame-house, where for years they had supported themselves by weaving rag carpets, or rather Aunt
                    Lovey had supported them, for Aunt Betty had a particular aversion to work. She always said as she
                    rocked to and fro in her chair: "When Aunt Lovey ain't here no more to do the work
                    I'm goin to the Poor Farm," little dreaming that she was uttering a true prophecy.
                    In the course of time, it came about that Aunt Lovey was called to her long home, and in bitterness
                    of soul Aunt Betty did end her days at the Poor Farm. She did not like to work, but she loved to
                    sing and never missed an opportunity on prayer meeting nights to start her favorite hymn in a high
                    pitched nasal voice.</p>
            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>Life is such a bitter thing, A journey to the tomb, All that is mortal will soon Be closed in
                        death's cold arms.</p>
                </quote>
            <p>She sang it solo for no one could get her particular key or make the song seem half so bitter. When
                    ingrain carpets began to take the place of rag carpets, work grew scarce for Aunt Lovey, and the
                    sisters had to have some assistance. They virtually constituted the total poor of the Church for
                    whom the Communion Sunday offering was taken. Besides, once a year the church visited them in a body
                    with pound party donations of staple goods of which soap always formed a prominent feature. The poor
                    old souls were more prone to godliness than cleanliness and somehow in spite of free soap the dark
                    creases in their wrinkled old faces never grew less noticeable.</p>
            <p>In the body of the church, there were other interesting characters. Cousin Lou Thiebauld, a son of
                    Uncle Charles <pb n="121" id="VAA4025-031-2-039"/> and a step-son of Aunt Zella, had a face that was
                    long and narrow, its length being accentuated by a chin beard. With the nervous intensity and
                    vivacity of the French, as he listened to the sermon, his face registered in quick succeeding
                    flashes his approval or disapproval. Ever and again he would raise to his face to inhale its
                    fragrance the little nosegay which he always carried from the first flower of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Spring</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the last blossoms or leaves of Autumn. Tall and spare, on his arm he always carried
                    a cane which he never seemed to use, but it was always handy should it become necessary.</p>
            <p>An unusual figure was Mrs. Hoffman, a mulatto. Her yellow wrinkled face was full of goodness and
                    kindness. In the back of the church, under the gallery were seats reserved for the few pious negroes
                    of the community, but Mrs. Hoffman sat in the body of the church with the quality. She had been the
                    slave of a rich <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> planter, who had brought her with their children across the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> and settled them on a farm on Plum Creek a few miles above. The prefix
                    "Mrs." was hers by courtesy only. How the pious church people of the community
                    reconciled to their conventional code the habit of thinking of this old mulatto as Mrs. Hoffman
                    cannot be explained, for she was not a penitent. She had lived her life and been happy and had not
                    spoiled it by vain repentance afterwards. She was respected by all. On Sundays her neat buggy and
                    well groomed mare could always be seen before the church door, while on week-days it stood at the
                    gates of the best families. She delivered butter, eggs, and chickens to her customers and often sat
                    down for a little chat.</p>
            <p>Once a year this privileged woman of color entertained the Ladies Aid and set before them large
                    platters of fried chicken, with hot biscuit, jellies, preserves, and that great variety of good
                    things that the colored people of her kind have such a knack of preparing. She busied herself with
                    serving and would never sit at table with them. Just so, it was said, she had served her master,
                    who, until he died, often spent weeks at a time with her. She gave liberally to the church, adding a
                    special gift to the pastor at Christmas time. Now her children were grown and had gone away. They
                    paid the price for the father's sin. Since they were too good for one race and not high
                    enough for the other of the community, <pb n="122" id="VAA4025-031-2-040"/> they were lonely and
                    went afield to seek and find their kind in larger communities.</p>
            <p>Grandfather was superintendent of the Sunday School. It is said that he was absent only twice in
                    thirty years. He provided the money for the Sunday School prizes for regular attendance and the
                    memorizing of Bible verses as well as for the candy for the Christmas treat out of his own pocket.
                    The latter was one of his greatest pleasures. With the same pleasure that he bought the candy for
                    the children's Christmas treat, he bought numbers of tickets which he sent to those,
                    especially widows and orphans, whom he thought hardly able to spend their own money. He loved
                    children and wanted to see them happy. He moved among them radiating a benign influence. He spoke
                    sublime truths in simple language. One morning his theme was love. He admonished us to love Jesus,
                    to love our parents, to love one another and to love our Superintendant. At this point to his
                    delight and the great amusement of the rest of the school, a soulfull little voice from the infant
                    class piped up with: "Why grandfather, I love you." It was the truth.</p>
            <p>On week days, I never went home from school without first going to the store to greet him where he
                    stood behind his high desk in his office at the back of the store. The place was often full of
                    men—farmers, selling produce, borrowing money or asking advice—but there was
                    always a welcome for the little girl, a kiss and a gentle pat on the head. As I sped away satisfied,
                    I often heard him answer their queries with: "That's Ben's
                    youngest." I could not know the pain at the old man's heart for the loss of that
                    son who was to have been the prop of his old age, and on whose broad shoulders he was beginning to
                    rest his large business interests. The realization came only later at grandfather's death.
                    That was the first great sorrow to cross my path, for, at my father's going, I was too
                    young to realize its significance.</p>
            <p>Grandmother's interest in the Church was just as great as grandfather's, but her
                    strength was failing and she did not take such an active a part. It was she who always thought of
                    the little things that add so much to the daily happiness of others. When she called on the
                    pastor's wife, and that was often, she never left without slipping a bill into her hand for
                    some little luxury that she might crave. It was done as <pb n="123" id="VAA4025-031-2-041"/>
                    secretly as possible so there could be no chance for a word of thanks or an opportunity for anyone
                    else to notice it. She visited us in all of our childhood sicknesses and never came empty handed. In
                    addition to other good things she was sure to bring oranges—a rare treat in those days.
                    Her visits were rather stately affairs, which no one took lightly. For that hour grandfather laid
                    aside all his business. Good old Fanny was ordered hitched to the broad seated rig of many years
                    service and with grandmother seated at his side, grandfather would pick up the reins, give a cluck,
                    and a slap on Fanny's broad back with a rein. She would start off at a brisk trot never
                    slacking her pace until she stood at the door of the big house on the hill.</p>
            <p>If possible mother always met them at the front door and escorted them upstairs. In those big
                    unheated halls there could be no question of laying aside wraps, but inside one of the big bedrooms
                    she would take grandfather's silk hat and grandmother's cloak, and after a cheery
                    word at the bedside of the patient they would sit down comfortably by the grate fire for a short
                    chat on family affairs. Always the talk drifted into church matters, which lay close to their
                    hearts. Before taking leave grandmother never failed to ask the patient what delicacy she might
                    crave and, if possible, she always procured it.</p>
            <p>Once when my mother lay very ill in her delirium she asked for lemons and a cone of loaf sugar. The
                    lemons were easily procured but not the sugar in that form. Grandmother had <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cincinnati</settlement>
                    </placeName> searched until finally in a small German shop in an outlying district a cone of sugar
                    was found. When mother recovered, she was greatly surprised to find this cone on the table at her
                    bedside, a form of sugar she had not seen for years. The cone was no better than the sugar which we
                    always used, but grandmother had gone to no end of trouble to satisfy the fancy of a sick brain. It
                    was this same kindly spirit and thought for the comfort and welfare of the families of future
                    generations of Baptist preachers that prompted her shortly before her death to deed the brick house
                    next to the Baptist Church to the trustees for a parsonage.</p>
            <p>Many years have passed since these two old people sat in the "amen-corner" of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>

                    </placeName> rivers as "the Hay King." The firm of U. P. Schenck &amp; Son had

                        <settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement>
                    </placeName> and was the largest shipper of produce. The partners in this firm were the moving

                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                    </placeName>—the First National Bank, the Furniture Factory, the Woolen Mills, and the
                    Chair Factory. Of these, the only one left is the First National Bank.</p>
            <p>It was a great privilege to know those fine old people—Ulysses and Justine Schenck. They
                    were of such upright and sterling character, that they, with many others of their generation, stand
                    out apart. The question often arises, "shall we see their like again?"</p>

            <p>In thousands of Indiana homes today, some member of the family assumes the responsibility of bringing
                    in the newspaper from the front porch or from under the barberry bush where an unruly wind has
                    tossed it. Lucky the individual who gets the first peep at the front page, the sports'
                    section, the comic strips, or whatever individual taste may dictate. Daily distribution of both
                    morning and evening newspapers is enjoyed in almost every city, while in smaller places, or even in
                    the country, at least one daily paper brings news of local happenings as well as that from remote
                    corners of the world to all who can read.</p>
            <p>We live in a busy world and are often forgetful of the trail-blazers who made the daily paper. This
                    effort is but an appreciative gesture—a tribute to Elihu Stout, who unassisted and with
                    patient toil, one hundred and thirty one years ago, issued the first number of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>, the first newspaper published in Indiana. This journal, thus founded,
                    with slight interruptions and an early change of name, has continued for a century and more, and
                    therefore has the distinction of being an outstanding pioneering effort.</p>
            <p>Elihu Stout, the son of Judiah and Mary Stout, was born on April 16, 1782, in Newark, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="nju">New Jersey</region>
                    </placeName>. At an early age, he learned the printer's trade. Judiah Stout fought in the
                    American Revolution, and, ten years after its close, feeling the urge of migrating towards the West,
                    which was then anywhere beyond the Alleghenies, he and his family joined the increasing tide,
                    crossed the mountains and settled at <placeName>

                        </placeName> Gazette</hi>, published by the Bradfords, comfortable and wealthy, who became
                    intimate friends of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Henry</settlement>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName>. Ambitious to edit a newspaper of his own, and having faith in the Northwest, he left <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> to solicit aid for his undertaking but found little. Undaunted he came to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1803, there to try his fortunes. Governor William Henry Harrison equipped a boat for
                    young Stout in which he journeyed back to <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Frankfort</settlement>,

            <pb n="126" id="VAA4025-031-2-044"/>
            <p>To appreciate the difficulties that confronted Elihu Stout, it is necessary to consider the handicaps
                    of a hundred fifty years ago in Indiana. There were no roads leading from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> to the East at that time. The people were poor. They depended largely upon their own
                    produce from the soil and the forests for the necessaries of life. Money was extremely difficult to
                    obtain and some of it worth less than its face value. Hence the first issue of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi>, on July 31, 1804, in the face of all these obstacles, has a deep
                    significance. It was the urge for expression that motivated the young man of twenty-two years, and
                    the desire to contact the hardy pioneers who were to ask for admission to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> only twelve years later.</p>
            <p>A lengthy but definite statement of the rules governing subscriptions to the <hi rend="i">Indiana

            <p>With the optimism of a young man, Stout probably did not foresee many of the difficulties to be met.
                    For example, a printer had not only to get news and paper but he had to get paid. The first paper
                    mill in the West was completed in 1793 at Georgetown, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, quite a distance from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Early journals of the West were sometimes printed on brown wrapping paper. Tradition
                    has it that a frontier newspaper was once printed with swamp mud for ink and run off on a cider
                    mill. Sometimes only one side of the paper was used. Then after being read by the subscriber, the
                    sheet was supposed to be returned to the printer in order that he might run off the next issue on
                    the reverse side. Currency was scarce and editors frequently announced that they would take produce
                    in exchange for the paper. Maple sugar, jeans, tow-linen, oats, corn-meal, chickens, deer meat, coon
                    skins, and fire-wood were among the commodities that were prone to reach the printer. Many years
                    after he founded his paper, Editor Stout was compelled to give his subscribers the following in the
                    issue of May 8, 1829: "Want of paper compels me to furnish my readers with but half a
                    sheet. I expect a supply before another publication day."</p>
            <p>In April, 1806, a great misfortune overtook the adventurous editor, when his plant was destroyed by
                    fire. The spirit of Stout was not subdued, but he immediately set out for <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> determined to prepare for a new venture. While in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName>, he obtained another press and a supply of paper which he carried to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>
                    </placeName> on pack mules over the rude road that followed the old Buffalo Trace. It was more than
                    a year after the fire before it was possible to resume publication.</p>
            <p>On July 4, 1807, the first issue of the <hi rend="i">Western Sun</hi> is said to have appeared,

            <p>Stout and other editors were makers of public opinion in Indiana. Their editorial efforts were fairly

                    forties and fifties had a literary style and flavor which one misses in the present day newspaper.
                    Not one of these editors built up a personal following which enabled him to dictate either
                    politically or otherwise".<hi rend="sup">5</hi>

            <p>The modest little <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> of 1804 blazed the trail for many Hoosier
                    newspapers. By 1854 there were in Indiana twelve daily, two tri-weekly, one hundred twenty-one
                    weekly, one fortnightly and six monthly newspapers. From any of these it seems a far cry, indeed, to
                    the newspapers of today. Whereas the <hi rend="i">Indiana Gazette</hi> reached at most a few hundred

                    with his printing-press is second in importance only to the coming of George Rogers Clark.</p>

            <p>I was born May 10, 1857, in the city of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, within a stone's throw of the old state house—which contiguity, I
                    have always maintained, entitled me to be classed as a thorough Hoosier. When I was still a child my
                    father moved his family to a farm which he owned, lying in the neighborhood of the present
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Beech Grove</settlement>, <region type="county">Marion
                            County</region>
               </placeName>, and that was my home for more than twenty years, or until we
                    moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, then a suburb, politically independent of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, I did various things other than the humdrum duties of a farmer lad, one of them being to
                    serve for three years as a printer's apprentice in the job office of the old <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Sentinel.</hi> This was well worth the time spent for though I did not cleave to the
                    trade as a life business it helped me in more ways than one. In the first place, since my formal
                    scholastic education did not extend beyond the simple curriculum of a country district school, I
                    found that a post-graduate course in a printing office, especially when supplemented by a good free
                    library, played no small part in widening my mental horizon. So I rather like to regard myself as an
                    alumnus of the <hi rend="i">Sentinel</hi> printing office, of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName> Public Library, and, somewhat later, of the Indiana State Library. Again, when in
                    obedience to an inborn wanderlust I made divers excursions out into this glorious world strange
                    places to see, the good old art preservative, the hobo's true friend, made possible
                    peregrinations that otherwise would have been but dreams. Incidental to these sporadic travelings I
                    treasure the memories of many tramps with haversack and staff at the invitation of mountains and
                    lakes and of trails unknown to conventional travelers, where there were many things to be
                    discovered. One of the first of these inquisitive expeditions was the exploration of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Brown County</region>
                    </placeName>, which at that time (the early eighties) appealed to the imagination as a region of
                    unique isolation peopled by a primitive hill folk.</p>
            <p>Since this tabloid chronicle is a human document, regardless of the smallness of its subject, perhaps
                    I should weave into it all the threads that went into the making of the pattern. Be it known that
                    from the days of the district school period when I discovered a facility in the writing of
                    compositions <pb n="132" id="VAA4025-031-2-050"/> (done at the expense of less alluring studies), I
                    decided to become one of that innumerable host who write books and things. Reasons: It would be a
                    pleasant substitute for work and would allow me to give free rein to the aforementioned mania for
                    wandering. Then there was the thing called fame and the proud delight of occupying a pinnacle where
                    one could be seen and admired by the great world. By the time I had finished my apprenticeship at
                    the printing cases, I felt that I was ready to spring some large literary surprise on my fellow-men.
                    While preparing this surprise in divers forms, I avocated as a farmer. Unfortunately (for himself)
                    the embryonic author cannot wreak himself upon the public without the intervening agency of the
                    editorial guild, a class of questionable intelligence and undoubted malevolence chiefly notorious
                    for the habit of returning manuscripts accompanied by "regret slips". They should
                    know that bank checks would conduce much more to the popularity of editors. One of my souvenirs of
                    those sad, postage consuming days is a scrap-book filled with return slips of various styles.</p>
            <p>Eventually a new idea came my way. Evidently there was a missing factor in this long range
                    bombardment of the literary market with its succint and cold-blooded responses. That factor was the
                    need of direct application of a magnetic personality to the editorial frigidity. And so it was that
                    my first invasion of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> City was with a gripsack full of my choice manuscripts with which to beard the
                    purveyors of literature in their dens. Which I did. Contemporaneously with this bearding I provided
                    for my personal upkeep by setting type at twenty cents per thousand ems, and as I consumed this
                    revenue almost as fast as I acquired it, and it was a long way back to Indiana, I did not soon see
                    my happy home again. Fortunately there was then no income tax such as we have in these days.</p>
            <p>Subsequently I really found a way to circumvent the autocracy of the editors. After <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Irvington</settlement>
                    </placeName> became my place of residence, I turned to the printing trade once more, this time by
                    investing in a one-man printery, which I installed on the home premises. Then on the side, and as
                    the primary vocation of job printing permitted, I ventured to launch out as my own book publisher
                    and issued a modest brochure containing a collection of nature sketches that lay near my heart. <pb n="133" id="VAA4025-031-2-051"/>
                    <hi rend="i">Hours with Nature</hi>, I called it, and its reception among like-minded people was so
                    cordial that I was encouraged to try three or four other booklets of similar character. Aside from
                    the zest of the ventures, the returns were so disproportionate to the time and labor involved that I
                    thought it best to forego further efforts.</p>
            <p>About this time I began to have better luck with the home editors than I had ever been able to evoke
                    from the haughty publishers of the effete East. The good old <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer</hi>, under
                    J. G. Kingsbury, took me to its bosom, and within the tomb of its now forgotten files repose not a
                    few stories, both short and serial, contributed by me as pictures of Indiana farm life or of pioneer
                    days; likewise miscellaneous articles galore addressed to my rural audience. Also the now defunct

                    <hi rend="i">Journal</hi>, one of the best journalistic friends Indiana writers ever had, bade me
                    welcome to its columns, as did the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi> and the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">Press</hi>, which, under the proprietorship of John H. Holliday, led a lively existence
                    for one year. I never held a staff position on any of these newspapers, unless an engagement with
                    the <hi rend="i">News</hi> at one time to furnish historical articles on demand might be called a
                    staff job. The selective freedom of a free lance writer best comported with my mental makeup, and my
                    preserved scrapbooks will testify to that freedom, though a great many of the contributions were
                    hooked up in some way with local history.</p>
            <p>This brings me to a consideration of what small service, if any, I may have done in behalf of local
                    history. I believe I harbor no illusions on that question. I am at best but part historian, for
                    there are in that field areas many and extensive that are to me drearily arid; for example, that
                    hypothetical unraveling of long-buried questions, that must always remain hypothetical, and which,
                    if once accepted really interest nobody. The happenings of time, to my mind, may roughly be regarded
                    as falling into two classes. One aspect is the flux and flow which crowds upon us every day, most of
                    which must by the very plenitude of the harvest be relegated to oblivion. The other aspect is of
                    those features of the time stream that reveal the workings of cause and effect, and that invest with
                    significance the mutations of the world. Then there is the <pb n="134" id="VAA4025-031-2-052"/>
                    picturesque element—the resurrection of the archaic and quaint and novel that casts a
                    grace over existence.</p>
            <p>Whether or not this historical classification will stand rigid criticism, it was the theory that
                    originally won me to an interest in the subject, and the one to which I have ever since adhered. As
                    a newspaper space filler ever in search of good copy, I found that few special topics offered a
                    richer mine than does history with its veins of romance, adventure, human interest stories, or what
                    you will. One danger in it to history itself and to the writer who respects his own honesty is the
                    temptation to substitute loose statements or downright fiction for fact. My observation is that
                    newspapers as a rule care only for the story, in writing of this kind, and bother little about the
                    truth of it. The consequence is that leaden-footed truth seldom overtakes the flying feet of fancy.
                    Rob history of its verity and Clio no longer has a message.</p>
            <p>If the old <hi rend="i">Journal</hi> was a real friend of the literati of Indiana so was John H.
                    Holliday, of blessed memory, a Godsend to those who wanted to write local history and do it
                    creditably. Mr. Holliday himself was well grounded in Indiana history with a lively and
                    discriminating interest in the same and he knew with professional accuracy when a good piece of
                    history came his way. Moreover, he encouraged the subject by giving considerable pay space to it in
                    his columns, and not a few series of articles that subsequently found a more permanent form were
                    originally published in the <hi rend="i">News.</hi> Among these may be mentioned D. D.
                    Banta's <hi rend="i">Short History of <placeName>
                            <region type="county">Johnson County</region>
                        </placeName>
               </hi> and <hi rend="i">Early School Days in <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                        </placeName>
               </hi>, the most important of the journals of John Tipton, and others I cannot recall
                    off hand, all revealing real historical values.</p>
            <p>The relevancy of this is that the encouragement to local history afforded by such an editor as Mr.
                    Holliday, especially in the days when he controlled the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>
                    <hi rend="i">News</hi>, was a healthy stimulus in a worth-while direction, and it may, I think be
                    regarded as a logical forerunner of the widespread organized movement of today. In my own case the
                    reaction was a slowly growing conviction that there should be a more permanent preservation of those
                    things of the past which innately appeal to and affect the present. To be sure, the experiment had
                    already been made by W. H. Smith, a well known local historian, and a Mr. B. L. Blair who launched a
                    magazine <pb n="135" id="VAA4025-031-2-053"/> called <hi rend="i">The Indianian</hi>, only to have
                    it go on the rocks ere long. But <hi rend="i">The Indianian</hi> had been somewhat ambitiously
                    conceived, being an illustrated monthly of good size, with a cost of production out of proportion to
                    its limited field. The promoters sought to finance it by selling stock at fifty dollars per share,
                    as may be poignantly remembered by those stock holders still living, but that failed to turn the
                    trick, and <hi rend="i">The Indianian</hi> became a reminiscence.</p>
            <p>I argued with myself, however, that there was a place for the kind of organ in question if only the
                    cost of its maintenance were reduced to a fine art. The only key to the problem seemed to be to make
                    the publication a quarterly, not too bulky, and to utilize my little printing plant as far as
                    possible in its production. Eventually (1905) I acted upon this line of reasoning and in due time
                    led forth a small and feeble infant christened with a rather big name, <hi rend="i">The Indiana
                        Quarterly Magazine of History.</hi> As the genesis of this creation has already been dealt with
                    by the author in the pages of this <hi rend="i">Magazine</hi> (December, 1929), I need not say more
                    about it here. In 1908, I relinquished the quarterly to the Indiana Historical Society, because I
                    went to the Puget Sound region expecting to remain. On my return to Indiana, I renewed the
                    editorship. I finally severed my editorial connection with the <hi rend="i">Indiana Magazine of
                        History</hi> in 1913, because I could no longer afford the luxury.</p>
            <p>I do not know that I need to add anything further to this subject unless it be to say by way of
                    filling out the sketch that my writings are only in part historical, including as they do fiction,
                    pageantry and miscellaneous essays. I have two books to my credit—<hi rend="i">Centennial
                        History and Handbook of Indiana</hi> (with other matter by Max Hyman), and <hi rend="i">Indiana,
                        Its History, Constitution and Present Government</hi>, now used in some of the schools. In
                    making my own evaluation of the various veins I have worked, I would place first certain descriptive
                    matter incorporated in the nature booklets which I printed myself, and in five other brochures
                    descriptive of our state parks written for the Department of Conservation.</p>

            <p>An event of unusual importance to archaeologists and museums is the sale of the archaeological
                    collection of the late Edward W. Payne, of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>. Mr.
                    Payne collected this material during most of his long life, beginning at least fifty years ago. He
                    bought many extensive collections made by others earlier than that. He is said to have amassed more
                    than a million pieces of relics of the mound builders and other Indians of North America. The First
                    National Bank and the Marine Bank, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, have announced the sale of all of this material piecemeal beginning August 15.</p>
            <p>Historical societies and museums, with rare exceptions, are the logical places for such collections.
                    Private collectors, however, often prevent the loss or destruction of valuable artifacts and other
                    relics. They would be of greater service to the historical world if they could be induced to observe
                    universially some sort of a code or agreement which would embrace, among other things: the
                    limitation of their collection largely, if not entirely, to pieces from their own locality, or even
                    state; a rigid rule of preserving with every piece full information about the location where it was
                    found, relation to other things, date of finding, etc.; reporting items collected and any other
                    archaeological information to the person or office which serves as headquarters for archaeological
                    work in the state.</p>
            <p>The Payne collection includes many items from Indiana. It is to be hoped that at least some of the
                    most important of these—important from the scientific view—will be returned to
                    this state as a result of the sale.</p>

                                    there must be many where the names are unknown. Especially will this be true of the
                                    burial places in the older counties along the <placeName>

                                    </placeName> river. The farm on which I was born, for instance—two miles
                                    back of <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName>—a quarter section—had an old cemetery of perhaps
                                    over 12 graves none of which ever had a headstone with name and date of person
                                    buried. My parents moved from <placeName>
                                        <settlement type="city">Vevay</settlement>
                                    </placeName> there in 1838 and I think it was entered at <placeName>

                                    </placeName> land office in 1814. A farm adjoining had, as near as memory serves me,
                                    as many as four places where burials had been made. Its owner had a half section he
                                    had bought from several previous owners. In those earliest days with many families
                                    just squatters there was no way to secure a good headstone. It is an undertaking in

                    discussed. On first thought these leisure time activities may bear little relationship to the high
                    school history department, but on further thought a very direct bearing should be seen. Hobbies are
                    a comparatively new feature of the school program which fascinate a large group of students not
                    otherwise reached. There is no reason why this interest cannot be transferred to the regular
                    classroom work or incorporated in the history club activities.</p>
            <p>In every community there are men and women whose spare time is spent in some useful hobby, who would
                    be glad to share their enthusiasm and knowledge with high school students, if called in to the
                    history club for an exhibit or talk. For example, there may be a man who has a collection of Indian
                    arrow heads picked up on his own farm, there may be someone particularly interested in period
                    furniture, or a coin collector with some valuable Confederate or greenback money.</p>
            <p>No more interesting program could be arranged than one enjoyed recently by the writer when he heard a
                    business man talk on the German paper money he had collected during the inflation period following
                    the war. In his collection were bills printed by cities noted for the making of chamois, therefore
                    chamois money; bills made by cities where silk was the chief industry, hence silk money; and bills
                    made by cities where the Quakers were carrying on child feeding, and consequently called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Quaker</settlement>
                    </placeName> money. Such men are proud of their collections and usually eager to exhibit them.</p>
            <p>Many students have already developed hobbies of their own but as yet have failed to realize all the
                    values to be derived from them. Their value would be enhanced by showing the relationship they bear
                    to their more formal studies, including history. No better example of this plan can be found than
                    the popular pastime of stamp collecting. It is a hobby <pb n="140" id="VAA4025-031-2-058"/> that can
                    help students in a tangible way, for "the history of our national postage is a history of
                    the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> for the past century". The historical value of stamp collections has been
                    covered in an extremely interesting manner by such books as K. B. Stiles, <hi rend="i">Geography and
                        Stamps</hi>; A. F. Harlow, <hi rend="i">Old Post Bags: The Story of the Sending of a Letter in
                        Ancient and Modern Times</hi>; S. I. Rothschild <hi rend="i">Stamps of Many Lands</hi>, The
                    inexpensive Leisure League's booklet on <hi rend="i">Stamp Collecting</hi> may be procured
                    by those interested.</p>
            <p>There yet remains another group open to suggestions for developing new hobbies such as the collecting
                    of historical advertisements. It is safe to assert that no magazine appears without some
                    advertisement which harks back to some historical incident or fact. A recent double-page automobile
                    advertisement discussed "The Evolution of the Automobile"; another carried a full
                    page painting in color of the "Landing of Captain Cook at Botony Bay in 1770";
                    while the startling caption of an insurance company's effort at attractiveness read as
                    follows: "Every policyholder owes a debt to Queen Elizabeth", which was followed
                    by a discussion of the first charter to such a company. Perhaps the most startling and helpful
                    historical advertisement to appear recently was a double-page picture in color representing progress
                    in modes of travel throughout the world from ancient to modern times. So one might continue to list
                    the material available for starting the fascinating and educational hobby of collecting historical
                    advertisements.</p>
            <p>There are no doubt a great many persons interested in local and state history because of some small
                    piece of research done while high school or college students, which later developed into hobbies.
                    According to the student's interests, the sponsor of a history club can often encourage the
                    use of spare time in delving into local history or biography. Then too, the whole club can
                    profitably devote several meetings to the study of famous Hoosiers, such as the biographies of Janet
                    Scudder or W. M. Chase in art; the Wright brothers in aviation; Ida Husted Harper in the realm of
                    women's rights; Abbott, Rives, or Bowers in history; William Vaughn Moody, Theodore
                    Dreiser, George Ade or many others that might be mentioned in the field of literature.</p>
            <p>This same biographical scheme may be extended to almost any field. One particularly interesting and
                    profitable <pb n="141" id="VAA4025-031-2-059"/> field would be that of famous American immigrants as
                    Angelo Patri, Louis Agassiz, Walter Damrosch, Michael Pupin, Edward Bok, Carl Schurz, John Muir,
                    Alexander Bell or anyone of scores of others.</p>
            <p>This approach to the study of history through the use of hobbies should be profitable in many ways.
                    First of all it offers a new and variable approach to the field of history, thereby helping to
                    eliminate the monotony of repetition in different years, especially in American history. In the
                    second place it correlates history study with the activities program. Similarly it helps to correct
                    the mistaken impression held by some students that history is not an integral part of the every day
                    knowledge needed in understanding events around them. In the fourth place it develops a lasting
                    interest in history by starting the student out on what may become a life-time hobby. Likewise, it
                    may appeal to some group of students hard to reach, because they are interested in contemporary life
                    rather than history. This sort of work shows them some direct relationships between the present and
                    the past. It is to be hoped that teachers will more and more embrace the opportunity to use
                    extra-curricular activities to increase the interest of their students in history.</p>

            <p>Salmon Brown was the last of the many sons of John Brown of Osawatomie to die. He participated in the

                    </placeName>, during the winter of 1861–1862. The recruits were afraid, however, to go to <placeName>

                    </placeName> for service under a son of John Brown, so no commission was received and Salmon Brown
                    remained a private citizen. Having married in 1859, the family migrated to <placeName>

            <p>Dr. Linneus N. Hines, until recently President of the Indiana State Teachers' College at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>
                    </placeName>, went to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1917 to attend the National Educational Association. Learning before his departure
                    from Indiana that a son of John Brown was living in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Dr. Hines hunted up the plain but comfortable home of Salmon Brown and became
                    acquainted with the old gentleman and his wife. Finding that his mind was clear and that he thought
                    about the violence of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kansas</settlement>
                    </placeName> conflict without passion or rancor, Dr. Hines urged this last reviving son of John
                    Brown to prepare an account of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Kansas</settlement>
                    </placeName> struggle. With the aid of a daughter, Mrs. Ethel Brown Chamberlain, the following
                    narrative was written and sent to Dr. Hines, about a year before the death of the author, which
                    occurred on May 10, 1919, in <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Portland</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="oru">Oregon</region>

                    interesting story, save for the omission of the first section, as it came from the lips of Salmon

                        but went on organizing his court. He got out warrants for all of the Browns and the members of
                        the free state legislature that were in his district. My brother John and H. H. Williams were
                        two of them. At this time Colonel Buford's men were located somewhere within two or

                        of the Pierce Administration surveyors were Southern sympathizers. That made us all hail fellows

                        was old man Doyle, and two sons who were deputies, to serve upon the whole Brown crowd, and
                        Henry Thompson, Brown's son-in-law. As soon as father heard this he sent <placeName>

                        </placeName> Thompson and me to Cato's courthouse unarmed, ten miles away, on foot, to
                        see if they would arrest us. If we were arrested father promised to secure us next day. We
                        remained around the courtroom nearly half a day but they were not quite ready to act. I never
                        could approve of father's act in sending Thompson and myself on such a hazardous scheme
                        just to bring about the issue between freedom and slavery. I thought he trusted a little too
                        much to <placeName>

                    <p>While all this was going on in the Pottawatomie region, we had another call to make haste to the
                        defense of <placeName>

                        </placeName>, as the border riders were marching in force in that direction. My brother
                        John's company of Pottawatomie rifles, 100 strong, augmented with troops from the
                        surrounding country, including Osawatomie, with father's squad, made a forced march in
                        the night for the defense of <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lawrence</settlement>
                        </placeName>.</p>
                    <p rend="center">HOTEL IS DESTROYED</p>
                    <p>We traveled all night in the dark and at daybreak in the morning we were on the top of the hills
                        south of Waukarusa, where we could see <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lawrence</settlement>
                        </placeName> very distinctly. There were about 200 men standing there, tired and hungry, gazing
                        at the Free State hotel all in flames. Just at this time a messenger on horseback came up the
                        hill from the Waukarusa in great haste. Our men made him a prisoner at once. He said,
                        "Who are you?" We replied, "We are free state men, going to the
                        defense of <placeName>

                        </placeName>." He said, "You are the very, men I want to see and I have a
                        hurry-up call for you." He then took a paper out of his boot leg and it was read to our
                        men in the gray of the early morning. The import of the message was to hasten to save <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Lawrence</settlement>
                        </placeName>. The messenger did not know until he got to the top of the hill that <placeName>

                        </placeName> was on fire.</p>
                    <p>This messenger told us that Senator Charles Sumner, of <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                        </placeName>, had been knocked down on the floor of the <placeName>

                        </placeName>. I do not think there was a tired or hungry man in that crowd as they were too much
                        excited to think of creature comforts. This messenger gave his name but I do not remember it. He
                        was soon mixed up with the other men and lost to my view. Some of our men got weak in the knees
                        and expressed the belief that the South had us whipped, and were ready to give up the fight.
                        Others were more on the fight than ever before.</p>
                    <p rend="center">SOME ARE FRIGHTENED</p>
                    <p>We all turned back to our troubles on the Pottawatomie. My brother John and some of his men had
                        freed some slaves of a man who had settled near our route back. Some of the weak-kneed ones
                        commenced a howl against the act and soon had the company all torn into shreds. They did not
                        want to mix up with "niggers" or abolitionists. In the meantime
                        father's little company went back on the road toward <placeName>
                            <settlement type="city">Ottawa</settlement>
                        </placeName>, Jones' place. I think, as near as I can remember, it <pb n="145" id="VAA4025-031-2-063"/> was about twelve miles from the Waukarusa hills to the Jones home
                        place. Near there was a station where they served meals, I think, from a tent. Anyway they had a
                        grindstone. There were a good many men there when we arrived, among them being H. H. Williams,
                        of Pottawatomie, an old comrade of my brother John, and later a resident of Osawatomie, I
                        understand. He was a very fine man but got badly cowed after he was taken to Lecompton a
                        prisoner.</p>
                    <p>He knew everybody on the Pottawatomie. My father told him we were going back there to break up
                        Cato's court and get away with some of his vile emissaries before they got away with
                        us. "I mean to steal a march on the slave hounds, Williams," my father said.
                        "That is just right," replied Williams, "and I will write down their
                        names," which he did. I stood within two feet of him when he gave the names of all
                        those that were later killed, and some others. We all had implicit confidence in Williams and
                        knew that he was giving us the truth.</p>
                    <p rend="center">GUIDE IS WEAK-KNEED</p>
                    <p>We then ground all of our swords on the grindstone. When we had finished, old man Tousley in high
                        glee volunteered to haul all of our crowd back in his lumber wagon. We started off with the
                        cheers of the crowd, with their hats in the air, they all knowing the purport of the mission. On
                        the way old man Tousley got weak in the knees and wanted to quit from sheer fear, but we
                        couldn't let him go, fearing he might turn traitor and foil all of our plans.</p>
                    <p>We went down to near the crossing at Dutch Henry's and turned off to the right in a deep
                        grass canyon next to the timber on the creek, far away from all travel. We stayed there all that
                        night and all of the next day until late in the evening. The reason for taking the night for our
                        work was because it was impossible to take the men in the daytime. And the broadswords were used
                        because it could be done in a noiseless manner, while shooting would have aroused the whole
                        neighborhood.</p>
                    <p rend="center">DOYLES ARE SLAIN</p>
                    <p>We went to Doyle's first and encountered a number of savage dogs. Old man Tousley went
                        after the dogs with a broadsword and he and my brother Fred soon had them all laid out. Tousley
                        then went in without being asked and worked with all his might, but not as a prisoner as he
                        afterwards claimed. The three Doyes were taken out of the house to a point a half mile or so
                        away and were slain with broadswords. Owen Brown cut down one of them and another of the Browns
                        cut down the old man and the other. Old Man Doyle's wife gave the Doyles a terrible
                        scoring as they were being taken from the house. She said, "I told you you would get
                        into trouble for all your devilment; and now you see it has come."</p>
                    <p>Henry Sherman was killed by Henry Thompson, and also Wilkinson, at about the same time the Doyles
                        were. Our party divided, Thompson and Winer in one party and Owen Brown, Fred Brown, Salmon
                            Brown,<hi rend="sup">7</hi> Oliver Brown and old man Tousley in the other, father running

                        a hand in slaying the men. He shot a bullet into the head of old man Doyle about a half hour
                        after he was dead, but what for I do not know. Perhaps it was to call Thompson and Winer so that
                        they could locate us and we could all get together and return to our camp. We all soon got to
                        camp and remained there all of the following day and until quite late at night. We left and
                        Tousley was more than willing to go with us.</p>
                    <p rend="center">SLAYING IS REGRETTED</p>
                    <p>The night of the slaying I went alone to the house of Mr. Harris, who worked for Dutch Henry, and
                        had the care of a fine gray stallion. I made Harris saddle the animal and hold the stirrup for
                        me to mount. I said, "Thank you and goodbye." I never saw him again. He made a
                        report of this just as here given before an investigating committee.</p>
                    <p>We moved back toward our place near Middle Creek and camped. My brother Owen felt terribly
                        conscience-smitten because he had killed one of the Doyles, and he cried and took on at an
                        agonizing rate. My brother John made his way back to Osawatomie, where his family had gone, in a
                        very dejected state of mind, bordering on a breakdown. He hid himself in the timber near
                        Adair's old place, as the <placeName>

                        his head was still wild. He would not take the horse, and Owen came back, most of the way
                        through the timber. When he got back he was so used up that he could not keep from going to

                    <p>We came up to the lane in single file and were halted by their guards. It was a very dark night.
                        The men were lying along both sides of the road with their feet to the road. There were still
                        coals in the middle of the road where they had fires earlier in the night. My brother Frederick

                        around. Suddenly and before the guard had time to think, Fred rushed his horse through the lane
                        over the coals and we all followed like a flash of lightning. I was behind, riding a mule and
                        carrying the blankets for the crowd, which were fastened to the mule with a circingle. I looked
                        back after we had got through and the road was full of men, who had been startled out of their

                        for it. Jason replied, "Then you have committed a very wicked crime. Father said,

                        Black Jack Spring, where Pate's men were camped. We started late on Sunday afternoon
                        from Palmyra for the fight. Night overtook us near the Springs and we had to camp until daybreak
                        the next morning. Their guard on the ridge fired his gun and then ran to their camp to give the
                        alarm. We all jumped up and made for their camp on the double quick. Captain Shore's
                        men, 15 in all, went down within 200 yards of their camp, <list type="footnotes">

                        were scattered all around, getting their breakfasts. They soon began to return the fire. Father
                        took his 15 men right down near their camp, at the right, behind a little bank about two feet
                        high. This was done under their fire, which was very wild, for they were in a great panic. We
                        began a cross-fire and this drew the fire away from Shore's men to us, which gave Shore
                        and his force time to retreat up the ravine, which they did—and they never came back.
                        They went home, saying they were hungry, as they had not had anything to eat since the day
                        before at breakfast. We kept up our fire, off and on, until nearly noon. Nearly one-half of
                        Pate's men had been wounded or had deserted. We fired at every one that ran over the

                    <p>It was looking pretty dark for us, as two of our men were wounded right at my elbow and they had
                        to be escorted away by three others, which reduced our squad to 10. Father sent one of our men
                        up to the ravine to a point out of our sight to try to get some of our men to come back but he
                        never returned. Father told the rest of us to shoot all of the horses and mules in sight, which
                        we did in short order. In a few minutes they were covered with buzzards, with which the air was
                        by this time thick. Then out came a man from their camp with a flag of truce. When questioned he
                        said he was a prisoner in their hands. Father told him to go back and tell their captain to come
                        out with him. Pate came out and father asked him what he was doing there. He went on to tell him
                        that he was a captain of the state militia, sent there to enforce the Lecompton laws.</p>
                    <p>Father said, "Then I want an unconditional surrender of you and your men, and I will
                        have it; go back to your men." Then he sent us boys on the double quick around a point
                        that brought us up right to Pate's men, who stood behind the ridge, with only their
                        heads and shoulders exposed, with their rifles at their shoulders aimed at us. We pointed our
                        guns at their heads, only about 10 feet away.</p>

                    <p>Father then said to Lieutenant Brocket, "Tell your men to lay down their arms."
                        Brocket replied, "If our captain says so, we'll do it; but I don't
                        think he is such a darned coward as to do so." Father then turned to Pate, who stood by
                        his side, and ordered him to tell his men to lay down their arms. Pate said, "Boys, lay
                        down your arms until we talk this over." Down went their arms and the nine of us took a
                        company of 28 men. Pate did not know at the time that our men who had gone up the ravine had all

                        Colonel Sumner came into our camp with 180 dragoons and <placeName>

                        serve the warrant. Donaldson, a big, fine-looking man, fumbled in his pockets and said he had
                        lost it. Sumner said: "You are a damned liar and a coward, for I saw you have it a few
                        minutes ago." So John Brown was not arrested.</p>
                    <p>Sumner turned loose all the prisoners that we had taken and then Secretary Marcy countermanded
                        the order for releasing the free state prisoners that were held at Lecompton. Our men, who had
                        gathered to the number of fully 800, scattered to their homes to await future results. Our
                        little band went into hiding on short rations. All the ten of us had to eat for about two weeks

                        over their heads." The battle of Black Jack was the first battle of the great Civil War

                        had burned Osawatomie and [now] came up with their cannon torch all lighted and colors flying.
                        They halted a little more than 100 feet from the brush and trees where they saw Brown's
                        men go into the brush. Father's men opened fire on them, 30 guns all at once on their
                        solid ranks.</p>
                    <p>"Their men fell by the score and they broke all into groups. Colonel Buford finally got
                        his men into line again by beating them over the backs with his sword. They finally got their
                        cannon to work; the first few shells hit the top of the big oak trees. My father, to encourage
                        the boys, told them that the cannon was the most harmless thing they [the enemy] could use.
                        Finally the advance of the Buford men got down to the edge of the brush, when father ordered his
                        men to retreat across the Osage. The Buford forces followed and at the bank shot one of our men,

                        warned against trying anyone under that code of law, but he paid no attention to the warning and
                        assumed the whole responsibility for his actions. The warrants were placed in the hands of his

                    and introduced by Senator Samuel M. Ralston of Indiana authorized the Secretary of State to cause
                    the collection, copying, and editing for publication of papers relating to the territories found in
                    the national archives. Under an amendatory act of 1929, further provision was made for the
                    publication of the papers, and Dr. Carter was appointed to edit the collection.</p>

                    covering the origin, scope, and method of the proposed series. It contains a chronological list of
                    the territories and a second list, alphabetically arranged, with a roster of the governors,
                    secretaries, and federal judges of each territory, with the place from which they were appointed and
                    the dates of their commissions. In its final form this volume will include general papers which
                    relate to two or more territories. It is proposed to include also a general bibliography.</p>
            <p>Volumes II and III present some seven hundred official papers relating to the Territory Northwest of
                    the <geogName>River Ohio</geogName>, 1787–1803, and the Journal of Executive Proceedings,
                    1788–1803, in which are incorporated many letters and orders of the governor and
                    secretary. The arrangement is chronological in the main; the Journal, just mentioned, is printed as
                    one document at the end of Volume III. Great care has been taken to follow the original spelling,
                    punctuation, and capitalization. <pb n="152" id="VAA4025-031-2-070"/> A small proportion of the
                    papers have been printed before, but are included because they are essential to the understanding of
                    a group of following papers, or because the earlier printing is now generally inaccessible or shows
                    considerable variation from the sources. In this group belong the cessions of western lands from the
                    states to the government of the Confederation, the Ordinance of 1787, several Indian treaties, and a
                    number of St. Clair papers.</p>
            <p>In selecting papers for the series, emphasis has been placed upon the administrative side of
                    territorial affairs, including questions of public-land policy and certain phases of Indian affairs,
                    which during the period were inextricably entangled with the ordinary problems of civil government.
                    While the direction of territorial affairs lay with the Department of State until 1873 and many of
                    the papers printed came from that department, the files of the General Land Office of the Department
                    of the Interior and of the War Department have furnished many additional papers. Others have been
                    selected from the records of the Post Office Department, the House and Senate files, and manuscripts
                    now in the Library of Congress.</p>
            <p>With the establishment of the Territory Northwest of the <geogName>River Ohio</geogName>, the Federal
                    government was obliged to formulate a general territorial policy, to set up a workable system for
                    surveying and disposing of public lands, to devise some means of protecting the lands from
                    intruders, to adopt an Indian policy that would satisfy the inhabitants of the western country, and
                    to begin a postal service. The correspondence between the governor and secretary of the territory
                    and the president and heads of government departments at <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wau">Washington</region>
                    </placeName> shows how thse problems presented themselves, how an attempt was made to meet them, and
                    how they gradually worked themselves out or proved to be beyond solution.</p>
            <p>Local affairs come into view in the Journal of Executive Proceedings, which deals with appointments,
                    communications between the governor and secretary, the difficulties of legislation, the organization
                    of counties, the development and discipline of a dependable militia. While the guarded formality of
                    official correspondence colors most of the papers printed, there are occasional papers that are very
                    "human" indeed. See, for example, Gibault's memorial to Governor St. <pb n="153" id="VAA4025-031-2-071"/> Clair (Vol. II, 243–44), and Sargent to St. Clair
                    (Vol. III, 399ff.). The Journal makes clear the curious combination of very large and very small
                    affairs which made up territorial government.</p>
            <p>Careful attention to cross references greatly facilitates the use of these volumes, and the notes to
                    a vast number of related published and unpublished papers are invaluable. Students of local history
                    will feel a particular gratitude for the care that has been taken in the identification of the many
                    persons who appear as signers to petitions. No user of the volumes will fail to comment on the
                    satisfactory inclusiveness of the Index.</p>

            <p>The publication of this volume marks the completion of the task of collecting and reprinting the
                    legislation enacted by the territorial governments whose jurisdiction included the area which now
                    constitutes the state of Indiana. The work of rendering these early laws readily available to the
                    public was begun and carried fodward in two earlier volumes, published in the <hi rend="i">
                  <placeName>
                            <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                        </placeName> Historical Collections</hi>, to which the present volume is, in a very real sense,
                    a companion. The first of these preceding volumes, <hi rend="i">Laws of the Northwest Territory,
                        1788–1800</hi>, appeared in 1925 under the editorship of Theodore C. Pease; the next,
                        <hi rend="i">Laws of Indiana Territory, 1801–1809</hi>, was edited by Francis S.
                    Philbrick and published in 1930. The second volume was reprinted in 1931, with supplementary Indiana
                    material, by the Indiana Historical Bureau.</p>
            <p>The present volume covers the years from 1809, when <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> Territory was carved out of Indiana Territory, to the admission of Indiana to statehood
                    in 1816, and comprises the session laws enacted by the territorial general assembly during that
                    period. A panoramic summary of the laws which constitute the body of the volume is set forth in a
                    "Review of Legislation" to which the first eighty-five pages are devoted. <pb n="154" id="VAA4025-031-2-072"/> In some instances, this summary includes references to
                    legislation enacted prior to 1809 or subsequent to 1816.</p>
            <p>The subjects dealt with in these early laws are indicative of the problems which confronted the
                    inhabitants of the territory. Prominent in the list are laws regulating imprisonment for debt and
                    specifying what property of a debtor should be exempt from execution. The status of negroes and
                    mulattoes in the territory was a problem which called for legislative action. Acts which created new
                    counties, fixed the location of county seats, regulated the method of conducting county business,
                    and prescribed the organization of the local courts were numerous. As might be expected, laws
                    pertaining to the militia accounted for a considerable part of the legislative output of the period,
                    the militia act of 1814 covering more than sixty pages—a lengthy act for those days. This
                    act appeared in the session laws with its own index, and five hundred copies were ordered separately
                    printed.</p>
            <p>Then, as now, taxation constituted an important subject of legislative action. For the most part, the
                    taxes of the period were specific in their nature rather than <hi rend="i">ad valorem</hi>; land,
                    although taxed at a fixed sum per hundred acres, was commonly divided into three classes so that the
                    better land would pay a higher rate. The use of the taxing power as a means of striking at practices
                    which were considered socially undesirable is evidenced in the provisions of a tax law of 1813 to
                    the effect that, while the annual tax on ferries should not exceed ten dollars, the tax on every
                    billiard table was to be fifty dollars. Numerous acts for the relief of sheriffs who were unable, as
                    tax collectors, to collect the taxes charged against them, indicate that tax delinquency was
                    widespread. While the courts were authorized to grant divorces, legislative divorces were not
                    uncommon. Other statutes typical of the period are those regulating the number of days which a
                    person should be required to work on roads, penalizing the obstruction of navigable streams,
                    providing bounties for the killing of wolves, and regulating the methods of electing public
                    officials.</p>
            <p>The session laws included in the volume are reprinted from original editions, many of which are now
                    rare and relatively inaccessible. The value of the work is enhanced by the printing, as Appendix I,
                    of the private acts of the assemblies <pb n="155" id="VAA4025-031-2-073"/> of 1810 and 1814, which
                    were originally printed with the general acts of those sessions by title only and are here
                    reproduced from the enrolled acts in the office of the Secretary of State. Certain memorials and
                    joint resolutions of general significance make up the contents of Appendix II. In the third appendix
                    the roster of territorial and county officials published in the Philbrick volume is brought down to
                    1816. The entire volume is excellently indexed.</p>
            <p>The text of the legislation presented in the volume has heretofore existed only in a fugitive form
                    which will become less and less generally accessible with the lapse of time. The work of the editors
                    and of the Historical Bureau, in making this material readily available to research students, the
                    bar, and the general public, deserves the highest commendation.</p>

               <hi rend="i">A Kentuckian at the Court of the Tsars.</hi> By James Rood Robertson. Berea College
                    Press, Berea, 1935. Pp. 286, $2.50, illustrated.</head>
            <p>This volume deals with the ministry of Cassius M. Clay to Russia 1861–62 and
                    1863–69. Mr. Clay was one of Kentucky's most picturesque characters. Dr.
                    Robertson's book presents a fine biographical study of what was perhaps the most dramatic
                    and colorful decade in Mr. Clay's life of ninety-three years. Though Mr. Clay would
                    naturally have preferred a diplomatic position in <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> or <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, a conference with President Lincoln led him to accept an appointment to Russia. This
                    was most fortunate as he was well fitted for the Russian post and he soon came to refer to himself
                    as "a sentinel on the frontier" (p. 35). He had much in common with the upper
                    classes of Russia and undertook to outdo the Russian aristocracy in their own field. He became a
                    welcome guest at social functions and invitations to his dinners were not only accepted but sought
                    after.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clay's letters were sometimes curious diplomatic documents, ranging over the whole field
                    of international affairs rather than being confined to specific issues. He was of course vitally
                    interested in the political and military conditions in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and often made suggestions and gave advice concerning these to Secretary Seward and
                    President Lincoln. His correspondence also gives interesting characterizations of
                    personalities—rulers, foreign ministers, <pb n="156" id="VAA4025-031-2-074"/> other
                    diplomats, etc., with whom he came in contact both in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> and in Europe.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clay was an enthusiastic admirer of Tsar Alexander II and of Prince Alexander Gortchacow, the
                    Russian Chancellor. The genuinely cordial feeling of Prince Gortchacow for Mr. Clay led to many
                    special attentions and unusual opportunities. An example of this is cited by Dr. Robertson in the
                    invitation to Mr. Clay to attend the reception given by the Mayor and citizens of Moscow in 1866, on
                    the occasion of the anniversary of Alexander's coronation and the Emancipation Proclamation
                    for the serfs—a courtesy, the first of its kind granted to Russia by a foreign legation.</p>
            <p>Dr. Robertson presents the interesting comparison of the position of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> during the Civil War, and Russia during the Polish Insurrection. When <placeName>
                        <country reg="enk">England</country>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName> were threatening intervention in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Civil War, our minister sought and obtained moral support from Russia who assured us
                    that we "could count upon most cordial sympathy". In 1863, during the Polish
                    Insurrection, Mr. Clay found the tables turned and he was to seek moral support of his country for
                    Russia when Great Britain, <placeName>
                        <country reg="fr">France</country>
                    </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <country reg="au">Austria</country>
                    </placeName> were proposing that the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> join them in intervention in Russia's internal affairs. Prince Gortchacow was
                    gratified at the refusal of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> to join these powers, and conveyed the Tsar's appreciation of the
                    "firmness with which the government of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> maintains the principle of non-intervention" … and the
                    "loyalty with which they refuse to impose upon other states, a rule, the violation of which
                    in respect to themselves, they would not allow" (p. 148).</p>
            <p>The author also discusses Mr. Clay's concern over French intervention in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName>, his opposition to the Congressional Plan of Reconstruction, his lack of sympathy with
                    the notorious Perkins claims against the Russian government, his activity in promoting the plan to
                    connect Russia and the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> by telegraph through Alaska and Siberia, and the Purchase of Alaska.</p>
            <p>The book is written in a charming narrative style and will appeal not only to Kentuckians but to all
                    who are interested in our diplomatic history. A noteworthy feature of the work is nine full page
                    illustrations. The frontispiece is a photograph of Dr. Robertson, who died in 1932. The other <pb n="157" id="VAA4025-031-2-075"/> eight illustrations pertain to the life of Mr. Clay and his
                    Russian mission. The little volume has faults which are evident to the professional historian, such
                    as incomplete footnotes. There are also evidences of the inexperience of the printer. The lack of
                    more complete documentation is doubtless due to the untimely death of the author. Dr. Robertson had
                    practically completed the manuscript before his demise. His widow, Catherine Lansing Robertson,
                    edited the manuscript and arranged for its publication. In spite of minor shortcomings, however,
                    this modest book is a wholesome and welcome aid to the understanding of our relations with a
                    friendly European power during a critical period in our history.</p>

            <p>Catharine Merrill was born in Corydon in 1824, her father, Samuel Merrill, being State Treasurer at
                    the time. When he brought the funds of Indiana to the infant <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, nine months after the birth of Catharine, his wife held the babe in her arms as the
                    wagon jolted over the hills and through the forests to the new capital. Here the child grew to
                    womanhood, and here she spent many of her remaining years. She became a great reader, traveled much
                    in Europe, and spent a number of years as a teacher in Butler College.</p>
            <p>This volume, though it gives an account of Miss Merrill's life and work, is largely made up
                    of letters. It was prepared by Mrs. Katharine Merrill Graydon, daughter of Miss Merrill's
                    brother. The author and editor has performed a fine service, not only for members of the Merrill
                    family and friends of the family, but for outsiders as well. One has only to read the correspondence
                    presented to know that Catharine Merrill was an unusual woman—a charming and helpful
                    friend to those privileged to know her, and an inspiration to the students in her classes. The book

            <p>Born in 1824, Miss Merrill lived and served to 1900—through an interesting period of great
                    changes. There are <pb n="158" id="VAA4025-031-2-076"/> chapters dealing with childhood, girlhood
                    and young womanhood, accompanied by letters and diary entries to show the spirit of the writer and
                    to reveal the unfolding of her life. Other chapters are based on her travels and sojourns in
                    European countries. One chapter is devoted to the Civil War years, and another to her career as a
                    college teacher.</p>

                    </placeName>, we have the situation summed up succinctly: "Presbyterians do not trust
                    Episcopalians, Episcopalians look with contempt on Presbyterians, both regard the Methodists as

                    age: "Those lectures were a real enjoyment to me. To walk through the dark land of the
                    past, pick out something here and there that I could apprehend and show it to eager young

            <p>Many passages could be quoted to show that this student, traveler, and teacher was also a poet, who

            <p>Any college that has survived the vicissitudes of one hundred years furnishes a good subject for the
                    historian. In his "Introduction" Dr. Cady speaks of the history of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College as "the story of the attempt of the Baptists in Indiana to function in
                    an educational way". Many of the small church colleges founded in the Middle West when the
                    region was yet in the pioneer stage have a fascinating history. Any writer who catches the spirit of
                    one of these institutions, who draws true portraits of the men who have given effect to its work,
                    and who somewhat correctly evaluates the influence emanating from it through years of trouble and
                    struggle as well as through periods of success, does a good work. To a large extent Dr. Cady has
                    measured up to these requirements.</p>
            <p>There are six chapters in the modest volume with the following headings: "The First
                    Decade"; "The Administration of George C. Chandler"; "President
                    Bailey's Time"; "The Rebirth of the College"; "Campus
                    Activities in Stott's Time", and "The College in Recent Years".
                    The account starts at the inception of the School, but does not cover the years since 1929. A great
                    deal of space is given to the several presidents who have guided the destinies of the institution.
                    The work of each is quite closely analyzed and the author has not hesitated to present evidence
                    whether favorable or unfavorable. He has also dealt very frankly with the short sightedness
                    manifested at times by the Baptist Church in its relationships with the College. In this respect,
                    the treatment of the period of the presidency of the courageous and far-seeing Dr. Elmer B. Bryan is
                    well done. In fact, it seems <pb n="160" id="VAA4025-031-2-078"/> clear that the School reached its
                    climax under Bryan's leadership, though he was needlessly compelled by leaders in the
                    Church to work under handicaps.</p>
            <p>It is characteristic of most college histories that they deal too exclusively with problems of
                    administration and with the activities of presidents. In short, there is a too-well established
                    routine into which writers of such histories are prone to fall. Not enough of attention is given to
                    faculty members, who do so much to give character and prestige to an institution, nor to the
                    worth-while students who are sent out in the world and who justify its existence. Dr. Cady has
                    succeeded in avoiding these faults to some extent. Though he identifies <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> College too closely with the several educators who have served as presidents, he does
                    deal with campus activities at some length.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the volume under review furnishes a valuable account of a strong church college which
                    has won a place in the sun. One has no hesitancy in saying that the school should be more heavily
                    endowed; that the Baptist Church should rise to the occasion, make a mighty effort to obtain
                    adequate funds, and never try to control the views of an able president who has vision and a liberal
                    outlook.</p>

            <p>The author of this history of education in Indiana was a teacher in the public schools, County

                        <region type="county">Henry County</region>
                    </placeName>, and then Superintendent of Public Instruction in Indiana. In 1909 he went to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName> to serve as President of the State Teachers College at LaCrosse. He left this position

                    </placeName> Teachers College at Flagstaff, where he remained for two years. His interest in the
                    development of education in Indiana was greatly stimulated by his work during the three terms which
                    he served as Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>
            <p>In the first eighty pages, Mr. Cotton deals with the earlier periods when educational progress in
                    Indiana was very slow. In the next portion of the book, the founding of <pb n="161" id="VAA4025-031-2-079"/> Indiana University, Purdue University, and the two State Teachers
                    Colleges is sketched, after which a brief notice is given to each of a long list of other colleges.
                    The remainder of the volume is devoted to some of Indiana's leading educators, and to a
                    series of problems connected with elementary, secondary and college education, including teacher
                    training, school revenues, library development, and the strong points of the general system that has
                    been built up in the state.</p>
            <p>The book will serve as a useful manual and parts of it will be read with enjoyment by teachers and
                    others who are interested in the educational progress of the state. The best part of the account is
                    that which relates to the author's work as State Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>

                            countries of the world had need of leaders ready to exercise this capacity, now would seem
                            to be the time.</p>
                    </quote> In our own country the new deal was launched a few months after the above statement
                    appeared, but the various experiments have long been strenuously opposed by powerful interests. So
                    many of the problems have demanded quick solution that those more fundamental, which require;
                    far-reaching changes and much time, have not received sufficient attention. Certainly they have been
                    widely confused with temporary expedients necessary to relieve multitudes in dire need. The great
                    object, however, is to pave the way for a future regime in which a far greater degree of economic
                    justice shall prevail. If the foundations for such a regime can not be laid under the existing
                    Constitution, then what blessings can come from the efforts of those who are out to save it?</p>
            <p>Every man who declares that the great purpose of the present is to preserve the Constitution, ought
                    to be able and willing, even anxious, to explain what he means. Whether he is a pillar of the
                    existing economic structure, a lawyer, a journalist, an army man, or just John Doe, he surely has
                    some idea as to what it is that he wants saved. It would require no very close analysis to show that
                    each one is out to conserve all the features of the existing order that he believes to be conducive
                    to his own well-being and power. He likes a Constitution that does not interfere with his own
                    interests, and he wants it to be interpreted by law-makers and courts so that he will not be
                    hampered by it in the future. Such, however, is not enough. If the Constitution is to be saved, it
                    will have to be interpreted so that the weak may have protection from the strong, so that the fruits
                    of the productive efforts of society shall be equitably distributed, and so that no citizen who
                    respects the rights of others can be denied the opportunity to work and live comfortably.</p>
            <p>From the War of 1812 to 1850, Indiana developed rapidly. Indeed the state was a dynamic commonwealth
                    in the <pb n="165" id="VAA4025-031-2-083"/> last decade before the Civil War. She was by 1850,
                    mature enough to send forth many colonists to newer areas farther westward. Her representation in
                    the national House and in the electoral college was, from 1850 to 1860, greater than that of any
                    state west of the Alleghenies except <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>. The only states in the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName> besides <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName> that ranked above her were <placeName>

                            <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
                    </placeName>, while she was exactly equal to <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mau">Massachusetts</region>
                    </placeName>. With 228 miles of railroad in 1850, she had 2,125 miles ten years later. From third
                    place in hog production at the beginning of the decade, she had risen to first place by the end. In
                    wheat production, she had climbed from sixth place to second. Wheat growing had shifted westward. In
                    1850, the first six states in the order of wheat production were: <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>, <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
               </placeName>, and Indiana. In 1860, the order was: <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, <placeName>
                  <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>, <region type="state" reg="vau">Virginia</region>
               </placeName>, and <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">New York</settlement>
                    </placeName> in seventh place. Whatever has happened since, citizens of Indiana had no good cause to
                    be discontented with the growth of the state to power and position up to the eve of the great
                    sectional conflict.</p>
