                    <l>yet 'twas a happy boyhood; not forlorn</l>
                    <l>with the thumbed book for gossip, not forlorn</l>
                    <l>with all the outdoor world for company.</l>
                    <l>Oh, many and many a balmy eve like this,</l>
                    <l>beside my pollard willows by the brook,</l>
                    <l>I sat and watched the greyness creeping on,</l>
                    <l>thinking 'twas pity days must end in nights</l>
                    <l>and one must sleep away so many hours,</l>
                    <l>losing such sweetness of the summer time.</l>

                    <l>my village stands among its fields of flax;</l>
                    <l>last year I still could find it, where to me</l>

                    <l>my placid scholar's town of colleges,</l>
                    <l>where the smooth river, lagging by its elms,</l>

                    <l>of glossy sward and wee white heather bloom</l>
                    <l>and rare and southern wildflowers of the moors,</l>
                    <l>one looked on the illimitable plain,</l>

                    <l>my heart and head grew number, day by day</l>
                    <l>I and my schoolboys seemed to grow less apt,</l>

                    <l>of unknown faces thronging to and fro!</l>
                    <l>my life went shrivelling there as if one brought</l>

                    <l>all part in aims and duties, like a tool</l>
                    <l>blunted with little use I am laid by</l>
                    <l>never to serve again; I sit apart</l>
                    <l>useless, forgotten, a lone purblind man</l>
                    <l>hid in an almshouseâbut the rest is good,</l>
                    <l>is very peaceful, and I feel God near,</l>
                    <l>near as I never knew Him in old days</l>

                    <l>what happy fireside future should be ours</l>
                    <l>if you should ever love me; afterwards</l>
                    <l>I sorrowed patiently; and in both whiles</l>
                    <l>lived in my peace as if you had not been:</l>

                    <l>and sat with me beneath my willow tree;</l>
                    <l>it was but chance that, for your goodâgirl treat,</l>

                    <l>(a shamefaced hero, conscious of renown,</l>
                    <l>and bearing such a greatness bashfully),</l>

                    <l>against my Gracie and her rival band</l>

                    <l>I heard my name sound in the topmost list,</l>
                    <l>the very roll of fame as I thought thenâ</l>
                    <l>maybe I thought it too long afterwards,</l>

                    <l>to put by hopes, and work, as the bird sings,</l>

                    <l>undazzled on the future, see the clouds,</l>
                    <l>and see the sunbeams, several, not one glow:</l>
                    <l>I know that I shall find my secret yet</l>
                    <l>and make my creature here another power</l>

                    <l>whom will the world thank for it? Me perhaps;</l>
                    <l>perhaps some other, who, with after touch,</l>
                    <l>shall make the springs run easier: I have read</l>
                    <l>the lives of men like me who have so sought,</l>
                    <l>so found, then been forgotten, while there came</l>
                    <l>an apter man, maybe but luckier,</l>
                    <l>to add or alter, gave another shape,</l>
                    <l>made or displayed it feasible and sure,</l>
                    <l>and then the thing was his ... as the rare gem</l>
                    <l>is not called his who dug it from the mines,</l>
                    <l>but his who cut and set it in a ring.</l>
                    <l>It will be as it will be: I dare count</l>
                    <l>no better fortunes mine than from first days</l>
                    <l>the finders met with, men who, howsoe'er,</l>
                    <l>seekers and teachers, bring the world new gifts,</l>

                <head>THE MANUSCRIPT OF SAINT ALEXIUS.</head>

                    <l><hi>THERE</hi> came a child into the solemn hall</l>
                    <l>where great Pope Innocent sat throned and heard</l>

                    <l>Grace, Purity, and the Pelagian creedâ</l>
                    <l>an ignorantly bold poor child, who stood</l>
                    <l>shewing his rags before the Pope's own eyes,</l>
                    <l>and bade him come to shrive a beggar man</l>
                    <l>he found alone and dying in a shed,</l>
                    <l>who sent him for the Pope, ânot any else</l>
                    <l>but the Pope's self.â And Innocent arose</l>
                    <l>and hushed the mockers âSurely I will go:</l>
                    <l>servant of servants, I.â So he went forth</l>
                    <l>to where the man lay sleeping into death,</l>

                    <l>and blessed him. Then, with a last spurt of life,</l>
                    <l>the dying man rose sitting, âTake,â he said,</l>
                    <l>and placed a written scroll in the Pope's hand,</l>
                    <l>and so fell back and died. Thus said the scroll:</l>

                    <l>Know now, all men who read or hear my words,</l>
                    <l>that I, Alexius, lived in much delights</l>
                    <l>of a dear home where they who looked on me</l>
                    <l>looked with a smile, and where I did but smile</l>
                    <l>to earn sweet praises as for some good deed:</l>
                    <l>I was the sunlight to my mother's eyes,</l>
                    <l>that waked their deepest blueness and warm glow,</l>
                    <l>I was my father's joy, ambition, boast,</l>
                    <l>his hope and his fulfilment. It may be</l>
                    <l>I grew too strong a link betwixt their hearts</l>
                    <l>and this poor world whose best gifts seemed to them</l>
                    <l>destined for me, grew, when they looked on Heaven,</l>
                    <l>a blur upon their sight, too largely near,</l>
                    <l>as any trivial tiny shape held close</l>
                    <l>will make eclipse against the eye it fills:</l>
                    <l>and so, maybe. for their sake, not for mine,</l>
                    <l>God took me from them, me, their only son,</l>
                    <l>for whom they prayed, and trebled pious deeds,</l>
                    <l>and took thought in this life.</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>I grew by them,</l>

                    <l>even from childhood, would my heart grow still</l>
                    <l>and seem to feel Him, hear Him, and I knew,</l>
                    <l>but not with ears, a voice that spoke no words</l>

                    <l>âI will be emperor when I am big,â</l>
                    <l>my foolish wont was âI will be a saint:â</l>
                    <l>later, when riper sense brought humbleness,</l>
                    <l>I said âWhen I am grown a man, my lot</l>

                    <l>He shews thy place and duty:â and, with tears,</l>

                    <l>And still the days went on, and still the voice</l>
                    <l>and then my father said âThe bride is chosen,</l>

                    <l>to stay us from a desolate old age,</l>
                    <l>and give us children prattling at our knees?â</l>
                    <l>and more and more they answered âShew to us</l>
                    <l>how He has called thee from thy certain path</l>
                    <l>where He has set thy feet?â Wherefore I said</l>

                    <l>And through the tedious feast my mind was torn</l>
                    <l>with reasonings and repentance. For I said</l>
                    <l>âBut I may love her,â and kept marshalling forth</l>
                    <l>such scriptures as should seem to grant it me:</l>

                    <l>and voices passing, I grew scared with doubts</l>

                    <l>with slow steps to the altar: she prayed long;</l>
                    <l>praying, poor child, to have me given back,</l>
                    <l>claiming me back of Heaven, as if her right</l>
                    <l>could equal That right, crying out for me</l>
                    <l>by loving names, and weeping, that my heart</l>
                    <l>went out of me towards her, wondering,</l>
                    <l>and yearned for her. But God was pitiful,</l>
                    <l>so that I swerved not.</l>

                    <l>threw from a massive column by the door,</l>

                    <l>full on the face of Peter where he wept</l>

                    <l>but, did she give one startled sudden cry,</l>
                    <l>womanlike, I had been betrayed: and then</l>
                    <l>I feared her if she wept.</l>

                    <l>dropped from her loosened hair, then, kissing it,</l>
                    <l>passed out, and, for a moment long, forgot</l>

                    <l>I broke into such weeping that the men</l>

                    <l>is a fair woman: but, or fair or foul,</l>

                    <l>I fled from, flying Claudia; suddenly</l>

                    <l>She talked to me, inconsequent grave talk</l>
                    <l>like children's, whispered after when I prayed,</l>
                    <l>and made me sing her hymns, so was content</l>

                    <l>as he has lived alone. My mother, though,</l>
                    <l>will lack me, ask for me, Claudia will send</l>
                    <l>to bid me hasten, then the word will come</l>
                    <l>âHe died this morning,â and she will not weep</l>
                    <l>but say âPoor wretch: God rest the parted soul,â</l>
                    <l>and turn to soothe my mother with some wile</l>
                    <l>to make her never miss me: and may be</l>
                    <l>Euphemianus will not hear the news,</l>
                    <l>or will not note it if he ever hears.</l>
                    <l>So I shall lie in the grave and they not care,</l>
                    <l>but wait for lost Alexius to come home,</l>

                    <l><hi>NOW</hi>, when Pope Innocent had read the scroll,</l>
                    <l>he bade one with him enter in the house</l>
                    <l>and call the lord Euphemianus thither,</l>
                    <l>and Claudia, and Aglaia. So they came,</l>
                    <l>Aglaia feebly leaning on the two,</l>
                    <l>and questioning them who knew not; so they came;</l>
                    <l>and the Pope pointed them to the dead man,</l>
                    <l>âBehold, for this is one whom you should know.â</l>
                    <l>Euphemianus gazed and was perplexed:</l>
                    <l>and the poor purblind mother gazed and peered,</l>
                    <l>âOld Lazarus? no, yes, old Lazarus;</l>
                    <l>asleep or dead? Why is it? is he dead?â</l>
                    <l>but Claudia answered softly âYes I know;</l>
                    <l>I knew it;â and then, suddenly, borne down</l>
                    <l>by one strong gust of passion, flung herself</l>
                    <l>beside the corpse, her head upon its breast,</l>
                    <l>her arms clasped straining round it, weeping out.</l>
                    <l>And Innocent answered the father's eyes,</l>
                    <l>âThis was Alexius, thy long lost son.â</l>
                    <l>But yet the father, stricken dumb, looked doubt:</l>
                    <l>Aglaia cried âMy boy, where is he then?â</l>
                    <l>and fretfully âThis is old Lazarus:</l>
                    <l>where is my boy? show me Alexius.â</l>

                <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                    <l>Then Innocent bade peace, and read the scroll:</l>
                    <l>Euphemianus, with his face hid down</l>
                    <l>between his hands, listened and never stirred;</l>
                    <l>and Claudia listened, weeping silently;</l>
                    <l>but Aglaia whispered always âIs it true?</l>
                    <l>is the tale of Lazarus or of my boy?</l>
                    <l>I cannot understand.â And, when 'twas read,</l>
                    <l>Euphemianus gazed upon his son,</l>
                    <l>âYet did he well?â he said âhe was our son,</l>
                    <l>he was her husband: how could it be well?</l>
                    <l>for look upon his mother, what she is.â</l>
                    <l>But Claudia rose up tearless, and replied</l>
                    <l>âAlexius did all well: he knew God called:â</l>
                    <l>and Innocent, not tearless, raised his hand</l>
                    <l>and spoke âShe answers wisely: he obeyed;</l>
                    <l>he knew, being a very saint of God:</l>
                    <l>let us bless God for him.â And they all knelt.</l>
                    <l>But still Aglaia could not understand.</l>
