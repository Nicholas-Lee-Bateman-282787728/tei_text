            Now sunburned autumn comes among the hills
            Flouting the green conventions
            She is strong—
            The sumac reddens as she comes along
            And the wan marsh with fire of gold she fills.
            The sun makes haste, and undue heat he spills
            Into the noon, and lank grasshoppers throng
            The rusty steeps. The locust sings his song
            With growing stress—I know not what he wills.
          
          
            From lowland cornfields, standing stark and pale,
            With tattered shadows carpeting their ways,
            I hear at intervals a lonely quail
            Who makes his meaning clear in simple phrase—
            He listens where the morning glories trail
            And calls amain throughout the startled maize.
          
        
        
          THE ROBIN SINGS.
          
            The robin sings in the frozen marsh
            Of a day the summer-time will bring—
            The fields are sullen, the reeds are harsh,
            But a full, warm note doth robin sing.
          
          
            The day is far, but the day is fair,
            And seems to bloom for him while he sings—
            The listening fields are not so bare
            And a milder freak the marsh wind flings.

          THE MORNING TRYST.
          
            When the ships of the morning come sailing in
            Out from the seas of splendor,
            When night veils are grown to be mistily thin
            And the air aromatic and tender,
            When pale lilies shake from their faces the dew
            And the rose, sweetly heavy, hangs low,
            It is then, my dear love, I'll be waiting for you
            When the East wears its Orient glow.
          
          
            Then lightly you'll trip o'er the dew jeweled mead,
            Through the plume of white mist in the vale;
            Over the brooklet your way you will speed
            To the silver birch, slender and pale,
            And there I'll be waiting, my Mary to greet,
            My Mary—the light of my eyes!
            Then for a few golden moments—how fleet—
            Two fond hearts will taste Paradise.
          
          —BESSIE JOHNSON-BELLMAN.
        
        
          IN THE SHADOWS.
          
            If death means that no longer we partake
            Of earth's fair feast; that we no more can know
            Enjoyment in the roses; winds that blow,
            When crimson clouds of morning gladly break,
            And all the valleys and the woodlands make
            Triumphal arches; heeding not the flow
            Of winding rivers, or the mist and snow.—
            If this be death, then I shall not awake.
            My life is purposeless: with empty hand,
            I mark each year, the rose, the bird, the bee;
            I catch the scent that gladdens all the land;
            I hear the song that rings full-throated, free;
            And view the honey, but I understand
            In this wide bounty there is nought for me.

          THE EDGE OF THE WOODS.
          
            Here clover blooms and is the brown bees theme—
            A little brook slips down from its high well,
            Tinkles upon the ripple like a bell
            And fails among the rushes like a dream.
            The wilds are soft with many a misty gleam—
            Some near vine sheds its fragrance, and a spell
            Of hidden song falls ceaselessly, to quell
            Morrows and yesterdays and thoughts extreme.
          
          
            'Tis good to be with mother earth apart—
            To lie in her warm lap and hush my cry.
            Seeing the rosebuds into color start—
            To listen to her gentle lullaby
            Of lowly things, and soothe my anxious heart
            When its wild longings push against the sky.

          THE COWBOY'S SONG.
          
            Prairie winds all around me are sighing!
            For a home's pleasing comforts I yearn,
            Yet high in my heart hope is flying,
            For my darling awaits my return.
            Yes, my darling awaits for my coming!
            She said, when she kissed me adieu,
            "Go, precious one, hasten! The sooner
            To come back and find I've been true!"
          
          
            A hard fight with grim fortune I'm making,
            And I long that the scales may soon turn.
            For oh, how my heart is sore aching
            For the darling who waits my return!
            Yes, my darling awaits for my coming!
            She said, when she kissed me adieu,
            "Go, precious one, hasten! The sooner
            To come back and find I've been true!"
          
          —KATE WARTHEN SEARCY.
        
        
        
          AN IDYL OF THE PAST.
          
            One moment in the dim recess
            Of that grim past let me reside,
            And long once more for love's caress,
            The charm of some one's tenderness
            And ideals deified.
          
          
            Through narrow paths that I have known,
            At eventide again I stroll,
            And see the village lights that shone
            Upon a watcher, who, alone,
            Sat on a grassy knoll.
          
          
            Oh! there within the self-same place
            A broken-hearted lover stood;
            Torn from a sweetheart's fond embrace—
            Soured cynic, standing face to face
            With elfish solitude.
          
          
            What wonder that the scar remains
            E'en in this far and distant day!
            What wonder that the self-same chains
            Still bind me to those leafy lanes
            Where she was wont to stray!

          LIFE.
          
            Lo, it is night and yonder is the moon—
            The hill tops rise and smile
            And the deep vale lies black across the land—
            There is no sound or song—
            Naught moving, save the slowly changing light
            And now an errant star, wild riding down
            The far off field of blue, in urgent quest.
            O, my vain soul! have peace—
            The world alone is mine, and I would grow
            As a tall tree into the Heavenward air.
            Knitting my roots more deeply in the earth
            While day abounds and sunshine warms the world;
            Or, when the darkness and the blast come on,
            Stand high against the battling storm, and know
            The mighty joy of bravery—
            For there are life and death, and life is mine
            And death seems far away—a sacred thing.

          AMBITION.
          BESSIE JOHNSON-BELLMAN.
          
          
            O talk not to me of the sin of ambition,
            'Tis the glorious forecast of coming fruition;
            'Tis the acorn's proud swelling to copy the oak,
            'Tis the felling of forests by many a stroke;
            'Tis the doing one's noblest and best every day,
            The striving to live in an ideal way,
            The meaner self crushed and the better self grown—
            Ambition, come thou! In this heart set thy throne!
          
        
        
          IN A LETTER.
          
            Petals of roses from yesterday,—
            Odorous, faded and dry.
            Proudly they flaunted their colors so gay,
            Nor feared that such as I
            Should ruthlessly strip from their nodding spray,
            And fold them away, to die.
          
          
            The pretty dears, they little knew
            My purpose; I but meant
            To send them far away to you,
            And they should be content
            To symbolize a friendship true
            Ere their brief charm is spent.
          
          —BESSIE JOHNSON-BELLMAN.
        
        
        
          TO A PRAIRIE BARD.
          
              "I want the hills! I want the streams!
              I'm sick of prairie sand,
              I want to catch the morning gleams
              Across the tumbling land."
            —MERWIN.
          
            My bard is homesick I now see,
            He yearns for forest shades,
            He dreams of streams that flow so free
            Through cat-tail everglades.
            He catches gleams from sand to hill
            And tosses in his chair,
            He craves the dancing, laughing rill,
            The forest, vine and tare.
          
          
            I have been homesick for all these,
            I know his craving well,
            I love the hills and streams and leaves,
            Far more than I can tell.
            No prairie field has charms for me,
            I stroll by forest streams,
            The giant trees in gallantry
            Toss down the sunny gleams.
          
          
            My prairie bard, you come to-day,
            I'll take you for a stroll,
            O'er the hills and streams—away
            To mossy forest knoll;
            We'll catch the breath of purest air,
            Where hawthorn scents the breeze,—
            We'll hide away from thorny care,
            Behind the shady trees.
          
          —HARVEY PORTER LAYTON.
        
        
          THE ELFIN KNIGHT.
          
            The moon is up, and flooding with her bright
            And tranquil rays the river-shore and glade;
            And here within this leafy colonade,
            Sequestered deep from mortal sound or sight,
            I pause to hear the plaint of Elfin Knight,
            As low he trills his evening serenade
            Beneath his lover's bower, half-afraid
            It will not please nor waken love's delight.
            A favored minstrel! Where the lilies lean,
            She softly watches him with soul-lit eyes,
            And hand aloft lest leaves that intervene
            Shut out the music of his heart-felt sighs,
            And though to him secluded and unseen,
            She gives his tender message sweet replies.

          TO AN ANGRY SUITOR.
          
            I answered you gently, but firmly, "No!"
            When you asked me to be your wife;
            Why will you declare my refusal unfair,
            And say it has blasted your life?
            I did not snare this—your offer amiss
            Of your love, your land and your name—
            You candidly own! Then why say of stone
            Is my heart? As if I were to blame!
          
          
            I answered you gently and firmly then,
            And I told you the reason why;
            You know if I could I would spare you this pain,
            But I can not—will not—live a lie.
            I could not be true to my vows and to you—
            Without love I never shall wed;
            'Twould be life—time dirge—you are cruel to urge—
            'Twere better we both be dead.
          
          
            Don't say that your love for both is enough!
            Ere long you would discover
            That a one-sided love is comfortless stuff
            To the one who is the lover.
            Though your love now is strong it would not be long
            Till you'd curse the day when we met;
            But I trust that we will for aye be friends still,
            And neither have aught to regret.
          
          
            Resign your false hopes; your anguish remove;
            You are too brave to weakly repine
            The course I've expressed I have judged to be best
            Both for your future weal and for mine.
            You will thank me, I know, as years come and go;
            You may win you a worthier bride,
            Who will return love real, such as I do not feel,
            And will faithfully stand by your side.

          SOMETIME.
          
            Sometime, sometime,
            Promises are made,
            By a youth and hopeful girl,
            Rosy cheek and chestnut curl,
            Strolling in the shade—
            Sometime, sometime,
            Golden fancies fade.
          
          
            Sometime, sometime!
            Have you ever thought
            How you promised years ago
            To be true in weal or woe,
            When your heart meant naught?
            Sometime, you will
            See the wreck you wrought.
          
          
            Sometime, sometime,
            When the end is near,
            You will take a casual glance
            Backward o'er the broad expanse,
            To the shadows drear,—
            Sometime, sometime,
            Teardrops will appear.

          A WISH: TO MARJORIE.
          
            If change must come to you when you ascend
            To those far courts where we sojourn for aye,
            How shall I know you in that distant day,
            When scenes of earth with those of Heaven blend?
            How shall I come to you who now attend
            My footsteps as I journey down the way?
            What sign between us shall there be to say,
            You stand within the presence of your friend?
            I know naught of the wonderland that lies
            Secluded from my view; but should a change
            Possess the dreamy depths of those blue eyes,
            Or rose-red cheeks, or bind your tresses' range,
            I should not know you; in the olden guise,
            I hope to greet you when all things are strange.

          HOMESTEAD DREAMS.
          
            If I could stroll to pasture shades,
            Where homestead dreams are old,
            Where stately trees stand guard at glades,—
            I guard my shepherd's fold;
            The world would seem once more anew,
            The languid streams would wake,
            The woodland morn through flashing dew,
            Would stroll down through the brake.
          
          
            The birds would sing in sweeter muse,
            The torch of noon would glare;
            The sumac flames at night refuse
            To let me go from there.
            No village mars this dear retreat,
            No plowshare turns the clay,
            I eat the apples which are sweet,
            And throw the cores away.
          
          
            The sober and the gay with smiles
            Think of my homestead dreams,
            Where stately trees for miles and miles,
            Fringe laughing, forest streams.
            Dreams of home are dreamed again,

          FOR YOU.
          
            I send you some pansies to-day, friend,
            That were cared for by my own hands,
            And they rival in beauty and fragrance
            The products of sunnier lands.
            O, the rose is the flower of romance,
            The violet vows to be true,
            But the delicate odor of heart's-ease
            Always reminds me of you.
          
          
            They were waked by the morning sunbeams
            And bathed in the evening dew;
            They slept all night in the white moonlight,—
            They knew they were growing for you!
            So wear them, because of our friendship;
            Let them lie in your bonnie brown hair,
            Then, after long weeks of waiting
            They will find their reward, nestling there.

          THE HORSEBACK RIDE.
          
            The prairie, the prairie! Its beauties, oh, see!
            Come gallop its green, rolling surface with me:
            The swish of its grasses makes faint music, sweet,
            Bestirred by our galloping horses' swift feet.
            Then over the hillocks and straight to the West,
            To the land by the wind and sun both loved the best,
            Through briar-set copses were jackrabbits sleep,
            Through rough, rocky canons where silver brooks creep,
            Then away once again through the swift swirling air
            That plucks like sprite fingers your clothing and hair.
            O, with wild exultation your true heart will beat
            When over the prairie on mustang so fleet
            You feel all your being the center of power,—
            And oft you will sigh for return of this hour
            When once more ensconsed in your far, city home,
            So mount your good mustang, and come, stranger, come!

          THE RED BIRD IN WINTER.
          
            When wintry woods are silent with the cold
            And all the paths are deep with dazzling grit,
            Some gracious mood of Fortune may permit
            A weary-eyed snow-gazer to behold
            The vivid red bird. He is blithe and bold,
            Haunting the dreary elm tops, he will sit
            Beside the dark green mistletoe, or flit
            In ruddy flame athwart the frozen world.
          
          
            Some morning, when the glory of the sun
            Falls upon groves of crystal, he will sing
            A pean of the universe, so fit
            That all the shadowy purlieus shall be won
            And dreams be born of fair realms, widening
            From mortal coigne to verges infinite.

            I'm weary of the narrow way
            That I have trod these lonely years—
            Oh! let me leave it for a day,
            And stroll in other spheres.
          
          
            Let me recline in childish mirth
            Away from life's cares—fancy free.
            Beside the broad and cheerful hearth,
            And dream of things to be.
          
          
            Let stern ambition take her place,
            Within my young and hopeful soul,
            And there in dreamland's fond embrace,
            Look forth and see the goal!
          
          
            Oh! let me wander to the source
            Of life's long stream—and be a boy,
            Before it gathers on its course,
            Rude pebbles of alloy!
          
          
            For I am not what I would be,
            If I were but a boy once more—
            To sail again, the troubled sea
            Still farther from the shore.
          
          
            I know that I would realize
            Those tender dreams of long ago;
            The bad would vanish—and the skies
            Would gleam with brighter glow.

            The play is done—the curtains fall
            Upon the saddest act of all—
            A woeful tragedy of tears,
            A glimpse of those forgotten years
            Whose memory wakens with the call
            Of piping quail upon the wall,
            Or mournful melody withal,
            Of that sad echo filled with fears—

            Depart, thou ever-vexing gloom,
            My heart is full of care
            My life is shadowed with a doom,
            Far more than I can bear.
          
          
            I stand in dreams upon a height
            All viewless to my gaze,
            And long for that departed light
            Of golden other days.
          
          
            My hopes are fled—all gold is dross,
            My heart is fraught with pain,
            While fleeting dangers flash across
            My visionary brain.
          
          
            I see the fields I loved so well,
            Where once I used to rove,

            The hunter's hounds give up the chase;
            The owl's lone shout,—lamp-lights are out,
            And gay depart from festal place.
          
          
            The game is done,—the shekels won,
            The cup is empty at the pail;
            The embers die,—the moonlit sky
            Points out the cold, departing trail.
          
          
            The embers glow, till life burns low,
            And then I fade from eyes of men;
            The curtain falls in life's vast halls,
            Where I shall never play again.

            Laid by a whim in death's unhallowed grave,
            I see him now, by England once defied,
            Silent, the while his "Common Sense" replied
            To the base insult that the Briton gave,
            And lo, our Nation's warrior true and brave,
            Was banished to the mercies of the wide
            Unfeeling world, while from across the sea,
            Came news of one who could not be suppressed,
            But proclaimed liberty, though bound with chain,
            Or shackled with disgrace and poverty.

            It's kind o' nice to think about,
            The shade I use to walk into
            An' stay all day—jist laid squar' out—
            To fish an' snare the minner-crew.
            Cute silver-sides wud more 'n glis'en
            Down in the water-hole,—thar I'd
            Set an' nod—an' see, an' lis'en
            At the cows—worter up mid-side,—
            Stomp an' throw their heads 'round each way
            'Cause the flies wuz bad.—Their tails wuz
            Swung 'round an' 'round, an' had full play
            With big cow flies that 'd bite an buzz.
            A kingfisher—with his chatter cry—
            Lit on a limb hung 'cross the crick,
            To watch the minners swimmin' by,
            Then chatter like he'd played a trick.
            Purty soon he'd leap in the air
            An' fly around, up through the wood;
            Quicker 'n scat! he'd be right back there—
            Or send a feller jist az good.
          
          
            What kep' me from gittin' lonesome
            Wuz the fly-up-the-crick,—awkerd,
            Long-necked,—long-legged;—by gum
            He wuz the greenest actin' bird
            I ever seed fly,—walk, or stand
            'Round anywheres. Act like he's beat
            No matter how it wuz. The sand
            Seemed hard on his tender feet.
            He walked like he'd fall apart
            If he stept on a sticky burr;
            It wud purty near break his heart
            If he mist what he's fishin' fer.
            He wuz lazy az he could be,—
            Think he wuz by the way he'd walk
            'Round in the worter—slow az me;—
            He'd crane his neck to watch—jist gawk
            'Cause I wuz doin' az I please,—
            Or think 'bout his jumped-claim down
            Thar in the shade where the bees
            Hug the blooms, no matter who's 'roun'.
          
          
          
            Thar goes the kingfisher—dives past;—
            Jist scrapes the worter—awful quick;
            He got the minner,—then he sast
            Back at the slow fly-up-the-crick.
            Then he flew up on a dry snag,
            Et his dinner in highest style,—
            Chatterin'—jist seemed to brag
            Like he wuz better'n the whole pile.
            I throwed in the water-hole,—
            'Way went the kingfisher,—skeered.
            The fly-up-the-crick,—crazy soul,
            Like a fract'us team, done geared,
            Jist went scootin' up the crick!
            I wuz left to pull out fer home,
            An' quit fishin'. Drapt in my stick,
            (Lodged 'ginst the foot-log an' foam)
            Wound up my line—drapt in the can.
            Chubs I ketched, wiggled an' flopt
            In the deep, round hole in the san',
            That wuz full o' worter. I stopt
            An' looked a minit or so,—
            No use, I tho't, to take 'em home;
            I tuck 'em out, an' let 'em go
            In the hole I ketched 'em from.
          
          
            I'd offen leave my team an' plow,
            Go to the crick to lay up fence,
            In the spring when the breachy cow
            Re'ch fer weeds, like she had no sense;
            When grass knee-deep, everywhere,
            Kivered pastures fer an' wide,
            I don't know what she done it fer,
            Without she was not satisfied.
            I am satisfied!—I am shore.
            The crick has a hole jist az deep
            Az 'twuz ten year ago, or more;—
            Tho' kind shifted 'round a-heap.
            I long quit fishin' in the crick;
            I like to think 'bout times I had,
            Full o' mischif az I cud stick,
            (Outer reach o' pap's ellum gad!)
            I'd lounge like I wuz stuck to stay,
            Watchin' the birds an' bumble-bees,
            Ketchin' the smell that lasts all day
            Wrapt in the best an' coolest breeze.
            I tho't them days wuz fine,—but not
            Half az fine az they seem to-day,
            When they come from the Not-For-Got,
            An' hang around to make me gay.
            The pictur' jist skunks what I've told
            'Bout the crick, where I use to be;

            At sunset on a green decline,
            I stood and fixed a longing gaze,
            Upon the east where day was born,
            Now burnished in a leaden haze.
          
          
            And then toward the west I turned
            And saw the great red sun depart,
            And thought, "as fades this splendid day,
            So fades the hopes within my heart."
          
          
            Full twenty seasons in the past
            On such a day as this I stood,
            And saw the splendor of the sun
            Fade in a distant purple wood.
          
          
            Beside me stood a girlish form,
            Who eagerly the distance scanned,
            While I a wild and careless youth
            With loving heart the future planned.
          
          
            She listened with a dreamful awe,
            With lifted eye and lips apart,
            The while the beauty of the scene
            Made a firm picture on my heart.
          
          
            'Twas but a dream from which I woke,
            When many years had passed away.
            And lo, its eloquence I saw
            In the fair sunset of today.

          AN AUTUMN SCENE.
          
            From barren boughs the gathered dampness drips,
            And twilight shadows softly fall around
            On river-valley, and deserted ground
            Of ruined gardens, where in death's eclipse
            The rose's face is shadowed; shattered ships
            Of broken leaves touch with a muffled sound,
            And toward the springs of freshness that abound
            The fainting lily leans with pallid lips.
            The lilac presses to the fire-lit pane,
            Like some devoted maiden who has sinned
            Beyond redemption. Shades of twilight gain
            On day's confines; the summer ranks are thinned
            But still I mark the lances of the rain
            And hear the silver bugles of the wind.

          A BALLAD.
          
            I saw him last night slowly walking
            Along the old path on the hill—
            His head was bowed down—he was talking
            To himself in low tones; volatile
            Were all things around him. The rill
            In the valley slipped gently along,
            The while he strolled onward at will,
            As sad as a nightin-gale's song.
          
          
            He thought of the wonderful sages,
            Who slumber so solemn and still
            In the cold vaults of the mystical ages
            But send forth their wisdom to fill
            The vaults of the mind, and instill
            A hope in the suffering throng,
            The while he strolled onward at will,
            As sad as a nightin-gale's song.
          
          
            Still backward and forward he wandered
            Along the old path on the hill,
            He thought of the love he had squandered
            In earlier youth, and a thrill
            Broke loose in his bosom to chill

          TWO ARTISTS.
          
            You have heard of the wonderful window
            That the Roman artist made
            Of the sparkling bits of crystal
            And the glowing tints arrayed,
            Till it seemed complete and lovely
            To the people who beheld,—
            And the artist was contented,
            Strong his heart with pleasure swelled.
          
          
            You remember how the servant
            Who assisted at the toil
            Saved the cast off bits of color,
            Treasured there through all the moil.
            Then he built of these wee fragments
            That the one had counted naught,
            O, a vastly finer window
            Than that by the artist wrought.
          
          
            So it is, my little children,
            In this life through which we move;
            Not the one with wealth and honor
            Shall the greatest progress prove.
            But the child of humble fortune,
            Who can toil with steadfast eye,
            Shall behold his window growing
            Still more fair, as years go by.

          DISAPPOINTMENT.
          
            In joy I sit and think
            About how love shall be,
            I walk life's river brink
            And sail upon life's sea:
            These lines were sung to one,
            Who sleeps the sleep of death;
            The heart I nobly won
            Is gone with fleeting breath.
          
          
            I con the tear-stained lines,
            I think of them in mart,—
            Beyond life's bleak confines,
            There is a broken heart.
            I sit and think again
            About how love shall be;
            In haunts of busy men,
            My soul goes out from me.

            Before it faded from the view
            Of watchers on the shore,

            I see again the many friends
            I loved in days of yore,
            Returning with their gifts of praise
            I can possess no more.
          
          
            Ah! fleeting remnant of a dream,
            To what port hast thou flown?

            To charm the ear or cause the tear to start,
            With this one player from the stage withdrawn.
            The farce is ended; lay the mask aside

            To darkling fernbanks in the forest deeps
            A boon of campion stars; or lurks and leaps
            In cloud and ray, and ripening essence flings
            On July fields; or, done with ministerings,
            Lies down beneath the windy trees and sleeps.

            From any scroll or tome; before the time

            The heart amid its lost possessions yearned
            For life beyond the grave. Love weeping turned
            And hoped that in some distant, sunny clime
            Its mate survived, far from the surge sublime
            Of death's long billow; where no rose inurned
            In autumn's sepulcher, at twilight brings
            The breeze to mourn its fragrant life's short lease;
            Where skies are bright, and harps with golden strings
            Vibrate to tuneful songs that never cease;
            Where heedless of the past, the sad soul sings

            Was the greatest of his kind;
          
          
            For, with precedent denied him,
            He devised this cleaving blade,
            And the niggard past supplied him
            Only with a scrap of jade.
          
          
            Then he smote, and chipped, and cluttered,
            All the stone floor of his den,
            And the sparks that spat and sputtered
            Lighted up the years of men.

          A ROSE AND A CURL.
          
            One eventide, as fainter grew each sound,
            Before the moon was up or lamps were lit—
            The time when dusky bats begin to flit,
            And fire-flies sputter in the marshy ground—
            I opened Byron's poems, and I found
            A turned-down leaf, and hidden under it
            A rose that long had faded, and a bit
            Of golden tress a hand had woven round.
            And then I thought of her who years ago
            Had placed the book upon her knees, and bent
            Above its tender pathos; buds may blow,
            And curls may dance in sunny blandishment
            But such as these that suit my fancy so
            I see no more along the way she went.

            O, that the morn would linger, that its loves might live!
            Now every full blown flower
            Has found at once its glory and its doom.
            Day waxes great, and fails.
            Sweet odors came
            From altars newly lighted by the dawn—
            Born of the flame and dying in the heat....
            Another morning shall efface this woe
            With newer light...
            But ever in the heart
            The past grows bold by cumulative years—
            The incense is dispelled—
            The fire abides unquenched, and grows
            To unforgetfulness.

            I stand by the casket that holds her

            The one playmate of my childhood,

            She went a bride from the village;
            A happier ne'er was won.
            She laughed, "Dick will fight my battles,
            You will fight yours alone!"
          
          
            Alas, when the storm-wind sunders
            The rose petals from the bloom!
            Alas, when the noon-sun deadens
            The violets' glad perfume!
          
          
            Fewer high hopes had been cherished
            Could she but then have known!
            Can he another's foes vanquish,
            Who can not conquer his own?

            Who then was his wife's strong champion?
            Who was her greatest foe?

            One day, long dead, these violets
            Lay in my love's dark hair,
            And their odor in the quiet room
            Suited her beauty rare.
          
          
            And now,
            Though all the world divide us, yet the scent
            Of dying violets brings to me
            A sense of desolation and regret—
            The Dead Sea Fruit of memory.
          
          
            Why was it, love, we parted thus?
            Chance wafted you away
            Like thistle-down on summer air,
            And Duty bade me stay.
          
          
            Ah well—
            We can not know the future, and perchance
            Our lives are better so;
            But these dead violets awake
            Love's haunting afterglow.

            The glad sun points again, with gentle rays,
            To westward sloping pastures, strewn with flocks,
            Where meet the waters from their highland ways
            And go together down between the rocks—
          
          
            Beyond the meadow's width of even sod
            Where yonder yeasty sea of thorough wort
            Breaks on its tawney beach of goldenrod
            In graceful groups the willow trees resort.
          
          
            Hung here and there upon the forest wall

            Gray mullioned windows, newly wrought, look down.
          
          
            Bright are the hues October's hand has laid
            Upon the woodland with a brush of air.
            The red bird dreams amid the maple shade
            And is not redder than his leafy lair.

          AUTUMN SONG.
          
            The dull and gloomy days are come,
            And yellow leaves are falling fast—
            The nights are frosty—summer's done!
            The sky is smoky, and the sun
            Shines dimly from the sky so vast.
            The pheasants now begin to drum
            Within the grove;
            And far away, I hear the hum
            Of locomotive on the rail;
            And farther yet, the gentle call
            Of lonesome quail—
            And gently, gently, sweet notes fall
            Of spoken love.
          
          
            The days are shorter than of yore,
            The horned-owls toot their doleful lay
            From shady wood and far beyond,
            The frog is silent in the pond.
            The squirrels long have ceased their play,
            And wisely do they hide their store
            Of fallen nuts.
            The bonnets that the milkweeds wore,
            Have been borne off among the trees,
            And now are resting here and there,
            Safe from the breeze.
            The beavers silently repair
            Their tumbled huts.
          
          
            The noisy jay sends its lament
            To wooded hill-tops where the day
            Is first discerned—and on the mead.
            The melancholy turkeys feed
            Upon the locusts, and at play,
            The children of the settlement,
            Send their halloo
            Across the land where summer went;
            While here and there, the lowing herd
            Browse on the hill-tops where the grass
            Is still unstirred—
            The doves coo dolefully, alas!
            'Tis their adieu.
