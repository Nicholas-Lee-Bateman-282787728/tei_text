            <p>It was in the summer of 1894, while on a visit with my brother, Prof. William D. Pence, to our
                    brother, the Rev. Edward H. Pence, D.D. (then the minister in charge of the First Presbyterian
                    church at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Janesville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>), that it was proposed that we make the trip to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Lodi</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
               </placeName>, a town some sixty miles to the northwest, to visit James
                    Bartholomew. James Bartholomew, with whom the writer had been in a desultory correspondence for some
                    time, was a son of General Joseph Bartholomew, one of Indiana's pioneers and in whose honor
                    our county was named.</p>
            <p>We desired to procure additional information concerning the noted man of whom so little had been
                    published, and to make sure of our intent, Edward sent a telegram to the Presbyterian minister at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lodi</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the Rev. James M. Campbell, D.D., inquiring whether or not James Bartholomew was still
                    living there. The reply only increased our eagerness when we read: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>James Bartholomew living here, quite aged and feeble and totally blind.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>Dining enroute at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Madison</settlement>
                    </placeName>, the beautiful capital of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="wiu">Wisconsin</region>
                    </placeName>, we took a Northwestern train for Lodi, some twenty miles to the north, where we
                    arrived at one p.m.</p>
            <p>Upon inquiring we found that Mr. James Bartholomew lived on a large and fertile farm about one mile
                    north of the <pb n="288" id="VAA4025-014-4-002"/> town, and further that the last train south would
                    be due in two hours. Promptly we procured a conveyance and within twenty minutes had reached the
                    vine-clad cottage of Mr. Bartholomew, which stood in the center of a large tract of land owned by
                    him.</p>
            <p>Our knock at the door was answered by a matronly lady who, when we had given our names and had asked
                    if we could see Mr. Bartholomew, asked us to await her announcement to him, as he was then lying,
                    resting on his couch.</p>
            <p>In a short time we were ushered into their pleasant sunny reception room. Mr. Bartholomew was
                    standing in the middle of the room with his outstretched hands to bid us welcome; and after I had
                    told him who we were, and introduced my brothers, he said, "Gentlemen, I feel that I am
                    honored" and "I am glad to see you," and turning his face to the writer,
                    added, "I have been wanting to see you for years."</p>
            <p>The latter expression appealed to us, particularly, as he was totally blind, and as we afterwards
                    learned he had been thus for over forty years, and that it had been caused from the
                    "sore-eyes" contracted while a schoolboy—a malady then quite prevalent.
                    His dignity, learning and courteous manner, together with his garb and the choker with which his
                    throat was dressed, struck us as the old-time gentleman of the fifties.</p>
            <p>We mentioned the object of our visit to be to procure some additional facts concerning his
                    illustrious father and made inquiry why there had not been more published concerning him, when he
                    told us the reason for this was the native modesty of the father; that he seldom made mention of his
                    acts, and that it required some effort to persuade him to relate any of his adventures, even to his
                    children.</p>
            <p>He informed us that General John S. Simonson, late of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, had prepared a sketch at one time of the father, but for some reason or
                    another it had never been published.</p>
            <p>That Mr. James Bartholomew was proud of his father was without question to us, as this feature
                    cropped out more than once in replying to our numerous inquiries.</p>
            <p>Thus from facts secured from Gen. Joseph Bartholomew's own son, at an age when early
                    recallments are vividly awakened, <pb n="289" id="VAA4025-014-4-003"/> as well as from other
                    authentic sources, we propose to essay a readable tribute to a great man—one of the most
                    noted of his time, of the unboastful sort, given more to the applied art of doing than to the fine
                    art of telling about it afterward.</p>
            <p>His days fell in the territorial times of the great State of Indiana, rough days, tough days and
                    men-making days—the days of which William Henry Harrison, John Gibson, John Tipton and
                    Joseph Bartholomew were products.</p>
            <p>The times found the man; the man shaped the times. It is ours to save to memory the fame and story
                    that we and posterity may go to school to them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Joseph Bartholomew was born in the State of <placeName>
                        <country reg="nju">New Jersey</country>
                    </placeName>, March 15, 1766. At the age of five the family removed to the western frontier of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="pau">Pennsylvania</region>
                    </placeName>, settling at <geogName>Laurel Hill</geogName>, where they were the neighbors of General
                    Arthur St. Clair, of Revolutionary War fame, and whom President Washington appointed as the first
                    governor of the Territory Northwest of the <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>Bartholomew's youthful days along the frontier were full of adventure and already at the age
                    of ten years he had become expert with the rifle. When but eighteen he was rated as an
                    "Indian fighter" and took an active part in the defense against marauding bands of
                    Indians.</p>
            <p>At this place, <geogName>Laurel Hill</geogName>, his father died, and he remained at home with his
                    mother until 1788, when he was married to Christiana Peckinpaugh, and the newly married couple
                    migrated to the then village of <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
               </placeName>, locating some four miles east of the
                    town.</p>
            <p>On August 3, 1795, at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Greenville</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
               </placeName>, Mad Anthony Wayne concluded his celebrated
                    treaty with the belligerent Wyandots, Delawares, Shawnees and other tribes, and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>, either as a volunteer or as an interested spectator, was present.</p>
            <p>The result of this treaty was the cessation of general hostilities for a time by the red men against
                    the whites, and was the first permanent cession of lands which, within a few <pb n="290" id="VAA4025-014-4-004"/> years, became a portion of Indiana. Bartholomew was engaged in the
                    survey of the boundary lines covered in this treaty and later helped the government surveyors in
                    running the subdivision lines of the First Principal Meridian. While he lacked the early education
                    he was the growing man and kept apace with the surroundings, in time becoming a practical surveyor
                    and in later days followed land surveying, and helped many of the incoming new settlers in locating
                    their land warrants.</p>
            <p>In 1798 he removed with his family to Indiana territory, settling in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> near the town of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and it was here in 1809 that his wife died. The fruits of this marriage were ten
                    children: <hi rend="i">viz</hi>: Joseph, Jr., who is buried in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>; Sarah, married Hugh Espy; John; Catherine, married a McNaught; Mary, married Patrick
                    Hopkins; Amelia, married Patrick Hopkins, relict of Mary, deceased; Martha, married Gamaliel Vail;
                    Christiana, married Isaac Epler; Marston Clark and Albert. There were no descendants or relatives,
                    in 1894, of General Bartholomew by this marriage residing in Indiana, save a few through the
                    daughter, Sarah Espy.</p>
            <p>In the spring of 1811 General Bartholomew was married to a Miss McNaught, and it was about this time
                    that by reason of his marked traits for leadership and under the threatened antagonism of the
                    Indians of Indiana territory, that he was selected by Governor William Henry Harrison as lieutenant
                    colonel of the regiment of militia.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Within a very few <list type="footnotes">

            <p>This vicinity was reached on Wednesday afternoon, November 6, 1811, and at a small prairie Colonel

            <p>The Indians met General Harrison and made a plea for peace, promising to give satisfaction the next
                    morning. There was considerable trouble in this palaver with the Indians, as the Frenchman whom
                    General Harrison had taken with him to act as interpreter, and who knew each of the chiefs
                    personally refusing to attend the powow, being in fear of them, for as he termed it, that he
                    "would be roasted."</p>
            <p>That evening after the powow with the prophet—his brother Tecumtha was then on a
                    missionary trip in the south to enlist the southern tribes into his confederacy, the American army
                    selected a site for camp about one mile north of the Indians' town. This was on an elevated
                    tract of woodland between Burnetts creek on the west and a prairie on its east, General Harrison
                    selecting Colonel Bartholomew as officer of the day, and on his suggestion, based upon his knowledge
                    of the Indian, the troops slept on their arms.</p>
            <p>On Thursday morning, November 7, 1811, at four o'clock, Colonel Bartholomew is going the
                    round of the sentries, a drizzling rain is falling and the darkness of the autumn morning is
                    suddenly lightened by the glare of the fire from the rifles of the treacherous Indians who a few
                    hours before had promised to give satisfaction at their peace powow. The fire from the Indian guns
                    made it as light as day. Colonel Bartholomew assumed at once the command of the foot soldiers, but
                    riding a very nervous horse found it difficult to handle him, and was greatly in fear of being
                    thrown. His troops were armed with squirrel rifles, and as the Indians at the first had the
                    advantage, it was here that through his tact he became master of the moment when he requested
                    General Harrison to give him a company of regulars whose guns were equipped with bayonets. General
                    Harrison at once gave orders for one of Captain Boyd's companies to follow Colonel
                    Bartholomew, when a bayonet charge was made by these hardened regulars and the Indians were routed.
                    This closed the short and decisive battle in favor of the American army, but in this charge, Colonel
                    Bartholomew received an Indian's bullet through his right forearm, breaking both bones.</p>
            <pb n="293" id="VAA4025-014-4-007"/>
            <p>It was fully two hours before his wound was dressed and the bones of his arm were set, he sitting on
                    a stump in the camp awaiting his turn, with the other wounded, for the surgeon, Dr. Andrew P. Hay,
                    his neighbor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>

                    including its captain and two lieutenants. John Tipton went home as captain of his company. Truly,
                    it was a day of sacrifice when the lives of Owen, Spencer, Joe Davis, Warrick, and Judge White went
                    out and an hundred others, but the red man was mastered in Indiana.</p>
            <p>The victorious army, after burying the illustrious dead, returned with wounded to <placeName>

                    </placeName>, reaching there November 24. When the militia was mustered out, Colonel
                    Bartholomew's wound gave him much trouble and he suffered throughout his entire after life
                    from it.</p>
            <p>He now returned to his farm, and it is at the next term of the territorial legislature that his
                    successful charge and gallant fight at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName> is mentioned, and made a matter of record by a vote of thanks for his valiant services

                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName> campaign.</p>
            <p>During the summer and fall of 1812 the western Indians became more fretful and a deplorable condition
                    existed amongst the white settlers along the lower <geogName>Driftwood</geogName> and
                        <geogName>Muscatatuck rivers</geogName> in southern Indiana, and on September 3, 1812, the
                    deplorable massacre by the savages occurred at the Pigeon Roost settlement, some forty miles south
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>. In this twenty-four persons, mostly women and children, were slain by a straggling
                    band of Shawnee warriors.</p>
            <p>At this date General Bartholomew, whose home was less than twenty miles from the scene of the
                    massacre, was away from his home, but a large force was soon collected at Charles-town which pursued
                    the retreating Shawnees. This force was under the command of Captain John McCoy, of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> cavalry. In an interview with the late F. C. Nugent, of Jonesville, Indiana, he
                    mentioned that his father was a member of the company which followed the savages to the <pb n="294" id="VAA4025-014-4-008"/> banks of the Muscatatuck and where the Indians were soon located, but
                    by the foolishness or cowardice of the captain, orders were given to sound the bugle, which was done
                    and the murderous Indians escaped by swimming the river. It was the general expression of regret
                    among the men that General Bartholomew was not in command, as he would have shown better judgment
                    and courage and the savages possibly would have been punished. The elder Nugent never forgave his
                    captain, and while of the same politics, ever refused to vote for him and denounced him to the day
                    of his death.</p>
            <p>In June, 1813, General Bartholomew, with one hundred and thirty-seven men, moved from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vallonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, in <placeName>

                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, with the intention to surprise and punish the Indians for some of their outbreaks and
                    depredations. Lieutenant Colonel John Tipton and Major David Owen were his aides. The line of march
                    was along the east side of Driftwood river through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>

                    </placeName> State road. Their trail was still visible seven or eight years later when the county
                    was organized, settled and named for <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>, and its nearest point to <placeName>

                    </placeName> is immediately west of our Garland Brook cemetery", east of the city.</p>
            <p>This expedition was of but short duration and in a skirmish with the Indians but one of them was
                    killed and a member of the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName> militia was wounded. The line of march on the homeward trip of the troops was along the
                    opposite side of Driftwood on the present line of the Mauck's Ferry State road, which
                    passed through the Dwight farm, two miles west of the city.</p>

                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, to disperse and punish the still hostile Delawares.</p>
            <p>His force consisted of five hundred and seventy-three men, volunteers, militia and regulars, and
                    among the latter Lieutenant Zachary Taylor, who was on the march through this neighborhood and who,
                    thirty-five years later, was elected President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>One of the sons of General Bartholomew, who was a member of one of the companies of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> militia ordered out, was sick and his father, the general, requested to act as his
                    substitute.</p>
            <p>This was agreeable to Colonel Russell and he appointed General Bartholomew as his aide. Upon the
                    march through this county the commanding officer was suddenly taken violently ill, when he at once
                    called General Bartholomew to his tent and said to him, "General Bartholomew, I put my
                    force under your command until I am better, and I give you full responsibility."</p>
            <p>The Delawares were overawed by this large force of troops and ended their further warlike
                    demonstrations in central Indiana.</p>
            <p>Colonel Russell, in his report of the expedition to Governor Harrison, said, "Colonel
                    Bartholomew acted as my aide-decamp. This veteran has been so well tried in this kind of warfare
                    that any encomiums from me would be useless."</p>
            <p>This was the last Indian expedition of the doughty <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew</region>
                    </placeName>, and he now quiets down again upon his farm in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>

            <p>One of the questions asked James Bartholomew was how his father regarded the treatment of the whites
                    toward the Indians in the encroachment upon their lands.</p>
            <p>His reply was: "Father thought the Indians had been harshly treated by the whites,"
                    and then added with apparent pride, "But he killed as many of them as any other
                    man." <pb n="296" id="VAA4025-014-4-010"/> James Bartholomew also mentioned that his
                    father, who had met Tecumtha, regarded this Indian chief as the greatest diplomat he ever knew.</p>
            <p>General Bartholomew erected the first brick farm house in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, and according to the statement of Mr. Nugent, by reason of his very happy and jovial
                    disposition and his love for young people, his home was the seat of constant gayety and hospitality.
                    The general was an accomplished dancer and he took as much delight in that amusement as did the
                    younger folks. His personal associations were of the highest and his social standing was the same.</p>
            <p>In December, 1817, we find him as one of the essential eleven in the constitutional organization of
                    the Grand Lodge of the Masons in the newly erected State of Indiana, which met at Corydon, the then
                    State capital, his membership being at Blazing Star Lodge, No. 36, <placeName>

                    State, which cast its vote for James Monroe. While a member of the Lower House, on January 11, 1820,
                    a bill was passed to appoint commissioners to select a site for the permanent capital of the State,
                    the federal government having donated four sections of its land for such purpose. In this act
                    General Bartholomew was named as one of the ten commissioners.</p>
            <p>The others named were Gen. John Tipton, George Hunt, John Conner, John Gilliland, Stephen Ludlow,
                    Jesse B. Durham, Frederick Rapp, William Prince and Thomas Emerson. To John Tipton, the methodical
                    man, we are again indebted for a written account of the trip northward through this portion of the
                    trail, which later, in 1823, was surveyed by Tipton under the act creating a State road forty-nine
                    feet in width from Mauck's Ferry on the <geogName>Ohio river</geogName>, northward through
                    Corydon, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Brownstown, to the newly made capital, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName> relates that on May 17, 1820, he, with <pb n="297" id="VAA4025-014-4-011"/> Conner and
                    Governor Jennings, with Tipton's black boy, Bill, met General Bartholomew at Colonel Jesse
                    B. Durham's at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vallonia</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and with General John Carr and Captain Dueson, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>, they made the trip together, northward, along the trail mentioned above. The
                    commissioners viewed several proposed sites, but before the end were divided only between the site
                    at Waverly Bluffs, now in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Morgan county</region>
                    </placeName>, and one which was selected. General Bartholomew and four others, including <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>, voted for the site which was selected, and which the following year was given the name
                    of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>General Bartholomew used the spade to make the mound showing the location of the middle corner of the
                    four donated sections, and, as James Bartholomew informed us, often claimed "to have dug
                    the first dirt for the State capital."</p>
            <p>This same year, 1820, he was elected to the State Senate from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, and at the 1820–21 session of the legislature a bill was introduced to
                    erect a new county out of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> and <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Delaware counties</region>
                    </placeName>. This was the first proposal to form a county from the "New
                    Purchase," as the territory purchased at the Saint Mary's treaty was called. This
                    territory, which embraces nearly the whole of central Indiana, had by an act of the legislature been
                    divided into two counties, making the Second Principal meridian as the dividing line. The western
                    portion was called <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the eastern <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Delaware county</region>
                    </placeName>. In the former term of the legislature it was enacted that the permanent north line of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName>, when the New Purchase was opened for settlement, should be the line dividing townships
                    7 and 8 north. This line is an east and west line one and one-half miles south of Axalia in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>. As the proposed new county would take of a three mile strip from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName>, there was developed a strong fight against the bill by the <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson county</region>
                    </placeName> representative, General Carr. <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>, a member from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Harrison County</region>
                    </placeName>, was leading the fight for the lines of the new county as proposed and in the end won
                    out. It was on <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Tipton</region>
                    </placeName>'s motion that the newly erected county was called for his old commander and
                    leader in all of the campaigns in which they had both engaged, seeking the vanquishment of the red
                    man in Indiana, General Bartholomew. It was near the last <pb n="298" id="VAA4025-014-4-012"/> days
                    of the term, January 21, 1821, that the bill had passed both the House and the Senate and the act
                    was at once signed by Governor Jonathan Jennings, on that date.</p>
            <p>Generals Tipton and Bartholomew were of opposing political parties—Tipton being a
                    Democrat, but this did not induce a lack of respect for each other.</p>
            <p>After Bartholomew's services ended in the State legislature, in which he had served with
                    conspicuous ability, in 1825, he returned to his <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName> farm, which then consisted of two hundred and thirty acres of excellent farming land.
                    In this year General Bartholomew was appointed a member of the board of commissioners to make deeds
                    of the lands in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Clark</settlement>
                    </placeName>'s <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grant</settlement>
                    </placeName> and at a meeting of the board, August 20, 1825, he was made its chairman. The records
                    show but one other meeting of the board, October 15, 1825, which he attended. Dr. Andrew P. Hay was
                    then also a member of this board, which held its meetings at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName>. This was the last public service of General Bartholomew mentioned, and according to
                    Mr. Nugent, he gave his full time to his farm.</p>
            <p>One of Mr. Nugent's stories of General Bartholomew concerned the finishing of the large
                    brick house which the general erected on his farm. The painter had taken great pains in graining the
                    front door, and having completed a very handsome job of it, the owner came up to enter it, and not
                    aware that the paint was fresh, put his hand on it to push it open, leaving an imprint of his hand
                    very markedly. The painter was greatly put out about it, and grumbled at having to do his work over,
                    but the general good-naturedly told him that it made no difference and to let it alone as it was,
                    and so it remained with the mark of his hand plainly visible for nearly forty years.</p>
            <p>It was while living here that Mrs. Bartholomew, the second wife of the general, died from the result
                    of an accident. She was quite fleshy and was one day riding horseback, on the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Charlestown</settlement>
                    </placeName> and Springville road, when a sudden clap of thunder frightened her horse and throwing
                    her, broke a leg. This injury was the cause of her death within a very few days.</p>
            <p>The fruits of the second marriage were five children, <hi rend="i">viz</hi>: George McN.; Nancy,
                    married James Bradley in McLean <pb n="299" id="VAA4025-014-4-013"/> county, <placeName>

                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana; and William Milton, then living at <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Pingree</settlement>, <country reg="ndu">North Dakota</country>
               </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In 1830, by reason of being one of the bondsmen for Dr. Andrew P. Hay, who had been appointed by
                    President Jackson, receiver of public monies at the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Jeffersonville</settlement>
                    </placeName> land office, and being called upon by the federal government for a settlement, a
                    shortage was found. General Bartholomew, whose share of the defalcation amounted to some
                    $10,000, was compelled to sell his farm to make good for his neighbor. It was Doctor Hay
                    who had dressed the general's fractured arm at the Battle of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName> and they had been personal friends for many years.</p>
            <p>General Bartholomew sold his farm at eighteen dollars per acre which, as Mr. Nugent mentioned, was
                    considered a very high price at the time, and taking his entire family, in 1831, removed to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">McLean</region>
                    </placeName> county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, and thus it was that Indiana lost the citizenship of one of her most noted men and one
                    of her foremost history-makers.</p>
            <p>He purchased six hundred acres of government land in one body and soon settled down again to farming
                    and improving his land. He was also engaged at his self-taught profession of land surveying. He
                    founded a town on his land and called it Clarkesville, in honor of his old-time friend, Marston G.
                    Clarke. This town is not now even on the map, but was located but a few miles from <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Lexington</settlement>
                    </placeName> in the "Sangamon Country."</p>
            <p>The <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> government had granted General Bartholomew a pension, for wounds and disabilities
                    received during the 1812 war, of twenty-three dollars per month. This he drew each year at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">New Albany</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and it was his custom to make this annual trip by horseback, the usual route
                    taken by him being <hi rend="i">via</hi>
                    <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Terre Haute</settlement>, <region type="county">Spencer</region>,
                            <settlement type="city">Bloomington</settlement>

                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>. It was recalled by the son that one of these trips was made by the State capital, <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Indianapolis</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which site he had assisted to select, and it was thought that this trip included the
                    trail through <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, which had been <pb n="300" id="VAA4025-014-4-014"/> named for him—and of
                    which the general and his family, as the son told us, were justly proud.</p>
            <p>Another story mentioned by Mr. Nugent—and also related by the late David Deitz, the first
                    treasurer of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, who had formerly been a neighbor in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clark County</region>
                    </placeName>, was of the swarthy complexion of General Bartholomew, who was very dark-skinned.</p>
            <p>When his neighbors heard that the new county being erected in the "New Purchase"
                    was named for their noted neighbor, some jocular friend suggested that "the soil must be
                    very black up there to suggest such a name."</p>
            <p>In 1840, when General Harrison was nominated by the Whigs as their candidate for President, General
                    Bartholomew, who had always been strong anti-<placeName>
                        <region type="county">Jackson</region>
                    </placeName> and a staunch Whig, promptly rallied to his old friend and companion-in-arms.</p>
            <p>He regarded General Harrison, as the son told us, as being the best off-hand speaker he had ever
                    heard, and that General Harrison, when on the march, always encouraged his men and frequently made
                    speeches to them to that end.</p>
            <p>The Whig's battle-cry in 1840 was "<placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Tippecanoe</settlement>
                    </placeName>" and our old hero, who had taken such an active part in that battle along with
                    the candidate for President, was soon identified in the political campaign. He saddled his horse and
                    on its back traveled through <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> and Indiana and in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="kyu">Kentucky</region>
                    </placeName> for his candidate. General Bartholomew was in Indiana at the time of the monster Whig
                    meeting, which was held at the "Battle Ground" and where he presided. It was
                    claimed that seventy-five thousand people were present at this, said-to-be, the largest political
                    meeting ever held in Indiana. A similar, huge meeting was held by the Whigs of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName> during the campaign, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Springfield</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where General Bartholomew was again selected to preside.</p>
            <p>The old hero is now, in 1840, seventy-four years of age and the prolonged horseback exercise during
                    the campaign had been too severe for him, having aggravated a chronic trouble, the inflammation of
                    the bladder, and returning to his home he became violently ill on election day, November 2, 1840,
                    and died the next morning at one o'clock.</p>
            <p>He was buried at the graveyard at the village founded by <pb n="301" id="VAA4025-014-4-015"/> him,
                    Clarkesville, and near his side is the grave of Captain James Bigger, who had commanded a company
                    under General Bartholomew in several campaigns against the Indians.</p>
            <p>It was not until 1895 that a suitable monument was erected at the grave of General Bartholomew, but
                    on each Memorial Day it has ever been marked with garlands of flowers by the members of the G.A.R.,
                    who appreciate and honor the memory of as brave a soldier as ever lived and who helped to carve out
                    two great States of the Middle West, Indiana and <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>General Bartholomew was not large of stature, but was described as weighing about one hundred and
                    forty pounds, about five feet eight inches in height, his form as straight as an arrow and of a very
                    dark complexion. At the time of his death his hair was white as snow, although as shown in the two
                    oil portraits now in possession of the board of county commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName> the hair is as black as the crow's wing.</p>
            <p>These portraits were painted in 1826, and one of them, the family picture, was in the reception room
                    at the time of our visit. The son told us that it was painted in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Louisville</settlement>
                    </placeName> and its old mahogany frame but adds to its ancient appearance. It was at the suggestion
                    of the writer that a loving son, who desired to add honor to the father, should make a gift of the
                    family picture to the authorities of the county which had been named for him.</p>
            <p>It was the last official act in 1895 of the writer, who was retiring from the term of office of
                    county auditor, to record the matter of the gift of James Bartholomew (whose death occurred a few
                    weeks before) of this picture as the "property of the board of county commissioners of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, forever."</p>
            <p>The first portrait of General Bartholomew was procured as a gift, through the writer, by the widow of
                    Judge New, the mother of J. Thompson New, of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Clay</region>
                    </placeName> township, in 1880. This picture was resurrected through the publication in George E.
                    Finney's newspaper at <placeName>

                    picture of General Bartholomew. This picture, an unfinished one, had been in the possession of the
                    News for over half a century and had <pb n="302" id="VAA4025-014-4-016"/> been painted by James New,
                    a young art student, who died in the late twenties. The work was said to have been done at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Salem</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and it is unquestionably a replica of the family portrait.</p>
            <p>The writer has the pleasure to own the Masonic apron and sash which General Bartholomew wore. These
                    have been loaned to St. John's Lodge No. 20, F.&amp;A.M., at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Columbus</settlement>
                    </placeName>, and having been placed in a frame now hang on her walls. These were presented to the
                    writer at the request of James Bartholomew at his death in 1895.</p>
            <p>General Bartholomew was not a member of any church, but was a constant attendant of the Presbyterian.
                    Mr. Nugent related that he was one of the most moral men he ever knew, and that he could not brook a
                    vulgar or profane word from any one.</p>
            <p>Here was a rare man, of the sort schooled in hardness for hard tasks. The crude environment with
                    which he had to do, so impoverished of all we call necessities, was an incorporate part of the man.
                    That unkempt soil, now so rich in answer to the returning toil, was then possessed by matted
                    grasses, the impenetrable forests; the air was fairly redolent of malaria, a haunting, invisible,
                    malignant legion of harrowing devils, which, peeved at dispossession, beleaguered with fateful
                    vengeance the despoilers of their abode, the virgin soil.</p>
            <p>These hardy sons and daughters of hardy fathers and mothers before them, told us little of their
                    hardships. They little knew the stage they wrought for a civilization so soon to burst almost
                    full-grown, and within less than a century. The mighty steam-boat, monarch and servant of commerce
                    and civilization, made possible this western empire. Hardly a generation had gone, when the
                    locomotive drove the steamer to exile. Now electricity haunts the locomotive with the dread of a new
                    rival. A new conqueror arrives; gasolene threatens to conquer space, time, and the air trembles for
                    its immemorial liberty. But let us not lay our emphasis here.</p>
            <p>We were wondering, however, what our brave old hero of simple, but strenuous days, should say, could
                    that Sangamon county graveyard give him back. Moreover, let us test if these, the complex, be better
                    days after all. Do they iron and <pb n="303" id="VAA4025-014-4-017"/> nerve our arms to severer
                    tests of the man and woman? Do the times, do the customs produce a more virile type of four-squared
                    manhood? Do ethics, does religion mean any more to us, with our greater facility, than they meant to
                    this man and to his contemporaries, who floored our stage for us to act upon?</p>
            <p>Not ships, nor armies, nor millions make our land great, but her men. In the high virtues of
                    physical, mental, moral devotion, do we now set to our children the killing pace which our fathers
                    set for us?</p>
            <p>Grave it deeply on the stone which we loyal men of <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Bartholomew county</region>
                    </placeName> carve to our hero, that it was a great man whom we honor; great in virtue, in vision,
                    in self-mastery; a man who held only vice in derision; and dying poor, with meagre acres to bequeath
                    to his own, gave an empire to those whose deepest sin shall be to forget their great benefactor in
                    the greed to exploit his benefactions.</p>

                    migratory nature it is difficult to say just what Indian tribes inhabited these parts. The Miamis,
                    Wyandots, Delawares, Pottawatomies, Kickapoos, Shawnees, Weas, and the Piankeshaws were the most
                    closely connected with this part of the State. At one time the <placeName>

                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> and then could find no way to cross either river, so we went up the <placeName>
                                <region type="state" reg="ohu">Ohio</region>
                            </placeName> for seven or eight miles and found a family of friendly Indians, who carried us
                            over in a canoe, the horses swimming. This was in the fall of 1803. We then traveled in a
                            northerly direction for more than a day, when we came to a large creek (Big Pigeon).
                            Following along this creek we crossed one of its forks (no doubt Big creek in Greer
                            township, <placeName>
                                <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                            </placeName>) and continued for several miles farther and came to another fork
                            (Smith's Fork). We did not cross this, but went up the south bank until we found
                            some high land and selected a place for a camp, intending to stay a few days and rest. After
                            being in camp about two days, nine or ten Indians came, pretending to be very friendly. We
                            gave them food, which they ate, but after finishing their meal they jumped up so suddenly
                            that we had no time to think; giving a loud yell one caught me, another my little sister and
                            a third attempted to hold my mother, but she got hold of an axe and in the scuffle struck
                            the blade in the Indian's thigh, severing the main artery, from which he bled to
                            death. Another Indian ran up back of my mother killing her with a club. My father was killed
                            at the fort by two Indians with clubs. About half of them took the dead Indian away and were
                            gone for some time. The rest loaded our plunder on the horses and we went away to the north,
                            leaving my father and mother where they fell, after taking their scalps. After wandering
                            that day and a part of the next we came to a big Indian town near a river, which I think is
                            now <geogName>White river</geogName>. My little sister was left there and I never saw her
                            again. I was then taken to an Indian town near <placeName>

                            </placeName> and lived with the Indians for several years. I went with a party on a hunting
                            expedition and was gone several days, during which trip I made my escape and met a party of
                            General Harrison's soldiers after the battle of <placeName>

            <p>Nearly every locality has its "first settlers", but rarely do the first actual
                    settlers of a community come down to the present as such. There are two kinds of first settlers:
                    those preserved by tradition and those found in the records of the land entries. The first were
                    prominent men of affairs in their neighborhood after it became more thickly settled. The second may
                    or may not have been the first settler. In most all cases, however, the squatter preceded the
                    so-called "first settlers." These facts must be borne in mind in reading the
                    accounts of these "first settlers."</p>

                                of the present site of Boonville.</p>
                            <p>Colonel Boon through his unusual tact and sagacity made himself one of the most prominent
                                men in Indiana during the early days. He had force of character and had a way of making
                                loyal friends. In 1812 he was commissioned lieutenant in the Fourth Indiana regiment.

                                1820. On the admission of Indiana into the union in 1816, Boon was elected to the State

                                resigned on January 30, 1824 to become a candidate for Congress. He was elected on the
                                Jackson Democratic ticket. He was defeated by Col. Thomas H. Blake for representative,
                                in the 20th congress. However, he was a member of the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 24th and 25th

                    <p>In the fall of 1807, when the deer were at their best and the bears fat upon the mast, Major
                        Sprinkle and his two kinsmen, cousins from <placeName>

                        </placeName>, went a little way back from the river and made a camp, intending to have a
                        week's hunting. They had been hunting two or three days when the boys had an
                        experience, the marks of which they carried to the end of their lives. They had been following a
                        drove of deer for some time, when they came upon an old bear and two cubs eating acorns under a
                        white oak tree. One of the boys shot one of the small bears, knocking it down. The old mother
                        and the other little one ran off. It seemed that the little bear was only stunned and was not
                        fatally injured and was soon up, staggering around. The young men ran up to it, intending to
                        finish it with their hunting knives. They laid down their guns, but had not quite reached the
                        place where the young bear was, until the old mother came at them savagely.</p>
                    <p>They attempted to get their guns, but before they succeeded the old bear knocked one of them
                        down. The other got his gun, but it was empty, and rushing at the bear that was fighting his
                        brother he struck it over the head with the barrel of the gun. The bear knocked the gun out of
                        his hands with such force that it broke his arm. The other brother, though badly wounded, got
                        his gun and attempted to shoot the bear in the head as it was biting his brother, but his aim
                        was so bad that he only slightly wounded it, and then the bear turned upon him and knocked him
                        down, biting his legs in a fearful manner. The boy with the broken arm stabbed the bear many
                        times with his hunting knife and finally hurt it fatally. It started, however, to follow the
                        cubs, but had gone only a few yards when it laid down and died. The young men were found by the
                        Major and taken to camp and then to his cabin, where they were for several months before they
                        were able to be out. This experience satisfied their roving dispositions and they returned to

            <quote rend="blockquote">
                    <p>There was a young girl who lived with one of these families at the Sprinkles settlement who was
                        expecting a sister from central <placeName>

                        Late one evening, just before dusk, a whining, piteous cry was heard, which did not seem like
                        the scream of a panther, as it was continuous. This girl heard the noise and declared it was the
                        cry of her sister, and nothing could stop her from going out to it. Before the men in the fort
                        realized her intentions, she was running in the direction of the noise. Three of the men got
                        their rifles and hurried after her. They were uncertain what it was, thinking it might be the
                        ruse of the Indians trying to imitate the cry of a woman or child to draw some of the people
                        into an ambush. The men had gone nearly a quarter of a mile when they heard the most terrible
                        scream of the panther mingled with the outcry of the unfortunate girl. Hurrying as fast as they
                        could, when they located the scream, they were very cautious in their advance. Coming to an open
                        space they saw several animals which were biting and scratching the body of the girl they had
                        killed. The men killed the old panther and two of the young ones that she, no doubt, was
                        teaching to scream, which was the cause of the peculiar noise which they had heard. After she
                        had killed the girl she was teaching the young ones how to attack their prey, and she would
                        bound onto the prostrate form and bite and scratch it. The kittens would go through the same
                        motions and thus had torn her into pieces.<hi rend="sup">39</hi>

                    it. Meat was placed in a meat trough made of a poplar tree and salted. After the meat had taken all

                    again. On account of the danger from Indian attacks, the early settlers from this region of the

                    for the year. The salt was sacked and brought home on horseback.<hi rend="sup">60</hi>

                            deep that there is danger of the earth falling in, the trunk is put down and sunk to the
                            surface of the rock. After the influx of fresh water is prevented by calkins around the
                            edges at the bottom of the trunk, the perforation is made. And the salt water immediately
                            rises to the surface.<hi rend="sup">62</hi>

            <p>Some years later, in 1814, a party of men undertook to establish a salt well on Cypress creek, in <placeName>

                    river</geogName> at a deer lick. After boring to a considerable depth without any satisfactory
                    results the men engaged in the work became discouraged and abandoned the enterprise.<hi rend="sup">63</hi> Another attempt was made on Pigeon creek. For a number of years, it was thought that
                    salt water could be obtained on this stream. Two enterprising citizens of the county put down a well
                    528 feet deep and obtained a tolerable supply of salt water from which they made from twenty-five to
                    thirty bushels of salt a day.<hi rend="sup">64</hi> Not being satisfied, they bored deeper and hit
                    mineral water which ruined the well.<hi rend="sup">65</hi>

                                            anything about what an Indian will do when he has the advantage. They are
                                            the most treacherous, cunning rascals on earth and the most brutal as well.
                                            The only safe way is to keep the advantage on our side and put the Indians
                                            on the defense. When they know that your position makes one white man equal
                                            to ten Indians there is no danger of an attack."</p>

            <p>A little later in the year (1807) the people began to fear another attack from the Indians. In
                    October of that year, Maj. John Sprinkle informed the governor that detached bands of Indians had
                    been passing for eight or ten days and appeared to be carrying their luggage with them. Some of
                    these Indians made their camp not far from Bailey Anderson's cabin. The gathering of the

                    Anderson and two other men, were sent to visit the chief, whose name was Setteedown.<hi rend="sup">84</hi> Chief Setteedown assured these men that the tribes were only paying a peaceful visit,
                    that the reason for their coming was the abundance of game; and that they would go back to their
                    country by the 26th of November. True to their word, the Kickapoos, the visiting Indians from <placeName>

                    one of his race, was wealthy, having a large drove of horses and cattle. Their village, already
                    referred to, was situated near the mouth of Cypress creek, on the north bank of the <geogName>Ohio
                        river</geogName>. The west end of this town was near the Newcom coal mines and scattered over a

                        with the Indians along the frontier. Governor Harrison was able to secure a peace with some of
                        the Indians in 1809, but Tecumseh and his followers were loud In their declarations against it
                        and tried to prevent its being carried into effect. During this period the Indians made numerous
                        raids along the frontier, crossing over into the white settlements in many places, killing the
                        settlers or running off the stock. The times became so troublesome that many left the country. <placeName>

            <p>Preceding the outbreak of the War of 1812, the Indians made numbers of raids along the border. The
                    unsettled condition of the Indians probably had something to do with one of these murders committed
                    in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warrick county</region>
                    </placeName>, the details of which follow:</p>
            <p>Probably as early as 1810, the Meeks family settled on Little Pigeon creek, in the northern part of
                    Luce township, <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Spencer county</region>
                    </placeName>. There Atha Meeks and his son William built log houses. In the cabin of the elder Meeks
                    were his two grown daughters and his son, Atha, Jr. William Meeks, another one of his sons, who had
                    a wife and one small child lived near by. It seems that by the spring of 1812 only a few straggling
                    bands of Indians remained in the neighborhood.<hi rend="sup">89</hi> Most of them had probably gone
                    north under the direction of Tecumseh to prepare for a general raid along the frontier. However
                    Chief Setteedown and his followers were still living in the county. What led the Indians to make an
                    attack on the Meeks family can only be conjectured. It might have been, as some claim, that a family
                    living near Darlington who had a grudge against the Meeks family, persuaded Setteedown that Meeks
                    had been stealing his traps.<hi rend="sup">90</hi> It was doubtless partly done at the instigation
                    of Tecumseh, who had planned to make a concerted attack along the entire frontier,<hi rend="sup">91</hi> and in this manner so to divide the attention of the settlers as to prevent the militia
                    from going to the protection of any other part of the State.<hi rend="sup">92</hi> So
                    Setteedown's warriors before departing to the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Wabash country</settlement>
                    </placeName> to put on war paint and feathers, decided to massacre the nearest white settlers,
                    toward whom they had a grudge. Thus early on the morning of April 14, 1812, an attack was made on
                    the Meeks family. Some say that the murder was done by Setteedown, his son and an Indian called
                    "Big Bones"<hi rend="sup">93</hi> while others lay the deed to a band <list type="footnotes">

            <p>While the Indians were on their way to the Meeks cabin to make the attack they met Atha Meeks, Jr.,
                    the strong, athletic son of senior Atha on his way to a nearby spring to get some water with which
                    to prepare breakfast. Some say that he was fired at by two of the Indians and slightly wounded in
                    the knee and wrist. Others make no mention of this. Nevertheless two of the Indians attacked him
                    with tomahawks but he fought so desperately that he partly succeeded in warding off with his arms
                    the blows aimed at his head. It is probable that the two Indians had already emptied their guns or
                    they would have made quick work of him. In the meantime Atha, Sr., had been aroused by the noise and
                    had appeared at the door where he was shot through the brain killing him instantly. The Indian
                    rushed forward to scalp the dead man, but Mrs. Meeks succeeded in getting her husband's
                    body in the house and barring the door before the Indian reached it. Tradition says that she
                    received a severe wound in the ankle from a tomahawk, thrown by the Indian.<hi rend="sup">96</hi>
                    William Meeks was aroused by the report of the gun and came to the rescue of his mother. One of the
                    Indians was fatally wounded. The two who were trying to kill Atha, Jr., escaped before William had
                    time to reload his rifle.<hi rend="sup">97</hi>

            <p>It was probably about noon before the party of men was ready to start. Although the Indians had six
                    or eight hours the lead they were encumbered with their baggage and families. Traditional stories
                    vary a great deal as to the outcome of this expedition. Some say that only Setteedown and his family
                    were fleeing to the northward and that they were captured. Others say that Setteedown was
                    accompanied by a band of warriors few of whom ever lived to cross the river.<hi rend="sup">100</hi>
                    Yet another account says that the posse went only to the Indian camp where they hid themselves to
                    watch for the return of any of the Indians. At least the stories agreed that one Indian was taken
                    captive. As to who this captive was, there is a difference of opinion. Some say that it was Chief
                    Setteedown while others say that it was an Indian who had been hunting for two or three days and at
                    nightfall came to the camp where he was taken.</p>
            <p>The captive was placed in a log cabin, probably Uriah Lamar's house, near <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Grandview</settlement>
                    </placeName>, where he was to await preliminary trial. While waiting for trial the Indian was
                    killed. Whether he was shot by William Meek, while the guards were away to get a drink, or shot by
                    Thomas Ewing or bled to death by Bailey Anderson stories vary. At least the Indian was killed.<hi rend="sup">101</hi> It is said that for months after the hasty retreat of the Indians, horses
                    and cattle were found around Setteedowns' home. These were gathered up and thirty-five
                    turned over to the widow of Atha Meeks.<hi rend="sup">102</hi>

                    transaction of the necessary county business. Then the county commissioners ordered a new brick
                    building thirty-five feet square to be erected, which, however, was never built. A frame building

                        thus remained until 1836. While it was capable of holding more people than the log cabin it
                        could hardly be used even during the summer months.<hi rend="sup">17</hi>

                    </placeName> had become fairly well established along the lines that she was to make her future
                    development. Within her limits were already formed four townships—<placeName>

                    brought into closer touch with the outside world. Although Warrick for the next two decades was

            <p>The sudden origin and rapid growth of the People's party was a most striking political
                    phenomenon of the period from 1890 to 1896. Beyond a doubt it was the most important third party in
                    the history of American politics up to that time. In 1892 and 1894 the party attained a strength
                    which practically gave it the balance of power. For this reason politicians regarded it with respect
                    and secretly courted it, though publicly as a matter of political policy they affected to hold it in
                    derision. Many of the People's party's demands have since been enacted into law.
                    This fact more than any other testifies to the sincerity and significance of the movement.</p>
            <p>The chief cause of the sudden appearance of the People's or Populist party in 1890 and 1891,
                    was the economic conditions of the time. From 1873 to 1893, roughly speaking, the country was in the
                    throes of an industrial crisis.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> It was a period marked by falling prices and
                    consequent wide-spread discontent, particularly among the agricultural and laboring classes. These
                    classes constituted to a large extent the debtor element upon whom the burden caused by the
                    declining prices fell most heavily. It is obvious that a debt contracted by a producer when prices
                    are high will have practically increased in amount if paid off when prices are low. A
                    $1,000 debt contracted in $1.10 wheat is equal to $1,290 when paid
                    in 85c wheat, provided the cost of producing the wheat remains the same. The average price of wheat
                    during the five years ending in 1883 was $1.11 a bushel; the average price in the next
                    five years was 81c. In 1885 it was lower in the <placeName>

                    several years, but on the other hand there were times, during the darkest days of 1893 and 1894,
                    when 40c wheat was not uncommon. Under such conditions it was small wonder that thousands became
                    restless and wished for a change.</p>
            <p>Naturally the classes affected were not at a loss in fixing to their own satisfaction the cause of
                    their distress. They felt that the main reason for the prevailing low prices was the scarcity of
                    money. According to the quantitative theory of money, the precious metals are commodities just as
                    meat or cotton or corn, and are governed by the same law of supply and demand. Increase the amount
                    of the commodity and it becomes cheaper, that is, cheaper in comparison with other commodities.
                    Since the value of these goods is measured in terms of money, prices rise. On the other hand, let
                    the amount of money in circulation be curtailed, the supply lessened, and money becomes dearer, that
                    is, a given amount of any commodity will not exchange for as much money as before and the prices
                    fall. Holding to this quantitative theory, thinking people saw in the insufficient supply of money
                    the one great cause of the hard times. It was generally believed that lack of money was the
                    deliberate act of self-seeking men who had cornered the money market in order to enhance the value
                    of the precious metals for their own profit. The act of 1873 <list type="footnotes">

                    increase in the money supply was prevented, was dubbed the "crime of
                    ‘73" and pointed to as clear evidence of this deep-laid plot. Herein lies the
                    necessary relation between the economic phase of the matter and the political. The remedy for the
                    bad state of affairs into which the country had fallen was to be found in the restoration of silver
                    to an equality with gold through free coinage and the issuance of paper money direct from the
                    government.</p>
            <p>Many persons also found fault with the way in which the government issued money to the people. By the
                    constitution, "Congress shall have the power to coin money and regulate the value
                    thereof". It was charged that although the government coined the money it turned it over to
                    individuals and corporations to trade in. Both old parties, it was said, had deserted the wise
                    doctrine of finance that money should be issued by the people themselves through their agent, the
                    government. Instead they had turned over the business of issuing money and controlling its volume to
                    a few persons who used their power in their own interest. This was the essence of the
                    farmers' quarrel with the national banks.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The farmer objected to the
                    banks because they appeared to him a money monopoly fostered by the government. He would have them
                    abolished as banks of issue and the money issued directly by the government. The whole national
                    banking system was unjust and an unnecessary tax on the people. For one thing, the banks received
                    double interest,—interest on their bank notes when loaned to the people, and interest on
                    the bonds securing their circulation.</p>
            <p>Upon the question of interest a great many thinking people held well defined convictions. Interest
                    was looked upon as a destroyer. It was pointed out that money loaned for a number of years at
                    compound interest amounted to more than the profits of ordinary industry in the same length of time.
                    That is, interest charges accumulate faster than the savings of labor. The reason, of course, was
                    that interest rates were <list type="footnotes">

                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Another grievance lay in the fact that by the law of 1864

               </list>
                    <pb n="335" id="VAA4025-014-4-049"/> too high. The obvious remedy, therefore, was a decrease in the
                    legal rate. The profits arising through the lending of money, it was contended, should not exceed
                    the profits arising through the expenditure of labor. For instance, if a net profit of 2 per cent is
                    the maximum yielded by farming, that industry cannot afford to pay a higher rate of interest than 2
                    per cent.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Again, it was pointed out that the price of any commodity other than
                    money is constantly changing, unaffected by any arbitrary law. The question then was asked, why are
                    interest rates alone fixed always making necessary the payment by the borrower of the top price?</p>
            <p>One great cause of existing evils in society then, it was felt, was the power of money, a power which
                    could be neutralized by increasing the supply of money, taking from it its interest-bearing function
                    to the extent of bringing its value as a profit-bearing investment to the same level with land and
                    labor. The annual net profit on labor and labor's productions was about 3 per cent.
                    Interest on money should be no higher than that.</p>
            <p>Besides the financial errors there were other evils pointed out as the cause of the people's
                    distress. It was believed that the operations of speculators were responsible to a certain extent
                    for the low prices of farm products. A bill to prevent such alleged speculation, known as the
                    Butterworth Bill, was introduced into congress, but never enacted into law. Not only food
                    speculators but land speculators also were an anathema in the eyes of the farmers. In fact the
                    prevention of speculation in land was the main object of the Farmers' Alliance organized in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>
                    </placeName> in 1875. Alien ownership was especially frowned upon. Another grievance in this
                    connection was the great land monopoly built up by the railroads throughout the south and west by
                    governmental grants.</p>
            <p>Since the discontented elements believed that reform was needed because the functions of government
                    had been taken wanted to see those functions brought more under public control. They believed in
                    greater power for the people, especially in the regulation of these industries partaking of the
                    nature of natural monopolies. From this attitude arose their <list type="footnotes">

                    the telegraph, telephone, and railroad companies. In regard to the railroads, it was felt that the
                    only way for the people to avoid the high rates charged by the railroads due to their
                    over-capitalization was to own and operate them themselves. To the same attitude may also be traced
                    the advocacy in the latter history of the radical movement of the Initiative and Referendum.</p>
            <p>Add to the above mentioned factors the beliefs held by many persons that the two old parties had been
                    insincere in professing friendship for free coinage and poor people in general; that the rich were
                    largely exempt from their share of taxation; that the administration of the government was corrupt
                    and extravagant; and one may form an idea of the elements going to make up the People's
                    party.</p>
            <p>The demands of the Populists, particularly in the early stages of the movement, may be summarized
                    under the three heads of land, transportation, and money.</p>

            <p>The way had been prepared for the People's party by various social and quasi-political
                    organizations among the farmers and laborers dating back as far as 1867. This remarkable activity
                    among the two great laboring classes was a distinguishing characteristic of the two decades and a
                    half beginning with 1870. It was what sociologists would call the awakening of class consciousness.
                    The farmers suddenly realized that they had common aims and purposes, and that through organization
                    they possessed a great amount of power. This feeling found expression in the formation of various
                    Granges, Farmers' Alliances, Industrial Unions, Benefit Associations, Agricultural Wheels,
                    etc., in most of the States of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Union</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Such associations did not always justify the hopes of their founders and in most cases
                    their political influence was negligible. Yet one or two of them came to exercise a decided
                    influence on the course of events. Originally their aims were of two kinds, social and educational,
                    though many of them were perverted from the original purposes.</p>
            <pb n="337" id="VAA4025-014-4-051"/>
            <p>The Patrons of Husbandry, known also as the Grange, was the earliest of these associations. Organized
                    in 1867 at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Washington, D. C.</settlement>
                    </placeName>, it was a secret organization, women were admitted on an equality with men, and it was
                    begun primarily for social purposes. Its scope broadened, however, until many of its demands were
                    enacted into law and were the key to the independent parties of the time. It attacked the growing
                    power of the railroads; with their over-capitalization, and exorbitant rates, and its ideas
                    succeeded so well that it has been called "the mother of the Granger legislation."
                    The two principles of this legislation are that transportation belongs to the people, and that
                    congress has the power to regulate it.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next in point of importance, perhaps, was the Farmers' Alliance, organized in <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="txu">Texas</region>

                    aim. After absorbing the Farmers' Union of <placeName>

                        <country reg="aru">Arkansas</country>
                    </placeName> it finally became split into two parts, The "Southern" Alliance, and
                    what became known as the "Northern" or National Farmers' Alliance. The
                    latter originated in <placeName>

                    participate in politics. "Equal rights to all, special privileges to none" was its
                    motto. The official title of the "Southern" Alliance was The National
                    Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                    </placeName> particularly was the Farmers' Mutual Benefit Association, commonly known as
                    the "F. M. B. A.". Its objects were the same as the other bodies mentioned. It was
                    a secret order and admitted only men. Besides these main bodies there were various minor and local

                    increase of the currency to $50 per capita. The convention pledged itself to demand
                    "that the government allow us to borrow money from the <placeName>

                    with either the Republican or the Democratic party and a declaration was made in favor of nominating
                    a national ticket in 1892.</p>
            <p>Thus by 1890 the forces of discontent had acquired considerable headway. Through the efforts of the
                    Farmer's Alliance, assisted by the labor element, a set of principles had been drawn up in
                    a combination new to the political history of the country. The way was cleared for a new party.
                    There remained the task of harmonizing the discordant elements and welding them into one
                    organization. We shall see how this was accomplished in the years 1890 and 1891.</p>

                    of the new party in several of the western and southern States. In the western States a number of
                    wet years had caused the farmers to increase the kind and area of cultivation to such an extent that

                    demands were already the cardinal principles of the Democratic party, while the points which were
                    not found in the Democratic platform were impractical and visionary. Throughout the period of the

                    <pb n="343" id="VAA4025-014-4-057"/> The meeting was called for the ostensible purpose of founding a
                    State league in the interests of agriculturists. It met in the lecture room of the State Board of
                    Agriculture. The call for the meeting was sent out by J. B. Kingsbury, editor of the <hi rend="i">Indiana Farmer.</hi>

            <p>Though the aim of the gathering was ostensibly the formation of a State league, the political phase
                    of the situation was paramount. However, the body assumed an equivocal and uncertain attitude on the
                    question of taking independent political action. The general sentiment seemed to be that if
                    political action were taken at all it should be only local. As long as possible the farmers were to
                    work within the old parties, endeavoring to secure the nomination of men who would carry out their
                    ideas. But as one of the resolutions declared: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>When the old parties fail to nominate men suitable to the farmers, we deem it our duty, and
                            pledge ourselves to nominate such independently, and will strive by all honorable means to
                            secure their election.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>On the other hand we have the words of one of the leaders: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>It is not our purpose to tear down, but to promote our own interest. We therefore let
                            politics alone just so far as we are able. The farmers' interests are local, as a
                            rule, and do not interfere with the general principles of the parties. We are a unit on
                            wanting State and county taxes cut in two, but tariff questions do not bother us. We believe
                            with our parties on that subject.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>A number of resolutions were concurred in by the assembly strongly suggestive of the later pure
                    Populist platforms. Class legislation, monopolies and trusts were denounced. The direct election of <placeName>

                    including the President and Vice-President. Another resolution called for the reduction of fees and
                    salaries. In regard to the money, question a free coinage bill which was being discussed in the
                    Senate was enthusiastically endorsed. It was demanded also that the legal rate of interest be
                    proportionate to the rate earned by capital when invested in agriculture and other productive <list type="footnotes">

                    indebtedness was called for. In regard to local matters the convention concurred in resolutions to
                    the effect that school funds should be appropriated according to the enumeration of pupils, that
                    public printing should be let to the lowest bidder and that the political parties place men on their
                    tickets in sympathy with the farmers' interests, the farmers to give them their support
                    regardless of past political ties. When suitable men are not put on the tickets the farmers to take
                    independent action.</p>
            <p>In addition the following resolutions were reported by the resolutions committee but recommended to
                    be laid on the table: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>That all county and township offices be let to the lowest bidder; that no farmer vote for one
                            who had been a candidate in the old parties; that women stand on the same legal footing with
                            men as executors and in property interests; that county commissioners be restricted in their
                            powers of constructing public buildings by a vote of the people; and that the government
                            should lend its credit to farmers on land at two per cent.</p>
                    </quote>
                </p>
            <p>This latter resolution provoked discussion in which it was finally decided that such a provision
                    would be impracticable since "land sharks would buy up all the rocky and swamp land and
                    palm it off on the government by fraud".<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The liquor question came up when a member of the resolutions committee introduced a plank expressing
                    the views of the Prohibitionists. The Prohibitionist party at this time was third in importance
                    among the parties of the State. Many feared that the introduction of such a resolution would have
                    the effect of identifyng the farmers' movement with the Prohibitionists and thus lead to
                    its downfall. After a lively discussion a harmless compromise resolution was adopted and the affair
                    closed.</p>

            <p>Although only a comparatively short time intervened between the time of their convention and the date
                    of the election, the farmers made a vigorous campaign. The results of the election showed that they
                    had developed unexpected, though still insignificant strength. Martin V. Kindle, the candidate for
                    Secretary of State, polled 17,354 votes and the vote for the other candidates on the ticket ran
                    approximately at that figure. The Prohibitionists, the only other minor party in the field, polled
                    barely twelve thousand.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>Thus the Populist State campaign of 1890 closed. An indication of what reform measures would be
                    expected of the next legislature is given by the resolution adopted at the annual meeting of the
                    State Farmers' Alliance on November 20. On that date the following resolutions were
                    adopted: That State and county officers be paid salaries in proportion to the business transacted
                    and in accordance with salaries paid for similar services in ordinary business; that debtors be
                    allowed exemption from bona-fide indebtedness; that free gravel roads be placed under the control of
                    district supervisors; that teachers take and report to the trustee the enumeration of their
                    respective districts; that the law giving the county commissioners the power to hold special
                    elections for voting aid to railroads and corporations be repealed; that no one living in an
                    incorporated town be eligible to the office of township trustee.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the following day, November 21, a set of resolutions, more general in their scope and more
                    outspoken, was adopted. These resolutions declared in favor of bimetallism and free silver, the
                    abolition of national banks, and the issuance of greenbacks, limited government control of
                    transportation and communication, and the abolition of gambling in food products. They also demanded

            </p>
            <p>How closely allied were the demands of the various farmers' organizations is shown by the
                    manifesto issued at a meeting of the F. M. B. A. at Peru, December 17. It asserted that fees in
                    county offices were exorbitant, that the legal rate of interest was too high, and that foreign
                    corporations were drawing vast incomes from the State without taxation. It demanded that assessors
                    list property at its true cash value; that official fees be reduced 10 per cent; that taxes from
                    toll roads, railroads and pipe lines be divided among the various school districts; that a law be
                    enacted permitting debtors to deduct their bona-fide indebtedness from their assessments; that
                    mortgages not reported to the assessor become null and void in the county where recorded; and that
                    county officials hold office for four years only and be ineligible for re-election.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the year 1890 saw the attempt of the farmers of the State to unite for independent political
                    action, without destroying at the same time the different farmers' organizations. The next
                    four years were to see the gradual growth of the new party until it reached its zenith as an
                    independent force in politics.</p>

                    and the action of the Democratic legislature.</p>
            <p>The year 1891 was one of unusual agricultural productivity. The corn crop of the State was
                    125,092,649 bushels, an increase of 43% over the yield of the previous year, and the
                    largest crop with the exception of that of 1888 in a decade. The yield of wheat was 58,305,796
                    bushels, more than double the amount raised in 1890, and the largest crop since 1881. The production
                    of hay, barley, rye, and oats was normal. The potato crop also was a large one, the largest since
                        1885.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This prosperity naturally checked the reforming zeal of the radicals,
                    though not to any great extent.</p>
            <p>The tax law of 1891 passed by a Democratic legislature, revised and reconstructed the existing
                    methods of taxation in such a way as greatly to increase the burdens of the taxpayer.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> From the point of view of the agriculturists, a weakness of the law was said to consist
                    in the fact that the farmer had to pay a tax upon value represented while the money lender got
                    credit for his indebtedness. In other words, the farmers were taxed upon what they owed while the
                    other classes were not.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> This increase of their taxes undoubtedly strengthened
                    many in the People's party doctrine. It was said by many and hoped by the Republicans that
                    the farmers would be greatly strengthened in their opposition to the Democrats because of the
                    latters' passage of this law doubling assessments instead of a reform fee and salary bill,
                    a particular pet of the Populists.<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                                above mentioned platforms were then summarized: (a) The abolition of national banks as
                                banks of issue, and the issuance by the government of legal tender treasury notes to
                                take the place of bank notes, the treasury notes to be loaned at not more than
                                2% on farm products according to the sub-treasury plan, (b) Free and
                                unlimited coinage of silver. (c) No alien ownership of land, (d) Just and equal
                                taxation, (e) Economical administration of governmental revenues, (f) Imposition of a
                                graduated income tax. (g) Government control of transportation and communication, In
                                case of control proving ineffectual, complete ownership, (h) The election by direct vote
                                of the people of the President, Vice-President, and <placeName>

                            <p>In addition to the above a number of resolutions, not a part of the platform, were
                                presented: That universal suffrage be recommended to the consideration of the States and
                                Territories; that justice be done to ex-soldiers who were paid off in depreciated
                                currency at the end of the war, by the issuance of legal tender treasury notes
                                sufficient to make the pay of old soldiers on a par with coin; that the principle of the
                                eight-hour day apply to all corporations employing labor.</p>
                            <p>In this way, by the naming of a national executive committee and the adoption of a set of
                                resolutions, the People's party was launched into the sea of national
                            politics.</p>

            <p>In November a further step was taken toward harmonizing the various farmer elements into a third
                    party on the occasion of the meeting of the Supreme Council of the Farmers' Alliance at <placeName>

                    the formation of a third party was the real purpose of the meeting.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>The events which took place on November 16 to 20 were varied and complicated. Besides the Alliance
                    council, including the F. M. B. A., the Grange, and other farmers' organizations, two other
                    bodies, whose deliberations were interwoven with those of the Alliance, met at the same time. These
                    two bodies were the executive committee of the People's party and the executive committee
                    of what was known as the Confederated Industrial Union. This latter organization had its origin at
                    the Ocala meeting when the Alliance invited farmer and labor organizations to send delegates to a
                    conference at <placeName>

                    a third party could the objects of the Alliance be achieved. It had tried to get the old parties to
                    take up its ideas and failed. Independent political action was the next logical step. Practically
                    all of the opposition to a third party came from the Southern delegates. In their view the

            <p>In the first place the definite inauguration of a third party backed by various farmers'

                    figure in the farmers' demands in their two State conventions in 1890.</p>
            <p>The sub-treasury plan was one of the most striking and ill-fated of the farmers' demands. It
                    is said to have been originated by C. A. Macune, the editor of the National Economist.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Broadly speaking, it is an extension of the familiar principle of borrowing money on
                    warehouse receipts. The plan provided for the storing of grain in local government warehouses, the
                    produce to be used as security for the loaning of paper money by the government to the farmers at a
                    low rate of interest. One or two per cent, was the usual rate advocated. The money was to be loaned
                    up to 80 per cent, of the market value of the grain.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the plan as set forth by its advocates was to provide a safe, certain, and efficient
                    method of giving a flexibility to the volume of money which would exactly equal the flexibility or
                    variations in demand. That is, it was hoped that the plan if put into operation would secure a
                    uniformity of price on the basis of the high prices prevailing during the summer months. The theory
                    was that as the products of the farm were put on the market, instead of money being absorbed from
                    other channels to move them, the marketings of the crops would be met by an issue of money from the
                    government. In this way the supply of money would always exactly equal the demand, stringencies in
                    the money market would be avoided and prices would be kept uniform.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>A bill embodying the features outlined above was introduced in 1892 in congress. In the report of the
                    committee of Ways and Means a number of arguments were brought forward in opposition to the scheme.
                    It was pointed out that if the market value of the grain after storing fell below eighty per cent,
                    of its original value the government would lose. The number of federal officers would be greatly
                    increased, it was said, and the jurisdiction of the federal courts augmented to the oppression of
                    the people. Also, it was urged, the plan would encourage speculation. Thousands of dollars worth of
                    wheat could be carried at a low rate of interest with a comparatively <list type="footnotes">

                    constitution in that it was class legislation: persons with wheat could get money from the

            <p>In the opinion of many the sub-treasury plan was unsound. In the form in which the idea first took
                    shape no doubt this is true. Yet it aimed to remedy a real weakness in our rural credits
                    system—a weakness recognized and remedied twenty-five years later by the Farm Loan and
                    Credits Act of 1916.</p>
            <p>Another plank in the platform demanded free and unlimited coinage of silver and denounced the efforts
                    of President Harrison in calling an international monetary conference to assist the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in fixing a value for silver. In addition, the increase of the circulating medium to
                    $50 per capita, a graduated income tax, and postal savings banks were demanded.</p>
            <p>In regard to the subject of transportation and communication, government ownership and operation of
                    railroads, the telegraph, and the telephone were advocated. At that time considered among the
                    wildest dreams of the Populists, these demands are now largely favored by public opinion.</p>
            <p>With reference to land the platform declared: <quote rend="blockquote">

            <p>It will be observed that the platform of this convention was silent in regard to the tariff and the

            <p>It was in the course of the ensuing campaign that the members of the People's party began to
                    be called "Populists." As usual in such cases, the term at first applied in
                    derision came to be adopted by the members themselves until the name "Populist
                    party" became official. Since the birth of the party in 1890 it had been consistently
                    called the People's party. The word "Populist" so far as the writer has
                    been able to learn, was unknown up until the summer of 1892. At first the term took the form of
                    "Populite." This, however, whether by the rules of euphony, or for some other
                    reason, never caught the popular fancy and "Populist" came to be the accepted
                    word.</p>
            <p>The State campaign was naturally over-shadowed by the national campaign. In this, as in national
                    politics, free silver was coming to be more and more the dominant issue. Both old parties made
                    strenuous efforts to keep the struggle confined to the old rallying cry of the tariff. Hence in
                    regard to the money question they adopted straddling and evasive platforms.<hi rend="sup">1</hi> The
                    Republicans, entrenched in the sound-money East, were sincerely and strongly opposed to the free
                    silver "populistic" doctrines of the South and West. Among the Democrats,

                    national platform: <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>The conditions which surround us justify our co-operation. We meet in the midst of a Nation
                            brought to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot
                            box, the legislatures, congress and touches even the ermine of the bench. The people are
                            demoralized. … The newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion
                            silenced; business prostrated; our homes covered with mortgages; labor impoverished and the
                            land concentrating in the hands of the capitalists. The urban workmen are denied the right
                            of organization for self-protection; imported pauperized labor beats down their wages; a
                            hireling standing army, unrecognized by our laws, is established to shoot them down, and
                            they are rapidly degenerating into European conditions. The fruits of the toil of millions
                            are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few. … From the same
                            prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two great classes—tramps and
                                millionaires.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                        <p>A number of resolutions were also adopted in addition to the platform proper.</p>

            <p>The preamble continued in the same melancholy vein, reciting the issue of gold-bearing bonds, the
                    demonetization of silver, and the efforts of the two old parties to confine the issues of the
                    campaign to the tariff, as evidence of gross injustice being perpetrated upon the people.</p>
            <p>The choice of the convention, could it have had its way, was the honored jurist, Walter Q.
                        Gresham,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> whose presidential boom was cut short only by his own declination.
                    Lionized by the convention from the start, he was the most available man the People's party
                    had and the one most likely to harmonize the different factions. Colonel L. L. Polk, of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, the national president of the Farmers' Alliance, had recently died. With both
                    Gresham and Polk eliminated the mantle fell upon General James B. Weaver, a veteran Green-backer,
                    who was ultimately the nominee of the convention.</p>
            <p>Members of the Indiana delegation figured most prominently in connection with the efforts put forth
                    to induce Judge Gresham to accept the nomination. In the early part of the proceedings, a caucus was
                    held, consisting of the delegations from Indiana, <placeName>

            <p>The campaign in Indiana was carried on in much the same way as in 1890. Rallies, barbecues, and
                    picnics were the order of the day. The opening shot in the campaign was fired on July 20, at a
                    monster rally at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Vincennes</settlement>

            <p>After the election, November 8, it was found that Leroy Templeton, the head of the ticket, had
                    received 22,000 votes, about 4 per cent, of the total vote cast, and an increase of 10,600 over the
                    vote cast in 1890.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

            <p>After the more or less exciting presidential campaign of 1892, the political pot became calm again.
                    Consequently 1893 brought few new developments in the People's party. The new party had
                    made greater inroads into the Democratic than into the Republican camp in the elections of 1892, but
                    while the large Democratic majorities in the South were safe against such losses, the narrower
                    Republican margins in the North were in many cases wiped out. An unexpected Democratic victory was
                    the result, perhaps not altogether due to the Populists. At any rate the free silver idea was
                    gaining ground and populistic doctrines were becoming more respectable. The financial panic of 1893,
                    whether or not brought on by the disasters of the <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Cleveland</settlement>
                    </placeName> administration, intensified the economic distress of the time. Low prices continued.
                    These and other conditions of the time continued to provide the Populists with ample ground upon
                    which to base their grievances. Instead of abating, the waves of discontent were rising higher and
                    higher.</p>
            <p>In Indiana at this time harmony prevailed within the party. In January, 1894, at the call of Joshua

                    be increased to $50 per capita. Free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one, to
                    be issued direct to the public was also demanded. Vigorous opposition to banks of issue, either
                    State or national, and to interest bearing bonds was expressed and the Acts of 1873 and 1893,<hi rend="sup">2</hi> were bitterly denounced. These two acts, it was said, had the effect through
                    the setting up of the gold standard of reducing the laborers and producers of this country to the
                    level of pauper labor in the Old World. The old demands of a national graduated income tax and the

                    legislature of 1893, which applied to cities between ten and thirty-five thousand population. By the
                    terms of the law three police commissioners were to be appointed by the governor. These

            <p>Further, a constitutional convention to revise the State constitution<hi rend="sup">2</hi> was
                    demanded, the changes contemplated being reform in the system of taxation, the initiative and
                    referendum and the placing of the veto power of important laws in the hands of the people. The old
                    demand made in the conventions of 1890 and again in 1892, that debtors should not be taxed on their
                    bona-fide indebtedness, was reiterated. Moreover, it was demanded that debtors in paying their debts
                    should pay in gold, silver or any lawful money without any previous discriminatory agreement. This
                    was a blow at the "gold bugs" who it was charged conducted their transactions in
                    gold at the expense of the poor.</p>
            <p>In regard to labor, the Populists were explicit and reasonable. They declared against child labor and
                    convict labor in competition with free workmen. According to their plan, convicts should be put to
                    work building and improving public roads. They favored industrial arbitration, an
                    employer's liability law and the reduction of working hours by legal enactment. They also
                    advocated municipal ownership of public utilities and the construction of public works by the State
                    and by communities.</p>
            <p>General demands were a homestead law, an inheritance tax of five per cent on sums above
                    $2,000 for the benefit of the State sinking fund, more efficiency in the administration
                    of the public school funds, and the conformation of the State naturalization laws to the national
                    laws on that subject.<hi rend="sup">1</hi>

                        minor parties, notably the Prohibitionists, for some time. The agitation has finally resulted in
                        the act for a constitutional convention of September, 1917, the change in the basic law taking
                        the form of a new constitution because of the difficulty of amending the old one.</item>

            <p>There was also a resolution declaring for woman's suffrage and one expressing alarm over the
                    liquor traffic. In doing away with the traffic, the initiative and referendum was urged as the best
                    remedy. As usual, the party was guarded and equivocal in its expressions in regard to prohibition,
                    no doubt through fear of being identified with the Prohibitionists.</p>

            <p>Edward A. Hannegan came into <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, about 1825 and lived for probably one year with a brother-in-law who had
                    erected a grist mill in the northern part of the county. In 1825–6 he worked for the
                    farmers on Shawnee prairie In <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain</region>
                    </placeName> cvounty. In the winter of 1826 he taught school in the northern part of the county and
                    in 1826–7, while teaching school and working by the month for the farmers on Shawnee
                    prairie, he was admitted to the bar in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName> to practice law and at once entered into the practice. A little later, on May 7, 1829,
                    he was admitted to practice law in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Warren county</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, and located at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Williamsport</settlement>
                    </placeName>, but remained there only a few months when he moved to <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>, which had been selected as the county seat of <placeName>

                    </placeName>.</p>
            <p>In the organization of the General Assembly in 1829 he was chosen as enrolling clerk. This was the
                    first public office he held. At this time, 1829, the lawyers followed the judge over his entire
                    circuit and were called circuit riders. Hannegan rode the judicial circuit in which he practiced
                    with Judge John R. Porter as president judge.</p>
            <p>He was elected to the office of prosecuting attorney for the judicial district in 1830. In 1832 he
                    was elected from his congressional district in Indiana to congress as a Democrat, defeating Albert
                    S. White of Lafayette, and served his district in congress until 1840, when he was defeated by Henry
                    S. Lane of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Crawfordsville</settlement>
                    </placeName>. He distinguished himself in congress as an orator, and Webster said of him:
                    "Had Hannegan entered congress before I entered it I fear I never should have been known
                    for my eloquence."</p>
            <p>On August 5, 1838, while yet a member of congress, Hannegan was made a colonel in the State militia
                    and was stationed <pb n="369" id="VAA4025-014-4-083"/> at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Fort Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, on account of trouble with the Indians.</p>
            <p>In 1842 he was elected to succeed O. H. Smith in the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate. At this time the Democratic and Whig parties were almost evenly matched in the
                    general assembly in the State of Indiana; so closely that one or two votes would determine the
                    contest. On the first ballot O. H. Smith, the Whig candidate, received 72 votes and Tilghman A.
                    Howard, the Democratic candidate, received 74 votes. Joseph G. Marshall, a Whig, received one vote.
                    The second ballot the vote stood as follows: O. H. Smith, the Whig, received 73 votes, Tilghman A.
                    Howard, the Democratic candidate, received 74 votes. Neither received enough votes to elect.</p>
            <p>As a criminal lawyer Edward A. Hannegan had won a reputation that extended over the State of Indiana.
                    He was called to <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, to defend a man accused of murder. He cleared the man. The man was very poor
                    and could not pay Hannegan anything for his work, but in the presence of his son he and his son, a
                    boy of about sixteen years of age, pledged themselves that in payment for his attorney fees in this
                    particular case, if the opportunity ever came, to repay him by supporting him for any office he
                    might wish, regardless of politics, they would do so. The man he had cleared soon afterward,
                    sickened and died and dying pleged his son to carry out their promise to Edward A. Hannegan. A few
                    years later the son of the man was stricken with hasty consumption and was nearing the end, but was
                    yet able to ride in a buggy or other conveyance for an hour or more.</p>
            <p>When the election came the Whig candidate for the State senate in that district was Daniel Kelso. The
                    district was very close and Kelso went to the dying man to get him to go to the polls and vote.
                    Kelso was a Whig and the dying man told Kelso that if he would pledge himself to vote for Edward A.
                    Hannegan for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate they could take him to the polls and he would vote for Kelso for the State
                    senate. With this pledge Kelso hauled the dying man to the polls; he voted for Kelso and Kelso was
                    elected by one vote.</p>
            <p>On this second ballot this Daniel Kelso, a Whig, voted for <pb n="370" id="VAA4025-014-4-084"/>
                    Edward A. Hannegan, a Democrat, and continued to vote for him. In the sixth ballot the Democrats
                    dropped Tilghman A. Howard and supported Hannegan who then received 76 votes and was thus elected by
                    one vote to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate in 1843. The Whigs accused Kelso of selling his vote and by public resolution
                    renounced him.</p>
            <p>In the Democratic caucus of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> congress to determine whether or not we would declare war on <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="mx">Mexico</region>
                    </placeName> in 1846, the vote was a tie, Hannegan not voting, and in that caucus Hannegan cast the
                    one vote, the decisive vote in favor of declaring war, and thus the one vote of the dying man in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Switzerland County</region>
                    </placeName>, Indiana, added to the domains of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> of America all of the territory that came to the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> as a result of the Mexican War. And this the politicians use today to show the value of
                    one vote.</p>
            <p>In 1849 Hannegan was defeated by Governor James Whit-comb for the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> senate. On the 29th day of March, 1849, Hannegan was appointed by President Polk as
                    minister to the court of Prussia and the queen of Prussia became so infatuated with this eloquent
                    Hoosier representative that His Majesty the Kaiser grew jealous and when on a state occasion
                    Hannegan broke all rules of courts and etiquette and kissed the hand of the queen, the Kaiser
                    requested that Hannegan be recalled, he having served about two years.</p>
            <p>In the county election in 1851 there were three candidates for representative in the lower house of
                    the legislature from <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Fountain county</region>
                    </placeName>. Hannegan was the Democratic candidate, William Piatt, for whom <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Piatt</region>
                    </placeName> county, <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="ilu">Illinois</region>
                    </placeName>, was named, ran independent and received 80 votes. Hannegan received 997 votes and
                    Jacob Dice, a United Brethren preacher and the Whig candidate, received 1,165 votes and was elected.</p>
            <p>As the politicians gathered in the courthouse yard in the dusk of the autumn evening and the returns
                    came in from the out townships, Hannegan, realizing his defeat, said: "The gloom of this
                    night is the winding sheet of my political career." He immediately entered the race for the
                    nomination for President of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> on the Democratic ticket, had secured pledges of nine States to support him and it
                    looked as though nothing would prevent his being the Democratic nominee for President in the
                    following election.</p>

                        <settlement type="city">Franklin</settlement>
                    </placeName> Pierce was then unknown and Hannegan had been the only man in the <placeName>

                    </placeName> senate from the middle west on the Democratic side of the house who could cope with
                    Daniel Webster in eloquence and debate, and it seemed that his nomination was certain. In the stress
                    of the canvass he drank too much and came home for a little rest and to sober up. He and his wife
                    were living with his wife's brother, Capt. John R. Duncan, at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. Duncan had distinguished himself for bravery and won his title of captain in the
                    Mexican War and was greatly interested in the welfare and political career of his brother-in-law and
                    felt that the drink habit was growing on Hannegan to the point of jeopardizing Hannegan's
                    chances for the nomination and thought it best that Hannegan should know it.</p>
            <p>Hannegan's wife agreed with Duncan, but did not like to talk to Hannegan about it. (Perhaps
                    she had taken him to task for the incident with the queen of Prussia and still had unpleasant
                    memories of the occasion.) At least it was left to the brother-in-law to speak to Hannegan about
                    curbing his habit of drink. A quarrel followed and Mrs. Hannegan took Hannegan by the arm and
                    started upstairs with him. The conversation fired Hannegan to great anger and as his wife started to
                    pull him to the stairway he snatched a dagger from the mantle in the room and drove it to the hilt

                    nominated for congress in 1860 and would have been elected to congress, but while making a speech at
                    Delphi in his congressional race he dropped dead. He was yet a young man, an able editor and an
                    eloquent public speaker.</p>
            <p>Hannegan was never the same man after the tragedy. He abandoned his presidential aspirations and for
                    a few years continued to practice law at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Covington</settlement>
                    </placeName>. His prestige was gone and his drink habit grew on him. He moved to
                            <placeName>
                  <settlement type="city">Saint Louis</settlement>, <region type="state" reg="mou">Missouri</region>
               </placeName>, and opened a law office there (his son had previously
                    located in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saint Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName>), and for two years he prospered and concluded to again enter politics in a new field
                    away from the sad memories of the tragedy that had ended his political career in Indiana.</p>
            <p>In the meantime his wife, who had been very devoted to him, had died and the whiskey habit still
                    remained with him. <pb n="373" id="VAA4025-014-4-087"/> He had also become addicted to the use of
                    morphine but in spite of all these habits he was still an eloquent orator. He could still charm a
                    jury in the court room, and he gathered about him a few over-zealous friends who insisted that he
                    should start a new political career.</p>
            <p>It was planned that in January, 1859, a great meeting should be held in <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Saint Louis</settlement>
                    </placeName> and the principal address was to be made by Hannegan. This was the period preceding the
                    nominations of the Presidential election of 1860. Hannegan's address was planned to advance
                    the interests of Stephen A. Douglas for the Presidency and again to bring the speaker into
                    prominence.</p>
            <p>The meeting was carefully arranged and well advertised. The audience was everything that those who
                    had the meeting in charge could have wished and the promoters were elated at their prospects. But
                    the mills of the gods are relentless. Hannegan had worshipped long at the shrine of Bacchus and
                    again Bacchus claimed his toll. Realizing that upon the success of this speech depended his success
                    or failure in his last effort to gain political prominence, Hannegan resorted to both whiskey and
                    morphine for stimulant. The man who made the introductory speech reviewed the public life of
                    Hannegan at length and talked too long. When at last he presented the distinguished and able speaker
                    the alcohol and opium had passed the stage of stimulant and had reached the stage of stupefaction.
                    Hannegan made an address, but it lacked the brilliancy and power of oratory which his hearers had
                    been led to expect, and not only did it fall flat but was a disappointment to the promoters, to the
                    audience and to Hannegan. Those who had planned the meeting severely upbraided him for his
                    indulgence at such a critical time, but Hannegan realized more keenly than they how completely he
                    had failed. Sad and broken-hearted he left the meeting and went to his room, stung by the criticism
                    of his over-confident friends and depressed by the sense of his own humiliation and was never seen
                    alive after that inauspicious night.</p>
            <p>The next morning his dead body was found in his bed. Upon his retirement on the night of the 24th day
                    of January, 1859, he had taken an overdose of morphine, whether to induce <pb n="374" id="VAA4025-014-4-088"/> sleep and rest from his troubled past or with suicidal intent will
                    never be known.</p>

                                    placed in the park 16 beautiful monuments that bear the record of each of the 28
                                    Indiana organizations engaged in the Vicksburg operations, and 53 massive markers.
                                    The War Department authorized bronze portraits of 9 Indiana officers (Alexander,

                    interesting and valuable. The journal is plain though a little more editorial explanation here and

                    Commission, 1917, pp. 152, $1.00.)</head>
            <p>This is a plain account of the public career of Zach. Chandler, the noted Republican political leader
                    of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName>, from his election as mayor of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement>
                    </placeName> in 1851 to his sudden death while a senator of the <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> in 1879. These years marked stirring times, during which Chandler was engaged in much
                    party activity and in many political controversies. Dr. Harris in his brief monographic sketch is
                    able to touch only lightly on varied subjects of much historical importance. The monograph <pb n="383" id="VAA4025-014-4-097"/> is intended to supplement, not to supersede, the Post and
                    Tribune Life of Chandler, which was written from partial and friendly motives. Dr. Harris writes
                    without bias or partizanship and is far from being a eulogist. He merely sets forth, with very
                    little of either commendation or disapproval, the party record of Chandler and his position on
                    public policies. We see Chandler as an early Whig candidate for governor of <placeName>
                        <region type="state" reg="miu">Michigan</region>
                    </placeName> in 1852; as one of the founders of the Republican party in 1854, as the successor of
                    Lewis Cass in the Senate in 1857; as a Radical Republican in that body during the Civil War and
                    Reconstruction times, till his defeat for re-election in 1875; as Secretary of the Interior for a
                    time under President Grant; as chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1876; and again as <placeName>
                        <country reg="-us">United States</country>
                    </placeName> Senator to fill an unexpired term.</p>
            <p>The author finds in Chandler a "typical product of his time," a
                    "fire-eater of the Northwest," and an "exponent of practical spoils
                    politics," one who was a political manager of great strength, who never hesitated to build
                    and use a party machine in order to promote his own political ambition and to keep himself in power.
                    The kind of radical that Chandler was before the Civil War is shown by his being ever ready to meet
                    southern threats of disunion with counter-threats of hanging rebels, and by his proposal to his
                    Republican colleagues to stand up in the face of Southern insults with bold challenges to
                    fight—"to carry the quarrel into a coffin." He knew no compromise. If
                    the right of secession were to be conceded, or if the South had to be "let alone"
                    to break up the Union, he wished to know it. Then Chandler would resign his seat in the Senate,
                    arrange his business affairs, and prepare to migrate, as he proposed never to live in a country
                    whose government "had no power to enforce its own laws." He preferred to join the
                    Comanche Indians. His famous letter about "stiff-backed men" and a little
                    "blood-letting" as a cement to the Union finds its due recognition in the essay.</p>
            <p>One is disappointed to find that only a very few lines are given to Mr. Chandler's
                    connection with the campaign and disputed election of 1876, when the cause of "a civil
                    service reform candidate was managed by a dyed-in-the-wool spoilsman." <pb n="384" id="VAA4025-014-4-098"/> Chandler's telegram is given, announcing Hays'
                    election with 185 electoral votes, but nothing is told of what Chandler did in the winter of
                    1876–1877 to make that famous telegram good. It is so with many other subjects of
                    importance; everything is brief, sometimes to the point of leaving one quite unsatisfied. However,
                    such defects are incident to the nature of the task. The volume, on the whole, is a credit to the
                    author and it is one of distinct value to the student of American politics. It contains a good deal
                    of <placeName>

                    </placeName>, has recently presented the library with a valuable collection of books and pamphlets
                    relating to these Indians. Recent interest in this tribe of Indians is largely due to the efforts of
                    the late Daniel McDonald, of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>
                    </placeName>. As a member of the house of representatives in 1905, he secured an appropriation for a
                    monument to the Pottawattomies at <geogName>Twin Lakes</geogName> in <placeName>
                        <region type="county">Marshall county</region>
                    </placeName>. It will be recalled from history that here is where the tribe was assembled

                        <country reg="ksu">Kansas</country>
                    </placeName> in August, 1838. The address of Mr. McDonald in support of the bill for erecting the
                    monument is included in this collection. This address and another delivered by the same author at
                    the unveiling of the monument, September 4, 1909 (also included in the collection), deal with the
                    history of the tribe. Previous to this, Mr. McDonald, who was an editor at <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">Plymouth</settlement>

            <p>In addition to these, Miss Emerson included a volume entitled <hi rend="i">Queen of the Woods</hi>,
                    by Leopold Pokagon, last chief of the band which bears his name. Pokagon was born at Pokagon
                    village, a few miles north of <placeName>
                        <settlement type="city">South Bend</settlement>

                                    with Mr. William Gorham Rice of <placeName>

                        <p>It is my hope that Mr. Rice, aided by such material and by his own already existing

                                    biography. The collection thus deposited will also be of permanent value because of
                                    its accessibility to anyone who in the future may desire to obtain for historical or

                    movement is altogether commendable. The volume is well edited, well printed, on good paper and
                    substantially bound. Such a volume can scarcely be reviewed. It is a political encyclopedia of the
                    State and is without doubt the most valuable State publication so far issued by the State.</p>

            <p>The field covered by Dr. Lonn's book is one of great difficulty. The partisan bitterness
                    aroused by the struggle is still in the atmosphere. The documents on which the history must rest are
                    all full of partisanship. The author has rightly preserved in her story enough of the contemporary
                    expression to <pb n="387" id="VAA4025-014-4-101"/> give the reader a sense of this characteristic
                    period. The story is told with commendable reserve and impartiality. There is ample evidence that
                    the sources have been used liberally. There has been a tendency in the last decade by writers on
                    Reconstruction to condemn without reserve the carpet-bag government. It seems that the mantle of
                    charity which is used so freely might be used with more impartiality in this regard.</p>
            <p>Sweeping generalizations in history are easily made. Except mere physical description they constitute
                    the cheapest filler for the historian and likewise cause the most trouble. From this moralizing Dr.
                    Lonn has wisely refrained. Barring a few typographical errors and lapses of the pen, the volume
                    contains little for adverse criticism. On the other hand, the author is entitled to great praise for
                    a patient investigation of a difficult subject. Dr. Lonn is a native of Indiana, her home being at
                    Laporte.</p>
