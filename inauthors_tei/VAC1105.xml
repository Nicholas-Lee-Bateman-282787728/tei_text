        <head rend="center">PREFACE</head>
        <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> retelling these tales from Shakespeare, the author's purpose is to
          introduce Shakespeare to the young, and to such of their elders as find the intricacies of
          the plots of the dramas somewhat difficult to untangle. For, although in naming the best
          books of the world, Shakespeare is usually mentioned after the Bible, comparatively few of
          the great reading public are familiarly acquainted with Shakespeare's plays.</p>
        <p>The stories that constitute the main plots are given, and these are interspersed with the
          dramatic dialogue in such a manner as to make tale and verse interpret each other.</p>
        <p>The author has endeavored to tell the stories from Shakespeare's point of view; to
          interpret sympathetically and truthfully the motives of the dramas and of the characters;
          to omit unessential details; and to select for quoting passages that are notable for
          strength and beauty, and those that have especial significance in revealing character.</p>
        <pb id="VAC1105-008" n="viii"/>
        <p>It is hoped that this work may serve to attract readers of this generation to
          Shakespeare, as Lamb's charming "Tales" have done for so many years.</p>
        <p>The author gratefully acknowledges her indebtedness to Professor Fred N. Scott, of the
          University of Michigan, for encouragement in the prosecution of this work.</p>
        <p>For the most part, Rolfe's text has been followed in the passages quoted. The spelling of
          the past tense and the past participle of verbs ending in <hi rend="i">ed</hi> has been
          made to conform to modern pronunciation. The spelling of such words as <hi rend="i"
            >honor</hi> accords with the custom in America.</p>
        <p>The meaning of obsolete and unusual words is given in footnotes at the bottom of the
          pages on which they occur. Classical, and other literary allusions, are explained in notes
          at the end of the volume.</p>

          <p>M<hi rend="sc">ANY</hi> years ago &mdash; so long ago that no one knows how many
            &mdash; a certain king of Naples, Alonso by name, was returning to his own country,
            after having attended the marriage festivities of his daughter, who had been wedded to
            the king of Tunis. As the fleet was crossing the great sea, it encountered a violent
            storm, and the vessel that carried the king and his courtiers was wrecked upon the
            shores of an island. In the confusion, the king's son, Ferdinand, became separated from
            his father and friends, who were greatly distressed at his loss, believing that he had
            been drowned.</p>
          <p>The truth was, however, that the storm was the work of a magician, Prospero, the lord
            of the island. Prospero had raised the tempest for his own purposes, and he had charged
            his servant, Ariel, a dainty sprite who delighted to do his master's bidding,
            &mdash;</p>

            task was performed, Ariel reported to Prospero, who asked him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Miranda, the beautiful daughter of Prospero, standing before her father's rock-cell,
            their only home, and watching the vessel as it was driven before the tempest, had
            suffered with those that she saw suffer, and had begged her father, if by his art he had
            "put the wild waters in this roar, to allay them." Prospero quieted her fears by the
            assurance that he had so ordered it that no harm had come to any of the inmates of the
            wrecked vessel.</p>
          <p>Ever since she could remember, Miranda had lived alone with her father, who had been
            her companion and teacher; for, in all these years, she had seen no other <note

            father's history.</p>
          <p>Now, however, Prospero told her that the time had come for her to hear what had caused
            them to live this lonely life so long. Bidding her be attentive, he asked
            her:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Prospero then told his daughter that he had always been fond of study. So devoted to
            his books was he that he had found it an annoyance to give attention to the affairs of
            his dukedom. So he persuaded his brother, Antonio, to manage the government in his
            stead. Antonio took advantage of his student-brother's neglect to gain the rule of Milan
            for himself. By pledging himself to pay an annual tribute to the king of Naples, and to
            acknowledge him as a superior lord, Antonio induced Naples to assist him to seize the
            throne of Milan, saying that his library was dukedom enough for Prospero.</p>

          <p>We shall not wonder that Miranda could not resist this drowsiness, when we know that it
            was due to a touch from the magic wand of Prospero, who willed that she should not
            overhear what passed between himself and Ariel. This bright little spirit longed to be
            free, and Prospero promised to release him in two days' time, if he would perform
            perfectly every command that his master should lay upon him.</p>
          <p>First, he was to make himself a nymph of the sea, but he was to be invisible to every
            eye but that of Prospero. While in this form, he went to seek Prince Ferdinand, whom he
            had left sitting upon a bank, weeping for the loss of his father, the king of Naples. In
            order to arouse him from his sad thoughts, Ariel sang a sweetly plaintive

          <p>Never having seen any man except her father, Miranda supposed that all men were
            gray-haired like the aged Prospero. When Ferdinand, who, by this time, had come to
            believe the island enchanted, saw the fair Miranda, he thought that she must be the
            presiding goddess of the place. Still, so attracted was he to her, that he ventured to
            hope that she was human like himself. When Miranda replied in his own language, telling
              <note id="note_007"><ref target="ref_007" rend="super">1</ref>fine.</note><pb
              id="VAC1105-021" n="11"/>him that she was only a simple maid, his astonishment knew no
            bounds, and he immediately told her that, if he could win her love, he would make her
            queen of Naples.</p>
          <p>Now this was just what Prospero desired, but fearing that "too light winning would make
            the prize seem light" to Ferdinand, he pretended to suspect that Ferdinand intended to
            seize the island from him, and make himself the lord of it. So he spoke very harshly to
            the young man, whereat the gentle Miranda plead with her father, saying that she was
            sure that "nothing ill could dwell in such a temple," and promising to be surety for her
            lover's truth.</p>
          <p>Ferdinand, angered by the threatening words of Prospero, drew his sword, but Prospero,
            waving his magic wand, charmed his uplifted hand, and compelled him to obey his will.
            The bewildered Ferdinand declared:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.</l>
              <l>My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,</l>
              <l>The wrack of all my friends, nor this man's threats</l>
              <l>To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,</l>
              <l>Might I but through my prison once a day</l>
              <l>Behold this maid. All corners else o' th' earth</l>
              <l>Let liberty make use of; space enough</l>
              <l>Have I in such a prison.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In order to test Ferdinand's sincerity, Prospero commanded him to pile up some
            thousands of logs of wood. Although the prince felt the harsh treatment keenly, yet he

          <p>Miranda wept at seeing him so heavily tasked, and begged him to rest while she carried
            some of the logs to the pile for him. But Ferdinand protested:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Prospero, who had been watching the lovers, but unseen by them, was delighted at the
            turn affairs were taking, saying to himself, "my rejoicing at nothing can be more." He
            now revealed himself, and said to Ferdinand:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Then, telling them that he had business that demanded his attention, Prospero bade them
            enjoy each other's society until his return. This command they were rejoiced to
            obey.</p>
          <p>Besides Ariel, the delicate spirit of air, Prospero had still another servant, who was
            of a very different nature. This was a kind of monster, half man, half beast, the
            offspring of Sycorax, a foul witch, who had been the sole possessor of the island before
            Prospero's coming.</p>
          <p>This monster, Caliban, hated Prospero because his low nature could not appreciate the
            efforts which Prospero had made to teach him, and because he resented Prospero's taking
            the island from his mother, Sycorax. So he vented his spite in every possible way;
            cursing his master, who was, in turn, compelled to use harsh measures in order to subdue
            the vile creature to his will. When Caliban complained, Prospero told him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Although raging inwardly, Caliban acknowledges that Prospero's art is such that even
            the god Setebos, whom his witch-mother had worshipped, would be compelled to obey it
            &mdash; much more, he. So he goes to his task of carrying wood. While at this work, he
            encounters two drunken knaves who have escaped from the wrecked vessel. When these men
            discover the misshapen monster, they amuse themselves by giving him liquor from a cask
            which they have found among the ship's wreckage.</p>
          <p>The brutish Caliban takes these drunkards to be gods who have been sent by Setebos, the
            moon-god. So he is ready to worship them; and he hopes, with their help, to revenge
            himself on Prospero. He tells one of them, Stephano by name, that if he will destroy the
            cunning sorcerer who has robbed him, Caliban, of his birthright, he will evermore serve
            Stephano as the lord of the island. Caliban then unfolds his plan:&mdash;</p>

              n="17"/> As they were coming stealthily forward, under the lead of Caliban, Prospero

            master.</p>
          <p>It is time to inquire what fortunes have befallen the king of Naples and his courtiers,
            whom we left bewailing the loss of Ferdinand and of their ship.</p>
          <p>After a vain search through the mazes of the enchanted island, the king had given up
            all hope of ever again seeing his lost son. At one time during their <note id="note_009"

              n="18"/>wanderings, King Alonso and the faithful Gonzalo, he who had succored Prospero
            when he was set adrift, were overcome by sleep. Their companions &mdash; Antonio, the
            usurping brother of Prospero, and Sebastian, Alonso's brother &mdash; plotted together
            to kill the sleepers, that Sebastian might make himself king of Naples, and that
            Antonio, in reward for his part in the conspiracy, might be freed from paying tribute to
            Naples.</p>
          <p>Just as the two plotters had raised their swords to strike, however, Ariel was sent by
            Prospero to save the man who had taken pity on him in his hour of need. He sang in
            Gonzalo's ear:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Starting up suddenly, the king asked of Antonio and Sebastian why they had their swords
            drawn. The false men pretended that they had heard a roaring like the sound of lions,
            and had drawn to defend themselves. Affrighted by the tale, the king and Gonzalo led the
            way to another part of the island. As they started off, Ariel said to
            himself:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>A little later, heart-sick and weary, and fainting with hunger, these men were still
            further tortured by Ariel, <pb id="VAC1105-029" n="19"/>who placed a banquet before
            their longing eyes, and just as they were about to eat, suddenly appeared in the form of
            a harpy &mdash; a loathsome creature, half bird, half woman &mdash; and snatched the
            food from their out-stretched hands.</p>
          <p>By this time, the memory of their past misdeeds began to stir their consciences, and
            now they heard the voice of Ariel telling them of their sins. In stern tones he
            pronounced judgment, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">I and my fellows</l>
              <l>Are ministers of Fate. Remember,&mdash;</l>
              <l>For that's my business to you, &mdash; that you three</l>
              <l>From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</l>
              <l>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</l>
              <l>Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed</l>
              <l>The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have</l>
              <l>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,</l>
              <l>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,</l>
              <l>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me,</l>
              <l>Lingering perdition &mdash; worse than any death</l>
              <l>Can be at once &mdash; shall step by step attend</l>
              <l>You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,&mdash;</l>
              <l>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls</l>
              <l>Upon your heads, &mdash; is nothing but heart's sorrow,</l>
              <l>And a clear life ensuing.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The three guilty men imagine that the very billows, and the winds, and the
            loud-sounding thunder are accusing spirits, denouncing them for the wrong they had done
            to Prospero. In their alarm, they rush about like madmen, followed by the good Gonzalo,
            who fears that, in their desperation, they will do themselves some harm. <pb
              id="VAC1105-030" n="20"/>But this the watchful Ariel prevents. He drives them into a
            grove near the cell of Prospero, and there he holds them until the sixth hour of the
            day, the time appointed by Prospero for his and their release.</p>
          <p>Alonso and Antonio, the usurping brother of Prospero, have now become sincerely
            repentant for the wrong they had done to Prospero, and he, knowing this, commands Ariel
            to bring them into his presence, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</l>
              <l>Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury</l>
              <l>Do I take part. The rarer action is</l>
              <l>In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,</l>
              <l>The sole drift of my purpose doth extend</l>
              <l>Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:</l>
              <l>My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,</l>
              <l>And they shall be themselves.</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Drawn by the subtle power of music which Ariel sounds in the air above them, they are
            led to Prospero, who thus addresses them, as they stand within a charmed
            circle:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly</l>
              <l>Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:</l>

              <l>Thou art pinched for't now, Sebastian.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then turning to Antonio, Prospero continues:&mdash;</p>

              <l rend="ti-2">Flesh and blood,</l>

          <p>These words of forgiveness were scarcely understood by the bewildered men, who did not
            recognize the long-unseen Prospero. He therefore retired into his cell, whence he soon
            emerged again, dressed in the very same garments that he had formerly worn when he was
            Duke of Milan. He then addressed himself to Alonso, saying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>L<hi rend="sc">ONG</hi>, long ago, a band of warlike maidens, called Amazons, lived in
            the far East. They were so fond of war and hunting that they even sometimes battled with
            their neighbors, the Greeks. In one such engagement, Hippolyta, their chief, was
            captured by the famous Grecian hero Theseus, who took her with him on his return to
            Greece, and made her his queen.</p>
          <p>Their wedding festivities lasted many days, and Theseus tried, in every way, to amuse
            his bride, so that she might be happy in her new home. He bade his master of revels
            to&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>telling Hippolyta:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">I wooed thee with my sword,</l>
              <l>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</l>
              <l>But I will wed thee in another key,</l>
              <l>With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>While Theseus was thus planning merry sports, he was interrupted by an aged father, who
            complained that his daughter Hermia refused to marry the man whom he had selected for
            her, and insisted upon choosing a husband for herself. So Egeus, the father, begged <pb
              id="VAC1105-038" n="28"/>Theseus to interfere and compel Hermia to obey his will in
            the matter.</p>
          <p>It may seem strange to you that a father should make such a request of a king; but in
            the olden times kings often chose husbands for the daughters of their subject lords.
            Besides, there was a law in Athens requiring young women either to accept the husbands
            chosen by their fathers, or to remain all their lives unmarried, serving as priestesses
            in the temple of Diana. In case that a girl was so obstinate as to refuse to do either,
            then she must die.</p>
          <p>Theseus told Hermia that he would give her four days to decide, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Upon that day either prepare to die</l>
              <l>For disobedience to your father's will,</l>
              <l>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</l>
              <l>Or on Diana's altar to protest</l>
              <l>For aye austerity and single life.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Hermia and her lover, Lysander, were in despair when they heard this harsh judgment
            pronounced, until Lysander bethought himself that they might elude the severe Athenian
            law by going to the house of his aunt, who resided some miles out of Athens, and there
            be married. To this plan Hermia agreed and they parted, promising to meet on the
            following night in a wood a short distance from the city.</p>
          <p>Now this wood was a favorite haunt of the fairies, and on the very night on which the
            lovers were to meet there, Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of <pb
              id="VAC1105-039" n="29"/>fairyland, with their trains of elves and sprites, were to
            hold a midsummer revel in the enchanted grove.</p>
          <p>Titania and Oberon had quarrelled for a very foolish reason, and their silly quarrel
            had frighted all fairyland, so that, as the mischief-loving fairy Puck said:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l>Now they never meet in grove or green,</l>
              <l>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</l>
              <l>But they do square,<ref id="ref_011" target="note_011" rend="super">1</ref> that
                all their elves for fear</l>
              <l>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>So it happened that on this beautiful midsummer night, Oberon crossly greeted Titania,
            saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>and asked her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>How long within this wood intend you stay?</l>
            </lg>

            <speaker>T<hi rend="sc">ITANIA</hi>.</speaker>
            <lg>
              <l>Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.</l>

              <l>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>So saying, Titania moved proudly away, followed by her fairy train.</p>
          <p>Oberon was determined to be revenged upon his haughty queen, so he called his willing
            little servant, Puck, and told him to go search for a little flower, once milk-white,
            but which had been stained purple by the blood that dropped upon it from a wound made by
            an arrow shot by Cupid, the god of love. This little purple-stained flower we call the
            pansy; but Oberon called it love-in-idleness.</p>

          <p>Said Oberon:&mdash;</p>

          <p>which was Puck's way of saying that a fairy can be here, and there, and everywhere, as
            quick as one can think.</p>
          <p>Puck found the wished-for flower, and speedily returned with it to his jealous master,

          <p>Titania, just as Oberon had thought she would, had sought out her favorite flowery

          <p>The fairies did not once suspect that Oberon would be the one who would harm Titania;

          <p>The mischievous little Puck, in wandering through the wood, came upon some rude,
            clownish fellows who were rehearsing a play which they were planning to give at the
            wedding-feast of Theseus and Hippolyta. Thinking to play a fine joke upon them, Puck
            softly dropped over the hairy pate of one of their number an ass's head, which he had
            found lying upon the ground. His strange transformation so frightened the others that
            they fled in all directions. But the clown, thinking that one of his companions had put
            the ass's head on him, declared that no one should make him afraid, and said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I will not stir from this place, do what they can: I will walk up and down here,
                and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>It happened that he was so near Titania's flowery bank that the sound of his harsh
            voice in singing awaked her, and the charm caused her to fall in love with this foolish
            clown with the ass's head, since he was the first creature that she saw upon waking.
            Strangely <note id="note_014"><ref target="ref_014" rend="super"

            <lg>
              <l>I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:</l>

          </sp>
          <p>The little fairies, always obedient to their queen, bow before the ridiculous clown,
            bidding him "Hail!" and lead him to Titania's woodland bower. There Titania, whose eyes
            have been so blinded by the magic juice of the little purple flower that she loves this
            clown with the ass's head, begs him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>But the clown, who knows that his head is not smooth and sleek, asks the fairies,
            Peaseblossom and Mustardseed, to scratch his rough pate, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>

          </sp>
          <p>Titania desires to have him entertained with fairy music, but he would rather listen to
            the rude sound of the rustic bones to which he is accustomed.</p>
          <p>Says Titania,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The clown replies that he should much enjoy some hay, or a peck of good dry oats, or a
            handful or two of dried peas. In vain Titania tells him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I have a venturesome fairy that shall seek</l>
              <l>The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>He grows sleepy and does not wish to be disturbed, so Titania winds her fairy arms
            about the clownish fellow, and they lose themselves in sleep.</p>
          <p>By this time Oberon has become ashamed of his foolish anger, and repents of the
            ill-natured trick which he has played upon his beautiful queen. So while they are yet
            sleeping, he releases Titania from the charm with which he had bound her eyes,

          <p>The trick that Puck played upon Titania was not the only piece of mischief that he did
            by means of the magic flower. You will remember that the two lovers, Hermia and
            Lysander, had agreed to meet that night in this same wood. They were followed secretly
            by Demetrius, the man whom Hermia's father was determined to force her to marry against
            her wishes; and also by another maiden, named Helena, who was madly in love with
            Demetrius and exceedingly jealous of Hermia.</p>
          <p>Now it happened that, while Puck was away searching for the little purple flower,
            Oberon overheard Helena vainly beseeching Demetrius to bestow his love upon her. So when
            Puck returned, he instructed the merry sprite to squeeze some of the magic juice upon
            the eyes of the disdainful Athenian youth, if he should chance to find him asleep. This
            Oberon did, thinking to make Helena happy. But Puck, by mistake, gave the charm to
            Lysander, who awoke just as Helena was passing, and transferred to her all the love that
            he had felt for Hermia.</p>
          <p>Helena, on her part, disdained the love of Lysander as scornfully as Demetrius had done
            in repulsing her advances to himself. Lysander pursued the fleeing Helena, and Hermia,
            who now awoke, followed them both.</p>
          <p>In their wild chase, all four came within hearing of <pb id="VAC1105-047" n="37"
            />Oberon, who thus discovered Puck's mistake, and sharply rebuked him.</p>

          <p>Oberon, however, is filled with remorse because of the bitter quarrel among the lovers,
            for which he feels himself, in a measure, responsible. So he commands Puck to use his

          <p>So saying, naughty Puck, unseen by the youths and maidens, scatters them in roundabout
            ways, until, one by one, they all sink exhausted on the ground. Then when they are fast
            asleep, he undoes the former mischief by squeezing upon the eyelids of Lysander some of
            the juice of the same flower with which Oberon removed the spell from the eyes of

          <p>Soothed by the magic spell, all four slept so soundly that not even the bright May
            sunshine awakened them. And there they were found still sleeping peacefully upon the
            ground when Theseus and his train came to the wood to find amusement in hunting the
            deer.</p>
          <p>Among the courtiers was Egeus, father of Hermia, whose wrath was enkindled at sight of
            his daughter and Helena asleep in the grove. Theseus, however, fancies that the young
            people have come out to do honor to the May. Their presence reminds him of the command
            laid upon Hermia, and he asks Egeus if this is not the day on which Hermia was to make
            answer as to her choice. Finding that this is the case, he bids the huntsmen blow their
            horns. At the sound, the sleepers start up broad awake, and with all their spite and
            jealousy melted away. Demetrius no longer desires to wed Hermia; but his whole heart is
            now given to Helena, whom he had disliked until the magic juice opened his eyes to her
            loveliness. Lysander, too, cured of his brief passion for Helena, is again Hermia's,
            heart and soul.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-050" n="40"/>
          <p>At the duke's command, Egeus gives his daughter to her chosen one, and Theseus declares
            that Hermia and Lysander, Helena and Demetrius, shall be wedded in the temple, when his
            own marriage rites with Hippolyta are solemnized.</p>
          <p>Thus, amidst the rejoicings of the entire court, the true lovers are made happy, and
            the genial fairies shower blessings upon the newly wedded pairs.</p>

          <head rend="center">ROMEO AND JULIET</head>
          <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> has often happened in the course of the world's history, that
            silly quarrels between members of different families have resulted in arraying whole
            houses against each other. These quarrels, or feuds, are inherited from generation to
            generation, until any chance meeting becomes the signal for open attack.</p>
          <p>Such a deep-seated enmity between the family of the Capulets and that of the Montagues
            had long disturbed the peace of old Verona, and the prince had tried in vain to
            reconcile these enemies. His patience was exhausted when he found, one day, not only
            their servants, but also the heads of the two houses engaged in a street brawl. He
            commanded:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,</l>
              <l>And hear the sentence of your movéd prince.&mdash;</l>
              <l>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</l>
              <l>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</l>
              <l>Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,</l>
              <l>And made Verona's ancient citizens</l>
              <l>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</l>
              <l>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</l>
              <l>Cankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.</l>
              <l>If ever you disturb our streets again,</l>
              <l>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-054" n="44"/>
          <p>Soon after this, the Lord and Lady Capulet issued invitations to a masked ball to be
            given at their family mansion. Among the beauties who were to grace this festival was
            one Rosaline, niece to Lord Capulet, with whom Romeo, the heir of the house of Montague,
            imagined himself to be madly in love, but whose advances had been repulsed by the
            lady.</p>
          <p>Benvolio, Romeo's cousin, had no patience with the lovesick folly of his kinsman, and
            he thought that, if Romeo would make the acquaintance of other maidens, he would be
            cured of his hopeless passion. So he suggested to Romeo:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>At this same ancient feast of Capulet's</l>
              <l>Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st,</l>
              <l>With all the admiréd beauties of Verona.</l>
              <l>Go thither, and with unattainted eye</l>
              <l>Compare her face with some that I shall show,</l>
              <l>And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>R<hi rend="sc">OMEO</hi>.</speaker>
            <lg>
              <l>I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,</l>
              <l>But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Although Romeo scouted the suggestion that there could be any one fairer than Rosaline,
            yet he ventured to don a mask, and take the risk of being recognized in the house of his
            hereditary foe.</p>
          <p>At this masquerade, Juliet, the sole heir of the house of Capulet, was to make her
            début; for, although she was but fourteen years of age, her father considered her quite
            old enough to marry. He favored the suit of the young Count Paris, kinsman of the
            prince, and he hoped <pb id="VAC1105-055" n="45"/>that, as a result of their meeting at
            the ball, Juliet would fall in love with Count Paris.</p>
          <p>The old saying, "Love goes where it is sent," was, however, to be perfectly fulfilled
            in this case. The moment Romeo's glance fell upon the fair, sweet Juliet, he lost all
            thought of his former love, and had eyes for none but her. He exclaimed in
            ecstasy:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!</l>
              <l>Her beauty hangs upon the cheek of night</l>
              <l>Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;</l>
              <l>Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!</l>
              <l>So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,</l>
              <l>As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.</l>
              <l>The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,</l>
              <l>And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.</l>
              <l>Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!</l>
              <l>For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In speaking aloud, Romeo entirely forgot the danger of self-betrayal, and his voice was
            recognized by Tybalt, nephew of the Capulets, who happened to overhear him. It angered
            Tybalt to find that a Montague should presume to attend a feast of the Capulets, and he
            said to his servant:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

          <p>Tybalt resented this interference, and withdrew in high dudgeon, uttering threats of
            vengeance against the upstart Montague, when they should meet elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Romeo, entirely unconscious of Tybalt's wrath, made his way to the side of Juliet at
            the first opportunity. Love made him bold, and when he dared to take a kiss from her
            lips, she did not repulse him, for she had also fallen in love at first sight. Her
            mother, who was watching her, knew that it was not Paris to whom Juliet was giving her
            favors, and she sent to call her daughter from the ardent Romeo.</p>

            of Capulet, Romeo was in despair. Juliet, on her part, was equally <note id="note_018"

          <p>Romeo left the house with his friends, but the violence of his new love made him linger

          <p>Young in years though she was, love had, in a flash, as it were, transformed Juliet
            into a woman. Hence this unreserved surrender of herself. She knew that family pride
            would forbid an open marriage with one of the hated Montagues; therefore, in order to be
            true to the holy love which possessed her soul, she felt that she must act for herself,
            without consulting her parents. The only person whom Juliet could trust with her secret
            was an old nurse who was wholly devoted to her interest. This was the messenger whom she
            resolved to send to Romeo in the morning.</p>
          <p>Before retiring, however, Juliet went again to the window, hoping for one more word
            with her lover. She was not disappointed, for Romeo still lingered, longing to hear her
            sweet voice once again. As she called his name, quickly came the response:&mdash;</p>

          <p>When Romeo left Juliet, he at once repaired to the cell of a certain Friar Laurence,
            who was father-confessor for both families. It was now early morning, and the good friar
            was already astir gathering herbs. As he worked, he thus communed with
            himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</l>
              <l>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities!</l>
              <l>For naught so vile that on the earth doth live</l>
              <l>But to the earth some special good doth give;</l>
              <l>Nor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,</l>
              <l>Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.</l>
              <l>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,</l>
              <l>And vice sometime's by action dignified.</l>
              <l>Within the infant rind of this weak flower</l>
              <l>Poison hath residence, and medicine power;</l>
              <l>Two such opposéd kings encamp them still</l>
              <l>In man as well as herbs, &mdash; grace and rude will.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The friar's reflections were interrupted by Romeo, who sought him for advice and
            assistance in the matter of his proposed marriage with the daughter of his enemy. Friar
            Laurence consented to unite the lovers, hoping that their union would result in healing
            the feud. In the afternoon of that same day, therefore, Romeo and Juliet were wedded
            with the blessing of the church.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-063" n="53"/>
          <p>The fiery Tybalt, whom his Uncle Capulet had restrained from summarily chastising Romeo
            for appearing at the ball, was determined to punish the rash youth at his first
            opportunity. Late that day, after Romeo's marriage rites had been celebrated, the
            opportunity came. Benvolio and Mercutio, partisans of the Montagues, were passing along
            the street, when they encountered Tybalt, who inquired where he could find Romeo. Even
            as he spoke, Romeo came in sight. Tybalt at once accosted him in a violent manner,
            saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford</l>
              <l>No better term than this, &mdash; thou art a villain.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Romeo returned a mild answer, for now that Juliet was his wife, he desired to avoid
            quarrelling with any of the Capulets. Tybalt refused to be pacified, however, and
            Mercutio took the quarrel upon himself. In the sword-fencing that followed, Mercutio was
            mortally wounded. This bloody deed Romeo felt that it was his duty to avenge. He
            argued:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>This gentleman, the prince's near ally,</l>
              <l>My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt</l>
              <l>In my behalf; my reputation stained</l>
              <l>With Tybalt's slander; &mdash; Tybalt, that an hour</l>
              <l>Hath been my cousin! &mdash; O sweet Juliet,</l>
              <l>Thy beauty hath made me effeminate,</l>
              <l>And in my temper softened valor's steel!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The sight of Tybalt triumphing over Mercutio slain aroused his fury, and he
            shouted:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-064" n="54"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Now, Tybalt, take the "villain" back again</l>
              <l>That late thou gav'st me! for Mercutio's soul</l>
              <l>Is but a little way above our heads,</l>
              <l>Staying for thine to keep him company;</l>
              <l>Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,</l>
              <l>Shalt with him hence.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>This proved a vain boast, for it was Tybalt, not Romeo, who was slain in the duel.
            Romeo had barely escaped, at the entreaty of his friend Benvolio, when the prince,
            together with the heads of the two rival houses, appeared upon the scene. Benvolio
            related truthfully all that had happened, and since, in slaying Tybalt, Romeo had
            avenged the death of Mercutio, the kinsman of the prince, his punishment was made exile,
            instead of death. The prince sternly told Capulet and Montague:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;</l>
              <l>I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;</l>
              <l>Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:</l>
              <l>Therefore use none; let Romeo hence in haste,</l>
              <l>Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.</l>
              <l>Bear hence this body, and attend our will;</l>
              <l>Mercy but murthers, pardoning those that kill.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Romeo had fled to Friar Laurence for protection, but when that faithful friend brought
            him word of the prince's sentence, telling him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hence from Verona art thou banishéd;</l>
              <l>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide:&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>instead of rejoicing that he had not been condemned <pb id="VAC1105-065" n="55"/>to
            death, Romeo thought of nothing but the separation from his bride. He bitterly bewailed
            his fate, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,</l>
              <l>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog</l>
              <l>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</l>
              <l>Live here in heaven, and may look on her,</l>
              <l>But Romeo may not; he is banishéd.</l>
              <l>And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?</l>
              <l>Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,</l>
              <l>No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,</l>

          <p>At this moment a knock was heard. The newcomer proved to be Juliet's nurse, whom Juliet
            had sent to find her husband and to assure him of her undying love. At sight of the
            nurse, Romeo started up, inquiring in agonized tones what his lady said of him who had
            taken the life of her kinsman. The nurse replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;</l>
              <l>And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,</l>
              <l>And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,</l>
              <l>And then falls down again.</l>

          <p>Friar Laurence advised Romeo to take up his residence in Mantua, saying that he would
            send him <pb id="VAC1105-067" n="57"/>frequent messages concerning the state of affairs
            in Verona. He promised also to use his utmost influence to reconcile the two hostile
            families to Romeo's marriage with Juliet, and to persuade the prince to pardon Romeo.
            Then he bade the nurse go tell her mistress that Romeo was coming to comfort her with a
            sweet farewell.</p>

          <p>Hardly had Romeo gone, when Juliet was dismayed by receiving an imperative command from
            her father that she should give her hand in marriage to Count Paris on the following
            Thursday, only three days later. In vain did the poor girl plead for delay on account of
            the recent death of their kinsman Tybalt. Equally vain were her prayers to be excused
            from marrying on account of her extreme youth. Her father was very angry that she should
            dare to oppose his will, for he was one who regarded himself as the rightful arbiter of
            his child's destiny. His wrath waxed so furious that he stormed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!</l>
              <l>I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,</l>
              <l>Or never after look me in the face.</l>
              <l>Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>To Lady Capulet he said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>It makes me mad: day, night, late, early,</l>
              <l>At home, abroad, alone, in company,</l>
              <l>Waking, or sleeping, still my care hath been</l>
              <l>To have her matched; and having now provided</l>
              <l>A gentleman of noble parentage,</l>
              <l>Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly trained,</l>
              <l>Stuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,</l>
              <l>Proportioned as one's thoughts would wish a man,&mdash;</l>
              <l>And then to have a wretched puling fool,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-070" n="60"/>
              <l>To answer "I'll not wed; I cannot love,</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then he threatened Juliet:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Even the old nurse, to whom Juliet turned in her distress, advised her to accede to her
            father's wishes; for the worldly-wise woman argued that Romeo was as good as dead; and
            probably she was afraid of the consequences to herself, if her part in the secret
            marriage should become known.</p>
          <p>As a last hope, Juliet repaired to the cell of Friar Laurence, to entreat his kind
            offices in this extremity, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I'll to the friar, to know his remedy;</l>

          <pb id="VAC1105-071" n="61"/>
          <p>In her desperation, she threatened to take her own life, unless the good friar could
            devise some way of escape. Her courage and determination emboldened the priest to
            say:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope,</l>

              <l>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</l>
              <l>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</l>
              <l>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</l>
              <l>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</l>
              <l>A thing like death to chide away this shame,</l>
              <l>That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;</l>
              <l>And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.</l>

              <l>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</l>

              <l>Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</l>
              <l>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</l>
              <l>Or bid me go into a new-made grave</l>
              <l>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</l>
              <l>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</l>
              <l>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Then Friar Laurence unfolded his plan. On Wednesday night Juliet was to dismiss her
            nurse, and, when she was alone in her bed, she was to drink a potion which he would give
            her. Its effect would be that she would fall into a cold sleep, the perfect image of
            death, a trance of forty-two hours' duration. The friar continued:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Juliet's resolution carried her through the dreadful ordeal. The night before she was
            expected to wed with Paris she calmly swallowed the draught given her by Friar Laurence.
            And when they came to waken her to go to the church, they found her lying still and
            cold. Her father, touched by the sorrowful sight, mourned:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Friar Laurence, who had been summoned to officiate at the marriage, uttered a solemn
            reproof, bidding the friends:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>&mdash;every one prepare</l>

          <p>The messenger whom Friar Laurence despatched to inform Romeo of Juliet's voluntary
            putting-on of death's counterfeit through love for him, was unfortunately detained by
            health officers, who suspected him of having been exposed to the pestilence. Instead,
            therefore, of learning the truth from the letter of Friar Laurence, Romeo was thrown
            into despair by the report of Juliet's death brought by his man, who hastened to Mantua
            to tell his master what had happened. As Balthasar met him, Romeo asked
            eagerly:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Not for an instant did it occur to Romeo that there could be any mistake. He had but
            one thought, and that was to lie beside Juliet in the tomb. With this thought came the
            question of how that could be accomplished. Then he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">O mischief, thou art swift</l>
              <l>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</l>
              <l>I do remember an apothecary,&mdash;</l>
              <l>And hereabouts he dwells, &mdash; which late I noted</l>
              <l>In tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,</l>
              <l>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</l>
              <l>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</l>
              <l>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</l>
              <l>An alligator stuffed, and other skins</l>
              <l>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</l>
              <l>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</l>
              <l>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</l>
              <l>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</l>
              <l>Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.</l>
              <l>Noting this penury, to myself I said,</l>
              <l>An if a man did need a poison now,</l>
              <l>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</l>
              <l>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.</l>
              <l>O, this same thought did but forerun my need,</l>
              <l>And this same needy man must sell it me!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-075" n="65"/>
          <p>Just as Romeo had anticipated, the starving apothecary was easily induced to sell him a
            deadly poison, for, in his wretched plight, he could not resist the offer of gold. Armed
            with this death potion, therefore, the grief-stricken Romeo set out for Verona.</p>
          <p>Now it happened that, on the same night of Romeo's arrival, Paris, who also grieved
            sorely for the loss of her whom he had hoped to make his bride, went to the churchyard,
            carrying flowers with which to deck Juliet's bier. As he walked towards the tomb of the
            Capulets, he lamented:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones,</l>
              <l>Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Or, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans;</l>
              <l>The obsequies that I for thee will keep</l>
              <l>Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>At this moment, a page, whom Paris had stationed to keep watch, warned him that some
            one was approaching; so he concealed himself within the friendly shelter of a yew tree.
            Being utterly ignorant of Romeo's connection with Juliet, he was astonished to see that
            young man coming toward the tomb, and he surmised that Romeo, who had slain Tybalt,
            intended some shameful injury to the dead.</p>
          <p>Romeo, on his part, had no suspicion of the presence of other listeners than Balthasar,
            to whom he gave this charge:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,</l>
              <l>And do not interrupt me in my course.</l>
              <l>Why I descend into this bed of death</l>
              <l>Is partly to behold my lady's face,</l>
              <l>But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger</l>
              <l>A precious ring, a ring that I must use</l>

          <p>Balthasar retired, but only for a short distance, so alarmed was he by Romeo's wild
            looks and words. Thus it happened that, when Romeo forced open the tomb of the Capulets,
            there were two witnesses to his violence. Paris rushed forward, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>

              <l>Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;</l>
              <l>Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,</l>
              <l>Put not another sin upon my head,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-077" n="67"/>
              <l>By urging me to fury; O, be gone!</l>
              <l>By heaven, I love thee better than myself;</l>
              <l>For I come hither armed against myself.</l>
              <l>Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,</l>

          <p>But Paris would not listen. He forced Romeo into fighting with him &mdash; Romeo, who
            did not even know who his antagonist was. In the struggle, Paris was slain, and as he
            fell, he prayed:&mdash;</p>

              <l>In faith, I will. &mdash; Let me peruse this face.</l>
              <l>Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!</l>
              <l>What said my man, when my betosséd soul</l>
              <l>Did not attend him as we rode? I think</l>
              <l>He told me Paris should have married Juliet;</l>
              <l>Said he not so? or did I dream it so?</l>
              <l>Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,</l>
              <l>To think it was so? &mdash; O, give me thy hand,</l>
              <l>One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!</l>
              <l>I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave,&mdash;</l>
              <l>A grave? O, no! a lantern, slaughtered youth;</l>
              <l>For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes</l>

          </sp>
          <p>So saying, Romeo tenderly placed the slain Paris in the tomb.</p>
          <p>It was nearing the hour when the power of the draught which Juliet had swallowed should
            loosen its hold, and life should be restored. As Romeo hung over her in an ecstasy of
            grief, he felt, but did not understand, the surging of returning life. He cried in
            agony:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Alas, that Romeo could not have been delayed a little longer! For even at that moment
            the steps of one who could have set all right were hastening to the tomb. Friar Laurence
            had just learned of the failure of his messenger to reach Romeo in time, and he intended
            to be at Juliet's side when she should awake. His plan was to keep her at the monastery
            until such time as he could get word to Romeo to come and claim his bride. As the friar
            entered the churchyard, he was met by Balthasar, who told him that Romeo had been in the
            tomb full half an hour. At the entrance of the tomb, <pb id="VAC1105-079" n="69"/>he
            found the blood-stained swords with which the unhappy rivals had fought. Entering, he
            cried:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Romeo! O, pale! &mdash; Who else? what, Paris too?</l>
              <l>And steeped in blood? &mdash; Ah, what an unkind hour</l>
              <l>Is guilty of this lamentable chance!&mdash;</l>
              <l>The lady stirs.</l>

            <l>O comfortable friar! where is my lord?&mdash;</l>
            <l>I do remember well where I should be,</l>
            <l>And there I am. &mdash; Where is my Romeo?</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>F<hi rend="sc">RIAR</hi> L<hi rend="sc">AURENCE</hi>.</speaker>
            <l>I hear some noise. Come, come away.</l>
            <l>Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;</l>
            <l>And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee</l>
            <l>Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:</l>
            <l>Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;</l>
            <l>Come, go, good Juliet. &mdash; I dare no longer stay.</l>

            <l>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.</l>
          </sp>
          <p>Then, as the friar left her, she looked about, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <l>What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?</l>
            <l>Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.&mdash;</l>
            <l>O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop</l>
            <l>To help me after? &mdash; I will kiss thy lips;</l>
            <l>Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,</l>
            <l>To make me die with a restorative.</l>
            <l>Thy lips are warm.</l>
          </sp>
          <p>Hearing the rapidly approaching steps of the guard, Juliet snatched her husband's
            dagger from his belt, and plunging it into her heart, died upon his breast.</p>
          <p>The whole city was soon aroused. The heads of the houses of Capulet and Montague met at
            the tomb <pb id="VAC1105-080" n="70"/>where lay the flower of both families, sacrificed
            to their wicked hate. The prince heard the testimony of Friar Laurence, who told the
            whole story of these unhappy lovers; of Romeo's man, Balthasar; and of the page of
            Paris. He read the letter which Romeo had intrusted to Balthasar, in which he had
            confessed to the taking of poison that he might die beside Juliet. Then he
            cried:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Where be these enemies? &mdash; Capulet! &mdash; Montague!</l>
              <l>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</l>
              <l>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!</l>
              <l>And I, for winking at your discords too,</l>
              <l>Have lost a brace of kinsmen; all are punished.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>And there, above the dead bodies of their children, Capulet and Montague clasped hands
            in token of repentance for the wicked feud which had brought such sorrow to their
            hearts. Montague pledged himself to raise a statue of pure gold to the memory of true
            and faithful Juliet; and Capulet promised to honor Romeo's memory as richly. Their
            reconciliation was complete, but too late to save the lives of the ill-starred lovers.
            As the prince expressed it:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">The sun for sorrow will not show his head.</l>
              <l>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</l>
              <l rend="ti-1">Some shall be pardoned, and some punishéd:</l>
              <l>For never was a story of more woe</l>
              <l>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</l>

          <head rend="center">THE MERCHANT OF VENICE</head>
          <p>A <hi rend="sc">FEW</hi> centuries ago, the city of Venice in Italy was famed for its
            great magnificence. It was then the leading commercial port in Europe.</p>
          <p>Among its wealthy merchants was one Antonio, who, having no family of his own, had
            attracted to himself by his free hospitality a group of pleasure-loving young men, who
            were sincerely attached to the warm-hearted merchant.</p>
          <p>One day, however, Antonio found himself suffering from an unaccountable depression of
            spirits. His friends tried in vain to rally him, so they at last fell in with his sad
            humor, and sought to explain it to him and themselves. Antonio told them:&mdash;</p>

              <l>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</l>

              <l>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</l>
              <l>Wherein my time, something too prodigal,</l>
              <l>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</l>
              <l>I owe the most, in money, and in love;</l>
              <l>And from your love I have a warranty</l>

              <l>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</l>
              <l>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</l>
              <l>Within the eye of honor, be assured,</l>
              <l>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</l>

          <p>With this encouragement, Bassanio continued:&mdash;</p>

              <l>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</l>

              <l>The self-same way, with more adviséd watch,</l>
              <l>To find the other forth; and by adventuring both,</l>
              <l>I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,</l>

              <l>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</l>
              <l>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</l>
              <l>To shoot another arrow that self way</l>
              <l>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</l>

            preferred his request for the loan of three thousand ducats, giving Antonio's name as
            security. Now there was mutual hatred between Jews and Christians at this period in
            history, and the feeling was especially bitter between Shylock and Antonio. Still, in
            the hope of somehow getting Antonio into his power, Shylock was willing to loan this
            money. He was very deliberate, however, choosing to tantalize the impatient Bassanio.
            The shrewd old money-lender said meditatively:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Now it was an unheard-of thing for a Jew to eat with a Christian. By the Mosaic law the
            Jews were forbidden to eat pork. Shylock, therefore, took this halfway invitation as an
            insult, and he burst out indignantly:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the Nazarite,
              conjured the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with
              you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you.
              Who is he comes here?</p>
          </sp>
          <p>It was Antonio approaching. He was also coming to ask Shylock to lend him the money on
            his bond. At that time the Christian money-lenders were not in the habit of taking
            interest on their money, and they despised the Jews still more for doing so. Antonio had
            taken every opportunity of interfering with Shylock's business, so it is not surprising
            that, at sight of him, Shylock should mutter angrily to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>How like a fawning publican he looks!</l>
              <l>I hate him for he is a Christian,</l>
              <l>But more for that, in low simplicity,</l>
              <l>He lends out money gratis, and brings down</l>
              <l>The rate of usance here with us in Venice</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-090" n="80"/>
              <l>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</l>
              <l>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</l>
              <l>He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,</l>
              <l>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</l>
              <l>On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,</l>
              <l>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,</l>

          <p>The depth of Antonio's friendship for Bassanio may be understood by his being willing

              <l>And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,</l>
              <l>And all for use of that which is mine own.</l>
              <l>Well then, it now appears you need my help:</l>
              <l>Go to, then; you come to me, and you say,</l>
              <l>"Shylock, we would have moneys;" you say so,</l>
              <l>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,</l>

          <p>The lady Portia, whose praises Bassanio had sounded so highly, was wearied by the
            presence of numerous suitors in her mansion of Belmont, for they all fell below her
            standard of noble manhood. She complained to her maid, Nerissa, who was a trusted friend

            <p>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and
              poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own
              instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
              twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot
              temper leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness, the youth, to skip o'er the
              meshes of good counsel, the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
              choose me a husband. &mdash; O me, the word "choose!" I may neither choose whom I
              would, nor refuse whom I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the
              will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse
              none?</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Portia's complaint was due to the singular provisions of her father's will. Her father
            had evidently feared that the large fortune which he had left his daughter would lead
            mercenary men to seek her hand simply for the sake of obtaining her wealth. For, in
            those times, whatever property a woman possessed became her husband's at marriage. So
            the will provided that whoever should seek to marry Portia must choose one of three
            caskets, the right choice being indicated by the contents of the casket, namely, that
            containing Portia's picture.</p>
          <p>Nerissa had perfect confidence in the wisdom of Portia's father, so she
            replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations;
              therefore the lottery that he hath <pb id="VAC1105-095" n="85"/>devised in these three
              chests of gold, silver, and lead &mdash; whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you
              &mdash; will, no doubt, never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly
              love.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Although Portia felt so keenly the hardship imposed upon her by the humiliating
            conditions of her father's will, she decided to obey, at whatever cost to herself. She
            rejoiced to hear Nerissa say that the suitors then at Belmont had all signified their
            intention of leaving without making choice of a casket, as they were not willing to take
            the oath prescribed by the will.</p>
          <p>For, in order to protect his daughter from unscrupulous fortune-hunters, the father had
            required whoever should choose to take a solemn oath, &mdash; first, never, in case he
            should fail, to seek the hand of another woman in marriage; second, to leave Belmont at
            once; third, not to reveal which casket he had chosen. Nerissa told Portia:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords: they have acquainted me with
              their determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their home, and to trouble you
              with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's
              imposition depending on the caskets.</p>

            <p>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be
              obtained by the manner of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers are so
              reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence; and I wish
              them a fair departure.</p>

          <p>Directly after the departure of these suitors, another was announced, &mdash; the
            Prince of Morocco. He had the dark skin of the African climate, and he feared that
            Portia would be so prejudiced against him on that account, that he would not be given a
            fair chance. He was a man of honor and of valor, and he plead his cause with the ardor

          <p>Soon after Morocco's departure, a Spanish lord, the Prince of Arragon, arrived at
            Belmont. He was a very self-conceited man, and so sure of his own sagacity that he could
            not think it possible for him to choose wrongly. So he took the oath without any
            hesitation and then proceeded to make his choice. As he stood before the caskets, he

          <p>We are now prepared to admire the shrewdness of Portia's father in framing the oracular

            accordance with his own feelings and his views concerning life.</p>
          <p>Nearly three months have elapsed since Bassanio, accompanied by his friend Gratiano,
            left Venice for Portia's country-seat of Belmont. On parting from Antonio,&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Bassanio told him he would make some speed</l>
            <l>Of his return: he answered, "Do not so:</l>
            <l>Slubber<ref id="ref_038" target="note_038" rend="super">1</ref> not business for my
              sake, Bassanio,</l>
            <l>But stay the very riping of the time;</l>
            <l>And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,</l>
            <l>Let it not enter in your mind of love.</l>
            <l>Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts</l>
            <l>To courtship, and such fair ostents of love</l>
            <l>As shall conveniently become you there."</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The weeks have sped rapidly. Absorbed in each other's society, the lovers have taken no
            account of time. Now, however, Bassanio is desirous of deciding his destiny by making
            choice of one of the caskets, while Portia's fear lest he shall choose the wrong one
            causes her to urge delay:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Then ensued a sportive word-play which really covered deep anxiety on the part of both.
            At length, Portia told her impatient lover,&mdash;</p>

              <l>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</l>
              <l>There is no vice so simple but assumes</l>
              <l>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</l>

              <l>And these assume but valor's excrement</l>

          <p>Bassanio, like the true lover that he was, was not satisfied with the words of the
            scroll alone, but he besought Portia to confirm his happy choice. This she did in the
            gentle, modest way that was habitual with her. She told him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Bassanio and Portia had been so completely absorbed in themselves that they had had no
            eyes for others. So it was that they were astonished to learn that Gratiano had been
            wooing the maid, Nerissa, and that she had consented to become his wife, if Bassanio
            should choose the right casket. When, therefore, Gratiano wished all joy to the happy
            lovers, he asked Bassanio's permission to be married at the same time with himself and
            Portia. Bassanio replied,&mdash;</p>

          <p>But now their joy is sadly darkened by the arrival of a messenger bringing a letter
            from Antonio, who writes:&mdash;</p>
          <p rend="i">Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my
            estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; <pb id="VAC1105-108" n="98"/>and
            since, in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are cleared between you
            and I, if I might see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if your love
            do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.</p>
          <p>As Bassanio read the letter, Portia observed with alarm that he turned paler and paler.
            She begged him to tell her what it was that distressed him so. Then Bassanio told
            her,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">O sweet Portia,</l>
              <l>Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words</l>
              <l>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</l>
              <l>When I did first impart my love to you,</l>
              <l>I freely told you all the wealth I had</l>
              <l>Ran in my veins &mdash; I was a gentleman:</l>
              <l>And then I told you true; and yet, dear lady,</l>
              <l>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</l>
              <l>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</l>
              <l>My state was nothing, I should then have told you</l>
              <l>That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</l>
              <l>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</l>
              <l>Engaged my friend to his mere<ref id="ref_040" target="note_040" rend="super"
                  >1</ref> enemy,</l>
              <l>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</l>
              <l>The paper as the body of my friend,</l>
              <l>And every word in it a gaping wound,</l>
              <l>Issuing life-blood.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>When Portia learns that the amount of Antonio's indebtedness to Shylock is only three
            thousand ducats, she tells Bassanio to pay the debt many times over, if need be, to
            satisfy Shylock's greed. She bids Bassanio return to Venice, asking him to delay only
            long enough <note id="note_040"><ref target="ref_040" rend="super"
              >1</ref>absolute.</note><pb id="VAC1105-109" n="99"/>to have their marriage rites
            solemnized in the church at Belmont; for, on no account, would she have such a friend as
            Antonio "lose a hair through Bassanio's fault."</p>
          <p>After Bassanio and Gratiano have gone, Portia decides to take Nerissa and follow them,
            for her quick wit has devised a plan by which her husband's friend may be saved. She
            leaves her house in charge of Lorenzo, another friend of Bassanio's, and Jessica, his
            wife. Jessica is the daughter of Shylock, but she has left her father and married a
            Christian.</p>
          <p>Portia despatches a servant to her kinsman, Doctor Bellario of Padua, a very learned
            judge of the law, with commands to meet her at the ferry leading to Venice, bringing
            with him such notes and garments as Doctor Bellario may give him. Then she says to
            Nerissa:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand</l>
              <l>That you yet know not of. We'll see our husbands</l>
              <l>Before they think of us.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The Duke of Venice tried every means at his command to soften Shylock's hard heart, and
            to prevent his insisting upon carrying out the provisions of his cruel bond. But all was
            in vain, and Antonio was brought before the high court of justice. His own sufferings
            had tempered his hatred, and he came to his trial supported by a noble courage. In reply
            to the duke's expression of pity for him, Antonio answered:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>As Shylock came into court, the duke made one last appeal, saying:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</l>

          <p>The duke now said that he would dismiss the court until another day, unless the learned
            Doctor Bellario, whom he had sent for to try the case, should arrive. Even while he was
            speaking, a messenger from Doctor Bellario came bringing a letter to the duke, which
            read as follows:&mdash;</p>
          <p rend="i">Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick:
            but in the instant that your messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young
            doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I acquainted him with the cause in controversy
            between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we turned over many books together: he is
            furnished with my opinion, which, bettered with his own learning, the greatness whereof
            I cannot enough commend, comes with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
            request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him
            lack a reverend estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave
            him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his commendation.</p>
          <p>The young doctor, as you have probably guessed, was none other than Portia, and her
            clerk was Nerissa. The duke was very willing to give the conduct of the case <pb
              id="VAC1105-113" n="103"/>into the hands of the new-comer, whom Bellario recommended

              <l>What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Taught by his own suffering, Antonio was ready to show mercy to his enemy. He requested
            the duke to remit the fine of the half of Shylock's property which the state could
            legally claim, and asked that the other half might be entrusted to him for the use of
            Shylock's <pb id="VAC1105-118" n="108"/>daughter and her husband; also that Shylock
            should be required to make a will bequeathing his entire estate to Jessica and Lorenzo.
            Finally, he demanded that Shylock should adopt the Christian faith.</p>
          <p>To all these conditions the broken-spirited Shylock assented, saying sadly, as he left
            the court,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;</l>
              <l>I am not well. Send the deed after me,</l>
              <l>And I will sign it.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The court adjourned amid general rejoicings at Antonio's happy escape. As the duke
            withdrew, he said to Antonio,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Antonio, gratify this gentleman,</l>
              <l>For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Bassanio besought the young doctor to take as a fee the three thousand ducats due to
            Shylock, which Portia, of course, refused to accept, telling Antonio,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>He is well paid that is well satisfied;</l>
              <l>And I, delivering you, am satisfied,</l>
              <l>And therein do account myself well paid.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then she said significantly to Bassanio,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I pray you, know me when we meet again:</l>
              <l>I wish you well, and so I take my leave.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>But they urged her to take, at least, some slight remembrance as a token of their
            gratitude. She consented, therefore, to take Antonio's gloves, and Bassanio's ring
            &mdash; the very ring which she had given <pb id="VAC1105-119" n="109"/>him with the
            solemn command that he should never part with it.</p>
          <p>In dismay, Bassanio replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>This ring, good sir, &mdash; alas! it is a trifle;</l>

          <p>So saying, Portia departed with Nerissa. At the urgent entreaty of Antonio, who feared
            that the young doctor would consider them ungrateful, Bassanio sent Gratiano after them
            with instructions to give the ring to the doctor. Nerissa took this opportunity of
            persuading Gratiano to let her have the ring which she had given him. The two ladies now
            looked forward with merry anticipation to the surprise which they had in store for their
            husbands on their return.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-120" n="110"/>
          <p>The evening on which Portia and Nerissa reached Belmont again was one of surpassing
            beauty. Lorenzo and Jessica were awaiting them in the moonlighted grounds before the
            mansion. Lorenzo bade the musicians to play, and as they listened to the sweet melody,
            he said to Jessica:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</l>
              <l>Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music</l>
              <l>Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night</l>
              <l>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</l>
              <l>Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</l>
              <l>Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:</l>
              <l>There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st</l>
              <l>But in his motion like an angel sings,</l>
              <l>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;</l>
              <l>Such harmony is in immortal souls,</l>
              <l>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</l>
              <l>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In a few moments Portia and Nerissa arrived. As they entered the avenue, Portia
            exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Ere many minutes had passed, Bassanio arrived with Antonio and Gratiano. Portia
            graciously bade Antonio welcome, expressing great joy at his deliverance from the Jew's
            malice.</p>
          <p>Both the ladies, however, quickly discovered that the rings which they had given their
            husbands at parting were missing from their hands. At first, they pretended to be very

          <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> happened one day in the old chivalric times that a famous
            wrestler came to the court of Duke Frederick of France, and offered to amuse the knights
            and ladies by feats of strength. So cruel were his blows that he overthrew three
            brothers who had accepted his challenge, and broke their ribs, thus entirely disabling
            them.</p>
          <p>Now there was a certain young man, Orlando by name, who, not daunted by these crushing
            defeats, offered to contend with the victorious wrestler, Charles. To the amazement of
            the entire court, the braggart Charles was quickly thrown down, while Orlando remained
            unhurt.</p>
          <p>In answer to the questions of the astonished duke, Orlando told him that he was the
            youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, a man whom the duke had, during his lifetime,
            regarded as an enemy; so instead of rewarding Orlando for his skill, the duke turned
            away, displeased that his favorite wrestler should have been defeated by the son of one
            whom he hated, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,</l>
              <l>Hadst thou descended from another house.</l>
              <l>But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:</l>
              <l>I would thou hadst told me of another father.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-126" n="116"/>
          <p>Among the lookers-on at the wrestling match were two fair maidens, &mdash; Celia,
            daughter of Duke Frederick, and Rosalind, her cousin. Rosalind's father was the rightful
            duke, but he had been ill-treated by Frederick and driven into banishment. Celia's love
            for her cousin was so strong that she had persuaded her father to permit Rosalind to
            remain at court as her companion.</p>
          <p>These two young girls were filled with admiration of Orlando's courage and skill in
            wrestling, and Rosalind, to show her esteem, gave him a chain that she had about her
            neck, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,</l>
              <l>That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.</l>
              <l>Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown</l>
              <l>More than your enemies.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>After this, Duke Frederick became more tyrannical than ever. He commanded Rosalind to
            leave the court at once, threatening her with death, if, at the end of ten days, she
            should be found within twenty miles of his court, and giving as the only reason for his
            cruel order&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The real reason for this harsh sentence was that Rosalind had endeared herself to the
            people, and the false duke feared that their pity for the wronged daughter of the
            banished duke would cause them to rebel against his rule. So he would not relent, even
            though his own daughter, Celia, pleaded with him for permission to keep Rosalind with
            her, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I cannot live out of her company.</l>

          <p>Celia's love for Rosalind was so deep and true, however, that she refused to be parted
            from her cousin, and herself suggested that they should go together to seek Rosalind's
            father, who, since his banishment, had been living in the neighboring forest of Arden.
            With him were some of his faithful friends among the nobles, who preferred to share his
            exile, rather than attend upon Duke Frederick, whom they hated. There they were said

          <p>Rosalind knowing that&mdash;</p>
          <p rend="ti-1">Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold,&mdash;</p>
          <p>was unwilling to risk travelling so far without some protection, so she proposed to
            disguise herself as a young man. This she could easily do, because she was taller and
            stronger than her fair cousin. Rosalind put on, therefore, the clothing of a countryman,
            while Celia dressed like a country lass, that they might pass for brother and sister.
            They also persuaded Touchstone, the court jester, who was devotedly attached to Celia,
            to accompany them. These preparations made, Celia proposed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Meanwhile, Orlando, after his unkind dismissal by the duke, had met with still greater
            unkindness from his elder brother, Oliver, who had hoped that Orlando would be worsted
            in the wrestling match. The secret of this unbrotherly feeling was a bad conscience.</p>
          <p>When their father, Sir Rowland de Boys, died, he entrusted the care and education of
            his two younger sons to the eldest, Oliver. Oliver had obeyed his father's will in the
            case of the second son, but, for some unaccountable reason, he so disliked Orlando, the
            youngest, that he neglected to give him the education that was his due, and even
            shamefully mistreated him.</p>
          <p>At the time our story opens, Orlando had determined that he would endure this
            ill-treatment no longer. So when Oliver called him a villain, or base peasant, he seized
            his brother by the throat, and compelled him to listen to his demands.</p>

              of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow me
              such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left
              me by testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>

          <p>When Oliver learned that his brother had defeated the duke's wrestler, his rage knew no

          <p>After many days of wandering, Orlando and his aged servant, almost fainting from
            hunger, came to the forest of Arden, where, unknown to them, the banished duke and his
            faithful followers were keeping a kind of rustic state. The famished Orlando, coming
            unexpectedly upon the exiles as they were about to partake of their <pb id="VAC1105-131"
              n="121"/>noonday meal, drew his sword in his excitement, and would have compelled them
            to give him food. But the kind-hearted duke, reading his suffering in his wild manner,
            spoke gently to him, and made the distressed young man heartily welcome to his table.
            The grateful Orlando, however, refused to eat, himself, until he could bring his

          <p>After their hunger had been satisfied, Orlando confided to the kind duke who he was,

          <p>It was not long until Rosalind herself happened upon one of these love-ditties, and she
            was greatly astonished to find her virtues published thus:&mdash;</p>
          <lg rend="i">

          <p>Her cousin Celia not only found other effusions, but she discovered the writer of them,
            and teased Rosalind wittily about her poetical lover. Since Rosalind was as deeply in
            love as was Orlando, she soon contrived to meet him, and he, not recognizing her through
            her disguise, was easily led to talk of himself. Rosalind began:&mdash;</p>

            <p>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote

          </sp>
          <p>Thus did Rosalind cunningly manage to lead the unsuspecting Orlando to woo her in her
            own name, for he was delighted to accede to her request. She, on her part, confessed to
            her cousin Celia,&mdash;</p>

            <p>My pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it

          <p>One day Orlando, who had promised to attend the duke at dinner, on parting from
            Rosalind, told her that he would return in two hours. She jestingly retorted that, if he
            should be one minute behind the promised hour, she should lose all faith in his word,
            saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>If you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will
              think you most unworthy of her you call Rosalind.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>The two hours passed, but Orlando did not appear. After a long waiting, another man was
            seen approaching. As he came near he thus addressed them:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Oliver, now thoroughly repentant, and ashamed of his former ill-treatment of his

          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>When from the first to last betwixt us two</l>
              <l>Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,</l>
              <l>As how I came into that desert place:&mdash;</l>
              <l>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</l>
              <l>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</l>
              <l>Committing me unto my brother's love;</l>
              <l>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</l>
              <l>There stripped himself, and here upon his arm</l>
              <l>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</l>
              <l>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</l>
              <l>And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</l>
              <l>Brief, I recovered him, bound up his wound;</l>
              <l>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</l>
              <l>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</l>
              <l>To tell this story, that you might excuse</l>
              <l>His broken promise, and to give this napkin</l>
              <l>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</l>
              <l>That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Upon hearing this, and seeing the blood-stained napkin, Rosalind swooned. By so doing,
            she almost betrayed herself, but she quickly recovered, and insisted that Oliver should
            return immediately to his wounded brother.</p>
          <p>All the time that Oliver had been telling his story, he had been looking with admiring
            eyes upon the gentle Celia, and very soon thereafter, he found an opportunity <pb
              id="VAC1105-140" n="130"/>of confessing his love to her, and was made happy by
            receiving a confession of love in return. Rosalind said afterward, in speaking of it to
            Orlando:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>There was never anything so sudden: for your brother and my sister no sooner met but
              they looked, no sooner looked but they loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no
              sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason, no sooner knew the reason but
              they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to
              marriage which they will climb; clubs cannot part them.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>So it was arranged that Oliver and Celia should be married in the presence of the duke
            and his rustic court. The sight of their happiness gave a fresh pang to the heart of
            Orlando. He said to Rosalind:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>O, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes! By so
              much the more shall I to-morrow be at the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I
              shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Rosalind then told him for his comfort that, ever since her childhood, she had known
            many secrets of the magic art, she having been taught by an uncle who was a great
            magician; and that this art would enable her to produce the real Rosalind, whom he might
            marry, if he would, at the same time that his brother should be wedded to Celia. She
            also won a promise from her father, the duke, that, if she should bring his daughter to
            him, he would give her in marriage to Orlando.</p>
          <p>The rest is quickly told. On the following day, Rosalind appeared in her own maidenly
            apparel, thus gladdening the hearts of her father and her lover. Her <pb
              id="VAC1105-141" n="131"/>knowledge of magic had enabled her to bring to the wedding
            Hymen, the goddess of marriage. Hymen, who rejoices in bringing loving hearts together,
            sang this marriage hymn:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Good duke, receive thy daughter:</l>

              <l>Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,</l>
              <l>Feed yourselves with questioning;</l>
              <l>That reason wonder may diminish,</l>
              <l>How thus we met, and these things finish.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>To complete their content, a messenger from the court, who was none other than the
            brother of Oliver and Orlando, arrived soon after the wedding, bringing word that Duke
            Frederick had repented of his evil ways. In token of the sincerity of his repentance he
            was ready to restore the crown to the rightful duke, Rosalind's father, and their lands
            to the lords who had followed the duke into exile. This news brought great joy to those
            in the forest. The duke voiced the happiness of all in saying:&mdash;</p>

          <head rend="center">THE TAMING OF THE SHREW</head>
          <p>B<hi rend="sc">APTISTA</hi>, a wealthy gentleman of Padua, had two daughters, for whom
            he desired to find husbands. The younger daughter, Bianca, was a gentle, yielding
            creature, and her father's favorite. Katherina, the elder, was a high-spirited girl,
            whose nature had been soured by her father's outspoken preference for her sister. The
            mother being dead, there was no one to teach Katherina to curb her ill temper, and she
            had grown to be so violent in word and deed that she was known in Padua as the "shrew,"
            or scold.</p>
          <p>Bianca had many suitors, but the marriageable men were all afraid of the shrew.
            Baptista, however, declared that Bianca should not marry until a husband were found for
            Katherina. He told the suitors in the presence of both daughters:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</l>
              <l>For how I firmly am resolved you know;</l>
              <l>That is, not to bestow my youngest daughter</l>
              <l>Before I have a husband for the elder.</l>
              <l>If either of you both love Katherina,</l>
              <l>Because I know you well, and love you well,</l>
              <l>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-146" n="136"/>
          <p>When one of them replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>To cart her rather: she's too rough for me:&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>is it any wonder that Katherina's brow mantled with shame and anger, or that she asked
            her father indignantly if he wished to make her an object of public scorn?</p>
          <p>Now it happened that, just at this time, Petruchio, a young gentleman of Verona, who
            had recently come into his fortune, arrived in Padua. One of the suitors for the hand of
            Bianca was an acquaintance of Petruchio's. On meeting Petruchio, this young man, named
            Hortensio, inquired:&mdash;</p>

              <l rend="ti-2">What happy gale</l>

              <l>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</l>
              <l>To seek their fortunes farther than at home,</l>
              <l>Where small experience grows. But, in a few,</l>
              <l>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:&mdash;</l>
              <l>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</l>
              <l>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</l>
              <l>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</l>
              <l>Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,</l>
              <l>And so am come abroad to see the world.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Hortensio at once bethought him that, if he could persuade Petruchio to marry
            Katherina, he might have some prospect of winning Bianca. So he asked:&mdash;</p>

          <p>It might seem from Petruchio's talk that he would be chiefly influenced by wealth in
            the choice of a wife, but in Europe, it is customary for men of rank and position to
            expect a woman to have enough money to support a style of living corresponding to that
            of her <note id="note_048"><ref target="ref_048" rend="super">1</ref>malicious,
              shrewish.</note><pb id="VAC1105-148" n="138"/>husband. Petruchio was fond of
            adventure, and a little opposition pleased him; so he rather liked the thought of
            showing himself the superior of other men, by being able to tame the proud spirit of the
            beautiful Katherina. He repaired, therefore, quickly to the house of Baptista, and
            inquired of that gentleman:&mdash;</p>

              <l>After my death the one half of my lands:</l>

            <lg>
              <l>And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of</l>
              <l>Her widowhood, &mdash; be it that she survive me,&mdash;</l>
              <l>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Baptista did not know what to think of this hasty young wooer, and he warned Petruchio
            that, before arranging for marriage settlements, he must get Katherina's consent.
            Petruchio assured him that he made no doubt of winning the lady's favor. He
            insisted:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,</l>
              <l>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</l>
              <l>And where two raging fires meet together,</l>
              <l>They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.</l>
              <l>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</l>
              <l>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</l>
              <l>So I to her, and so she yields to me;</l>
              <l>For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>These words of Petruchio's give us an idea what plan he intends to pursue with
            Katherina: that he proposes to disarm her ill nature by meeting her outbursts of temper
            with words and actions as ugly as her own.</p>
          <p>While awaiting her coming &mdash; for Baptista had agreed to send her to him &mdash; he
            pondered:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>I'll woo her with some spirit when she comes.</l>

              <l>She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</l>
              <l>Say that she frown; I'll say, she looks as clear</l>
              <l>As morning roses newly washed with dew:</l>
              <l>Say she be mute, and will not speak a word;</l>
              <l>Then I'll commend her volubility,</l>
              <l>And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</l>
              <l>If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks</l>
              <l>As though she bid me stay by her a week;</l>
              <l>If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day</l>
              <l>When I shall ask the banns, and when be married:&mdash;</l>
              <l>But here she comes:&mdash;</l>

              <l>Kate of Kate-Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</l>
              <l>For dainties are all cates; and therefore, Kate,</l>
              <l>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;&mdash;</l>

          <p>Katherina was sharp enough to see that Petruchio was really admiring her beauty; but
            that, at the same time, he was expecting her to show the ill temper of which he had
            evidently heard. This put her on her mettle, and she replied in the same tone. In the
            word-play that followed, she proved herself a match for the merry Petruchio in witty
            retort. Finally, Petruchio told her:&mdash;</p>

          <p>At sight of her father with some of her sister's suitors, all Katherina's ill-nature
            returned. When Petruchio assured them that he and Katherina had agreed so well that they
            were to be married upon the following Sunday, Kate made a sharp answer, saying that she
            would see Petruchio hanged rather than marry him then.</p>
          <p>But this made no difference to the determined Petruchio, who said,&mdash;</p>

              <l>She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss</l>

          <p>Sunday came, the wedding feast was prepared, and the bridal party were ready to proceed
            to the church where the marriage ceremony was to be performed. But the bridegroom came
            not. We cannot blame poor Katherina for feeling keenly the shame of this seeming want of
            faith on the part of the man who had wooed her so impetuously. She could not restrain
            her tears, and angrily reproached her father, saying:&mdash;</p>

              <l>And, to be noted for a merry man,</l>

              <l>Yet never means to wed where he hath wooed.</l>
              <l>Now must the world point at poor Katherine,</l>
              <l>And say, &mdash; "Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,</l>

          <p>Just as the wedding guests were about to disperse, word was brought that the bridegroom
            was approaching, but that, instead of wearing wedding garments, he was dressed in the
            most outlandish fashion imaginable&mdash;</p>
          <p>in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches, thrice turned; a pair of old
            boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another laced; an old rusty sword with a
            broken hilt: his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle, and stirrups of no kindred: and
            with a half-checked bit, and a head-stall of sheep's leather, which hath been often
            burst, and now repaired with knots: besides, being possessed with the glanders, swayed
            in the back, and altogether, a worn-out creature.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-154" n="144"/>
          <p>Baptista, although scandalized by the ridiculous appearance of his would-be son-in-law,
            was glad to find that he still intended to marry Katherina, as his greeting

              <l>And wherefore gaze this goodly company?</l>
              <l>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</l>
              <l>Some comet, or unusual prodigy?</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Why, sir, you know, this is your wedding-day:</l>
              <l>First were we sad, fearing you would not come;</l>
              <l>Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.</l>
              <l>Fie! doff this habit, shame to your estate,</l>
              <l>An eye-sore to our solemn festival.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Petruchio turned a deaf ear to all appeals that he would not go to the church dressed
            as he then was; he declared in reply to Baptista's wish that he would not thus marry his
            daughter:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words;</l>
              <l>To me she's married, not unto my clothes.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>At the marriage service, Petruchio's behavior was as irreverent as were his clothes. To
            judge by his actions he was far more shrewish than Katherina had ever been. The
            trembling bride shook with fear at his mad words and acts; for&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l rend="ti-2">When the priest</l>
            <l>Should ask &mdash; if Katherine should be his wife,</l>
            <l>"Ay, by gogs-wouns," quoth he; and swore so loud</l>
            <l>That, all amazed, the priest let fall the book:</l>
            <pb id="VAC1105-155" n="145"/>
            <l>And, as he stooped again to take it up,</l>
            <l>The mad-brained bridegroom took him such a cuff,</l>
            <l>That down fell priest and book, and book and priest.</l>
            <l>But after many ceremonies done,</l>
            <l>He calls for wine. &mdash; "A health," quoth he, as if</l>
            <l>He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</l>
            <l>After a storm. &mdash; Quaffed off the muscadel,</l>
            <l>And threw the sops all in the sexton's face.</l>
            <l>This done, he took the bride about the neck,</l>
            <l>And kissed her lips with such a clamorous smack,</l>
            <l>That, at the parting, all the church did echo.</l>
            <l>Such a mad marriage never was before.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>As they came from the church, Petruchio still further astonished every one by
            announcing that his business required such haste that he could not partake of the
            wedding feast that had been provided, but must leave immediately.</p>

              <l>I must away to-day before night come:</l>
              <l>Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,</l>
              <l>You would entreat me rather go than stay.</l>
              <l>And, honest company, I thank you all,</l>
              <l>That have beheld me give away myself</l>
              <l>To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.</l>

              <l>For I must hence, and farewell to you all.</l>

          <p>The secret reason of all Petruchio's strange conduct began to appear when he persisted
            in going in spite of Katherina's entreaties, and not only that, but in exercising his
            right as a husband to compel her to go with him. Katherina attempted to assert her own
            will against that of her husband, saying:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Obey the bride, you that attend on her:</l>
              <l>Go to the feast, revel and domineer,</l>
              <l>Be mad and merry,&mdash;</l>
              <l>But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.</l>
              <l>Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;</l>
              <l>I will be master of what is mine own.&mdash;</l>
              <l>And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;</l>
              <l>I'll bring mine action on the proudest he</l>
              <l>That stops my way in Padua.</l>
              <l>Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate;</l>
              <l>I'll buckler thee against a million.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>And thus, with a strange mingling of tenderness and harsh rudeness did Petruchio so
            bewilder poor Kate that she began to hate scolding and ill-temper just as Petruchio
            intended that she should; for his cure for the shrewishness of his pretty wife was to
            show her how <pb id="VAC1105-157" n="147"/>hateful was such ill-nature as she had been
            in the habit of indulging.</p>
          <p>On their ride home, Petruchio kept up the show of fitful caprice and unreasonableness,
            mounting Katherina upon a horse as worn-out as the one he rode; cursing the horse
            because it stumbled in a miry place; and beating the serving boy because of the fall,
            until Katherina begged him to desist. For the fretful girl, who, until then, had never
            felt any unselfish sympathy, now learned to feel for those who were unjustly blamed.</p>
          <p>On arriving at their country home, they found everything in readiness for their
            reception, but nothing pleased the cross master. When dinner was served, he refused to
            eat or to permit the hungry Katherina to taste the food, declaring that everything was
            burnt, and pretending to be afraid to eat over-done food lest it should make them both
            more ill-tempered than ever. He told his tearful bride that, on the morrow, all should
            be set right, but that, for that night, they would fast together. It might seem that
            Petruchio went to unnecessary extremes in his taming process, but he was resolved to
            accomplish a speedy and permanent cure. He said to himself:&mdash;</p>

              <l>As with the meat, some undeservéd fault</l>
              <l>I'll find about the making of the bed;</l>
              <l>And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,</l>

              <l>That all is done in reverend care of her;</l>
              <l>And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night:</l>
              <l>And, if she chance to nod, I'll rail and brawl,</l>
              <l>And with the clamor keep her still awake.</l>
              <l>This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;</l>
              <l>And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor:</l>
              <l>He that knows better how to tame a shrew,</l>
              <l>Now let him speak.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>By Petruchio's method of treatment, Katherina was soon humbled to that degree that she
            secretly begged her husband's most trusted servant, Grumio, to manage to get her
            something to eat without Petruchio's knowledge.</p>

          <p>Katherina's patience was now entirely exhausted, but just then Petruchio entered
            bringing a dish of meat, which he said he had prepared for her himself. He set the dish
            on the table, saying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Without Katherina's knowledge, Petruchio had given orders for the making of some
            fashionable garments for his bride. When they were brought, Katherina was well pleased
            with their style, but Petruchio, to carry out his plan of subduing the shrewish girl by
            imitating her usual habit of fault-finding, would have none of them. When the merchant
            said that he had brought the cap that was ordered, Petruchio objected:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Petruchio pretended not to hear these words, but at once began to ask the tailor to
            show the gown that he had brought. He found even more fault with the gown than with the
            cap, asking:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Petruchio pretended to understand her to say that the tailor intended to make a puppet
            of her, and when the puzzled tailor attempted to explain that Katherina's words referred
            to him, Petruchio burst out in such a torrent of abuse that the poor workman was fain to
            defend himself, but to no purpose. Petruchio roared:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,</l>

              <l>I tell thee, I, that thou hast marred her gown.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Having given Kate her lesson in the ugliness of unreasonable scolding, Petruchio sent
            the tailor away, but not without telling him privately that the work should be paid for.
            That done, Petruchio addressed his wife in the most pleasant tone, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's,</l>

          <p>Petruchio thought rightly that to be as perverse as Katherina had heretofore been was

            father's, they went, and not a moment earlier. On the way he exclaimed, although it was

              <l>But sun it is not, when you say it is not;</l>
              <l>And the moon changes, even as your mind.</l>
              <l>What you will have it named, even that it is;</l>
              <l>And so it shall be so, for Katherine.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Ridiculous as this contention seems, it was no more senseless than many of Katherina's
            actions had formerly been; and Katherina was quick-witted enough to recognize her own
            image in this mirror of her own girlish perversity, which her husband thus held up to
            her gaze. Petruchio felt that he had won, but in order to test Katherina's professions,
            he made one more merry test of her sincerity. They met an old gentleman on the road,
            whereupon Petruchio remarked:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,</l>
              <l>Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?</l>
              <l>Such war of white and red within her cheeks?</l>
              <l>What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,</l>
              <l>As those two eyes become that heavenly face?</l>
              <l>Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee:</l>
              <l>Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>This time Katherina fell in with Petruchio's mood and said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Young budding virgin, fair, and fresh, and sweet,</l>
              <l>Whither away? or where is thy abode?</l>
              <l>Happy the parents of so fair a child!</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>"Tamed!" thought Petruchio; "I need vex her no more."</p>
          <p>When Petruchio and Katherina arrived in Padua, they found a surprise awaiting them, and
            not them alone, but Father Baptista as well. For while Baptista was considering which
            one of the suitors for the hand of his younger daughter he should bestow her upon,
            Bianca had chosen for herself, and had been married to a youth named Lucentio, without
            her father's knowledge.</p>
          <p>Baptista was easily reconciled, however, since Lucentio came of a wealthy family.
            Katherina and Petruchio joined the others at the wedding feast of Bianca and Lucentio.
            Hortensio, one of Bianca's discarded suitors, who had quickly solaced himself by
            marrying a rich widow, was there also with his new wife. After the supper, when the
            ladies had withdrawn, the other gentlemen began to banter Petruchio concerning his
            scolding wife, Baptista saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,</l>
              <l>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Petruchio retorted:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-166" n="156"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Well, I say &mdash; no: and, therefore, for assurance,</l>
              <l>Let's each one send unto his wife;</l>
              <l>And he whose wife is most obedient</l>
              <l>To come at first when he doth send for her,</l>
              <l>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Lucentio began the game, sending word to Bianca that he desired her presence. To the
            amazement of all, she who had the reputation of being always yielding and gentle,
            returned answer that she was busy and could not come. When Hortensio's wife was
            summoned, she bade the servant say that she would not come, but that she commanded her
            husband to come to her. Now it was Petruchio's turn. He told his servant:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;</l>

          </sp>
          <p>The other men could hardly believe their eyes when they saw Katherina coming quietly
            in, and heard her say:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Baptista congratulated Petruchio on the change by which the shrew had been transformed
            into a good-tempered woman, and offered to increase Katherina's dowry by twenty thousand
            crowns. At the request of <pb id="VAC1105-167" n="157"/>Petruchio, Katherina, who was
            now proud of her husband, gave her opinion of wifely duty. She began by reproving the
            wife of Hortensio for her sour looks, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Unknit that threatening unkind brow,</l>
              <l>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</l>
              <l>To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</l>
              <l>It blots thy beauty, as frosts do bite the meads;</l>
              <l>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</l>
              <l>Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty.</l>
              <l>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</l>
              <l>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</l>
              <l>And for thy maintenance commits his body</l>
              <l>To painful labor, both by sea and land,</l>
              <l>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</l>
              <l>While thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</l>
              <l>And craves no other tribute at thy hands,</l>
              <l>But love, fair looks, and true obedience,&mdash;</l>
              <l>Too little payment for so great a debt.</l>
              <l>Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</l>
              <l>Even such a woman oweth to her husband:</l>
              <l>And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</l>
              <l>And not obedient to his honest will,</l>
              <l>What is she but a foul contending rebel,</l>
              <l>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</l>
              <l>I am ashamed that women are so simple</l>
              <l>To offer war, where they should kneel for peace:</l>
              <l>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</l>
              <l>When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Hortensio's comment was:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Now go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrew;&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>and Katherina and Petruchio lived happy ever after.</p>

          <head rend="center">THE COMEDY OF ERRORS</head>
          <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> olden times there was great enmity between the Mediterranean
            cities of Syracuse and Ephesus. At length their quarrels waxed so fierce that neither
            town would permit any citizen belonging to its rival to come within its gates. In case
            any man was so reckless as to venture into the hostile city, he was liable to be seized
            and held as a prisoner. In that event, he must either pay a large sum of money for
            ransom, or die like a criminal.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, Ægeon, an aged merchant of Syracuse, was found in Ephesus and brought
            before the duke to receive sentence. In pronouncing judgment, the duke told Ægeon that
            it was useless for him to plead, for he could not show mercy, even if he desired to do
            so, since the Duke of Syracuse had executed some Ephesian merchants who had been taken
            in that city. It had been decreed, he said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Both by the Syracusans and ourselves,</l>
              <l>To admit no traffic in our adverse towns:</l>
              <l>Nay, more, if any born at Ephesus,</l>
              <l>Be seen at any Syracusan marts and fairs,</l>
              <l>Again, if any Syracusan born,</l>
              <l>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-172" n="162"/>
              <l>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose;</l>
              <l>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</l>
              <l>To quit the penalty, and to ransom him.</l>
              <l>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</l>
              <l>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</l>
              <l>Therefore, by law thou art condemned to die.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Well, Syracusan, say, in brief, the cause</l>
              <l>Why thou departedst from thy native home;</l>
              <l>And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Thus entreated, Ægeon told a tale of sad loss. Twenty-five years previous to that time,
            he, having gone to the city of Epidamnum on a trading journey, was followed by his wife,
            Æmilia, who, soon after her arrival, became:&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l>The joyful mother of two goodly sons;</l>
            <l>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</l>
            <l>As could not be distinguished but by names.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Strangely enough, another pair of twin boys was born to a poor slave mother, in the
            same inn, and on the same day. The wealthy merchant, hearing of this, thought that it
            would be very fine to have each of his sons attended by one of the twin slave boys; so
            he purchased them for that purpose.</p>
          <p>Æmilia soon began to urge her husband to return to their own city of Syracuse, and
            Ægeon unwillingly consented. They had sailed but a short distance from the port when a
            violent storm arose, and it appeared that <pb id="VAC1105-173" n="163"/>the vessel must
            sink. Ægeon did all that was possible to do in the effort to save their lives. He bound
            two of the babes &mdash; one of his own children, and one little slave &mdash; to the
            end of a spare mast. At the other end, he fastened the other pair of infants. Ægeon went
            on to tell:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</l>
              <l>Fastened ourselves at either end the mast;</l>
              <l>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</l>
              <l>Were carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</l>
              <l>At length, the sun, gazing upon the earth,</l>
              <l>Dispersed those vapors that offended us;</l>
              <l>And, by the benefit of his wishéd light,</l>
              <l>The seas waxed calm, and we discoveréd</l>
              <l>Two ships from far making amain to us,</l>
              <l>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</l>
              <l>But ere they came, &mdash; O let me say no more!</l>
              <l>Gather the sequel by that went before.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>D<hi rend="sc">UKE</hi>.</speaker>
            <lg>
              <l>Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;</l>
              <l>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Ægeon continued sadly to tell that, before they could be picked up, the mast struck
            upon a rock, and was split in two. The wind quickly carried that end of the mast to
            which the mother was bound with two of the babes, within reach of one ship, while the
            father and the other boys were saved by the second vessel.</p>
          <p>During all the years since that sad day, Ægeon had sought in vain for his lost wife and
            the little ones who had disappeared with her. When the son whom he had brought up
            reached the age of eighteen years, he also <pb id="VAC1105-174" n="164"/>set out to
            search for the lost ones. Ægeon continued:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</l>
              <l>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</l>
              <l>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus</l>
              <l>Hopeless to find, yet loth to leave unsought,</l>
              <l>Or that, or any place that harbors men.</l>
              <l>But here must end the story of my life;</l>
              <l>And happy were I in my timely death,</l>
              <l>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The duke had listened with interest, and his sympathy prompted him to release the poor
            old father, but he dared not. He told Ægeon, however:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</l>
              <l>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</l>
              <l>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</l>
              <l>My soul should sue as advocate for thee.</l>
              <l>But though thou art adjudgéd to the death,</l>
              <l>Yet will I favor thee in what I can:</l>
              <l>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day,</l>
              <l>To seek thy help by beneficial help;</l>
              <l>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus:</l>
              <l>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</l>
              <l>And live; if no, then thou art doomed to die.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Although the duke gave the aged merchant this respite because his heart had been
            touched by his sad story, he could hardly have expected that Ægeon could find any one to
            become surety for him in the city that had sworn hostility to his nation.</p>
          <p>As Ægeon passed out of the judgment hall, he lamented:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-175" n="165"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hopeless and helpless, doth Ægeon wend,</l>
              <l>But to procrastinate his liveless end.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Now it happened that, unknown to Ægeon, his son, Antipholus of Syracuse, who, as Ægeon
            had told the duke, was also searching for his twin brother, had arrived in Ephesus that
            same morning. But he, being warned by an Ephesian merchant, gave out that his home was
            Epidamnum, instead of the hostile Syracuse.</p>
          <p>In those days there were no banks, so that travellers were obliged to carry their
            wealth in coin. Antipholus, desiring to take a walk and view the town, directed his

          <p>In putting all his ready money into the hands of his slave, Antipholus showed that he

              <l>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,</l>
              <l>Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,</l>

              <l>Farewell till then: I will go lose myself,</l>
              <l>And wander up and down, to view the city.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In saying that he would go lose himself, Antipholus could not foresee how strangely he
            would be lost in a maze of errors, arising from the fact that the other twins were
            residents of Ephesus. After the merchant had left him, he said to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I to the world am like a drop of water,</l>
              <l>That in the ocean seeks another drop;</l>
              <l>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,</l>
              <l>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:</l>
              <l>So I, to find a mother and a brother,</l>
              <l>In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>As Antipholus was starting upon his walk, he was surprised to meet Dromio, his slave,
            as he supposed. How he could have done his errand and returned so quickly, Antipholus
            could not understand.</p>
          <p>The truth is that the Dromio whom he met was not his own servant, but the other Dromio,
            who belonged to his lost brother, Antipholus of Ephesus; for both masters were named
            Antipholus, and both slaves were called Dromio. This circumstance, added to the fact of
            an exact resemblance between each pair of brothers, <pb id="VAC1105-177" n="167"/>caused
            a succession of ridiculous mistakes that day in Ephesus.</p>
          <p>They began when Antipholus of Syracuse asked his supposed servant how he could have
            returned from the inn so soon. The Dromio whom he was addressing had been sent out by
            his mistress, the lady Adriana, wife of the Ephesian Antipholus, to tell her husband
            that dinner was waiting, and to urge him to hasten home. Antipholus of Syracuse, not
            being married, was completely mystified by these words of Dromio:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Antipholus still thought that Dromio was trying to play a merry joke upon him, but he
            was in no mood for jesting, so he repeated his demand for a report as to what had become
            of the thousand marks. Dromio replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</l>

              <l>If I should pay your worship those again,</l>

          <p>Antipholus is so enraged at what he takes to be persistent jesting on Dromio's part,
            that he strikes the poor fellow. Thereupon, Dromio hastily makes his escape, he being as
            greatly puzzled as his supposed master. Antipholus, thinking that both he and Dromio are
            the victims of practical jokers, soliloquizes:&mdash;</p>

              <l>They say this town is full of cozenage;</l>

          </sp>
          <p>At the Centaur Antipholus found his money safe, and learned that Dromio had wandered
            out in search of him. But the master still believed that he had been mocked by his own
            servant; so when he met Dromio, shortly afterward, he spoke angrily to the innocent
            slave:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</l>

              <l>Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,</l>

              <l>For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.</l>

          <pb id="VAC1105-180" n="170"/>
          <p>This made Antipholus more angry than before, and thinking that Dromio was taking
            advantage of his kind familiarity to make a laughing-stock of him, he began to beat the
            poor fellow. Dromio, while smarting under the blows, begged to know why he was beaten.
            But as neither knew what had really happened, all that they said only increased their
            bewilderment. In the midst of their discussion, Adriana, the wife of Antipholus of
            Ephesus, with her sister Luciana, appeared upon the scene.</p>
          <p>Adriana, supposing that the man she addressed was her husband, reproached him for
            neglect of her, and, in particular, for keeping the dinner waiting so long. By this
            time, Antipholus hardly knew whether he was himself or somebody else. He said to
            Adriana:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:</l>
              <l>In Ephesus I am but two hours old,</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Upon this, the sister, Luciana, interposed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>While Adriana had been scolding Antipholus, like the shrew she was, he had not failed
            to observe the sweet refined manner of her sister, who seemed to be, in very truth, a
            gentlewoman. So, in order to see more of Luciana, Antipholus decided to humor Adriana's
            mistake, and go home with her to dinner. Dromio was bidden to act as porter, and to
            permit no one to enter while the dinner was in progress. He, poor fellow, concluded that
            he was, somehow, transformed, so puzzling did he find the situation. He
            thought:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>This is the fairy land; &mdash; O, spite of spites!</l>

              <l>If we obey them not, this will ensue,</l>
              <l>They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>By the time dinner was well under way, the tardy husband of Adriana came home, and with
            him two <pb id="VAC1105-182" n="172"/>guests, business friends of his. His own Dromio
            followed at his heels, he having found his master at last, and delivered his mistress's
            message. He had also greatly mystified his master by declaring that he had met him a
            short time before, and that Antipholus had charged him with having had a thousand marks
            in gold from him, and had beaten him when he denied the charge.</p>
          <p>Both master and man were astonished beyond measure when, on coming to the door of their
            own house, they were refused admittance by one who replied to the demand of Antipholus
            that he should tell who he was that was keeping him out of his own house:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The porter for this time, sir,</l>
              <l>And my name is Dromio,&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>whereupon, the other Dromio protested:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O villain, thou hast stolen both mine office and my name;</l>
              <l>The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>They made so much disturbance with knocking and calling that Adriana came to see what
            it was all about. When her husband heard her voice, he expected that she would have the
            door opened at once, but, to his amazement, she refused to acknowledge his right to
            enter, saying that Antipholus was within, and that he must be an impostor. Then the true
            owner was about to beat the door down, but he was dissuaded from that by one of his
            guests, who urged him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Have patience, sir; O let it not be so.</l>
              <l>Herein you war against your reputation,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-183" n="173"/>
              <l>And draw within the compass of suspect</l>
              <l>The unviolated honor of your wife.</l>
              <l>Your long experience of her wisdom,</l>
              <l>Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,</l>
              <l>Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;</l>
              <l>And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse</l>
              <l>Why at this time the doors are made against you.</l>
              <l>Be ruled by me; depart in patience,</l>
              <l>And let us to the Tiger all to dinner:</l>
              <l>And, about evening, come yourself alone,</l>
              <l>To know the reason of this strange restraint.</l>
              <l>If by strong hand you offer to break in,</l>
              <l>Now in the stirring passage of the day,</l>
              <l>A vulgar comment will be made of it.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Antipholus acknowledged the wisdom of this advice, but he declared that he would make
            his wife sorry by giving another woman a gold necklace which he had purchased for
            her.</p>
          <p>The Syracusan Antipholus, although enjoying the dinner, and still more the company of
            the gentle Luciana, felt that he had, unwittingly, become involved in such a tangle,
            that he was anxious to extricate himself by leaving the city where everybody seemed to
            know him, while he knew nobody. So he left as soon as possible after dinner, bidding
            Dromio go to the harbor, and ascertain whether any ship were to sail that night.</p>

              <l>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</l>
              <l>Where I will walk till thou return to me.</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-184" n="174"/>
              <l>If every one knows us, and we know none,</l>
              <l>'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.</l>
              <l>There's none but witches do inhabit here;</l>
              <l>And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.</l>
              <l>She, that doth call me husband, even my soul</l>
              <l>Doth for a wife abhor; but her fair sister,</l>
              <l>Possessed with such a gentle sovereign grace,</l>
              <l>Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</l>
              <l>Hath almost made me traitor to myself:</l>
              <l>But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,</l>
              <l>I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.</l>

          </sp>
          <p>At this moment, Antipholus was accosted by the goldsmith, of whom his twin brother had
            ordered the necklace, and who was bringing the chain, as he had been instructed to do.
            He called:&mdash;</p>

          <p>As the goldsmith departs, Antipholus says to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-185" n="175"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>What I should think of this I cannot tell:</l>
              <l>But this I think, there's no man is so vain</l>
              <l>That would refuse so fair an offered chain.</l>
              <l>I see, a man here needs not live by shifts,</l>
              <l>When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.</l>
              <l>I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;</l>
              <l>If any ship put out, then straight away.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The goldsmith's mistake in giving the chain to the wrong Antipholus cost him much
            trouble. He had depended upon the money for that chain for means wherewith to discharge
            a debt of his own. The merchant to whom he was indebted now demanded immediate payment,
            and threatened the goldsmith with arrest, if the money were not at once forthcoming.
            While they were discussing the matter, Antipholus of Ephesus came along. Then there were
            angry words on both sides, the goldsmith appealing to Antipholus to give him the money
            for the chain, and Antipholus denying that the necklace had been delivered.</p>
          <p>Naturally, the goldsmith thought that this denial was a falsehood, since he was sure
            that he had given Antipholus the chain less than half an hour before. Antipholus, on his
            part, requested the goldsmith to take the chain to his house, deliver it to his wife,
            and get the money from her. The goldsmith replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Well, sir, I will: have you the chain about you?</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Consent to pay thee that I never had!</l>
              <l>Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The goldsmith, feeling that it was useless to argue longer with one who, as he
            supposed, denied having received the chain only to avoid paying for it, ordered the
            arrest of Antipholus. Just as the officer was about to lead him away, however, up came
            the Dromio who had been sent to engage passage on an outgoing vessel. Thinking that he
            saw his own master, Dromio reported:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum,</l>
              <l>That stays but till her owner comes aboard,</l>
              <l>And then, sir, she bears away: our fraughtage,<ref id="ref_055" target="note_055"
                  rend="super">1</ref> sir,</l>
              <l>I have conveyed aboard; the merry wind</l>
              <l>Blows fair from land: they stay for naught at all,</l>
              <l>But for their owner, master, and yourself.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Antipholus of Ephesus thought that the fellow had lost his mind, to talk about a ship
            and sailing, when he had not thought of leaving the city. But his first desire, at that
            moment, was to secure his own release, so he bade Dromio hasten to his house, tell his
            wife of his arrest, and ask her to send money that she would find in his desk, so that
            he might give bail for his liberty. <note id="note_055"><ref target="ref_055"
                rend="super">1</ref>baggage.</note>
            <pb id="VAC1105-187" n="177"/>The perplexed slave, although very unwilling to return to
            the house where they had dined, felt that he must obey:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thither I must, although against my will,</l>
              <l>For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Adriana, although a shrewish wife, was much distressed to learn that her husband had
            been arrested, and she gave Dromio the money for his release, telling him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight,<ref id="ref_056" target="note_056"
                  rend="super">1</ref></l>
              <l>And bring thy master home immediately.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>But everything seemed to go criss-cross in Ephesus that day. As he was hastening back
            with the money, Dromio met his true master, Antipholus of Syracuse, and told him that he
            had brought the gold as he had directed; but not seeing any police officer, he asked
            Antipholus how he had rid himself of the man.</p>
          <p>Antipholus, who knew of no arrest, or why the gold should have been brought, thought
            that both Dromio and himself were wandering in illusions. So he was more anxious than
            before to get away from a place where he was losing himself continually. He
            said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>There's not a man I meet but doth salute me,</l>
              <l>As if I were their well-acquainted friend;</l>
              <l>And every one doth call me by my name.</l>
              <l>Some tender money to me; some invite me;</l>
              <l>Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;</l>
              <l>Some offer me commodities to buy:</l>
              <l>Even now a tailor called me in his shop,</l>

          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>And showed me silks that he had bought for me,</l>
              <l>And, therewithal, took measure of my body.</l>
              <l>Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,</l>
              <l>And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Meanwhile, Antipholus of Ephesus was still in the hands of the officer, waiting, not
            very patiently, you may be sure, for the money that would release him. His own man now
            appeared with a rope, which he had brought as he had been commanded to do. He did not
            even know of his master's arrest, and he could not understand why Antipholus should be
            so angry with him as to begin to beat him unmercifully. While writhing under the blows,
            he moaned:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>I have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at
              his hands for my service but blows; when I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I
              am warm, he cools me with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep; raised with it
              when I sit; driven out of doors with it when I go from home; welcomed home with it
              when I return; and I think, when he hath lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to
              door.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>And now came the wife of Antipholus of Ephesus, with a quack doctor, who claimed to
            have the power to drive out evil spirits. Adriana had persuaded herself that her
            husband's strange actions must be due to his having lost his mind, and in that age,
            insanity was attributed to the influence of demons. She was confirmed in this opinion
            when Antipholus stoutly denied that he had dined at home that day, although Adriana and
            her sister, too, as confidently asserted that he had <pb id="VAC1105-189" n="179"/>done
            so. Adriana also told Antipholus that she had sent him money by Dromio. The poor
            trembling slave contradicted the statements of both master and mistress, saying that he
            had not been sent, and that he had received no gold.</p>
          <p>The doctor declared that both man and master were possessed with evil spirits, and
            should be bound and placed in a dark room. He invoked:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Satan, housed within this man,</l>
              <l>To yield possession to my holy prayers,</l>
              <l>And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight;</l>
              <l>I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Antipholus, enraged by such treatment from his wife, threatened to pluck out her false
            eyes. In terror, Adriana cried to the doctor:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The goldsmith, failing to receive the money for the chain, was unable to discharge his
            debt to the merchant. As he was trying to excuse himself to his creditor, on the ground
            that Antipholus refused to pay for the chain, and denied having received it, along came
            Antipholus of Syracuse, wearing the chain about his neck. Amazed at the sight, the
            goldsmith addressed him, saying:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</l>

              <l>And not without some scandal to yourself,</l>

          <p>This unjust accusation inflamed Antipholus of Syracuse to that degree, that he drew his
            sword and attacked the merchant. At that moment Adriana and her sister happened to come
            along. Seeing the men with their swords drawn, they supposed that the Antipholus who had
            been bound had escaped. So Adriana cried out to the merchant:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake; he is mad;</l>
              <l>Some get within him, take his sword away:</l>
              <l>Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The gate of a neighboring convent happened to be standing open, and the two distracted
            men rushed into this hospitable shelter. Presently, the abbess, a reverend lady, came
            out to inquire into the cause of the disturbance. To her Adriana appealed for possession
            of her husband who, as she thought, had just entered the convent. The abbess was a
            shrewd reader of character, and she led Adriana on to confess that she had been a
            jealous woman, and that she had berated her husband day and night. Then the abbess
            sharply reproved the scolding wife, telling her:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-191" n="181"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>And therefore came it that the man was mad:</l>
              <l>The venom clamors of a jealous woman</l>
              <l>Poison more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.</l>
              <l>It seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing:</l>
              <l>And therefore comes it that his head is light.</l>
              <l>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</l>
              <l>Unquiet meals make ill digestions,</l>
              <l>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;</l>
              <l>And what's a fever but a fit of madness?</l>
              <l>Thou say'st his sports were hindered by thy brawls:</l>
              <l>Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue</l>
              <l>But moody and dull melancholy,</l>
              <l>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair?</l>
              <l>In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest</l>
              <l>To be disturbed, would mad or man, or beast:</l>
              <l>The consequence is then, thy jealous fits</l>

          <p>So saying, the abbess retired to nurse the injured man back to health, as she told
            Adriana.</p>
          <p>By this time, it was almost night, and as no one had been found who would pay the
            ransom for Ægeon, he was being led to execution. The way led past the convent, and as
            Adriana turned, she beheld the procession coming with the duke at the head. Now the duke
            had long been a patron of her husband's, and a friend of her own family, so when Adriana
            saw him, she impulsively threw herself in his path, crying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Even while the duke was speaking, a messenger came running to tell Adriana that her
            husband had freed himself, beaten the servants, and bound the doctor; and that he was
            now searching for her, vowing to take vengeance upon her for having him confined.
            Adriana was so certain that she had seen her husband enter the convent that she did not
            credit <note id="note_057"><ref target="ref_057" rend="super">1</ref>urgent.</note>

            astounded to see Antipholus approaching, followed by Dromio.</p>
          <p>Antipholus, in his turn, appealed to the duke, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>Justice, most gracious duke, oh, grant me justice!</l>

          <p>Antipholus went on to tell the duke how Adriana had locked the doors against him at
            dinner time; how he had been arrested and had sent his slave to Adriana for gold to

          <p>While Antipholus had been talking, the aged Ægeon had been an absorbed listener, for he
            recognized the face of his son, and he felt that his life would now be saved. He
            supposed that this was the son from whom he had parted at Syracuse seven years before.
            So, at the first pause, he ventured to say to the duke:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Just as the poor old father was about to yield to despair, the door of the convent

          <p>The fate of Æmilia since their parting had been even more full of sorrow than that of
            Ægeon, for she had not been permitted to keep the boys that were with her upon the raft.
            They had been seized by fishermen of Corinth, and she, bereft of husband and children,
            had entered a convent, and in course of time, had become the head of her house. Her kind
            reception of the persecuted Antipholus of Syracuse had been the means of reuniting the
            family so long and so strangely separated.</p>
          <p>Then followed mutual explanations, by means of which the various errors that had caused
            so many painful experiences that day were so pleasantly untangled that they seemed to be
            only so many chapters in a laughable comedy.</p>
          <p>The Duke refused to take the ransom which was offered by Antipholus of Ephesus for the
            life of his father. Thus the cruel law which had so long bred a deadly hatred between
            the two cities was disregarded. At the invitation of the abbess, the duke attended the
            feast that was given in the abbey to celebrate the happy reunion of parents and
            sons.</p>
          <p>Antipholus of Syracuse took this opportunity to win the affection of Luciana, who did
            not now repulse his suit. The twin slaves shared in the general rejoicing; for as each
            looked at the other, he saw himself as in a <pb id="VAC1105-197" n="187"/>glass, and
            discovered to his great satisfaction that he was a "sweet-faced youth." They had their
            part in the celebration feast, and as they entered the abbey, they settled a playful
            contention as to who should go first by deciding&mdash;</p>

          <p>O<hi rend="sc">RSINO</hi>, duke of the ancient kingdom of Illyria, was madly in love
            with a lady who disdained his suit. Olivia &mdash; that was the lady's name &mdash; was
            a wealthy orphan who, at the time our story opens, had just suffered a fresh affliction
            in the death of her only brother. In her grief, she vowed to give herself to mourning
            for the space of seven years, during which time she would not appear in public without
            being closely veiled:&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l rend="ti-2">&mdash;all this, to season,</l>
            <l>A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh</l>
            <l>And lasting, in her sad remembrance.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The duke was a very persistent wooer, however, and he continued to send Olivia frequent
            messages of love, in the belief that she could not hold out against him forever. He
            thought that so devoted a sister could not fail to make an equally devoted wife, if once
            her heart were touched:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</l>
              <l>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</l>
              <l>How will she love when the rich golden shaft</l>
              <l>Hath killed the flock of all affections else</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-202" n="192"/>
              <l>That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</l>
              <l>These sovereign thrones, are all supplied; and filled&mdash;</l>
              <l>Her sweet perfection &mdash; with one self king!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>About this time, a new page was received into the duke's household, in the person of a
            young woman in disguise. It was some sad misfortune, we may be sure, that had caused a
            refined girl, such as Viola was, to assume the garb of a young man.</p>
          <p>She, and her twin brother, Sebastian, were taking a sea-voyage, in the course of which
            their ship was wrecked upon the coast of Illyria. The brother and sister were separated,
            and Viola was saved by the captain, who befriended her to the best of his ability. When
            Viola lamented her brother's loss, the captain tried to give her hope by telling
            her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l rend="ti-2">&mdash;after our ship did split,</l>
              <l>When you, and those poor number saved with you,</l>
              <l>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</l>
              <l>Most provident in peril, bind himself,</l>
              <l>Courage and hope both teaching him the practice,</l>

          <p>The captain then told Viola of the duke's suit to Olivia, and of her secluding herself
            from the world on account of the death of her brother. Viola expressed a great desire to
            enter the service of Olivia, but since that seemed impracticable, she persuaded the
            kind-hearted captain to purchase a page's suit for her, in which she might apply to be
            admitted into the duke's household as his servant.</p>
          <p>This plan was successful, and Viola, under the assumed name of Cesario, quickly won the
            favor of the duke, so that he kept her in close attendance upon himself. He was very
            fond of music and, in his love-lorn state, he took great delight in listening to sweet
            melodies. Viola had a pleasing voice, and could sing, and "speak to him in many sorts of
            music." Her gentle arts won the duke's confidence, and he conceived the idea that
            Cesario might be able to persuade Olivia to look more favorably upon his suit. So he
            bade the page go to Olivia's house, and remain there until, by some means, he could gain
            an audience with the lady.</p>

          <p>It was with a heavy heart that Viola made this promise, for she had already learned to
            love the noble duke; but she valued honor above happiness, and she was resolved to use
            her best endeavors in behalf of her kind patron. When she came to the door of Olivia's
            house, it being known that she was the duke's messenger, she was refused admittance, but
            nothing daunted, she would take no denial, and declared that she would not go away until
            she was granted an interview with the lady. Olivia's servant reported to his
            mistress:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he
              takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him
              you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to
              speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified against any
              denial.</p>

          <p>In the interview that followed, Viola used flattery and every other art of which she
            was mistress, in order to make a favorable impression, and so to advance the duke's
            cause. She could not have foreseen what the effect would be &mdash; that Olivia would be
            so attracted by her engaging manners as to fall in love with the fascinating page

              <l>Farewell, fair cruelty.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>After the departure of the page, Olivia turned his words about himself over in her
            mind, dwelling especially upon what he had said about his parentage being above his
            fortunes. His ardor in pleading his master's cause excited the lady's admiration for
            himself. She mused:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Methinks I feel this youth's perfections,</l>
              <l>With an invisible and subtle stealth,</l>
              <l>To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>To make sure that the page should have some reason for coming again, Olivia called her
            servant, and gave him a ring, commanding him to run after the youth, and to say that he
            had left this ring as a gift from the duke, but that she would not have it,
            adding:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Desire him not to flatter with his lord,</l>
              <l>Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-208" n="198"/>
              <l>If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,</l>
              <l>I'll give him reasons for it.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Olivia's act in thus forcing a valuable ring upon Cesario may seem unmaidenly, but in
            those days, ladies of rank who loved those beneath them in station were accustomed to do
            much of the wooing. Viola was quick-witted enough to interpret the gift as Olivia had
            intended it, and she was dismayed to find that, instead of aiding her master, she had
            unwittingly become his rival. When the servant offered her the ring, she refused to take
            it. Whereupon, he threw it upon the ground at her feet, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds
              it.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Viola was sadly distressed by the outcome of her well-meant effort in the duke's
            behalf, and she said to herself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I left no ring with her; what means this lady?</l>
              <l>Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her!</l>
              <l>She made good view of me; indeed, so much,</l>
              <l>That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,</l>
              <l>For she did speak in starts distractedly.</l>
              <l>She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion</l>
              <l>Invites me in this churlish messenger.</l>
              <l>None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.</l>
              <l>I am the man: If it be so (as 'tis),</l>

          <p>The duke's passion was in no wise lessened by the ill success of his page with the fair
            Olivia. On the contrary, he indulged it still more, almost seeming to luxuriate in sighs
            and love-music. He daily grew more fond of the page Cesario, whose disguise he never
            once suspected. Still, he was so impressed by Cesario's tender, sympathetic manner that
            he asked the youth one day:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Viola was finding her disguise a source of increasing annoyance, and it now led to
            serious difficulty. Olivia's uncle, a foolish old man, had a friend named Sir Andrew
            Aguecheek, whom he desired his niece to marry. Olivia had shown her warmth of feeling
            for the young page so plainly that Sir Andrew concluded that it was useless for him to
            try to win her hand. But the uncle, Sir Toby, would not give up so easily. He insisted
            that the proper thing for Sir Andrew to do, under the circumstances, was to challenge
            the page to fight a duel.</p>
          <note id="note_069"><ref target="ref_069" rend="super">1</ref>in spite of.</note>
          <pb id="VAC1105-213" n="203"/>
          <p>So, at the first opportunity, Viola was inveigled into meeting Sir Andrew, who, to tell
            the truth, was a coward, and was induced to face Viola only on Sir Toby's assuring him
            that he had talked with the page, and that "he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and
            a soldier, he will not hurt you." This promise the trembling Viola was very willing to
            make, as you may well believe.</p>
          <p>Just as they had taken their places and drawn their swords, however, they were
            interrupted by the entrance of a strange man, who said to Sir Andrew:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Put up your sword. If this young gentleman</l>
              <l>Have done offence, I take the fault on me;</l>
              <l>If you offend him, I for him defy you.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>You, sir! why, what are you?</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>For reply, the stranger drew his sword, and was about to fight with Sir Toby; but, at
            that moment, some officers of the law appeared, and arrested the stranger in the duke's
            name. It seems that he was a sea-captain, who had formerly taken an active part in a war
            against the duke, and the officers had orders to arrest him, if he should ever be found
            in Illyria.</p>
          <p>As he was about to be led away, the sea-captain, whose name was Antonio, said to
            Viola:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">This comes with seeking you:</l>

              <l>I must entreat of you some of that money.</l>

            <speaker>V<hi rend="sc">IOLA</hi>.</speaker>
            <lg>
              <l>What money, sir?</l>
              <l>For the fair kindness you have showed me here,</l>
              <l>I'll lend you something. My having is not much;</l>
              <l>Hold, there is half my coffer.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Antonio appeared to be greatly surprised that Viola did not recognize him, and that she
            should deny having his purse, which he declared he had given her a short time before. To
            the officers, who grew impatient, he said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>This youth that you see here</l>
              <l>I snatched one half out of the jaws of death;</l>
              <l>Relieved him with such sanctity of love,&mdash;</l>
              <l>And to his image, which methought did promise</l>
              <l>Most venerable worth, did I devotion.</l>
              <l>But O how vile an idol proves this god;&mdash;</l>
              <l>Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.&mdash;</l>
              <l>In nature, there's no blemish but the mind;</l>
              <l>None can be called deformed but the unkind.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The name Sebastian, by which the captain had called her, gave Viola the key to the
            meaning of his puzzling words. For Sebastian was the name of her twin brother, who, as
            you remember, was parted from her at the time of the shipwreck, and whom she had mourned
            as lost. The captain's words gave her hope that her brother was alive, and that her
            strong resemblance to him had caused the stranger's mistake.</p>
          <p>Such was really the case. Sebastian had been picked up by Antonio, who, in the weeks
            that had since elapsed, had become very fond of the young man. Antonio was <pb
              id="VAC1105-215" n="205"/>fully aware that he ran a great risk in entering Orsino's
            dukedom, and he had not intended to let himself be seen, but the chance encounter with
            Viola, just as she was attacked by Sir Andrew, made him forget precautions for his own
            safety. When he and Sebastian had parted after landing, he had given the young man his
            purse, with instructions to engage lodgings for them both at an inn called the
            "Elephant." The page's failure to recognize him, and his denial of having received
            Antonio's purse seemed to the distressed captain nothing but rank ingratitude.</p>
          <p>Hardly had Viola disappeared when her brother came sauntering past Olivia's house. Sir
            Andrew spied him, and taking him for the page Cesario, he struck at him. But he found
            the stout young fellow more than a match for him. Thereupon, Olivia came running out to
            part them. She, like the others, took Sebastian to be the young page with whom she had
            fallen in love, and she thus entreated him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Be not offended, dear Cesario! I prithee, gentle friend,</l>
              <l>Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway</l>
              <l>In this uncivil and unjust extent<ref id="ref_070" target="note_070" rend="super"

              <l>Against thy peace. Go with me to my house;</l>
              <l>And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks</l>
              <l>This ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby</l>
              <l>Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go;</l>
              <l>Nay, come, I prithee: would thou'dst be ruled by me!</l>

              <l>Madam, I will.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Olivia found Sebastian ready to meet her advances halfway, for he was greatly attracted
            by her beauty and <note id="note_070"><ref target="ref_070" rend="super"
              >1</ref>conduct.</note><pb id="VAC1105-216" n="206"/>her warmth of manner. But he
            could not understand her allusions to previous meetings, and when she left him alone for
            a short time, he began to wonder what was the meaning of all these favors on her part.
            He felt as if he were in a sort of fairyland, where nothing was exactly as it seemed. He
            said to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>This is the air; that is the glorious sun:</l>
              <l>This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't:</l>
              <l>And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,</l>
              <l>Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?</l>
              <l>I could not find him at the Elephant:</l>
              <l>Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,</l>
              <l>That he did range the town to seek me out.</l>
              <l>His counsel now might do me golden service:</l>
              <l>For though my soul disputes well with my sense,</l>
              <l>That this may be some error, but no madness,</l>
              <l>Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune</l>
              <l>So far exceed all instance, all discourse,</l>
              <l>That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,</l>
              <l>And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me</l>
              <l>To any other trust, but that I am mad,</l>
              <l>Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,</l>
              <l>She could not sway her house, command her followers</l>
              <l>With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing,</l>
              <l>As I perceive she does: there's something in't</l>
              <l>That is deceivable.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>When you hear what Olivia did next, you will wonder, as did Sebastian, whether she were
            not mad. The truth is that she was accustomed to having her own way in everything, and
            thus she had become wilful and impatient of contradiction. But we must do her the
            justice <pb id="VAC1105-217" n="207"/>to remember that she supposed that it was Cesario
            whom she had rescued from his assailants, and that he already knew how much she loved
            him. For, in order to rid herself of Orsino's unwelcome importunities, she proposed to
            Sebastian that they should be married at once. As was the custom in those days, she had
            a private chapel on her own estate. She came to Sebastian with the priest, and
            said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,</l>

              <l>Plight me the full assurance of your faith;</l>
              <l>That my most jealous and too doubtful soul</l>
              <l>May live at peace. &mdash; What do you say?</l>

          <p>When Viola reported to the duke what had happened &mdash; the unprovoked assault upon
            her, and her equally surprising rescue by the stranger captain &mdash; her kind patron
            offered to go with her to Olivia's, in the hope of unravelling the mystery. As they came
            to the house, they were met by the officers with Antonio in charge. At sight of Antonio,
            Viola said to the duke:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Orsino remembered Antonio as the man who had defeated his own sailors in battle, and he
            now railed <pb id="VAC1105-218" n="208"/>at the valiant captain, calling him "pirate"
            and "salt-water thief." In reply, Antonio thus defended himself for being found in the
            city of his enemy:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Orsino, noble sir,</l>
              <l>Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me;</l>
              <l>Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,</l>
              <l>Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,</l>
              <l>Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:</l>

              <l>His life I gave him, and did thereto add</l>
              <l>My love, without retention or restraint,</l>
              <l>All his in dedication: for his sake,</l>

          <p>The duke's hasty dismissal of Antonio's plea was due to the fact that Olivia had
            appeared, and in her presence he had neither eyes nor ears for any one else. But his
            jealousy was excited when he observed what loving looks she cast upon the page, while
            she gave him nothing but scornful words. In order to punish Olivia for her disdain, he
            threatened to wreak vengeance upon the unfortunate Viola, who had, as he thought, taken
            advantage of his confidence to make love to the lady. He therefore angrily told
            Viola:&mdash;</p>

          <p>It was now Olivia's turn to accuse Viola of falseness, she supposing, of course, that
            the page was the man to whom she had been married in the chapel. So she

          <p>Olivia, in her distress, now appealed to the priest, who had just entered, to confirm
            her statement concerning the marriage. The holy man affirmed that, only two hours
            before, he had joined in wedlock the youthful page and the fair Olivia.</p>
          <p>Overwhelmed by the disclosure of what seemed like most wicked deceit on the part of the
            page whom he had loved and trusted, the duke could only say:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Nothing but the presence of Sebastian could clear up this painful misunderstanding.
            Happily, he appeared at this moment, with an apology on his tongue for having hurt
            Olivia's kinsman, Sir Toby, who, you recollect, had been worsted in an encounter with
            Sebastian, whom he had mistaken for Cesario. In his astonishment, the duke
            exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Sebastian, on his part, was overjoyed to discover the sea-captain among the company,

          <p>Viola was only too happy to confess her disguise, and to reveal her true self. The duke

          <head rend="center">TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA</head>
          <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> old Verona once lived two young gentlemen between whom so rare a
            friendship existed that they were generally to be found together. The time came,
            however, when Valentine, filled with a natural desire to see the great world, resolved
            to travel and to visit the ducal court at Milan. His friend Proteus would have liked to
            accompany him had he not fallen so deeply in love with a fair young lady named Julia,
            that he could not bring himself to go where he could not pursue his courtship.</p>
          <p>Proteus tried, in vain, to dissuade Valentine from leaving Verona, for the ambitious
            young man wisely argued that travel broadens the views and sharpens the wits. He
            therefore told his friend:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus;</l>
              <l>Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits;</l>
              <l>Were't not affection chains thy tender days</l>
              <l>To the sweet glances of thy honored love,</l>
              <l>I rather would entreat thy company,</l>
              <l>To see the wonders of the world abroad,</l>
              <l>Than, living dully sluggardized at home,</l>
              <l>Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-226" n="216"/>
              <l>But, since thou lov'st, love still, and thrive therein,</l>
              <l>Even as I would, when I to love begin.</l>

              <l>Think on thy Proteus, when thou, haply, seest</l>
              <l>Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:</l>
              <l>Wish me partaker in thy happiness,</l>
              <l>When thou dost meet good hap: and in thy danger,</l>
              <l>If ever danger do environ thee,</l>
              <l>Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,</l>
              <l>For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</l>

          </sp>
          <p>In Valentine's query we detect the contempt which he, who had never yet been touched by
            the passion of love, felt for what he regarded as weakness in his friend. He could not
            forbear expressing his opinion of that folly, as he called it:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Love is your master, for he masters you:</l>

              <l>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</l>
              <l>Even so by love the young and tender wit</l>
              <l>Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,</l>
              <l>Losing his verdure even in the prime,</l>
              <l>And all the fair effects of future hopes.</l>
              <l>But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,</l>
              <l>That art a votary to fond desire?</l>
              <l>Once more adieu.</l>

          <p>Antonio, the father of Proteus, desired that his son should benefit by the experience
            of travel, and his desire was brought to a determination to send Proteus <pb
              id="VAC1105-227" n="217"/>away, by hearing what his brother, a man of large
            experience, thought of the matter. It was told him:&mdash;</p>

              <l>While other men of slender reputation,</l>

              <l>Then, tell me, whither were I best to send him?</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Antonio was reminded of the fact that Valentine was at the royal court in attendance
            upon the emperor, where he was receiving the training suitable for a gentleman; engaging
            in tilts and tournaments, conversing with noblemen, and acquiring the various courtly
            accomplishments. So he decided to send Proteus to Milan, in company with some gentlemen
            who were about to set out for the emperor's royal seat.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-228" n="218"/>
          <p>Proteus himself was ignorant of his father's intentions concerning him; and to leave
            Verona was quite contrary to his inclinations, for, after much coquetting and many
            rebuffs, the lady Julia was now beginning to smile on him. It happened that, at the very
            moment when his father was ready to communicate his purpose of sending him to Milan,
            Proteus was engaged in reading a love-letter from Julia. Up to this time, Proteus had
            not confided his passion to his father, and when Antonio asked&mdash;</p>

          <p>Vainly did the young man plead with his father to delay a day or two, at least. He was

          <p>Valentine gained more than he anticipated at the court of Milan. Not only was his mind
            enlarged by travel, <pb id="VAC1105-230" n="220"/>but his heart found its life's
            happiness in the love of Silvia, daughter of the duke. Her father did not favor
            Valentine's suit, however, for he had other plans for his daughter's future. He was very
            much displeased because Silvia was not willing to accept the husband of his choice, a
            young courtier named Thurio. But love does not come at the command of another, even
            though that other be one's own parent, and Silvia, who was a young woman of shrewd
            perception, discovered that Valentine was far superior in mind and true-heartedness to
            the gay courtier, Thurio.</p>
          <p>One day when both Valentine and Thurio were paying court to the Lady Silvia, the duke
            announced that another young Veronese had arrived at the palace. He inquired of
            Valentine if he knew this compatriot of his, the son of Antonio of Verona. Valentine
            replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I knew him, as myself; for from our infancy</l>
              <l>We have conversed and spent our hours together:</l>
              <l>And though myself have been an idle truant,</l>
              <l>Omitting the sweet benefit of time</l>
              <l>To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,</l>
              <l>Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,</l>
              <l>Made use and fair advantage of his days;</l>
              <l>His years but young, but his experience old;</l>
              <l>His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;</l>
              <l>He is complete in feature, and in mind,</l>
              <l>With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</l>

              <l>Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,</l>
              <l>He is as worthy for an empress' love,</l>
              <l>As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.</l>

          <p>Such generous words of introduction should have been repaid by truth and honor on the
            part of Proteus. It is painful to be obliged to relate that his course at Milan was one
            of base betrayal of friendship and of love. For no sooner did he see the Lady Silvia,
            than he transferred his affection to her, although Valentine told him that he was her
            accepted lover, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">She is mine own;</l>
              <l>And I as rich in having such a jewel</l>
              <l>As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,</l>
              <l>The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Valentine may have made a mistake in assuming superiority over Proteus because his
            lady-love was the daughter of a duke; telling him that Julia&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">&mdash;shall be dignified with this high honor,&mdash;</l>
              <l>To bear my lady's train; lest the base earth</l>
              <l>Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,</l>
              <l>And, of so great a favor growing proud,</l>
              <l>Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower,</l>
              <l>And make rough winter everlastingly.</l>

            <lg>

              <l>Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing</l>
              <l>To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;</l>
              <l>She is alone.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>At all events, Proteus, then and there, resolved to win this paragon of a maiden for
            himself. This he did regardless of every obligation of friendship and of loyalty in
            love. The fickle fellow said to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Even as one heat another heat expels,</l>

              <pb id="VAC1105-232" n="222"/>
              <l>So the remembrance of my former love</l>
              <l>Is by a newer object quite forgotten.</l>
              <l>Is it her mien, or Valentinus' praise,</l>
              <l>Her true perfection, or my false transgression,</l>
              <l>That makes me reasonless, to reason thus?</l>
              <l>She is fair; and so is Julia, that I love;&mdash;</l>
              <l>That I did love, for now my love is thawed;</l>
              <l>Which, like a waxen image 'gainst a fire,</l>
              <l>Bears no impression of the thing it was.</l>
              <l>Methinks, my zeal to Valentine is cold;</l>
              <l>And that I love him not, as I was wont:</l>
              <l>O! but I love his lady too, too much;</l>
              <l>And that's the reason I love him so little.</l>
              <l>If I can check my erring love, I will;</l>
              <l>If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Valentine had no suspicion of the mean treachery that was in the mind of Proteus, and
            he confided to his friend's ear that Silvia's father was opposed to his suit, and
            favorable to that of Thurio. Furthermore, he unfolded their plans for evading the
            watchful eye of the duke. He had a ladder made of cords which he was to throw in at
            Silvia's window after nightfall, by means of which she expected to make her escape and
            elope with him.</p>
          <p>This plan Proteus decided to betray to the duke, in the hope that, after Valentine
            should be sent away from Milan, he might worm himself into the good graces of Silvia.
            Proteus did not determine upon this course without some twinges of conscience; for he
            argued with himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;</l>
              <l>To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-233" n="223"/>
              <l>To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn:</l>
              <l>And even that power, which gave me first my oath,</l>
              <l>Provokes me to this threefold perjury.</l>
              <l>Love bade me swear, and love bids me forswear:</l>
              <l>At first I did adore a twinkling star,</l>
              <l>But now I worship a celestial sun.</l>
              <l>Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken;</l>
              <l>And he wants wit that wants resolvéd will</l>
              <l>To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.</l>
              <l>Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose:</l>
              <l>If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;</l>
              <l>I to myself am dearer than a friend:</l>
              <l>For love is still most precious in itself:</l>
              <l>And Silvia, witness Heaven, that made her fair!</l>
              <l>Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.</l>
              <l>I will forget that Julia is alive,</l>
              <l>Remembering that my love to her is dead;</l>
              <l>And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,</l>
              <l>Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.</l>
              <l>I cannot now prove constant to myself,</l>
              <l>Without some treachery used to Valentine.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In pursuance of his plan to betray his friend, Proteus sought an audience with the
            duke. When the duke inquired what he desired, this arch-hypocrite pretended to be very
            loath to speak, but said that his sense of duty would not permit him to keep silence. He
            declared:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Myself am one made privy to the plot.</l>
              <l>I know you have determined to bestow her</l>
              <l>On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;</l>
              <l>And should she thus be stolen away from you,</l>
              <l>It would be much vexation to your age.</l>
              <l>Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose</l>
              <l>To cross my friend in his intended drift,</l>
              <l>Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</l>

              <l>Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The duke thanked Proteus for advising him of this plan, but said that he had little
            fear of Valentine's stealing his daughter, because he had been on the alert, and had
            taken the precaution to have Silvia lodged in an upper tower of which he himself kept
            the key. Proteus replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</l>
              <l>How he her chamber-window will ascend,</l>
              <l>And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</l>
              <l>For which the youthful lover now is gone,</l>
              <l>And this way comes he with it presently;</l>
              <l>Where, if it pleases you, you may intercept him.</l>
              <l>But, good my lord, do it so cunningly,</l>
              <l>That my discovery be not aiméd at;</l>
              <l>For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</l>
              <l>Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</l>

          <p>Valentine soon appeared, wearing a long cloak under which he had the rope-ladder
            concealed. The duke delayed him and, by a shrewd pretence, cunningly entrapped the
            unsuspecting lover. He thus began:&mdash;</p>

          <pb id="VAC1105-236" n="226"/>
          <p>Valentine fell into the trap, advising the duke as to the most likely means to win a
            lady's favor, and when the duke told him that the lady in question was promised by her
            friends to another gentleman, and that she was kept a half-prisoner in a room high above
            the ground, the approach to which was by a shelving roof very dangerous to climb,
            Valentine suggested that access to this room might be secured by means of a ladder made
            of cords.</p>
          <p>The duke pretended to be greatly pleased with this plan, and desired Valentine to get
            such a ladder for him, but he wondered how he could convey the ladder to the lady's room
            without its being seen. Valentine replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</l>
              <l>Under a cloak, that is of any length.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>D<hi rend="sc">UKE</hi>.</speaker>
            <l>A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>V<hi rend="sc">ALENTINE</hi>.</speaker>
            <l>Ay, my good lord.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>D<hi rend="sc">UKE</hi>.</speaker>
            <l rend="ti-2">Then let me see thy cloak:</l>
            <l>I'll get me one of such another length.</l>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>V<hi rend="sc">ALENTINE</hi>.</speaker>
            <l>Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</l>
          </sp>
          <p>Then, as if desirous of finding out how to manage it, the wily duke insisted upon
            trying on Valentine's cloak. Of course, no gentleman dares refuse the request of
            royalty, so poor Valentine was compelled to assist in the discovery of the ladder which
            he had concealed under the garment, and to stand by while the Duke read a letter
            addressed "To Silvia," which was in a fold of the cloak. When he came to the
            words&mdash;</p>
          <lg>

          <pb id="VAC1105-237" n="227"/>
          <p>the duke sternly said:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l>'Tis so: and here's a ladder for the purpose.</l>

              <l>Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates;</l>
              <l>And think my patience, more than thy desert,</l>

              <l>Thank me for this, more than for all the favors</l>
              <l>Which, all too much, I have bestowed on thee.</l>
              <l>But if thou linger in my territories,</l>
              <l>Longer than swiftest expedition</l>
              <l>Will give thee time to leave our royal court,</l>
              <l>By Heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love</l>
              <l>I ever bore my daughter or thyself.</l>
              <l>Be gone; I will not hear thy vain excuse,</l>

          <p>The news of Valentine's banishment spread quickly. When it came to the ears of Proteus,
            that two-faced fellow sought his distressed friend, pretending to be all sympathy, but
            really seeking to hasten his departure. He brought, however, the news, sweet to the ears
            of Valentine, that Silvia was constant and had pleaded with her father for a reversal of
            his harsh sentence. He told how&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">She hath offered to the doom</l>
              <l>A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;</l>
              <l>Those at her father's churlish feet she tendered;</l>
              <l>With them, upon her knees, her humble self;</l>
              <l>Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them,</l>
              <l>As if but now they waxéd pale for woe:</l>
              <l>But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,</l>
              <l>Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-238" n="228"/>
              <l>Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;</l>
              <l>But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.</l>
              <l>Besides, her intercession chafed him so,</l>
              <l>When she for thy repeal was suppliant,</l>
              <l>That to close prison he commanded her,</l>
              <l>With many bitter threats of biding there.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>When Valentine lamented his own and Silvia's hard fate, Proteus reproved him,
            saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,</l>

              <l>Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;</l>
              <l>Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.</l>
              <l>Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that,</l>
              <l>And manage it against despairing thoughts.</l>
              <l>Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence:</l>
              <l>Which being writ to me, shall be delivered</l>
              <l>Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.</l>
              <l>The time now serves not to expostulate:</l>
              <l>Come, I'll convey thee through the city gate;</l>
              <l>And, ere I part with thee, confer at large</l>
              <l>Of all that may concern thy love-affairs:</l>
              <l>As thou lov'st Silvia, though not for thyself,</l>
              <l>Regard thy danger, and along with me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The duke little understood the depth and constancy of Silvia's love, or he would have
            known that to banish Valentine was the very way to prevent the fulfilment of his hope to
            have Thurio as a son-in-law. Since Proteus had served him so effectually in exposing the
            plans of Valentine, the duke besought him to use his influence to persuade Silvia to
            look with favor upon Thurio. <pb id="VAC1105-239" n="229"/>Proteus was willing to act as
            a go-between, because he thought that, by this means, he might have opportunities of
            pleading for himself. Being so fickle himself, he imagined that Silvia could easily be
            induced to transfer her affection from Valentine to his friend.</p>
          <p>He was, therefore, wholly unprepared for the scorn with which Silvia rejected his
            protestations of love. He was stung to the heart by her contemptuous words. He was
            obliged to conclude that:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,</l>
              <l>To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.</l>
              <l>When I protest true loyalty to her,</l>
              <l>She twits me with my falsehood to my friend:</l>
              <l>When to her beauty I commend my vows,</l>
              <l>She bids me think how I have been forsworn</l>
              <l>In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:</l>
              <l>But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,</l>
              <l>And give some evening music to her ear.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Proteus had advised Thurio to woo the coy Silvia by singing love-songs under her window
            at night. Thurio therefore employed some skilful musicians to serenade her with this
            ditty:&mdash;</p>
          <lg rend="i">
            <l>Who is Silvia? what is she,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That all our swains commend her?</l>
            <l>Holy, fair, and wise is she,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">The heaven such grace did lend her,</l>
            <l>That she might admiréd be.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg rend="i">
            <l>Is she kind as she is fair?</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">For beauty lives with kindness:</l>
            <pb id="VAC1105-240" n="230"/>
            <l>Love doth to her eyes repair,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">To help him of his blindness;</l>
            <l>And, being helped, inhabits there.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg rend="i">
            <l>Then to Silvia let us sing,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">That Silvia is excelling;</l>
            <l>She excels each mortal thing,</l>
            <l rend="ti-1">Upon the dull earth dwelling:</l>
            <l>To her let us garlands bring.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>When Thurio and the musicians departed, Proteus stayed behind, hoping to see and speak
            with Silvia. In this hope he was not disappointed, for Silvia soon appeared at the
            window; but when Proteus addressed her with honeyed words of flattery, she reproached
            him for his falseness, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!</l>
              <l>Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,</l>
              <l>To be seducéd by thy flattery,</l>
              <l>That hast deceived so many with thy vows?</l>
              <l>Return, return, and make thy love amends.</l>
              <l>For me, &mdash; by this pale queen of night I swear,</l>
              <l>I am so far from granting thy request,</l>
              <l>That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit;</l>
              <l>And by and by intend to chide myself,</l>
              <l>Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>There was another listener whose presence neither Silvia nor Proteus suspected &mdash;
            the forsaken Julia who, impatient at the protracted absence of Proteus, had persuaded
            her maid to disguise her in the garb of a page and accompany her to Milan. She was so
            confident of her lover's constancy that she thought that he would <pb id="VAC1105-241"
              n="231"/>pardon her seeming immodesty in the joy of their meeting.</p>
          <p>Julia reached Milan on the same evening of the serenade, and on inquiring for Proteus,
            was conducted to the spot where he was with Thurio and the musicians. So it happened
            that she became an eavesdropper, and heard his suit to Silvia. Shocked and distressed as
            she was, she was somewhat comforted by learning from Silvia's scornful reply that his
            false suit was rejected.</p>
          <p>Julia's next move was to apply to Proteus for service with him, under the assumed name
            of Sebastian. Almost the first service that Proteus required of her was to take to
            Silvia the very ring which she had given him at parting. In giving her this commission,
            Proteus told her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Sebastian, I have entertainéd thee,</l>
              <l>Partly, that I have need of such a youth,</l>
              <l>That can with some discretion do my business,</l>
              <l>But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior;</l>
              <l>Which (if my augury deceive me not)</l>
              <l>Witness good bringing up, fortune, and truth.</l>
              <l>Go presently, and take this ring with thee,</l>
              <l>Deliver it to Madam Silvia:</l>
              <l>She loved me well, delivered it to me.</l>

            lover, yet her own love for him was of that quality that she was willing to further his
            wishes, even at the cost of her own happiness. As she left him with the ring, &mdash;
            her own love-gift, &mdash; she thus argued with herself:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The interview with Silvia proved less painful than Julia had feared; for that lady
            rejected the ring which she knew had been given Proteus by Julia, of whom he had talked
            continually when he first came to Milan. She also expressed great pity for her who was
            being so heartlessly forsaken by the fickle Proteus.</p>
          <p>The more efforts were made to draw Silvia's heart from her true lover, the more
            determined she was to elude those who were watching her and to escape to rejoin
            Valentine. She persuaded one of the attendants at the court, Eglamour by name, to assist
            her to carry out her plan. Silvia had learned that her exiled lover had betaken himself
            to a neighboring forest, and that he had been adopted as leader of a band of outlaws,
            who, like Robin Hood's merry men, were living by their wits, and by what they could
            filch from passing travellers. Eglamour was to accompany her in her search for her
            faithful lover. They were to meet at the cell of a friar where Silvia was accustomed to
            go for confession.</p>
          <p>Eglamour arrived first at the meeting-place near the abbey. Looking about for the lady,
            he said to himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The sun begins to gild the western sky:</l>
              <l>And now it is about the very hour</l>
              <l>That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.</l>
              <l>She will not fail; for lovers break not hours,</l>
              <l>Unless it be to come before their time;</l>
              <l>So much they spur their expedition.</l>
              <l>See where she comes: Lady, a happy evening!</l>

          <p>Silvia was not mistaken in thinking that her movements were being watched. She had not
            been gone long before the duke sought Thurio and Proteus to ask if they had seen either
            Sir Eglamour or Silvia. Upon receiving a negative reply, he immediately
            guessed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Why, then, she's fled unto that peasant Valentine,</l>
              <l>And Eglamour is in her company.</l>
              <l>'Tis true; for Friar Lawrence met them both,</l>
              <l>As he in penance wandered through the forest:</l>
              <l>Him he knew well, and guessed that it was she;</l>
              <l>But, being masked, he was not sure of it:</l>
              <l>Besides, she did intend confession</l>
              <l>At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not:</l>
              <l>These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.</l>
              <l>Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,</l>
              <l>But mount you presently; and meet with me</l>
              <l>Upon the rising of the mountain-foot</l>
              <l>That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.</l>
              <l>Despatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>As the duke left them to make hasty preparations for following Silvia, the others, each
            in turn, secretly remarked to themselves:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Meantime, the exiled Valentine was growing so accustomed to the life of an outlaw that
            he could even take pleasure in its loneliness. He was surprised, as he said, to
            find:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>How use doth breed a habit in a man!</l>
              <l>This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,</l>
              <l>I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:</l>
              <l>Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,</l>
              <l>And to the nightingale's complaining notes</l>
              <l>Tune my distresses, and record my woes.</l>
              <l>O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,</l>
              <l>Leave not the mansion so long tenantless;</l>
              <l>Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall,</l>
              <l>And leave no memory of what it was!</l>
              <l>Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;</l>
              <l>Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Just as he said the last words, he heard the sound of loud shouting. Wondering, he
            exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>What hallooing and what stir, is this to-day?</l>
              <l>These are my mates, that make their wills their law,</l>
              <l>Have some unhappy passenger in chase:</l>
              <l>They love me well; yet I have much to do,</l>
              <l>To keep them from uncivil outrages.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Quickly concealing himself behind a tree, Valentine waited to learn what would follow.
            Imagine his astonishment when he beheld Silvia approaching, <pb id="VAC1105-246" n="236"
            />accompanied by Proteus and a page. Indignation succeeded astonishment however, when he
            heard Proteus making love to Silvia, claiming her love as a reward for having rescued
            her from the outlaws. But Silvia never swerved from her allegiance to Valentine. She
            replied to Proteus:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Had I been seizéd by a hungry lion,</l>
              <l>I would have been a breakfast to the beast,</l>
              <l>Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.</l>
              <l>O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,</l>
              <l>Whose life's as tender to me as my soul;</l>
              <l>And full as much (for more there cannot be)</l>
              <l>I do detest false perjured Proteus:</l>

          <p>Valentine could no longer restrain himself. The treachery of the man whom he had
            trusted as a friend excited his wrath to that degree that he discovered himself, and in
            stinging words denounced Proteus, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thou common friend, that's without faith or love;</l>
              <l>Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye</l>
              <l>Could have persuaded me: Now I dare not say</l>
              <l>I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.</l>
              <l>Who should be trusted when one's own right hand</l>
              <l>Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,</l>
              <l>I am sorry I must never trust thee more,</l>
              <l>But count the world a stranger for thy sake.</l>
              <l>The private wound is deepest: O time most accursed!</l>
              <l>'Mongst all foes, that a friend should be the worst.</l>

          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-247" n="237"/>
          <p>Valentine's reproaches awoke the conscience that had so long slept in Proteus' bosom,
            and he pleaded:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow</l>
              <l>Be a sufficient ransom for offence,</l>
              <l>I tender it here; I do as truly suffer</l>
              <l>As e'er I did commit.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>It was not in Valentine's nature to harbor ill-will, and he received his friend's
            remorseful confession in a spirit of forgiveness, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Who by repentance is not satisfied</l>
              <l>Is nor of heaven, nor earth; for these are pleased;</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Seeing that Proteus seemed sincerely penitent, Julia was emboldened to make herself
            known to the company. She addressed herself to Proteus:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Inconstancy falls off ere it begins:</l>

          <p>Just as their reconciliation was complete, some of the band of outlaws appeared
            bringing the duke and Thurio as captives. Thurio at once claimed Silvia, but when
            Valentine threatened him with swift punishment if he dared to touch her against her
            will, Thurio disclaimed any wish to interfere with their purposes. The duke, who
            despised cowardice, was so disgusted with this yielding on the part of the man whom he
            had chosen for a son-in-law that he declared:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Now, by the honor of my ancestry,</l>
              <l>I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,</l>

          <head rend="center">HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK</head>
          <p>M<hi rend="sc">ANY</hi> years ago, the University of Wittenberg in Germany, then a
            famous seat of learning, numbered among its students Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who was
            deeply interested in the study of philosophy. Hamlet was a high-minded youth, nobly
            sincere, and of an affectionate disposition. One day his studies were sadly interrupted
            by news of the sudden death of his father, King Hamlet, who had died, it was said, from
            the bite of a poisonous serpent that had stung him as he lay sleeping in the garden of
            the palace.</p>
          <p>Hamlet deeply reverenced his father, who had seemed to him the ideal of manly virtue
            and kingly majesty. Overwhelmed with a sense of irreparable loss, he said of his father
            to Horatio, a friend and fellow-student:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>He was a man, take him for all in all,</l>
              <l>I shall not look upon his like again.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Such being Hamlet's high estimate of his father, we can easily understand how shocked
            he was, when his mother, Queen Gertrude, married his Uncle Claudius, within two months
            after the death of her former husband. In so doing, she elevated Claudius to the throne,
            for she had been joint ruler of Denmark, and in those <pb id="VAC1105-254" n="244"
            />days, the king's son was not necessarily the successor to the kingship.</p>
          <p>Hamlet had never liked his uncle, and this hasty marriage made him very suspicious of
            the man who had contrived to put himself in his father's place. Hamlet loved his mother
            tenderly, and he grieved bitterly over the fickleness that had led her to solace herself
            so quickly in the love of another husband. And when she even went so far as to reprove
            him for continuing to mourn, and urged him to look merry and show himself friendly with
            his uncle-father, he longed to die and leave a world that seemed false and wicked to his
            grief-stricken soul.</p>
          <p>Claudius incensed him still further by telling him that he was rebellious against the
            will of God in grieving so. He begged Hamlet to remain at court and to accept his love
            as a father's, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</l>
              <l>To give these mourning duties to your father:</l>
              <l>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</l>
              <l>That father lost, lost his; but to perséver</l>
              <l>In obstinate condolement is a course</l>
              <l>Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;</l>
              <l>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</l>
              <l>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</l>
              <l>An understanding simple and unschooled.</l>

          <p>he consented to remain. The king chose to regard his consent as an evidence of kind

          <p>Immediately upon ascending the throne, Claudius began to make active preparations for
            war. This gave great offence to some army officers, who could not understand why they
            should be required to keep as strict watch as if an enemy were already approaching, when
            they had not heard of any declaration of war.</p>
          <p>All sorts of rumors were afloat, the most astonishing of which was that the ghost of
            the late king had been seen clad in full armor, walking upon the battlements of the
            royal castle. This was taken to be an evil omen, and the officers who claimed to have
            seen the ghost, thought it their duty to tell young Hamlet.</p>
          <p>Horatio, who had now come to the capital, ventured to broach the matter to Hamlet,
            telling him that, on two separate occasions, when Marcellus and Bernardo were officers
            of the watch, just at midnight,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">A figure like your father,</l>
              <l>Arméd at point exactly, cap-a-pé,</l>
              <l>Appears before them, and with solemn march</l>
              <l>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walked</l>
              <l>By their oppressed and fear-surpriséd eyes,</l>
              <l>Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled</l>
              <l>Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</l>
              <l>Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me</l>
              <l>In dreadful secrecy impart they did;</l>
              <l>And I with them the third night kept the watch:</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-257" n="247"/>
              <l>Where, as they had delivered, both in time,</l>
              <l>Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</l>
              <l>The apparition comes. I knew your father;</l>
              <l>These hands are not more like.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Hamlet charged his friends to keep absolute silence about what they had seen, and made
            an appointment to watch with them the following night, so that, in case the ghost should
            again appear, he might learn, if possible, the meaning of these visitations.</p>
          <p>In those days, it was believed that the spirits of the dead would return to the earth,
            if their coming could be the means of causing justice to be done where some great wrong
            had been committed. Horatio's story made Hamlet still more suspicious, and he said to
            himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;</l>

              <l>Till then sit still, my soul; foul deeds will rise,</l>
              <l>Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Midnight found Hamlet, in company with Horatio and Marcellus, on the platform before
            the castle, where the ghost was reported to walk. As they stood there, the silence of
            the sharp night air was broken by the report of a cannon, and the sound of trumpets.
            These were accompaniments of the king's wassail, or drinking feast, with which he had
            said that he should celebrate Hamlet's consenting to remain at home. Horatio desired to
            know whether this was customary, and Hamlet told him:&mdash;</p>
          <note id="note_079"><ref target="ref_079" rend="super">1</ref>suspect.</note>
          <pb id="VAC1105-258" n="248"/>

              <l>And to the manner born, it is a custom</l>
              <l>More honored in the breach than the observance.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>From this reply, we see that Hamlet was more refined in his tastes than the majority of
            his countrymen. But even as he spoke, Horatio exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Look, my lord, it comes!&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>and Hamlet turned to see the figure of his dead father advancing. Almost beside himself
            with emotion, the prince knew not whether the apparition boded good or ill, but he cried
            out in tones of agonized entreaty:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

          <p>As he spoke the last word, it seemed to Hamlet that the spirit beckoned to him, as if
            it desired to speak with him alone. Hamlet had no fear for his own safety, but his
            friends begged him not to follow, lest he might be led into some awful danger. Horatio
            urged:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Nothing could deter Hamlet from obeying the evident wish of his father's spirit, and
            throwing off his friends' detaining hands, he hastened to a remote part of the
            battlements whither the ghost had preceded him. There a tale of horror was unfolded to
            Hamlet's listening ear. The spirit entreated him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The ghost further told Hamlet that Claudius had stolen upon him while he slept, and had
            poured a deadly poison into his ears &mdash; a poison that infused itself into the blood
            instantly, producing immediate death. Furthermore, this false brother had so fascinated
            Queen Gertrude by his evil power that she had transferred her affections to him even
            during his own life. This accounted for her marrying Claudius so soon after the death of
            King Hamlet. The ghost charged Hamlet, however, not to harm his mother, but to leave her
            to heaven and the stings of her own conscience. As morning dawned, the spirit vanished,
            with the parting words:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The horrible disclosure put Hamlet in a frenzy of passion. Now he knew why his whole
            soul had risen in rebellion when the new king had called him "son," and had reproached
            him for continuing to grieve for the loss of his father. He realized that,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>One may smile, and smile, and be a villain.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>He felt that he had lived through years of awful experience in a few minutes. The
            ghost's solemn charge rang in his ears, and he resolved to put aside all plans <pb
              id="VAC1105-261" n="251"/>for personal happiness, in order to devote himself with a
            single mind to the sacred duty laid upon him.</p>
          <p>In those early days, before courts of law were established, the nearest male relative
            of a murdered man was bound by custom to avenge the murder. But how could Hamlet prove
            the truth of his suspicion, which had been so strangely confirmed? His mind acted
            quickly, and knowing that it was of the first importance to prevent his uncle from
            guessing that he was under suspicion, Hamlet made his friends take a solemn oath not to
            reveal by the least hint what had occurred that night, nor to seem to understand the
            cause of any peculiar actions on his part; and he put their loyalty to a very severe
            test by refusing to gratify their curiosity to learn what had been divulged in his
            interview with the ghost.</p>
          <p>Highly as he revered true philosophy, Hamlet had now learned that philosophy cannot
            explain all profound experience. So he told Horatio:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</l>
              <l>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy;&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>and in bitterness of spirit, he murmured:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The time is out of joint; &mdash; O cursed spite,</l>
              <l>That ever I was born to set it right!&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>so unequal did he feel to the task that was laid upon him.</p>
          <p>When Hamlet resolved to devote himself to avenging his father, he was perfectly
            conscious that this resolution involved the renouncing of all thought of marriage with
            the fair Ophelia, to whom his heart's love was <pb id="VAC1105-262" n="252"/>given.
            Ophelia was the daughter of Polonius, the aged lord chamberlain, and a sweet, gentle
            nature was hers. Her father and her brother Laertes &mdash; her mother was not living
            &mdash; thought that, since Hamlet's rank was so far above theirs, he could not be
            sincere in his professions of love for Ophelia. So they told her that the prince was
            trifling with her affection, and commanded her to repel his attentions.</p>

          <p>Hamlet knew nothing of this, and the sudden change in Ophelia's manner toward him
            confirmed his belief in woman's frailty and fickleness, which had been excited by his
            mother's inconstancy. He had already decided to adopt the wild manner and strange speech
            of one whose mind is unbalanced, thinking that, under the mask of insanity, he might
            find a way of satisfying himself of the king's guilt. For, if Claudius should be led to
            think that Hamlet's melancholy had developed into madness, he might be thrown off his
            guard.</p>

          <p>When, therefore, Ophelia repulsed him in obedience to her father's command, Hamlet
            tried to create the impression that her unkindness had caused him to lose his reason. He
            had always been scrupulously neat in his personal habits; so when he suddenly appeared
            before her one day with his clothing all disordered, and with a wild look in his eyes,
            Ophelia hastened to her father to tell him how affrighted she had been by Hamlet's
            strange conduct. Polonius at once surmised that the prince was losing his mind, and he
            said to his daughter:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The king betrayed great eagerness to hear what Polonius had to tell, when he declared
            that he thought that he had found the cause of Hamlet's lunacy. Polonius was a shrewd
            courtier, and he took care to impress the king with a deep sense of his own loyalty
            which, he hinted, had prevented his being over-ambitious for his daughter. When Claudius
            inquired how Ophelia had received Hamlet's professions of love, he replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l rend="ti-2">What might you,</l>

              <l>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</l>

          <p>This wordy harangue did not convince the king, who had his own reasons for thinking
            that Hamlet had something else on his mind. He desired to have an opportunity of testing
            the truth of the old courtier's conclusions. Polonius then proposed to contrive an
            interview between Hamlet and Ophelia, at which he and Claudius should be present, but
            concealed behind the tapestry curtains with which the walls of the room were hung.</p>
          <p>To this plan the king consented. Ophelia herself had no voice in the matter, but she
            was led to believe that she might, in this way, be instrumental in discovering the real
            cause of Hamlet's deep-seated melancholy, and, perhaps, in restoring him to himself.
            Otherwise, her modesty would have rebelled against so far violating what she had been
            taught to consider true maidenly reserve, as to seek Hamlet in a part of the castle
            where he was in the habit of taking exercise.</p>
          <p>In order that she might seem to be occupied, Polonius bade her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Read on this book;</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Hamlet soon appeared, but so absorbed was he in his own thoughts that he did not, at
            first, notice the <pb id="VAC1105-266" n="256"/>presence of Ophelia. His soul was so
            deeply oppressed by the heavy weight of the difficult task, which he had not yet felt
            himself equal to perform, that he longed to die, and escape the painful duty of avenging
            the murder of his father. He mused aloud:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>To be, or not to be, &mdash; that is the question:</l>

              <l>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</l>
              <l>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</l>
              <l>And by opposing end them? To die, &mdash; to sleep,&mdash;</l>
              <l>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</l>
              <l>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</l>
              <l>That flesh is heir to, &mdash; 'tis a consummation</l>
              <l>Devoutly to be wished. To die, &mdash; to sleep,&mdash;</l>
              <l>To sleep! perchance to dream! ay, there's the rub;</l>
              <l>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</l>
              <l>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</l>

          <p>At this moment Hamlet discovered Ophelia. He saluted her gravely and with a tender
            courtesy, but something in her manner, combined with the surprise of finding her there,
            led him to suspect that others might be listening to their conversation. This suspicion
            caused an instantaneous change in his manner, and led him to speak so harshly to her
            that Ophelia prayed that he whom she loved might be restored to his own gentle self. In
            her distress she moaned:&mdash;</p>

              <l>O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!</l>

              <l>That unmatched form and feature of blown youth</l>
              <l>Blasted with ecstasy: O woe is me,</l>

          <p>The king, who had listened intently to Hamlet's words, instead of thinking with
            Polonius that disappointment in love was the cause of Hamlet's lunacy, doubted the fact
            of his madness. Hamlet's parting words to <pb id="VAC1105-268" n="258"/>Ophelia had
            alarmed him greatly, for his guilty conscience made him fear lest Hamlet should suspect
            him. So when he heard Hamlet say:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>We will have no more marriages: those that are married already, all but one, shall
              live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.&mdash;</p>
          </sp>
          <p>he said to Polonius:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Love! his affections do not that way tend;</l>
              <l>Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,</l>
              <l>Was not like madness. There's something in his soul</l>
              <l>O'er which his melancholy sits on brood,</l>
              <l>And I do doubt<ref id="ref_086" target="note_086" rend="super">1</ref> the hatch
                and the disclose</l>
              <l>Will be some danger; which for to prevent,</l>

              <l>With variable objects shall expel</l>
              <l>This something-settled matter in his heart,</l>
              <l>Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus</l>
              <l>From fashion of himself. What think you on't?</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Polonius could not bring himself to admit that he might be mistaken in his opinion, but
            persisted in maintaining that Hamlet's disturbance of mind was due to neglected love. He
            desired to have one more attempt made to induce Hamlet to confess what was troubling
            him; so he proposed that the queen-mother should talk with her son, hoping that he might
            open his heart to her. But, fearing that the mother might not report all that Hamlet
            might say, the cunning old lord <note id="note_086"><ref target="ref_086" rend="super"
                >1</ref>suspect.</note><pb id="VAC1105-269" n="259"/>chamberlain said that he would
            again listen behind the tapestry.</p>
          <p>Before this, however, the king's anxiety to ferret out the cause of Hamlet's strange
            behavior &mdash; "<hi rend="i">transformation</hi>," he called it, &mdash; had led him
            to summon to court two of Hamlet's boyhood companions, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. At

          <p>Feeling the necessity of being constantly on his guard, Hamlet grew suspicious of every
            unusual circumstance, and when he was approached so unexpectedly by these young men, he
            at once surmised that they had been sent for to spy upon him. But it was his habit to be
            kind and courteous, and after contriving to get them <note id="note_087"><ref
                target="ref_087" rend="super">1</ref>since.</note><pb id="VAC1105-270" n="260"/>to
            admit that they had been sent for by the king and queen, with a delicate
            considerateness, he refrained from leading them to betray the confidence of the royal
            pair, by himself telling them the reason why, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>I have of late lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes
              so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a
              sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
              o'er-hanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, &mdash; why, it
              appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors. What a
              piece of work is man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in form and moving
              how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a
              god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this
              quintessence of dust? man delights not me; no, nor woman neither, though by your
              smiling you seem to say so.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>The young men disavowed having any such thought, but told Hamlet that, if he had lost
            all delight in man, they feared that he would not enjoy the entertainment which was
            about to be given to the members of the court, by a company of actors whom they had met
            on the way, and had invited to come thither. Hamlet was fond of the drama, and he
            welcomed the players in true, gentlemanly fashion when they appeared, as they did soon
            after.</p>
          <p>At Hamlet's request, these players rehearsed before him a scene from a favorite play of
            his, in which the leading actor portrayed with powerful pathos the grief of Hecuba,
            queen of Troy, at sight of her husband, King <pb id="VAC1105-271" n="261"/>Priam, hacked
            to death by the sword of a hostile Greek. Hamlet was deeply moved by the recital, and
            the thought occurred to him that, if he could have these players enact a play in which
            there should be a scene corresponding in every detail to the story told by his father's
            ghost concerning the manner of his own death, Claudius might betray his guilt by some
            word or uncontrollable agitation. For Hamlet could not bring himself to proceed against
            his uncle without some other evidence of his guilt than the revelation of a ghost. He
            was too honorable to seek revenge merely on suspicion. But he reflected:&mdash;</p>

          <p>We see from this self-communing how fearful Hamlet was lest his deep melancholy,
            together with his hatred of his uncle, should lead him to commit an act of awful
            injustice. He had already taken Horatio into his confidence, because he knew him to be a
            man of incorruptible honor, and absolutely disinterested in his friendship for himself.
            He now went to Horatio to ask him to watch his uncle during the play, and help him to
            judge whether he was right in his suspicion. He told Horatio:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Hamlet was happy in having such a friend as Horatio, for a prince cannot always find
            one who is perfectly sincere and unselfish. In this talk with Horatio, Hamlet told him

          <p>The name of the play which Hamlet had selected was "The Murther of Gonzago." By
            inserting a few lines, he had made it agree with the account given by the ghost. It was
            presented before the entire court, Hamlet reclining at the feet of Ophelia, from which
            spot he could easily watch the king.</p>
          <p>The play opened with mutual protestations of ardent affection between a king and queen
            who had been married thirty years. The player-king was very poetical, describing their
            happiness thus:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Full thirty times hath Phœbus' cart gone round</l>
              <l>Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbéd ground,</l>
              <l>And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen</l>
              <l>About the world have times twelve thirties been,</l>
              <l>Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands</l>
              <l>Unite commutual in most sacred bands.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The player-queen responded with extravagant vows of constancy in life and in death,
            saying that she could never be induced, under any circumstances, to marry a second time,
            which declaration caused Queen Gertrude to say:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-274" n="264"/>
          <sp>
            <p>The lady protests too much, methinks.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>As the play proceeded, Claudius began to show signs of uneasiness, asking Hamlet if he
            had heard the argument, or plot, of the drama, and if there was anything offensive in
            it. Hamlet replied with deep meaning,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world;</p>
          </sp>
          <p>and as the player poured the poison into the ear of the sleeping player-king, he added
            significantly:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>You shall see anon how the murtherer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>The guilty king could endure the sight no longer, but rose in great excitement, calling
            for lights, and hastily left the apartment, followed by all the spectators except Hamlet
            and Horatio. Thoroughly convinced now of the truth of his suspicion, Hamlet
            exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?</p>

            <p>I did very well note him.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,
            whom the queen had sent to tell Hamlet that she desired to speak with him in her own
            apartment, for she was amazed at his behavior.</p>
          <p>Hamlet had, ere this, discovered that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, while pretending to
            be his friends, were trying to worm his secret from him. He now forced a recorder, or
            flute, into the hand of Guildenstern, <pb id="VAC1105-275" n="265"/>and insisted that he
            should play upon the instrument. When Guildenstern protested that he did not know how to
            play, Hamlet urged:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>I do beseech you.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>

            <p>I know no touch of it, my lord.</p>

          <sp>
            <speaker>H<hi rend="sc">AMLET</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>'Tis as easy as lying; govern these ventages with your finger and thumb, give it
              breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are
              the stops.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>G<hi rend="sc">UILDENSTERN</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Then Hamlet burst out in righteous indignation:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you
              would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would
              sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music,
              excellent voice in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. Do you think I am
              easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can
              fret me, you cannot play upon me.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>At this moment Polonius entered to tell Hamlet that his mother desired to speak with
            him immediately. Hamlet knew that he could play upon Polonius, who still believed him
            insane. So he questioned the lord chamberlain:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Hamlet felt that he must be alone a few minutes in order that he might nerve himself
            for the painful interview with his mother. He was resolved to compel her to see her
            wrong, which, so far, she seemed to be unable to do, and he felt that he must set a
            guard upon himself, lest he should be tempted to use violence. So he charged
            himself:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Looking upon the dramatic imitation of his own guilty deed had a two-fold effect upon
            the king. It showed him that Hamlet suspected him, and that determined him to get Hamlet
            out of the country as quickly as possible. He summoned Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and
            told them:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The sight had also aroused his conscience to remorse. Alone, in his own chamber, he
            tried to pray, but he knew that he could not make a sincere prayer, as long as he
            continued to live falsely. He realized that, to obtain forgiveness of Heaven, he must
            confess openly, and give up the fruits of his crime. In agony of spirit, he
            moaned:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Falling upon his knees, Claudius endeavored to frame a petition, but he was honest
            enough to acknowledge that words without heart-repentance are vain, so he arose,

          <p>After charging his mother not to reveal what he had said to her, and telling her that
            he knew that the king had made arrangements to send him to England, Hamlet expressed his
            sorrow for the unintentional killing of Polonius, saying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>When the queen told Claudius of Hamlet's rash act, he was almost beside himself with
            fear and perplexity. He feared for the result to himself when the death of Polonius
            should become known; but he did not dare to accuse Hamlet openly, both because he felt
            that that might mean danger to himself, and because, as he told Rosencrantz and
            Guildenstern:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weighed,</l>
              <l>But never the offence.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>But he told Hamlet with a pretence of kindness,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,&mdash;</l>

              <l>With fiery quickness; therefore prepare thyself.</l>

              <l>The associates tend,<ref id="ref_096" target="note_096" rend="super">1</ref> and

              <l>For England.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Knowing how his uncle feared and hated him, Hamlet suspected treachery; and opportunity
            offering while Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, whom Claudius had commissioned to guard
            him, were asleep, he broke the seal of their commission, and read therein the
            confirmation of his suspicions. His false uncle charged the king of England, if he
            desired to keep the peace between Denmark and England unbroken, to have Hamlet put to
            death immediately upon his landing in England. England had suffered greatly from the
            Danish sword, <note id="note_096"><ref target="ref_096" rend="super"
              >1</ref>wait.</note><pb id="VAC1105-283" n="273"/>and Claudius felt certain of
            compliance with his demands.</p>
          <p>Hamlet did not replace this commission, but substituted another written by himself, in
            which he put the names of his treacherous companions where his own had been, and charged
            the king of England:&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</l>
            <l>Without debatement further, more or less,</l>
            <l>He should the bearers put to sudden death.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Thus we see that, by not obeying the command of the ghost and of his own conscience, to
            punish the wicked deed of Claudius, Hamlet had allowed himself to become entangled in a
            net of villany.</p>
          <p>In those old days, sea-voyaging was a dangerous business on account of pirate vessels
            that infested the seas. It was the fortune of the ship in which Hamlet sailed to fall in
            with such a craft, and the prince was taken prisoner and held for ransom. As soon as he
            landed in Denmark, Hamlet wrote to Horatio, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <p>Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase.
            Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valor; in the grapple I
            boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their
            prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I
            am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair
            thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine
            ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.
            Rosencrantz and <pb id="VAC1105-284" n="274"/>Guildenstern hold their course for
            England; of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. He that thou knowest thine, H<hi

          <p>When Hamlet's letter announcing his unexpected return was put into the hand of the king
            he was in the midst of a stormy interview with Laertes, son of Polonius, who had
            returned in hot haste from France to avenge the murder of his father. Claudius had taken
            counsel of his fears rather than his judgment, and had had Polonius buried without any
            of the ceremonial rites which were properly due to a high public official. This strange
            procedure increased the popular dislike and distrust of the king, and caused Laertes to
            hold Claudius responsible for his father's death. The people were also greatly excited
            over the sudden sending away of Hamlet, and when Laertes arrived, they broke out into
            open revolt, crying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-1">Choose we; Laertes shall be king!</l>
              <l>Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>They followed Laertes even to the door of the king's apartment.</p>
          <p>Claudius, knowing that he could prove that he was not the murderer of Polonius, met the
            wrathful Laertes with calm dignity. He quieted the fears of Gertrude by telling
            her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>There's such divinity doth hedge a king</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then he told Laertes that it was Hamlet, not himself, whom he must hold guilty of his
            father's murder, and he <pb id="VAC1105-285" n="275"/>declared that Hamlet had sought to
            take his life also. Laertes, who could not understand why Claudius had not proceeded
            openly against Hamlet, asked:&mdash;</p>

          <p>When, therefore, Claudius read Hamlet's letter announcing his return to Denmark, he
            resolved to strike at Hamlet through Laertes. So he proposed to Laertes that he should
            challenge Hamlet to engage in a fencing match with him in the presence of the entire
            court. Under the guise of simple sport, however, the wicked king concealed a deadly
            purpose. He asked Laertes:&mdash;</p>

          <p>In thus praising Hamlet's generosity and honor, Claudius made his own villany seem
            darker by contrast. Laertes permitted himself to be drawn into the king's wicked plot,
            and even added to it by a piece of villany of his own, thus becoming a murderer instead
            of an avenger.</p>
          <p>He told Claudius that he would dip the point of the sword which he would use in a
            deadly poison, so that the least scratch would produce death. To make the murder trebly
            sure, the king said that he would have a poisoned cup of wine ready to offer Hamlet
            when, as was customary, he should drink to refresh himself during a pause in the
            fencing. And to make the match <note id="note_098"><ref target="ref_098" rend="super"

              id="VAC1105-287" n="277"/>seem like ordinary sport, Claudius proposed to wager six
            Barbary horses on Hamlet's success.</p>
          <p>This plotting was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Queen Gertrude, who brought the
            sad intelligence that Ophelia was drowned. The shock of her father's death, and that by
            the hand of Hamlet whom she still loved, but whose mysterious actions had grieved her
            sorely, had completely unbalanced her reason. On this day she had wandered through the
            grounds, until she came to an old willow, whose boughs she attempted to deck with
            flowers. The queen told Laertes:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples:</l>
              <l>There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds</l>
              <l>Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke,</l>
              <l>When down her weedy trophies and herself</l>
              <l>Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,</l>
              <l>And, mermaid-like, a while they bore her up;</l>
              <l>Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes,</l>
              <l>As one incapable of her own distress,</l>
              <l>Or like a creature native and indued</l>
              <l>Unto that element: but long it could not be</l>
              <l>Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,</l>

          <p>Hamlet returned to court on the very day of Ophelia's burial, and he happened to be
            passing through the churchyard when the funeral procession entered the grounds. Imagine
            his grief and consternation when he <pb id="VAC1105-288" n="278"/>heard the queen say,
            as she strewed flowers upon the open grave:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Laertes commanded:&mdash;</p>

          <p>On hearing the outcries of Laertes, Hamlet forgot everything but his own love for

              <l>I loved Ophelia; forty thousand brothers</l>
              <l>Could not, with all their quantity of love,</l>

          <p>The two were parted with difficulty. As they left the ground, the king found an
            opportunity to whisper in the ear of Laertes, begging him to urge forward the encounter
            with Hamlet which they had planned.</p>
          <p>When the king's messenger brought Hamlet the challenge, with the king's request that he
            would consent to fence with Laertes, he agreed to do so, although he felt some
            misgiving. To Horatio, who urged him to recall his consent, Hamlet said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>We defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
              'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will
              come: the readiness is all.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Hamlet's sincerity impelled him to confess to Laertes how deeply he grieved for the
            unintentional wrong he had done in killing Polonius. So, in presence of the court, which
            had assembled to witness the fencing match, he took the hand of Laertes,
            saying:&mdash;</p>

              <l>And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,</l>
              <l>Then Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.</l>

          <p>In spite of his professions of friendliness, Laertes chose the weapon with the
            uncovered point, which had been dipped in the poison. At the end of the second round,
            the king offered Hamlet the poisoned cup, but he refused it. Then, before Claudius could
            prevent <pb id="VAC1105-291" n="281"/>her, Queen Gertrude drank the wine which had been
            intended for her son.</p>
          <p>In the third round, Laertes made the fatal thrust, but Hamlet wounded him in turn with
            the same weapon, which, in the scuffle, he had wrenched from Laertes' hand. The next
            moment the queen fell, calling out that she was poisoned. Laertes now, when it was too
            late, repented of his own treachery, and confessed to Hamlet:&mdash;</p>

          <p>With these words, Hamlet stabbed the royal villain, thus avenging all the wrongs done

          <p>A<hi rend="sc">MONG</hi> the early kings of Scotland was Duncan, a man so gentle and
            unwarlike that he was hardly fitted to reign in an age when wars were frequent, and when
            the kings were expected to lead their armies in battle. King Duncan had a cousin named
            Macbeth, who possessed all the valor and skill in generalship that were lacking in
            Duncan. So when a rebellion broke out in the country, Macbeth, together with Banquo,
            another able general, led the king's forces against the rebels. In a very short time,
            Macbeth had slain the leader of the rebellious troops, and, in the bloody fashion of
            those times, had cut off his head and fastened it upon the battlements of a castle.</p>
          <p>No sooner had this victory been gained, however, than a second traitor, the Thane of
            Cawdor, assisted by the king of Norway, attacked Macbeth and Banquo. In the battle which
            followed, the Scottish generals were again victorious, and the Norwegian king asked for
            terms of peace. His request was granted, but Duncan ordered that the Thane of Cawdor
            should be put to death, and that his title should be given to the valorous Macbeth,
            saying:&mdash;</p>

            startled him. He was ambitious, and very likely he felt that his strength and valor made
            him more fit to rule than his unwarlike cousin, and the witch's words awoke strange
            thoughts in his breast. While he was meditating upon this, Banquo, who wanted the weird
              <pb id="VAC1105-297" n="287"/>sisters to prophesy some good fortune for him also, said
            to them:&mdash;</p>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In response to this request, the sisters told Banquo that, although he should not
            become king himself, he should be the father of kings.</p>
          <p>As the two generals continued their journey, they were met by the messenger whom Duncan
            had sent to inform Macbeth that he had made him Thane of Cawdor. This speedy
            confirmation of his own hopes and of the witches' predictions so excited Macbeth that he
            forgot everything but his own ambition to become king, and he fell into a fit of
            abstraction, saying to himself:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Banquo recalls Macbeth to a realization of the presence of others, and they proceed,
            after agreeing to talk over what has happened at another time.</p>
          <p>In those early times, a king was not always succeeded by his son. Sometimes the king
            himself named his own successor; sometimes the great lords chose the new ruler. It was
            natural for Macbeth to think that, if he showed his fitness to rule by conquering the
            enemies of the nation, either Duncan himself, or the lords, would choose him as the next
            king. But after he arrived at court, and had received the thanks of Duncan for the great
            service he had done the state in his successful conduct of the war, he was bitterly
            disappointed in his hopes by hearing the king, in the presence of all the nobles,
            declare that his oldest son, Malcolm, should be his successor on the throne of
            Scotland.</p>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>This unexpected announcement gave Macbeth such a shock that he said to himself in an

          <pb id="VAC1105-299" n="289"/>

          <p>After his meeting with the witches, Macbeth had written a letter to his wife
            acquainting her with what they had prophesied, and closing with these words:&mdash;</p>
          <p rend="i">This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
            that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is
            promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.</p>
          <p>Now Lady Macbeth was also very ambitious, and she longed to see her husband on the
            throne of Scotland: but she knew him better than he knew himself; she knew that he had
            no conscientious scruples against using any means to accomplish his end, but that he
            feared the consequences of detection. She herself was very resolute, and she determined
            to quench all tender womanly impulses, and to call up an iron resolution in support of
            her husband's ambition.</p>
          <p>While she was still meditating upon her resolve, a messenger arrived, who told her that
            King Duncan and his train were coming to spend the night at Macbeth's castle. He was
            followed almost immediately by Macbeth himself, who confirmed the report of Duncan's
            coming. At once, in the minds of both, guilty thoughts arose &mdash; thoughts which they
            hardly dared to breathe <pb id="VAC1105-300" n="290"/>even to each other. But they
            greeted the king with smiles and words of welcome, and he, having no suspicion of any
            evil intended toward himself, admired the beauty of the castle and the surrounding
            country, and said of Macbeth:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">&mdash;we love him highly,</l>
              <l>And shall continue our graces towards him.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The ungrateful Macbeth, however, left the kings presence, and fell to musing upon
            Duncan's goodness and his own evil desire. He tried, in vain, to think of some act of
            cruelty on the part of Duncan. The fact that the king was his guest made the crime which
            he was meditating seem still greater; but he refused to obey the voice of his conscience
            which told him:&mdash;</p>

          <p>It may be that Macbeth would have given up his wicked purpose, if Lady Macbeth had not

          <p>Thereupon, Lady Macbeth unfolded her plan, which was to wait until Duncan should be
            asleep, and then to make his attendants drunk, so that, while the king was unguarded,
            they could do their will upon him; and by smearing the drunken officers with blood, they
            could make these men appear to be the murderers.</p>
          <p>Thus urged on by his wife, Macbeth resolved to carry out his guilty purpose. Night
            came, and when <pb id="VAC1105-302" n="292"/>all the inmates of the castle were
            sleeping, Lady Macbeth stole into Duncan's chamber and laid the daggers ready for
            Macbeth's hand. She would have murdered the king herself, had he not looked so much like
            her father in his sleep that even her hard heart failed her. She was to ring a bell when
            all was ready, and while Macbeth waited for the signal, he seemed to see a vision of his
            coming deed. So horrified was he that he spoke:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The moment the deed was done, Macbeth was overwhelmed with the horror of his guilt, and

            and listening, he heard a prayer recited. When the speaker said "God bless us," he
            longed to say "Amen," but the word stuck in his throat. His wild manner in recounting

          <p>While the two guilty ones were trying to rid themselves of the marks of their murderous
            deed, morning had come, but not daylight. For a fearful storm which had made the night
            unruly, blowing down chimneys and screaming, as it were, in the gale, still kept the
            sun's <pb id="VAC1105-305" n="295"/>rays hid. By the clock 'twas day, but the darkness
            of night still shrouded the earth.</p>
          <p>The knocking which had disturbed the guilty pair announced the arrival of Lennox and
            Macduff, two powerful nobles who had come to the castle by appointment with the king.
            Macduff sought Duncan in his chamber, but immediately returned to report his awful
            discovery.</p>

          <p>Macbeth and Lennox hasten to the chamber, where Macbeth, in counterfeited wrath, slays
            the grooms in order to divert suspicion from himself. The alarum bell is rung to rouse
            the other inmates of the castle. With horror-stricken faces the nobles present consult
            as to how the murder of Duncan can be avenged. The two sons of Duncan, Malcolm and
            Donalbain, alarmed for their own safety, flee from the country. Malcolm feels that there
            must be treachery somewhere, and says to his brother:&mdash;</p>

          <p>From this conversation it is easy to see that the sons of the murdered king suspected
            who had committed the murder. Macbeth, on his part, took advantage of their flight to
            throw suspicion on them. As there was no one nearer in blood, and as Macbeth was
            generally regarded as the protector of Scotland, he was crowned king. Thus was the
            prophecy of the witches concerning Macbeth fulfilled. Since Banquo alone knew of the
            secret meeting with the weird sisters, is it any wonder that he should begin to query
            with himself as to whether their prediction might not be accomplished in his own case
            also? After Macbeth's coronation he thus communed with himself:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,</l>
              <l>As the weird sisters promised, and, I fear,</l>
              <l>Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said</l>
              <l>It should not stand in thy posterity,</l>
              <l>But that myself should be the root and father</l>
              <l>Of many kings. If there come truth from them&mdash;</l>
              <l>As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine&mdash;</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-307" n="297"/>
              <l>Why, by the verities on thee made good,</l>
              <l>May they not be my oracles as well,</l>
              <l>And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>For a time, Macbeth ruled wisely and sought to promote the good of the kingdom; but his
            guilty conscience kept him in constant fear of detection. He became so suspicious that
            he bribed servants of the great nobles to watch their masters, and to report to him
            anything that indicated dislike or distrust of himself. Knowing what the witches had
            prophesied for Banquo, he was apprehensive lest Banquo should plot against him in order
            to open the way for seating a son of his own upon the throne. In his anxiety, he
            mused:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Our fears in Banquo</l>

              <l>And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,</l>
              <l>He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor</l>
              <l>To act in safety. There is none but he</l>
              <l>Whose being I do fear. He chid the sisters</l>
              <l>When first they put the name of king upon me,</l>
              <l>And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like</l>
              <l>They hailed him father to a line of kings:</l>
              <l>Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,</l>
              <l>And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,</l>
              <l>Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,</l>
              <l>No son of mine succeeding. If't be so,</l>

          <p>Having gained the throne by crime, Macbeth did not hesitate to use further violence to
            make himself, as he thought, secure. In his blindness he believed that:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In order to rid himself of the fear of Banquo, he hired some desperate men to kill him,
            having excited their hatred by falsely representing to them that Banquo had done them an
            injury. After telling them that Banquo was their enemy, he continued:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>So is he mine; and though I could</l>
              <l>With barefaced power sweep him from my sight</l>
              <l>And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,</l>
              <l>For certain friends that are both his and mine,</l>
              <l>Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall,</l>
              <l>Who I myself struck down: and thence it is,</l>
              <l>That I to your assistance do make love,</l>
              <l>Masking the business from the common eye</l>
              <l>For sundry weighty reasons.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then Macbeth gives these hired murderers minute instructions how to proceed. They are
            to attack Banquo and his son after nightfall, as they are coming to the palace to attend
            a banquet which Macbeth is to give to the Scottish nobles.</p>
          <p>Night comes: the guests are assembled, and Lady Macbeth entreats her husband to be gay
            and jovial; to conceal under smiles the trouble with which his spirits are oppressed.
            Macbeth makes a great effort to seem cordial and free from care. He tells his
            guests:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Just as he is about to seat himself at the table, however, he is called out to receive
            the report of the assassins whom he had employed. They have killed Banquo, but his son
            Fleance has escaped under cover of the darkness.</p>

          <p>exclaims Macbeth, whose hope of preventing the fulfilment of the prophecy that sons of
            Banquo shall rule in Scotland, is baffled by the escape of Fleance.</p>
          <p>Macbeth was so unnerved by the disappointing news that, as he moved toward the table,
            he seemed to himself to see the ghost of the murdered Banquo sitting in the chair which
            he was intending to occupy. Overcome with horror, he lost all sense of occasion and
            surroundings, and with wild words, challenged the ghostly visitant:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Conscious that he must have betrayed what he would not that any one should know, he
            tries to apologize:&mdash;</p>

              <l>And all to all.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>As Macbeth uttered the name of Banquo, the ghost of the murdered thane seemed again to
            rise before his horrified gaze; whereupon he cried:&mdash;</p>

            whom he put to death simply because he thought them unfriendly to his rule. So wickedly
            did he oppress the people that one of the lords said of Scotland:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The man whom Macbeth feared and hated before all others was Macduff, for that noble had
            openly avowed his hatred of the tyrant. Finally, Macbeth's fears became so great that he
            resolved to seek the witches once more, to learn from them, if he might, who were his
            most dangerous enemies, and whether the son of Banquo should ever rule in Scotland.</p>
          <p>The night that he chose for this errand was wild and stormy. He found the weird sisters
            dancing around a huge cauldron in which they were brewing evil charms. Into the horrid
            mixture they were throwing everything ugly, such as snakes and lizards and bats, teeth
            of wolves and scales of dragons, the entrails of sea-sharks and tigers, together with
            poisonous herbs; and all moistened with the blood of a baboon. As they danced, they
            sang:&mdash;</p>

            <l>Double, double toil and trouble;</l>
            <l>Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Unawed by the horrid sight and sounds, Macbeth demanded that the weird women should
            show him a vision of the future. Then they poured fresh blood into the boiling mixture,
            and through the steaming vapor Macbeth beheld an armed head rise. To his thought it
            seemed to say:&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;</l>
            <l>Beware the thane of Fife.</l>

              <l>And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;</l>
              <l>That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,</l>
              <l>And sleep in spite of thunder.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Even while Macbeth was defying fate, a third spirit in the form of a child carrying a
            tree in its hand, rose before his startled eyes. The child-king spoke thus:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care</l>
              <l>Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-313" n="303"/>
              <l>Macbeth shall never vanquished be until</l>
              <l>Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill</l>
              <l>Shall come against him.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>But still Macbeth was unsatisfied, for he longed to know whether, as had been foretold,
            the children of Banquo would succeed to the throne of Scotland. For answer to this
            question, a procession of eight shadow kings seemed to file before Macbeth's vision.
            Last of all came the ghost of Banquo, who pointed at the shadows, as if to claim them as
            his, by which sign Macbeth knew that all his crimes had failed to gain the end he
            sought, namely, to seat his own family securely on the throne.</p>
          <p>The effect of these revelations was to cause Macbeth to pursue Macduff with increased
            hatred, and to rule more tyrannically than ever. His great fear was lest the Scottish
            people should revolt against him, and attempt to make Malcolm, the son of Duncan, king.
            It was whispered about among the nobles that&mdash;</p>

              <l rend="ti-2">The son of Duncan</l>

              <l>That the malevolence of fortune nothing</l>
              <l>Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff</l>
              <l>Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid</l>
              <l>To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:</l>

          <p>When the news that Macduff had fled to join Malcolm at the English court came to the
            ears of Macbeth, he resorted to the most awful means of vengeance. Since he could not
            lay hands upon Macduff himself, he had that noble's wife and children all put to death
            in their own castle home. This savage deed raised Macduff's hatred of the tyrant to a
            pitch of fury, and hastened the march of the army that was already preparing to move
            against Macbeth. Macduff longed to meet in battle the murderer of his helpless wife and
            innocent children. He prayed:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Malcolm and Macduff felt that they were instruments of God's justice, appointed to
            punish the wicked king. They set forth upon their march to Scotland believing
            that&mdash;</p>

          <p>In the midst of his preparations for war, Macbeth was called to mourn the loss of his
            broken-hearted wife whose love for him had made her a partner in the great crimes by
            whose means he had gained the crown. For months, remorse had so preyed upon her mind
            that she had lost her reason, and she would walk in her sleep, <pb id="VAC1105-315"

          <p>When, at length, death came to the relief of the frenzied queen, Macbeth was so
            hard-pressed by his enemies that he could give no time to grief. He could only

          <p>There was no time to be lost, however, for the forces of Malcolm and Macduff were
            rapidly approaching the castle of Dunsinane wherein Macbeth had fortified himself. Nor
            could Macbeth count upon the support of the leaders of his own troops, some of whom were
            only waiting until the English soldiers should arrive to go over to the side of their
            country's deliverers. Their abhorrence of Macbeth's tyranny, and their eagerness to

          <p>Although everything seemed to bode defeat to Macbeth, yet he felt that he bore a
            charmed life, for he still relied on the doubtful predictions of the witches. To those
            who sought to alarm him by reports of the great numbers of the enemy, he
            said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:</l>
              <l>Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,</l>
              <l>I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?</l>
              <l>Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know</l>
              <l>All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:</l>
              <l>"Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman</l>
              <l>Shall e'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false thanes,</l>
              <l>And mingle with the English epicures:</l>
              <l>The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear</l>
              <l>Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In spite of his bold speeches, however, Macbeth felt in his secret heart that the
            judgment of God was upon him, and that his was a ruined life. To himself he
            confessed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I have lived long enough: my way of life</l>

              <l>As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,</l>

              <l>Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,</l>
              <l>Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.</l>

          </sp>
          <p>Nevertheless, his valor did not forsake him; he declared:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The approach to the castle of Dunsinane led through Birnam wood, and, in order to make
            their numbers seem greater than they really were, Malcolm commanded his soldiers each to
            hew down a bough and carry it before him. The effect of this was to give the advancing
            army the appearance of a moving forest. At sight of this singular spectacle, a sentinel

          <p>I<hi rend="sc">T</hi> happened once upon a time that a poor Bohemian shepherd, while
            engaged in hunting wild animals, found a dear little baby girl lying upon the sea-shore.
            When the astonished shepherd took up the child, he saw that she was dressed in rich
            clothing, and that she wore costly jewels fastened about her neck. In the folds of her
            garments he found also a heavy purse filled with gold, and a paper on which was written,
            "Her name is Perdita," &mdash; meaning the lost one.</p>
          <p>A terrible storm was raging at the time, and the shepherd's son, who came up with his
            father at this moment, reported breathlessly that he had seen a vessel dashed to pieces
            upon the rocks, and that all the crew had drowned before he could do anything to save
            them. One of the ship's passengers had reached the shore, he said, only to be torn in
            pieces by a bear which the hunters were pursuing.</p>

                <pb id="VAC1105-324" n="314"/>here; take up, take up, boy; open't. So, let's see. It
              was told me I should be rich by the fairies. What's within, boy?</p>

            <p>This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so; up with it, keep it close: home, home,
              the next way. We are lucky, boy; and to be so still, requires nothing but secrecy.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>There was an old belief that fairies sometimes left one of their own offspring in
            exchange for a human child that they had stolen. The old shepherd thought that the baby
            Perdita was such a changeling, and that he should be prospered if he should bring her up
            as his own child. The two shepherds, father and son, wisely thought that to do a kind
            deed was a likely way to bring blessings upon themselves; so they tarried long enough to
            bury what was left of the poor gentleman who had been killed by the bear.</p>
          <p>We, who are in the secret, may tell what these simple people could not know, &mdash;
            that the dead gentleman was Antigonus, a Sicilian lord, whose cruel act in exposing the
            innocent babe to the fury of the storm was done by command of the king of Sicily, father
            of the little Perdita.</p>
          <p>It is hard to understand how a father could give such a wicked order, but it came about
            in this wise. Leontes, king of Sicily, and his beautiful queen, Hermione, were living
            happy in the love of their subjects, and rejoicing in the possession of a fine little
            son, Prince Mamillius, who was a boy of great promise.</p>
          <p>In his youth Leontes had become greatly attached to one of his princely mates who had,
            in his manhood, <pb id="VAC1105-325" n="315"/>ascended the throne of Bohemia. In the
            many years since they had been separated the two royal friends had lost none of their
            affection for each other, and had often exchanged gifts in token of their love.</p>
          <p>At length, Polixenes, the Bohemian ruler, came to visit Leontes, and he was entertained
            with a magnificence rare even for a king. So much did Leontes enjoy the society of his
            friend that when, after a stay of nine months at the Sicilian court, Polixenes announced
            his intention of returning to his own country, Leontes entreated him to prolong his
            visit, at least one week more. Polixenes replied:&mdash;</p>

          <p>As he watched the pleasant by-play between Hermione and Polixenes, a sudden jealous
            anger smote the heart of Leontes. Because Polixenes had resisted his entreaties, and had
            consented to prolong his stay at the request of Hermione, Leontes falsely imagined that
            his friend had won the love of Hermione from himself. In a moment, he became so inflamed
            with jealousy that all his love <pb id="VAC1105-328" n="318"/>and friendship were turned
            into hatred. The friendly attention which Hermione bestowed upon Polixenes, because she
            thought that in so doing she was giving her husband pleasure, Leontes, blinded with
            jealousy, misinterpreted as tokens of unlawful love.</p>
          <p>The jealous king even went so far as to communicate his unjust suspicions to Camillo,
            one of his trusted attendant lords. Camillo resented the cruel insinuations against the
            queen's honor, saying:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Nothing that Camillo could say, however, would induce Leontes to put by his evil
            suspicions. During the visit of Polixenes, Camillo had been his cup-bearer at table, and
            now Leontes went so far as to hint that it would please him were Camillo to pour some
            poisonous liquid into the cup when he should next offer it to Polixenes.</p>

          <p>Camillo gave this promise only in order to gain time for devising a plan whereby he
            might save the life of Polixenes. When Leontes left him, he murmured in his distress of
            mind:&mdash;</p>

              <l rend="ti-1">O miserable lady! &mdash; But, for me,</l>
              <l>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner</l>
              <l>Of good Polixenes. &mdash; To do this deed,</l>
              <l>Promotion follows. If I could find example</l>
              <l>Of thousands that had struck anointed kings</l>
              <l>And flourished after, I'd not do it; but since</l>
              <l>Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,</l>
              <l>Let villany itself forswear it. I must</l>

          <p>At this moment, Polixenes enters. He is greatly astonished because Leontes, whom he has
            just met, has <pb id="VAC1105-330" n="320"/>frowned upon him, and refused to answer his
            words of friendly courtesy. He begs Camillo to tell him what can have caused such a

          <p>The good Camillo then unfolded a plan that he had formed, which was that Polixenes
            should steal away secretly that night. His followers should be quietly informed of the
            danger, and should be let out of the city by different gates, of which Camillo himself
            held the keys. To escape the vengeance which Leontes would certainly inflict when he
            should discover that Camillo had thwarted his wicked design, it was necessary for
            Camillo to accompany Polixenes to Bohemia. The grateful Polixenes urged him:&mdash;</p>

              <l>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</l>
              <l>Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! &mdash; Come, Camillo;</l>
              <l>I will respect thee as a father, if</l>

          <p>The flight of Polixenes and Camillo added fuel to the fire of Leontes' jealous rage. He
            chose to regard this sudden departure as a confession of guilt on the part of Polixenes.
            Thereupon he publicly accused Hermione <pb id="VAC1105-332" n="322"/>of unfaithfulness,
            and ordered that she be cast into prison.</p>
          <p>The Sicilian lords, one and all, so trusted and honored the wronged queen that they
            braved the anger of the king by proclaiming their faith in Hermione's purity. Said
            one:&mdash;</p>

          <p>In order to satisfy others, as well as himself, Leontes despatched two lords to the
            shrine of the Grecian Apollo at Delphi, to obtain the judgment of the god concerning the
            guilt or innocence of the queen. During their absence, Hermione remained shut up in
            prison, where, one day, a daughter was born to her.</p>
          <p>This circumstance still further excited the indignation of the Sicilian lords and
            ladies, who were devoted to the sweet queen. One of the court ladies, Paulina, the wife
            of Antigonus, hoping to awaken the pity of the king for his suffering wife, took the
            baby princess in her arms, and forced her way into the presence of Leontes. Paulina was
            so indignant at the cruelty of the king that she lost all fear of his majesty and
            compelled him to listen to her sharp reproaches. She began:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Leontes was so incensed by Paulina's act and words that he threatened to have her

            accomplished her object, Paulina was willing to <pb id="VAC1105-334" n="324"/>withdraw,

          <p>The ship that conveyed Antigonus was, as we know, wrecked upon the shore of Bohemia.
            The act of deserting the baby princess greatly troubled the conscience of Antigonus, but
            he had not sufficient moral courage to dare to disobey his royal master. In leaving the
            child, he thus lamented:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Come, poor babe;</l>

              <l>May walk again; if such thing be, thy mother</l>
              <l>Appeared to me last night, for ne'er was dream</l>
              <l>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</l>
              <l>Sometimes her head on one side, some another; &mdash; in pure white robes,</l>
              <l>Like very sanctity, she did approach</l>
              <l>My cabin where I lay; thrice bowed before me,</l>
              <l>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</l>
              <l>Became two spouts. The fury spent, anon</l>
              <l>Did this break from her: "Good Antigonus,</l>
              <l>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</l>

          <p>As Antigonus hastened away, he was attacked and torn to pieces by a wild beast of the
            forest. Thus was he punished immediately for his cruel deed, but Leontes, whose wicked
            jealousy had caused all this suffering, had to sorrow for many years in bitter reproach
            of conscience.</p>
          <p>When the messengers who had been sent to obtain the judgment of Apollo returned, the
            answer of the oracle was opened in presence of the assembled court, and was read by an
            officer. Its words were:&mdash;</p>
          <p>Hermione is chaste; Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes a jealous
            tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten; and the king shall live without an heir, if
            that which is lost be not found.</p>
          <p>You would think that this plain answer would have convinced Leontes of his error, but
            he stubbornly refused to believe the divine message, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>There is no truth at all in the oracle.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-337" n="327"/>
          <p>Nothing but the bitterest sorrow could restore the mad king to reason. The first blow
            fell when his idolized boy, the little prince Mamillius, died. He was a very sensitive,
            affectionate child, and he had grieved himself sick over his father's cruel treatment of
            his dearly loved mother.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Conceiving the dishonor of his mother,</l>
            <l>He straight declined, drooped, took it deeply,</l>
            <l>Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,</l>
            <l>And downright languished.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The report of the death of the young prince was brought while the court was still
            assembled in the council-chamber where the judgment of the oracle had been read. On
            hearing the sad news, Leontes at once concluded that his son's death was sent in
            vengeance for his rejection of the oracular sentence. He declared:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves</l>
              <l>Do strike at my injustice.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>At this moment, the agonized queen fainted and was carried out in an apparently dying
            condition.</p>
          <p>Then did King Leontes come to himself, and bitterly did he reproach himself for his
            unfounded jealousy, and for his impiety in disbelieving the Delphian oracle. In his
            agony of mind, he made public confession, praying:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Apollo, pardon</l>

              <l>My friend Polixenes; which had been done,</l>
              <l>But that the good mind of Camillo tardied</l>
              <l>My swift command, though I with death and with</l>

          <p>The king's repentance came too late. He could not undo with a word the wrongs of which
            he had been guilty. Even while he was promising himself to atone for his sins, the
            queen's faithful attendant Paulina broke in upon him with the heart-rending

          <p>Sixteen years have passed &mdash; sad years for King Leontes who, in his loneliness,
            has spent the time in mourning over the insane folly which bereft him of wife and
            children.</p>
          <p>And what of the lost babe, &mdash; the little Perdita? She has been brought up
            tenderly, even if poorly, by the kind-hearted shepherd who saved her from a cruel death.
            Yet, although no one suspects her noble birth, every one who sees her feels that she is
            more <pb id="VAC1105-340" n="330"/>refined than other shepherd lasses. She carries
            herself with such grace and gentle dignity that it is said of her:&mdash;</p>

            <lg>
              <l>This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever</l>

              <l>But smacks of something greater than herself,</l>
              <l>Too noble for this place.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>It chanced one day that the young prince Florizel, son of the king of Bohemia, in
            following a pet falcon which had flown into the grounds belonging to the old shepherd,
            saw the beautiful Perdita, and immediately fell in love with her. After that he came
            often, and wooed the pretty maiden in honorable, manly fashion, not deceiving her as to
            his own princely birth, but assuring her that she was, in grace of manner, the equal of
            any princess, and declaring that, when he should be king, he should be proud to
            acknowledge her as his queen.</p>
          <p>The old shepherd did not suspect that Perdita's lover was the king's son, for if he had
            knowingly encouraged a prince to woo his adopted daughter, he would have deserved very
            severe punishment.</p>
          <p>The father of Prince Florizel was the same Polixenes who had so narrowly escaped from
            the jealous rage of Leontes. The lord Camillo, whose warning had saved Polixenes, was
            beginning to pine for his native land, which he had not seen in all these years. But
            Polixenes was unwilling to part with Camillo, and he urged him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now.
              The need I have of thee thine <pb id="VAC1105-341" n="331"/>own goodness hath made;
              better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Of that fatal country, Sicilia,
              prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
              penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most
              precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawest
              thou the Prince Florizel, my son?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>C<hi rend="sc">AMILLO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to
              me unknown; but I have missingly noted, he is of late much retired from court, and is
              less frequent in his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Florizel's frequent absences had excited the suspicions of his father who, by inquiry,
            had found out, as he proceeded to tell Camillo:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>He is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
              very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an
              unspeakable estate.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>It seems that the gold which he had found with Perdita, and which he took to be a gift
            of the fairies, the shepherd had used in buying land and flocks, so that he was far
            richer than his neighbors.</p>
          <p>In sheep-growing countries, it was formerly the custom to celebrate the close of
            sheep-shearing with a general feast for the entire country-side. On these festival
            occasions, the prettiest shepherdess was chosen queen of the festival, and it was her
            duty to welcome the guests.</p>
          <p>The sheep-shearing feast being just at hand, Polixenes and Camillo disguised themselves
            and went with the <pb id="VAC1105-342" n="332"/>country people to the home of the old
            shepherd. Prince Florizel, also disguised, was there before them. When he saw Perdita
            attired as queen of the festival, he told her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>These your unusual weeds to each part of you</l>
              <l>Do give a life; no shepherdess, but Flora</l>
              <l>Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing</l>
              <l>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,</l>
              <l>And you the queen on't.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The old shepherd, seeing that Perdita's modesty prevents her from taking the lead in
            the mirth, chides her, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>

              <l>A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do</l>
              <l>Nothing but that; move still, still so,</l>
              <l>And own no other function. Each your doing,</l>
              <l>So singular in each particular,</l>
              <l>Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,</l>
              <l>That all your acts are queens.</l>
              <l>But come; our dance, I pray:</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-344" n="334"/>
              <l>Your hand, my Perdita; so turtles pair,</l>
              <l>That never mean to part.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>After watching the dancers for a time, Polixenes grew impatient, and said to
            Camillo:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>'Tis time to part them.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Although he was himself charmed with Perdita's beauty and sweet modesty, he was very
            angry because his son had stooped, as he thought, to make love to a low-born maiden. So
            he abruptly made himself known to the company, harshly reproved his son, declared that
            he would have the shepherd hanged as a traitor, and threatened poor Perdita with a cruel
            death, if she should again receive the prince as her lover.</p>
          <p>Even in her distress, Perdita's native dignity and self-respect asserted themselves,
            for, as the wrathful king was departing, she said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>I was not much afeard; for once or twice</l>
              <l>I was about to speak and tell him plainly,</l>
              <l>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court</l>
              <l>Hides not his visage from our cottage, but</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Then she nobly begs the prince:&mdash;</p>

              <l rend="ti-2">Will't please you, sir, begone?</l>
              <l>I told you what would come of this. Beseech you,</l>
              <l>Of your own state take care; this dream of mine,</l>
              <l>Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,</l>
              <l>But milk my ewes and weep.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>But Prince Florizel's love was true, and his belief in Perdita's nobility of nature was
            perfect; therefore he <pb id="VAC1105-345" n="335"/>felt that it would be base in him to
            renounce his love, even at the command of his father. He assured Perdita of his
            willingness to give up his expectation of succeeding to the crown, if need be, for the
            sake of her love.</p>

          <p>Seeing that the prince was determined, Camillo thought that he might aid him and, at
            the same time, further his own plans. So he suggested that the lovers should go to the
            Sicilian court and tell King Leontes that the son of Polixenes had come with his bride
            to visit the friend of his father's boyhood. Camillo also offered to provide everything
            that was needed to enable them to appear before Leontes in a manner befitting Florizel's
            princely rank.</p>
          <p>In thus abetting the flight of the lovers, Camillo was not so disinterested as he might
            seem to be. For, as soon as they were well on their way, the crafty courtier told
            Polixenes of their escape, and whither they were bound. This he did, hoping that his own
            longing to revisit his native land might be gratified, as he felt certain of being asked
            to accompany Polixenes in his pursuit of the fugitives.</p>
          <p>Fair winds speedily conveyed the lovers to the island of Sicily. They were cordially
            welcomed by Leontes, who was eager to atone for his former wicked plot against the life
            of Polixenes by royally entertaining the son of his friend.</p>
          <p>Perdita's rare beauty and sweetness won from Sicilian courtiers extravagant praise,
            they calling her&mdash;</p>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In looking upon the beautiful pair, Leontes was distracted between admiration for their
            nobleness and sad <pb id="VAC1105-347" n="337"/>regret for what he himself had lost.
            Florizel so closely resembled his father as Leontes had known him that he
            exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Florizel's falsehood could not long remain undiscovered; for Polixenes, accompanied by
            Camillo, followed close upon the path of the fleeing lovers. As soon as he landed in
            Sicily, the angry father sent a messenger to tell Leontes:&mdash;</p>

          <p>From the account given by the messenger we learn that the poor old shepherd, who had
            gotten into such sore trouble by pretending to be the father of Perdita, had hidden
            himself in the vessel which had brought the lovers to Sicily. He was now very desirous
            of getting an opportunity to tell the truth concerning his finding the babe, the secret
            of which he had kept for sixteen years. This opportunity was granted by Leontes, who <pb
              id="VAC1105-349" n="339"/>had discovered that Perdita strongly resembled his lost
            queen Hermione. Through all the years of his mourning, the repentant king had cherished
            the hope held out by the oracle that, some day, his lost heir would be found. Therefore
            he was very anxious to hear the shepherd's tale.</p>
          <p>Great was the excitement at the Sicilian court when the story was told. The courtiers
            who did not happen to be present at the time were eager to get all the particulars from
            those who had heard the tale. In the square before the king's palace, where a crowd
            quickly gathered, one gentleman was heard to declare:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>The oracle is fulfilled; the king's daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is
              broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here
              comes the Lady Paulina's steward; he can deliver more. &mdash; How goes it now, sir?
              this news which is called true is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in
              strong suspicion. Has the king found his heir?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>S<hi rend="sc">TEWARD</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>Most true; that which you hear you'll swear you see, there is such unity in the
              proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of
              Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character, the majesty of the
              creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows
              above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the
              king's daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</p>

              joy were now become a loss, cries, "O, thy mother, thy mother!" then asks Bohemia
              forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; now he thanks the old shepherd, which
              stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such

              that all the instruments that aided to expose the child were even then lost when it
              was found. But O, the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina!
              She had one eye declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle
              was fulfilled; she lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing,
              as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of
              losing.</p>

              it acted.</p>

          <p>Only one thing was lacking to make Perdita's happiness complete; she longed for the
            dear mother whose face she had never seen. So when the Lady Paulina told her that she
            had a lifelike statue of Hermione, carved by a famous Italian sculptor, Perdita desired
            to see it immediately. Leontes, who had not yet been shown the statue, accompanied his
            newly found daughter, <pb id="VAC1105-351" n="341"/>and with them came Polixenes and
            Florizel, and the great lords of the Sicilian court.</p>
          <p>As they entered the private chapel where, Paulina told them, the statue was kept,
            Leontes said:&mdash;</p>

          <p>At the first sight of the wonderful image, Leontes, overcome by grief and remorse, was
            unable to speak; but when Paulina asked him if it were not a true likeness of the queen,
            he replied:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</l>
              <l>In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</l>
              <l>As infancy and grace. &mdash; But yet, Paulina,</l>
              <l>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</l>

              <l>As now it coldly stands, when first I wooed her!</l>
              <l>I am ashamed; does not the stone rebuke me</l>

          <p>As Leontes continued to gaze upon the beautiful figure, he was almost persuaded that it
            had life. Seeing his amazement and longing, Paulina told him that she could make the
            statue move. Then, at her command, sweet music sounded, and the statue was seen to be
            descending the steps of the pedestal. In a moment, the bewildered Leontes was clasping
            to his heart the living Hermione, whom the faithful Paulina had kept in concealment all
            these years, awaiting the day when the oracle should be fulfilled in the finding of the
            lost princess.</p>
          <p>And now the gentle Perdita kneels to crave a mother's blessing, saying:&mdash;</p>

          <head rend="center">KING LEAR</head>
          <p>I<hi rend="sc">N</hi> the early days of Britain, a king named Lear ruled the country
            for many years. In his old age, King Lear grew tired of managing the affairs of his
            warlike kingdom, so he decided to shift the charge of government upon his three
            daughters. Goneril, the eldest, was married to the Duke of Albany; the second daughter,
            Regan, was the wife of the Duke of Cornwall. Cordelia, the youngest, was still
            unmarried, but there were several suitors for her hand, and Lear thought that, with the
            third of a kingdom for a dower, a desirable husband could easily be found for her.</p>
          <p>The old king assembled his court, in order that there might be a large number of
            witnesses to his liberality in thus bestowing his lands upon his children while he was
            yet living. The act by which King Lear deprived himself of all authority and made
            himself wholly dependent upon his daughters cannot be regarded as wise, and he certainly
            showed great ignorance of human nature in the course he took. For he thought that the
            daughter who professed her love the most extravagantly had the truest affection for him,
            not seeming to understand that he was really offering a bribe when he asked his children
            to say in public how much they each loved him.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-358" n="348"/>
          <p>Taking in his hand a map of his kingdom, he told the court:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Know that we have divided</l>
              <l>In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent</l>
              <l>To shake all cares and business from our age,</l>
              <l>Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</l>
              <l>Unburthened crawl toward death. &mdash; Our son of Cornwall,&mdash;</l>
              <l>And you, our no less loving son of Albany,</l>
              <l>We have this hour a constant will to publish</l>
              <l>Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife</l>
              <l>May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</l>
              <l>Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,</l>
              <l>Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</l>
              <l>And here are to be answered. &mdash; Tell me, my daughters</l>
              <l>Since now we will divest us both of rule,</l>
              <l>Interest of territory, cares of state,</l>
              <l>Which of you shall we say doth love us most?</l>
              <l>That we our largest bounty may extend</l>
              <l>Where nature doth with merit challenge. &mdash; Goneril,</l>
              <l>Our eldest-born, speak first.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter;</l>
              <l>Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;</l>
              <l>Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;</l>
              <l>No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Lear, who believed that Goneril meant all that she said, was delighted with this
            extreme expression of love, and pointing to the map, he said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,</l>

              <l>We make thee lady. &mdash; What says our second daughter,</l>
              <l>Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall?</l>

              <l>I find she names my very deed of love;</l>
              <l>Only she comes too short: that I profess</l>
              <l>Myself an enemy to all other joys</l>
              <l>Which the most precious square of sense professes,</l>
              <l>And find I am alone felicitate</l>
              <l>In your dear highness' love.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The king was no less pleased with Regan's extravagant words than he had been with her
            sister's, and he told her:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>To thee and thine hereditary ever</l>

              <l>Than that conferred on Goneril.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Lear now turned to his youngest and his favorite daughter, Cordelia, expecting that she
            would go beyond her sisters in expressing her love for him; but Cordelia although she
            loved her father tenderly, was too sincere to imitate her sisters' excessive
            protestations of love. So, when the foolish old king sought to induce her to outdo her
            sisters, by promising her a third much richer than those he had given the others,
            Cordelia replied that she loved him as a true daughter should, but certainly not more
            than she should love her husband, if she should marry. It grieved her to disappoint her
            father, but she must be true to herself. She said:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</l>
              <l>They love you all? Haply when I shall wed,</l>
              <l>That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</l>
              <l>Half my love with him, half my care and duty.</l>
              <l>Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,</l>

          <p>The weak old king was so angered by Cordelia's quiet answers that he was blind to the
            truth that hers was the sincere affection, and that his elder daughters had flattered
            him for the sake of their own advantage. In his rage, he cast Cordelia off, forever, as
            he said, and divided the land which he had intended for her between her two sisters, to
            whom, with their husbands, he gave the rule of the entire kingdom.</p>
          <p>He retained the empty title of king for himself, and in order that he might be suitably
            attended, he declared that he would keep one hundred knights in constant attendance upon
            his person; these knights, together with himself, to be supported by Goneril and Regan.
            He added that he would spend a month in turn at the respective homes of his two elder
            daughters, whom he thus made his hostesses. All this he thus provided:&mdash;</p>

              <l>I do invest you jointly with my power,</l>

          <p>Kent's interference almost maddened the king, and as he still persisted in begging Lear
            to take back what he had just done, and would not be silent, Lear banished <pb
              id="VAC1105-362" n="352"/>the faithful Kent, saying that, if at the end of ten days,
            he was found in the kingdom, he should be put to death. Kent departed from the court
            with these words of farewell:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Fair thee well, king; sith<ref id="ref_115" target="note_115" rend="super">1</ref>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Lear now called upon the two suitors for Cordelia's hand, who were waiting at the
            court, to say whether they were willing to marry a wife who had no dower but truth.</p>
          <p>The Duke of Burgundy declined to marry a portionless princess, but the King of France,
            when appealed to, said that Cordelia was herself a dowry, and that he prized her all the
            more because of her freedom from all falsity; so he espoused her in these
            words:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor,</l>

              <l>Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon;</l>
              <l>Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,</l>
              <l>Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.</l>
              <l>Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy</l>

          <p>It was not long until Lear, a king now only in name, had bitter cause to regret his
            mistaken course. Goneril, with whom he took up his abode for the first month, was very
            impatient with what she chose to consider the disorderly pranks of her father's
            attendant knights, and she sharply reproached Lear for the misconduct of his followers.
            She even went so far as to demand that he should discharge half of his attendants,
            declaring:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Lear, amazed at Goneril's complaints, begs some one to tell him who he is, whereupon
            his court jester answers shrewdly, "Lear's shadow." The old king, who now, perforce,
            sees that there was no truth in Goneril's professions of love for him, sadly laments the
            blindness that led him to cast off the faithful Cordelia; but he bethinks himself that
            he has yet another daughter, and he determines to go to Regan immediately. He
            wails:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Than the sea-monster. &mdash; Ha! is it come to this?</l>

          <p>Lear thinks that, when Regan hears how unkindly Goneril has treated him, she will
            sympathize with him and share his wrath toward her elder sister. So he leaves Goneril
            with the wish that she may suffer as she has made him suffer, and that she may
            learn&mdash;</p>

          <p>When Kent left the court under sentence of banishment, he foresaw what griefs were
            likely to come to Lear through the ingratitude of his daughters; so he decided to
            disguise himself as a common servant, and <pb id="VAC1105-365" n="355"/>remain where he
            could assist his old master in case of need.</p>
          <p>Lear, not suspecting who he was, took Kent into his service, and it was he who, at
            Lear's command, went before to inform Regan of her father's intention of visiting her
            immediately. The wicked Goneril had also sent a messenger, named Oswald, to urge her
            sister to follow her example in requiring their father to reduce the number of his
            attendants.</p>
          <p>Regan was even more cruel than Goneril, and she, with her husband, the Duke of
            Cornwall, hastily left their home, so that when her poor distressed father should
            arrive, he could not find shelter.</p>
          <p>They betook themselves to the castle of one of the great nobles, the Earl of Gloster,
            and there the two messengers, Oswald and Kent, found them. Before either messenger had
            been admitted, however, the two met outside the castle, and Kent, knowing that Oswald
            was secretly trying to injure the king, his master, picked a quarrel with Oswald, and
            was soundly beating him when Cornwall and Regan appeared upon the scene.</p>
          <p>Oswald told his story and demanded that Kent should be punished. Regan cared nothing
            that her father's servant should be unjustly treated, but she was very desirous of
            pleasing her unfilial sister, so Kent was put in the stocks and made to sit there,
            unable to move, all day and all night. There he was found by Lear, who had followed
            Regan and Cornwall, thinking it strange that they should leave home when they knew that
            he was about to visit them. He was still more amazed to <pb id="VAC1105-366" n="356"
            />find that they had dared to put his servant in the stocks. He exclaimed
            indignantly:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Crazed with the sense of his cruel wrongs, Lear now invoked the vengeance of Heaven
            upon the unfilial Goneril; but even while he was cursing her for her ingratitude,
            Goneril approached, she having come to urge her sister to join her in stripping their
            father of all kingly dignities.</p>

          <p>Regan greeted her hard-hearted sister with a show of warm affection, and harshly told
            her father that, if he would dismiss half his train and return with Goneril, he might
            come to her at the end of the month. Lear replied that, rather than submit to such
            conditions, he would beg an asylum with the king of France, who had married the
            dowerless Cordelia.</p>
          <p>When Regan saw that her father was so determined, she not only refused to receive him
            with his hundred knights, but she went even farther than her unfeeling sister had done,
            declaring that, before she would receive him, Lear must still further reduce the number
            of his attendants to twenty-five. Upon this, the poor old father pleaded
            pathetically:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Finding that Regan was even harder upon him than her sister, Lear told Goneril that he
            would go with her. But the selfish, unfilial Goneril wounded him more deeply than ever,

          <p>With this word Lear, followed by the faithful fool and by Kent, who had been released
            from the stocks, rushed out into the night. A heavy storm was rising, but wind and rain
            seemed less cruel to the suffering king than the ingratitude of his heartless daughters.
            The Earl of Gloster sought in vain to awaken their pity for their father, telling
            them:&mdash;</p>

          <p>It was, indeed, a wild night: &mdash; how wild, we learn from these words of
            Kent's:&mdash;</p>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In the course of their wanderings over the heath, they came upon a wretched hovel, in
            which Kent <note id="note_119"><ref target="ref_119" rend="super"
              >1</ref>tumult.</note><pb id="VAC1105-372" n="362"/>persuaded the king to take
            shelter. Upon entering, they found another there before them. It seemed to be some poor
            body who had lost his wits. Lear imagined that nothing but the unkindness of daughters
            could have brought the poor fellow to such a pass. He asked:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou come to this? Couldst thou save
              nothing? Wouldst thou give 'em all?</p>
          </sp>
          <p>In seeing the misery of this "Poor Tom," as he called himself, and in hearing his wild
            words, King Lear's pity was awakened, and in sympathy for the sufferings of another, he
            almost forgot his own &mdash; only for a moment, however. To Lear's grief-crazed brain,
            "Poor Tom" seemed to be a learned judge who was to try his hard-hearted daughters. In
            plaintive tones he complained of their cruel treatment, until, at last, blessed sleep
            came to his relief.</p>
          <p>Although the kind-hearted Earl of Gloster could not prevent the merciless Regan from
            turning her old father out into the storm, he resolved to aid the king secretly. So he
            traced the steps of the party to the miserable hovel, and had them removed to a
            comfortable farm-house on his own estate. But when he once more begged permission to
            relieve the king's necessities, Regan and Cornwall took from him the use of his own
            castle, and charged him "on pain of perpetual displeasure, neither to speak of the king,
            entreat for him, or any way sustain him."</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-373" n="363"/>
          <p>Soon afterward, having learned that the unnatural daughters were even plotting to put
            their father to death, Gloster warned the faithful Kent, who was still caring for his
            suffering master, and together they managed to convey King Lear to the port of Dover,
            which is just across the channel from France, and in Kent's own earldom. This they did
            in order to meet Cordelia, who had heard how wickedly her sisters were abusing their
            father, and was coming with a French army to the aid of the king.</p>
          <p>The Earl of Gloster had a son, named Edmund, who was as disloyal to him as were Lear's
            two elder daughters to their father. Hoping to gain favor for himself, Edmund reported
            to Cornwall and Regan what Gloster had done to assist the king. For this reason, as soon
            as Gloster returned, he was cruelly tortured by order of Cornwall, and was made to
            confess that he had sent Lear to Dover. In reply to Regan's question &mdash; "Wherefore
            to Dover?" &mdash; Gloster said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Because I would not see thy cruel nails</l>

          <p>Whereupon, in order to make his words good, the fiendish Cornwall tore out both
            Gloster's eyes; but he was overtaken by swift punishment, being slain by a faithful
            servant, who attacked him in revenge for his cruel treatment of Gloster.</p>
          <p>The Duke of Albany, husband of Goneril, did not join in the unkind usage of King Lear,
            but yet, when the country was invaded by the French army, he felt it his duty to defend
            his kingdom. After the death of Cornwall, Regan deputed Edmund, the evil-minded son of
            Gloster, to lead her division of the British troops to do battle with the French.</p>
          <p>This made Goneril jealous, for she also was fond of Edmund. The ambitious Edmund tried
            to please both sisters, hoping that, through the favor of one of them, he might himself,
            in time, become ruler of the kingdom.</p>
          <p>When Cordelia read a letter which Kent had sent her to inform her of the wrongs
            inflicted upon her father, she was so deeply moved that:&mdash;</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Once or twice she heaved the name of father</l>
            <l>Pantingly forth, as if it pressed her heart;</l>
            <l>Cried "Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!</l>
            <l>Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?</l>
            <l>Let pity not be believed!" There she shook</l>
            <l>The holy water from her heavenly eyes,</l>
            <l>And, clamor-moistened, then away she started</l>
            <l>To deal with grief alone.</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="VAC1105-375" n="365"/>
          <p>As we already know, France immediately despatched an army into Britain to avenge the
            wrongs done to King Lear. Cordelia could not have consented to invade her native land
            for any other cause; but she said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>

          <p>When Cordelia landed at Dover, and learned that her poor crazed father was wandering
            about, wearing a wreath made of nettles and other weeds of the field, which he had woven
            into something resembling a crown, she offered the physicians all she had if they could
            restore his reason.</p>
          <p>To heal his wounded mind completely was beyond their power, but by the use of calming
            potions, they succeeded in soothing him to quiet sleep. While he was asleep, he was
            clothed in fresh garments, and soft music was played in the hope that it might have
            restoring influence. Cordelia prayed, as she kissed her father:&mdash;</p>

          <p>In the battle that was fought between the French and British forces, the British were
            victorious, and both Lear and Cordelia were taken prisoners. The wicked Edmund, without
            the knowledge of the Duke of Albany, bribed the jailer to put the aged father and his
            faithful daughter to death in the prison.</p>
          <p>But such wickedness as Edmund's could not go unpunished. He was accused of treason by
            the Duke of Albany, and was slain in a hand-to-hand combat with his own brother, who

          <p>S<hi rend="sc">EVERAL</hi> centuries ago, the Republic of Venice was a great power
            among nations. But Venice had many enemies. The Turks were active rivals, and, on one
            pretext or another, they would often attack its island dependencies. Under these
            circumstances, Venice employed many foreign soldiers.</p>
          <p>One of the most distinguished of these foreign mercenaries was a Moorish general, named
            Othello, who, because of his valiant deeds in their service, had become a favorite with
            the Venetian nobles.</p>
          <p>Brabantio, a magnifico of Venice, often invited Othello to be his guest, and encouraged
            the Moor to relate the stories of his exploits. Brabantio's daughter, Desdemona, was an
            interested listener to these stories, it never occurring to her father to fear that his
            daughter, a proud Venetian lady, could stoop to feel any special interest in the
            dark-skinned narrator. Desdemona, however, who since her mother's death had been in
            charge of the household, was so enamored of the grave Othello that she would not
            willingly miss any of his words. As Othello said afterwards,&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Still the house affairs would draw her thence;</l>
              <l>Which ever as she could with haste despatch,</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-382" n="372"/>
              <l>She'd come again, and with a greedy ear</l>
              <l>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</l>
              <l>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</l>
              <l>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</l>
              <l>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</l>
              <l>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</l>
              <l>But not intentively.<ref id="ref_122" target="note_122" rend="super">1</ref> I did
                consent,</l>
              <l>And often did beguile her of her tears,</l>
              <l>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</l>
              <l>That my youth suffered. My story being done,</l>
              <l>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</l>
              <l>She swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange,</l>
              <l>'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful;</l>
              <l>She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished</l>
              <l>That heaven had made her such a man.</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">Upon this hint I spake:&mdash;</l>
              <l>She loved me for the dangers I had passed,</l>
              <l>And I loved her that she did pity them.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>All this was done without the knowledge of Brabantio. Desdemona, on her part, knew very
            well that her father would not consent to her marrying the Moor. So she resolved to
            marry without consulting him.</p>
          <p>When Brabantio discovered that his trusted daughter had secretly left home and that she
            was already wedded to Othello, he was beside himself with rage. He believed that the
            Moor must have won Desdemona's love by the use of some magical arts, such as spells or
            charmed drugs, called love-potions, and he went to the duke to entreat him to use the
            law to separate the newly wedded couple.</p>
          <p>It chanced, however, that on that very day, news of <note id="note_122"><ref

            />serious import had reached the government, namely, that a large fleet of Turkish war
            vessels had been seen making straight for Cyprus, an island belonging to Venice. The
            duke, in alarm, had called a night session of the magnificoes, and had summoned Othello
            to appear before them. For all minds turned to the Moor as the only leader able to cope
            successfully with the Turks.</p>
          <p>Just as Brabantio reached the council chamber, the duke was saying to
            Othello:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

          <p>The duke and senators were so shocked by this unexpected answer that they could only

            chose his ensign, Iago, a man in whom he had full confidence.</p>

          <p>In saying farewell, Brabantio warned Othello:&mdash;</p>

          <p>returned the trusting Othello. Then, turning to his ensign, he added:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Honest Iago,</l>
              <l>My Desdemona must I leave to thee;</l>
              <l>I prithee, let thy wife attend on her</l>
              <l>And bring them after in the best advantage.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>From what we have heard we realize that what Iago said of Othello was true:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The Moor is of a free and open nature,</l>
              <l>That thinks men honest that but seem to be so.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>This was proved in the sequel, to the sad cost of the unsuspecting general. For Iago
            was far from being the honest man that Othello thought him. He had an evil, revengeful
            disposition, and, just now, he was very angry because Othello had not given him the
            position of lieutenant under him, but had promoted one Cassio to that office. Therefore
            he began to plot a double revenge, which should involve both Othello and Cassio in its
            snare. But he masked his wicked purpose in smiles and a pretence of ardent devotion to
            Othello and his bride.</p>
          <p>While on their way to Cyprus, the ships were overtaken by a frightful tempest, which
            separated them, and drove the one which carried Othello so far out of its course <pb
              id="VAC1105-389" n="379"/>that Desdemona, with Iago, arrived first. The storm proved
            the truth of the old saying, however, that "it is an ill wind that blows nobody good,"
            for it wrecked a large part of the Turkish fleet, and effectually prevented the attack
            upon Cyprus. When Desdemona landed, Cassio, whose vessel first reached the port,
            welcomed her joyfully, saying to the gentlemen who belonged to the garrison:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Even while they were talking, a sail was descried making for the harbor, and the hope
            that it might belong to the ship that carried her husband made Desdemona happy, and
            ready to lavish her smiles upon the company. Her lively sallies of wit and Cassio's
            gallant replies angered the evil heart of Iago, and he said to himself as he watched the
            innocent gayety of the unsuspecting pair:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Ay, smile upon her, do; ay, whisper; with as little a web as this will I ensnare as
              great a fly as Cassio. If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenancy, it
              had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft.</p>

          <pb id="VAC1105-390" n="380"/>
          <p>Othello's fears for Desdemona's safety were lost in joy to find her awaiting his

          <p>Iago's hatred grew still more bitter at sight of this loving meeting, and with

          <p>Among the Venetians who had been suitors for the hand of Desdemona was one whose
            disappointment at <pb id="VAC1105-391" n="381"/>her marrying Othello was so great that
            he allowed himself to be persuaded by Iago to enter into the plot against Desdemona's
            happiness in her husband. This man, Roderigo by name, had followed them to Cyprus. He
            was no match for the cunning Iago; so he became merely a tool in the hands of the
            greater villain.</p>
          <p>As the first step in this mischief-making, Iago falsely represented to Roderigo that
            Desdemona was beginning to weary of her husband, who was so much older than herself, and
            that she was now in love with the gallant young lieutenant, Cassio. Iago asserted of
            Cassio:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>He is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green
              minds look after, and the woman hath found him already.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>R<hi rend="sc">ODERIGO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>I cannot believe that in her; she's full of most blessed condition.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>I<hi rend="sc">AGO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>Blessed fig's end! if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the Moor.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Iago went on to unfold his plan, whereby he proposed to embroil Roderigo with Cassio.
            The lieutenant was to have charge of the watch that night, and Iago desired Roderigo to
            find some occasion to anger Cassio who, he said, was easily irritated. Iago's hope was
            that Cassio would strike Roderigo, and that his violence would stir up the soldiers
            against him. He thought that he could make capital out of their indignation so as to
            cause the removal of Cassio, and that Othello would then appoint him to the vacant
            place. That Iago was a cold, calculating villain appears plainly in these words, which
            he said to himself after Roderigo had left him:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-392" n="382"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;</l>
              <l>That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.<ref id="ref_126"
                  target="note_126" rend="super">1</ref></l>
              <l>The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,</l>
              <l>Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,</l>
              <l>And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona</l>
              <l>A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;</l>
              <l>And nothing can or shall content my soul</l>
              <l>Till that I put the Moor into a jealousy so strong</l>
              <l>That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,</l>
              <l>I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,</l>
              <l>Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb&mdash;</l>
              <l>Make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me,</l>
              <l>For making him egregiously an ass,</l>
              <l>And practising upon his peace and quiet</l>
              <l>Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused;</l>
              <l>Knavery's plain face is never seen till used.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>When Iago incited Roderigo to insult Cassio and so provoke the lieutenant to anger, he
            knew that there would be a good opportunity for carrying out his plan, because Othello
            had had proclamation made to the garrison and the inhabitants of the island, that they
            should celebrate their escape from threatened invasion by the destruction of the Turkish
            fleet. The herald cried:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general, that, upon certain tidings
              now arrived, importing the mere perdition<ref id="ref_127" target="note_127"

          </sp>
          <p>That Othello both taught and practised self-control it evident from the directions that
            he gave Michael Cassio, whom he had appointed to take charge of the festivities. To
            Cassio he said:&mdash;</p>

          <p>To make things turn out as he desired, Iago set himself to getting the watchmen drunk.
            He began by proposing to Cassio that they should, with some Cyprus officers, drink to
            the health of "black Othello." Cassio, who knew his own weakness, replied&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

            fiend-like, was pleased to consider his good success, saying of Cassio:&mdash;</p>

              <l>He'll be as full of quarrel and offence</l>
              <l>As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,</l>
              <l>Whom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,</l>

                he's to watch.</l>
              <l>Three lads of Cyprus, &mdash; noble swelling spirits,</l>
              <l>Have I to-night flusteréd with flowing cups,</l>
              <l>And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,</l>
              <l>Am I to put our Cassio in some action</l>
              <l>That may offend the isle.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>In pursuance of his devilish purpose the honest (?) ancient called for wine and began
            to sing a carousal song:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg rend="i">
              <l>And let me the canakin clink, clink!</l>

              <l>Why, then let a soldier drink!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The whole party now became hilarious and Cassio forgot all his discretion. Roderigo, at
            a word from Iago, spoke so insultingly to Cassio as to cause the foolish lieutenant to
            strike him. His blow excited others to interfere, and in the general fight that ensued
            some wounds were given. Then Iago, pretending that mutiny had arisen, caused the bells
            of the fort to be rung, in <note id="note_129"><ref target="ref_129" rend="super"
                >1</ref>to the bottom of the tankard or cup.</note><pb id="VAC1105-395" n="385"
            />order that he might bring Othello upon the scene, and cause the lieutenant to be
            publicly disgraced. When Othello appeared, and demanded in his wrath how the mad riot
            had begun, Iago was ready with his lying account. Said Othello:&mdash;</p>

              <l>In night, and on the court and guard of safety!</l>

              <l>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</l>
              <l>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;</l>
              <l>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth</l>
              <l>Shall nothing wrong him. &mdash; Thus it is, general.</l>
              <l>Montano and myself being in speech,</l>
              <l>There comes a fellow crying out for help,</l>
              <l>And Cassio following him with determined sword,</l>
              <l>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</l>
              <l>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause;</l>
              <l>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</l>
              <l>Lest by his clamor &mdash; as it so fell out&mdash;</l>
              <l>The town might fall in fright; he, swift of foot,</l>
              <l>Outran my purpose, and I returned the rather</l>
              <l>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</l>
              <l>And Cassio high in oath, which till to-night</l>
              <l>I ne'er might say before. When I came back&mdash;</l>
              <l>For this was brief &mdash; I found them close together,</l>
              <l>At blow and thrust, even as again they were</l>

              <l>More of this matter cannot I report:</l>

              <l>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</l>
              <l>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-396" n="386"/>
              <l>From him that fled some strange indignity,</l>

          <p>No sooner had Othello withdrawn with the rest of the lookers-on than the hypocritical
            Iago pretended to sympathize with Cassio, who had now come to a realizing sense of his
            dishonorable conduct. Iago queried:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ASSIO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>Ay, past all surgery. I have lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
              myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation, Iago, my reputation!</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>I<hi rend="sc">AGO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more
              sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is oft got without merit, and lost
              without deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such
              a loser. What, man! there are ways to recover the general again. Sue to him again, and
              he's yours.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ASSIO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight,
              so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble?
              swagger? swear? &mdash; O thou invisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be
              known by, let us call thee devil!</p>

            <p>What was he that you followed with your sword? what had he done to you?</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>C<hi rend="sc">ASSIO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>I know not. I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel, but
              nothing wherefore. &mdash; O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths to
              steal away <pb id="VAC1105-397" n="387"/>their brains! that we should with joy,
              pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
          </sp>
          <p>This repentance and lamentation was not what Iago desired. He was, even then, scheming
            to lead Cassio still further into disgrace, and at the same time, to entangle Desdemona
            in Cassio's fall. So he suggested that Cassio should apply to Desdemona to plead for him
            with her lord. This the wily villain did, intending to hint to Othello that Desdemona's
            interceding for the disgraced lieutenant was for her own selfish purpose &mdash; that
            she was herself secretly in love with Cassio.</p>
          <p>Cassio fell into the snare easily, and parted from Iago with the words:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Iago, left alone, exulted fiendishly over the success of his evil plot,
            saying:&mdash;</p>

              <l>As the free elements. How am I then a villain</l>

              <l>I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,&mdash;</l>
              <l>That she repeals<ref id="ref_132" target="note_132" rend="super">1</ref> him for
                her body's lust;</l>
              <l>And by how much she strives to do him good,</l>
              <l>She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</l>
              <l>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</l>
              <l>And out of her own goodness make the net</l>
              <l>That shall enmesh them all.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>The following day, when Desdemona gave audience to Cassio, and promised him that she
            would plead so earnestly for his restoration to the place which he had lost as to give
            her husband no rest, Iago contrived to come near with Othello just as Cassio was taking
            leave of Desdemona. Whereupon he started and uttered an exclamation:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Ha! I like not that!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>just loud enough to catch the ear of Othello. It had exactly the effect that the
            sneaking fellow intended, to arrest the attention of Othello, and excite a sudden
            suspicion in his mind. So when Othello inquired if that was Cassio who had that moment
            left his wife, Iago replied:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,</l>
              <l>That he would steal away so guilty-like,</l>
              <l>Seeing you coming,&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>and the mischief was done. The poison of distrust was lodged in the mind of the
            large-hearted, confiding Moor. And when the false ensign went on to insinuate that <note
              id="note_132"><ref target="ref_132" rend="super">1</ref>recalls.</note><pb
              id="VAC1105-399" n="389"/>it was not to be wondered at that Desdemona, young, ardent,
            and attractive, should tire of her dark-skinned husband, after the romantic light in
            which she had viewed her elderly lover's heroic achievements had paled in the daylight
            of marriage, Othello felt that this was but natural. So, without taking any steps to
            find out the truth for himself, he allowed himself to believe all the false stories that
            Iago now poured into his ear.</p>
          <p>In listening to the artful hints by which Iago undermined Othello's confidence in his
            true wife, one feels the same indignant sympathy as when a noble steed is rendered
            frantic by the stings of some venomous insect. With a pretence of unwillingness to
            suspect any evil of Cassio and Desdemona, Iago yet insinuated the worst. Although

          <p>Othello having told Iago that he would not believe that Desdemona was unfaithful
            without proof, Iago felt that it was necessary for him to offer something that might
            seem like tangible evidence of the lady's guilt. He happened to know that Othello's
            first gift to Desdemona was an heirloom in his family, &mdash; a curiously embroidered
            handkerchief which was reputed to have a magic charm about it. So he commanded his wife,
            Emilia, who was Desdemona's attendant, to steal that handkerchief for him. This Emilia
            contrived to do even though she knew that, because it was her husband's gift,
            Desdemona&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

              <l>To kiss and talk to.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Iago's plan was to drop this handkerchief in Cassio's room, and then to have the fact
            of its being there brought to the ears of Othello. He well knew that this alone would
            seem to the Moor sufficient proof, for Othello was now so wrought upon that he was not
            likely to search out the matter, and besides:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>He soon found an opportunity to pour this fresh lie into Othello's ear, but he had not
            calculated upon the <pb id="VAC1105-402" n="392"/>awfulness of the wronged Moor's wrath.
            It made him fear for his own safety, and caused him to play his villanous part with even
            more artful energy than before. So, when Othello in his pain and rage moaned over
            Desdemona's supposed falseness, and demanded proof of Iago's evil accusations, with the
            cunning of a serpent, Iago stung him into madness. In an agony of doubt and fear,
            Othello exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

              <l>I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh</l>

          <p>Poor Desdemona, innocent at heart, took every opportunity of pleading with her lord in
            behalf of Cassio, and she could not understand the meaning of the harsh words and still
            harsher frowns which her persistent <pb id="VAC1105-404" n="394"/>advocacy of the cause
            of the discharged lieutenant called out. But Othello's dark looks so terrified her that,
            when he asked for the lost handkerchief, she dared not confess the truth. For when the
            Moor, pretending to desire to use it, asked her to lend him the handkerchief which he
            had given her, she faltered:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Through fear of Othello, who seemed so wrathful, yet so serious in his anger, Desdemona
            was betrayed into falsehood; and her ill-timed pleading for Cassio confirmed the evil
            suspicion sown by Iago in the mind of her husband. That plotting villain missed no
            opportunity of fomenting Othello's jealousy. Lie after lie was poured into the ear of
            the Moor, who was so honorable himself that he did not once suspect the honesty of the
            man who seemed all sympathy for him. The mischief reached its climax when Iago contrived
            to let Othello hear a conversation between himself and Cassio, in which Cassio spoke
            lightly of a woman of low character, but which was so distorted by Iago as to cause the
            listening Othello to understand that the woman in question was Desdemona.</p>
          <p>Grief and rage now overmastered the Moor whose love had been so cruelly wronged.
            Believing the worst of Desdemona, he violently reproached her, and even went so far as
            to strike her in the presence of others. And when his pure and loyal wife knelt and
            implored him:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?</l>
              <l>I understand a fury in your words,</l>
              <l>But not the words:&mdash;</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <pb id="VAC1105-406" n="396"/>
          <p>he spurned her with the retort:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.</l>
              <l rend="ti-2">O thou weed,</l>
              <l>Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet</l>
              <l>That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Such agony of suffering was in Othello's voice that Desdemona felt that his unkind
            treatment must be due to some awful misunderstanding, and her own love was so true that
            her heart forgave his harshness. Her only desire was to win back the love of her
            husband, and knowing how Othello trusted Iago, she appealed to him to intercede for her.
            If that false knave's heart had been less than fiendish, it would have melted at her
            cry:&mdash;</p>

          <p>The sight of the misery he had caused, instead of exciting Iago to pity, spurred him on
            to complete the ruin of two loving souls. I suppose that he had gone so far in crime
            that he feared for his own life in the event of discovery of his villany. However that
            might be, he now had recourse to the lovesick Roderigo once more. Messages had just been
            brought from the court of Venice recalling Othello and appointing Cassio governor of
            Cyprus. Iago made Roderigo believe that it would be to his advantage to put Cassio out
            of the way, and the foolish fellow actually allowed himself to be persuaded into making
            an attack upon Cassio after nightfall. Iago stationed Roderigo at a point where he knew
            that Cassio was about to pass, and then, like the coward he was, slunk away, lest his
            part in the matter should be detected. That he realized on what dangerous ground he
            stood appears from these his words, which he spoke in the depths of his own
            heart:&mdash;</p>

          <p>As Othello looked upon the sleeping Desdemona, her chaste beauty almost overcame his
            purpose. In those days, a husband who had been wronged felt it to be his sacred duty to
            avenge his stained honor by inflicting death upon his sinning wife. So intense was
            Othello's gaze that it awakened the sleeper. Alarmed by his wild looks and his stern
            words, &mdash; for Othello bade her pray heaven for forgiveness, &mdash; Desdemona
            entreated to know how she had offended him to whom in her heart she had ever been
            faithful. Then Othello charged her with having loved Cassio wrongfully, and with having
            given him the handkerchief, his bridal gift. When Desdemona stoutly denied the charge,
            and begged him to send for Cassio that he might confirm her truth, Othello warned
            her:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Othello was sure that Desdemona was untrue, and his love was so great that he could not

            lips; so he silenced her pleading with a stifling pressure of the bed-clothes. But even
            while her breath was still warm, he heard cries without and his name called. It was
            Emilia crying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>It seems that Iago's scheme had failed as far as Cassio was concerned, and when he
            found that Cassio had gotten the better of his assailant, Iago stabbed Roderigo himself,
            to prevent his telling the truth about the matter. But his guilty soul could not longer
            escape the vengeance of just Heaven. When Emilia learned that her mistress was dead, and
            heard from Othello why he had taken that sweet life, she was horror-stricken at the
            discovery of her husband's villany. Then she confessed how she had stolen the
            handkerchief by command of Iago, and she denounced his false practices. At that moment,
            officers appeared with the wounded Cassio borne by attendants, and Iago bound as a
            prisoner.</p>
          <p>In searching the pockets of the slain Roderigo, they had found letters which revealed
            Iago's plots against the life of Cassio. Othello, who now realized that he had been
            fatally betrayed into crime by the man whom he had trusted as honor and honesty itself,
            felt that the <pb id="VAC1105-411" n="401"/>only way by which he could make atonement
            for his blindness and murder was by taking his own life.</p>
          <p>His dying wish was that those who heard him would do him justice with the Venetian
            state. He urged them:&mdash;</p>

          <head rend="center">CYMBELINE</head>
          <p>C<hi rend="sc">YMBELINE</hi>, king of Britain, was a harsh, despotic ruler, who would
            punish his subjects on mere suspicion, if he chanced to take a dislike to them. On one
            occasion he suspected a valiant officer, named Belarius, of treason, and sent him into
            banishment, without giving him any opportunity of proving his innocence of the
            crime.</p>
          <p>Belarius was so enraged at this injustice that he persuaded the nurse who had the care
            of the king's two boys, to steal her little charges, and fly with him. Cymbeline was
            unable to get any trace of the fugitives, and he mourned his sons as dead. The
            queen-mother had died before the loss of the princes. One child alone, a dear little
            daughter, named Imogen, remained to cheer her father's heart.</p>
          <p>Twenty years passed. Imogen had grown to be a beautiful young woman, whom everybody
            loved, for she was as good as she was beautiful. She had given her heart to Posthumus, a
            fine young man, who had been her playfellow in childhood, he having been brought up at
            the king's court. His father had lost his life fighting in a war with the Romans, and
            his mother dying also at the birth of her child, Cymbeline had taken the orphan <pb
              id="VAC1105-416" n="406"/>babe, and educated him. Posthumus proved an apt learner, and
            his nobleness of disposition made him a general favorite.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately for the happiness of Posthumus and Imogen, however, Cymbeline permitted
            himself to be ruled entirely by his second wife, a woman of a low nature. This queen had
            set her heart on marrying her son, Cloten, to Imogen, in order that he might be raised
            to the throne; for since the princes had not been found, Imogen was Cymbeline's
            heir.</p>
          <p>The queen won Cymbeline's consent to her plan. Great was her dismay, then, when she
            discovered that Imogen, knowing that her father would refuse consent to her union with
            Posthumus, and feeling that she would rather die than marry Cloten, who was a
            mean-spirited, stupid creature, had secretly espoused her true lover.</p>
          <p>Cymbeline's anger, when the queen reported to him how their plans had been thwarted,
            caused him to banish Posthumus, and to give Imogen as a prisoner into the hands of her
            stepmother. The wily queen pretended to pity the husband who was commanded to leave his
            bride forever, so she permitted him to have a parting interview with Imogen. She told
            Posthumus:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Imogen knew that this was a false pretence, and that the queen would use this meeting
            to excite her father to still worse anger. As the queen moved away, Imogen

          <p>At this moment, the false queen returned, and warned them to hasten their leave-taking,

            knowing that he was, even then, coming that way, she having suggested to him that it
            might be well to do so. Posthumus lingered at the request of Imogen, who
            pleaded:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Now that Posthumus was gone, the queen and Cloten set themselves to wean Imogen's
            affections from her absent lord, and to induce her to look upon Cloten with favor.
            Instead, they succeeded in causing her to loathe the base fellow, and to cling with her
            whole heart to her exiled husband. The petty persecution to which she was subjected
            excited the pity and indignation of the entire court. One of the lords expressed the
            general feeling thus:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">Alas, poor princess,</l>

              <l>A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer</l>

              <l>That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,</l>

          <p>Poor Imogen! though suffering keenly, no assaults <pb id="VAC1105-421" n="411"/>upon
            her constancy could prevail to weaken her devotion to the absent Posthumus.</p>
          <p>He, meanwhile, had arrived in Rome. At the house of his father's friend, Philario, he
            met a number of gay young fellows, who, as the time was, were given to making all sorts
            of wagers, and to provoking causeless quarrels. One of these idle youths, having heard
            Posthumus's story, and his high praises of the beauty and nobleness of Imogen, conceived
            the base notion of seeking to destroy the happiness of both by proving Imogen false to
            her husband. This man, Iachimo, had been so unfortunate as not to have known any true
            woman, and he believed that all women were weak and yielding. So he dared Posthumus, who
            firmly declared his faith in Imogen's honor, to wager the diamond ring that Imogen had
            given him, against ten thousand ducats, that he could win Imogen from her constancy.</p>
          <p>Posthumus foolishly consented to the wager, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>I shall but lend my diamond till your return: let there be covenants drawn between's:
              my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking: I dare you to
              this match: here's my ring.</p>

            <speaker>I<hi rend="sc">ACHIMO</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>If I bring you no sufficient testimony, my ten thousand ducats are yours; so is your
              diamond too: if I come off, and leave her in such honor as you have trust in, she your
              jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are yours.</p>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>P<hi rend="sc">OSTHUMUS</hi>.</speaker>
            <p>I embrace these conditions; let us have articles betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall
              answer: if you give me directly to understand you have prevailed, I am no further your
              enemy: if she remain unseduced, for your ill opinion and <pb id="VAC1105-422" n="412"
              />the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword.</p>

            <p>Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set down by lawful counsel, and
              straight away for Britain: I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>Imogen, ignorant of the evil designs against her honor, mourned her sad fate in being
            thus forcibly separated from her beloved Posthumus, and counted the days until she might
            hope to hear from him. So when Iachimo appeared, bringing a letter from her banished
            lord, she welcomed him kindly but with simple dignity, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I</l>
              <l>Have words to bid you, and shall find it so</l>
              <l>In all that I can do.</l>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Imogen's beauty and her queenly bearing so far exceeded Iachimo's expectations that he
            despaired of accomplishing his evil purpose, but he would not forego the attempt. So he
            began by telling false tales about Posthumus, insinuating that he was engaging in all
            sorts of merry-makings, forgetful of her lonely waiting at home. In reply to Imogen's
            anxious inquiries concerning the health of her lord, Iachimo said:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Although Iachimo had been baffled by Imogen's purity, he was too base to be touched by
            her heavenly constancy. So he plotted still further against her innocence. He was

          <p>Then Iachimo crept out of the trunk in which he had concealed himself. He was entranced
            by the sight of the sleeping loveliness of the fair princess, but no spark of pity moved
            his cold heart. He stole about stealthily, observing every detail of the furnishings of
            the room, that he might the better palm off his lying tale upon Posthumus. He said to
            himself:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Imogen had been reading, and had left the volume open when she fell asleep. Then,
            bending over her, he continued:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Ah, but some natural notes about her body</l>

              <l>O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>So soundly did Imogen sleep that she did not feel his guilty fingers as they took off
            her bracelet, the parting gift of Posthumus, which she wore night and day. Having
            secured it, Iachimo murmured triumphantly:&mdash;</p>

          <p>As if Iachimo's base plotting against her were not enough, Imogen's rest was disturbed
            by the playing of musicians who had been hired by Cloten, in the vain hope of inducing
            her to favor his suit. They sang:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Iachimo made such speed on his return journey to Rome that Posthumus argued rightly
            that he had been unsuccessful in his dishonorable suit. He was ready with his forged
            tale, however, beginning with praise of Imogen's beauty.</p>

          <p>While Iachimo was describing minutely the furnishings and decorations of Imogen's
            chamber, Posthumus listened unbelieving, for he said that Iachimo might have gained that
            information from another person who was familiar with the place; but when the false
            villain showed the bracelet which Posthumus had put on his wife's arm at parting, he
            turned pale and exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Once more let me behold it: is it that</l>
              <l>Which I left with her?</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <sp>
            <speaker>I<hi rend="sc">ACHIMO</hi>.</speaker>
            <lg>
              <l>Sir &mdash; I thank her &mdash; that:</l>
              <l>She stripped it from her arm; I see her yet;</l>
              <l>Her pretty action did outsell her gift,</l>
              <l>And yet enriched it too: she gave it me, and said</l>
              <l>She prized it once.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Even then Posthumus could not believe that Imogen was false. He thought that, perhaps,
            she had sent the bracelet to him; but when Iachimo suggested that, in that case, she
            would have mentioned it in the letter that he had brought, Posthumus lost faith in her
            truth, and railed bitterly against womankind, as he handed Iachimo the ring that he had
            wagered upon his wife's honor, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-429" n="419"/>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>Here, take this too;</l>
              <l>It is a basilisk unto mine eye,</l>
              <l>Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honor</l>
              <l>Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,</l>
              <l>Where there's another man: the vows of women</l>
              <l>Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,</l>
              <l>Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.</l>
              <l>O, above measure, false!</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>When Posthumus went into exile, he left with Imogen one faithful servant, Pisanio by
            name, on whose single-hearted devotion he knew that they could safely rely. The queen
            had sought in vain to bribe Pisanio to influence Imogen in favor of her son's suit. No
            offers of wealth or promotion could induce Pisanio to swerve from his honorable
            allegiance to his master.</p>
          <p>Imagine, then, Pisanio's consternation when he received from Posthumus a letter
            commanding him to take the life of Imogen because, as he said, she had been false to her
            wifely honor. Of the truth of this charge Posthumus wrote that he had sufficient proof,
            but he did not reveal the source of this evil report.</p>
          <p>Pisanio, knowing his mistress to be pure as an angel, felt sure that his master had
            been abused by an enemy. In his distress he moaned:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>O master! what a strange infection</l>

              <l>On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No;</l>
              <l>She's punished for her truth, and undergoes,</l>
              <l>More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-430" n="420"/>
              <l>As would take in some virtue. O my master!</l>
              <l>Thy mind to her is now as low as were</l>
              <l>Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her,</l>
              <l>Upon the love and truth and vows which I</l>
              <l>Have made to thy command? &mdash; I, her? &mdash; her blood?</l>
              <l>If it be so to do good service, never</l>
              <l>Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,</l>
              <l>That I should seem to lack humanity</l>
              <l>So much as this fact comes to?</l>
              <l>Lo, here she comes.</l>
              <l>I am ignorant in what I am commanded.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Pisanio now gave Imogen a letter which Posthumus had sent to her, in which he told her
            that his love could no longer content itself without a sight of her dear face; that he
            had, therefore, risked the danger of being discovered; and that he was, even then, at a
            place called Milford Haven, on the outskirts of Cymbeline's dominions. He ended his
            treacherous letter thus:&mdash;</p>
          <p>What your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness,
            that remains loyal to his vow, and your, increasing in love, <hi rend="right">L<hi

          <p>exclaimed the unsuspecting Imogen, in her eagerness to join the beloved husband, who,
            as she thought, was impatiently awaiting her at Milford Haven. She would not listen to
            any word of fear as to the outcome of the journey, for which she bade Pisanio prepare at
            once, but replied to his entreaty that she would consider the danger:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Not until they reached their destination did the faithful servant give his mistress a
            hint of the woful secret. Then, for reply to Imogen's exclamations of disappointment at
            not finding her husband there, he handed her Posthumus's letter wherein he had
            instructed Pisanio to slay her at Milford Haven. She turned so pale on reading the awful
            missive, that Pisanio thought that she would die of horror at the cruel charge. Utterly
            bewildered, the wronged wife wailed:&mdash;</p>

            in some way, be made known.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-433" n="423"/>
          <p>Just at this time, an ambassador from the Roman emperor, Augustus, was at the court of
            Cymbeline, threatening him with speedy war, unless Britain should pay the tribute which
            had been promised to Rome, and which was long past due. This ambassador, Caius Lucius,
            would come to Milford Haven on his return, and Pisanio suggested that Imogen should don
            a page's suit which he had provided for this emergency, and seek to enter the service of
            the Roman. Pisanio hoped that, if Imogen should go to Italy, she might chance to meet
            her husband, in which case he felt sure that Posthumus would learn that she had always
            been true to him.</p>
          <p>The plan seemed good to the unhappy Imogen, and she quickly transformed herself into
            the guise of a boy. The change of dress was the more necessary as Pisanio was about to
            return to the court, lest he might be suspected of having spirited Imogen away. Before
            starting, however, he gave his mistress a box of cordial which he had received from the
            queen, and which she had told him would cure any distemper.</p>
          <p>For two days Imogen wandered in search of the Roman, but without finding him; and two
            nights the tenderly nurtured princess made the ground her bed. On the third day, faint
            with hunger, she happened upon a cave, wherein, to her great joy, she found plenty of
            food. She was so intent upon satisfying her hunger that she did not hear the approach of
            the owners of the cave, who had been hunting in the forest.</p>
          <p>The elder man discovered Imogen as he was about to <pb id="VAC1105-434" n="424"/>enter,
            and he whispered to his companions, two noble youths:&mdash;</p>

          <p>asked Guiderius, one of the young men. Belarius, the elder man, replied:&mdash;</p>

            constancy. <hi rend="i">Fidele</hi>, she called herself to these new friends. In return
            for their hospitality, Imogen took upon herself the duties of a housewife, for, in the
            old days, princesses were carefully instructed in the arts of home-making. Her skill
            called forth high praise from Belarius, who said:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>When they were ready to hunt again, Imogen excused herself from accompanying her hosts
            on the plea of illness, and when she was left alone she took the drug that Pisanio had
            given her, hoping by this means to find relief from the dreadful heart-sickness that
            oppressed her. The effect of this drug was to induce a death-like trance.</p>
          <p>Arviragus, the younger brother, found Imogen in this condition when he returned, and
            taking the beautiful body in his arms, he bore it into the open air, telling the

          <p>When Imogen's absence became known at court, Cloten, fearing lest she should escape him
            altogether, decided to follow, and find her if possible. This he did in the hope of
            revenging himself upon her who had treated him with contempt, telling him that she
            valued her husband's cast-off clothing more highly than his princely person. He demanded

          <p>Thus adjured, Pisanio showed Cloten Posthumus's letter in which he said that he would
            come to Milford Haven. In doing this, Pisanio felt sure that no harm could come thereby
            either to his master or his mistress, for he supposed that they were both out of England
            then.</p>
          <p>At Cloten's demand, Pisanio brought him a suit of his master's, by means of which
            Cloten intended to lead Imogen to mistake him for her husband. He commanded
            Pisanio:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <p>Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing that I have commanded

              and true preferment shall tender itself to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I
              had wings to follow it! Come, and be true.</p>
          </sp>
          <p>As Pisanio watched the retreating form of Cloten, he said to himself:&mdash;</p>

              <l>Thou bid'st me to thy loss: for true to thee</l>

              <l>And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,</l>
              <l>You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed</l>

          <p>It seems surprising that a prince should trust himself on any expedition without
            attendants; but Cloten was bent upon imposing upon Imogen as her banished husband

            the anxious wife.</p>
          <p>On the very day that Imogen was found in that deathlike trance, Cloten encountered

          <p>In the fight that ensued Guiderius easily overcame the bragging prince. After killing
            him, he, in accordance with the custom of those old crude times, cut off the head of his
            slain enemy.</p>
          <p>When Belarius learned what the rash young man had done, he was greatly alarmed, for he
            realized what vengeance was likely to fall upon one who had killed a member of the royal
            family. Belarius, you will remember, was the name of the king's officer who, when he was
            unjustly accused of treason, had stolen the sons of Cymbeline. They had grown up in the
            mountains, all unaware of their princely birth, and loving Belarius as their father. Now
            that they were grown, however, they showed the noble qualities and <note id="note_143"

            as belonging naturally to princes. Belarius recognized this fact, and he felt that this
            deed of the elder son might have grave consequences. He said to himself:&mdash;</p>

              <l>That by the top doth take the mountain pine,</l>
              <l>And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder</l>
              <l>That an invisible instinct should frame them</l>
              <l>To royalty unlearned, honor untaught,</l>
              <l>Civility not seen from other, valor</l>
              <l>That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop</l>
              <l>As if it had been sowed. Yet still it's strange</l>
              <l>What Cloten's being here to us portends,</l>
              <l>Or what his death will bring us.</l>

          </sp>
          <p>After some time, the effect of the drug passed off, and Imogen slowly awoke to find
            herself lying upon the ground, and covered with flowers. She was bewildered, however,
            and had no clear recollection of what had happened before she had fallen asleep. As she
            rose to her feet, she was horrified to see beside her the headless body of a man dressed
            in the well-known clothes of Posthumus. Almost crazed with grief, she inferred that
            Pisanio had plotted with Cloten to put her husband to death, and to stupefy her with the
            drug. In utter despair, she threw herself upon the body of her supposed lord.</p>
          <pb id="VAC1105-442" n="432"/>
          <p>There she was found by the Roman ambassador, Lucius, and some other officers of the
            Roman army which had just landed in Britain for the purpose of compelling Cymbeline to
            pay the neglected tribute. On seeing the strange spectacle, Lucius exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Thus was Pisanio's advice that Imogen should seek service with the Roman ambassador
            strangely accomplished. But Pisanio himself, no more than other members of the court,
            knew what had happened to Imogen or Cloten.</p>
          <p>The queen, whose plottings had all come to naught, was lying dangerously ill, and the
            weak king, who had so long acted only under the advice of the queen, was perplexed in
            the extreme. Still, he was ready to meet the Romans, saying:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>Pisanio did not dare let any one know the special cause of his anxiety, but he

            <lg>
              <l>I heard no letter from my master since</l>

              <l>What is betid to Cloten; but remain</l>
              <l>Perplexed in all. The heavens still must work.</l>
              <l>Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.</l>
              <l>These present wars shall find I love my country,</l>
              <l>Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.</l>
              <pb id="VAC1105-444" n="434"/>

          <p>When Posthumus received Pisanio's letter containing the false report of Imogen's death,
            the Roman army was about to embark for Britain. Having lost, as he thought, all that
            made life of any worth, he decided to join the Roman troops. But once upon British soil,
            he could not bring himself to fight against his country, so he dressed himself in the
            clothing of a peasant, and quietly entered the ranks of the British. In his distress of
            mind, he even blamed Pisanio for having obeyed his commands too exactly. His love and
            grief forced him to lament:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l rend="ti-2">O Pisanio!</l>
              <l>Every good servant does not all commands:</l>
              <l>No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you</l>
              <l>Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never</l>
              <l>Had lived to put on this: so had you saved</l>
              <l>The noble Imogen to repent, and struck</l>
              <l>Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,</l>
              <l>You snatch some hence for little faults: you some permit</l>
              <l>To second ills with ills, each elder worse,</l>
              <l>And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.</l>
              <l>But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,</l>
              <l>And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither</l>
              <l>Among the Italian gentry, and to fight</l>
              <l>Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough</l>
              <l>That, Britain, I have killed thy mistress; peace!</l>

              <l>Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril</l>

          <p>With the Roman army came also the false Iachimo, whose conscience had given him no rest
            since he had so wickedly betrayed both Imogen and Posthumus. In the battle that
            followed, Iachimo was disarmed by Posthumus, whom he did not recognize in his peasant's
            garb. Iachimo attributed his defeat to his own guilty heart, saying:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>
            <lg>
              <l>The heaviness and guilt within my bosom</l>

              <l>Revengingly enfeebles me.</l>
            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>At one time during the battle, it seemed that the Romans would carry off the palm of
            victory; but just as Cymbeline was seized by the enemy, the brave mountaineers, near
            whose cave the engagement took place, rushed to the rescue of the king, rallied the
            Britons, and saved the day. Lucius was captured, together with his page. Posthumus,
            since he could not find the death he coveted in the battle, gave himself up, hoping
            that, when Cymbeline should discover him, he would suffer the death which had been
            threatened if he should return from exile.</p>

          <p>And now, unknown to one another, were assembled in the presence of the king all the
            persons with whom this story has to do. In accordance with the cruel customs of warfare
            in those days, Lucius expected that death would be his fate. With manly courage he faced
            the British king, saying:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Cymbeline was, though why he could not tell, moved by the winning grace of the page,
            who was, as we know, his daughter in disguise. He not only granted the page his life,
            but said that he would grant any favor that the boy might ask. Lucius expected that the
            page, grateful for his intercession, would ask that his life be spared, but Imogen had
            spied Iachimo among the prisoners, <note id="note_146"><ref target="ref_146"

          <p>Then Iachimo made a clean breast of the whole story of his treachery. When he came to
            tell how he had lied to Posthumus, the wronged husband could restrain himself no longer,
            but proclaimed himself, and confessed that he, deceived by Iachimo's false story, had
            ordered Pisanio to kill his mistress. In his bitter grief and rage, he now called for
            torturers to punish the villain, and again he accused himself as a murderer. He cried
            aloud:&mdash;</p>

          </sp>
          <p>His feelings were so wrought upon that he could not brook the slightest word from any
            one, and when Imogen herself said:&mdash;</p>
          <sp>

            </lg>
          </sp>
          <p>Posthumus struck her down, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

          <p>This was more than Pisanio could bear, and he rushed to the aid of his mistress,
            calling out, as he did so:&mdash;</p>

          <p>Imogen soon revived, and in the joy of being reunited to the wife whom he had so
