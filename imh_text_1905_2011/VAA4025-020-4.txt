            A SURVEY OF EARLY NEWSPAPERS IN THE MIDDLE WESTERN STATES
            George W. Purcell, 
                        Vincennes
                    
            
            A survey of the newspapers of the middle western states from their earliest beginnings would cover a
                    period of the history of the 
                        United States
                     dating back practically to the close of the American Revolution, and to a date
                    paralleling the beginning of the early form of American government in the Northwest Territory when
                    it was promulgated with the adoption of the Ordinance of 1787.
            To cover such a period would be to commence at a time when civilization's light was first
                    breaking through the rugged foothills of the Alleghenies or creeping over the mountainous passes of
                    the Blue Ridges of 
                        Virginia
                    .
            In the space of time allotted merely the faintest kind of a summary of the early history of
                    newspapers in this vast territory can be made. Cursory at best, yet intensely interesting, and
                    vitally connected with the development of the government of this "western
                    territory", the story of the founding of newspapers in these states and territories reads
                    like a novel of heroic characters, and brave men—the torch—bearers of the
                    gospel of liberty to light civilization's path over the prairies and in the fertile valleys
                    of the 
                  Ohio, Mississippi
                and 
                        Missouri
                     rivers.
            The exigencies under which these early papers were established and nurtured bore out the fidelity to
                    purpose which these early pioneers had pledged themselves. The hazards of flat—boating
                    materials, together with the terrors of the trails  from
                    marauding Indians, was none the less as tedious as the actual establishing of these
                    newspapers—whether it was under an elm tree in 
                        Kansas
                    , over a public house when pigs interrupted the serenity of the 
                        Minnesota
                     editor, in a log cabin as in 
                        Kentucky
                    , or in hazardous fire traps of Hoosier clapboard sanctums.
            The Revolution had been successfully closed, George Rogers Clark a few years before had wrested this
                    vast territory of the Northwest from the British, George 
                        Washington
                     was still president, the great 
                        Louisiana
                     territory was still the property of the Louis’ and the rendezvous of the
                    Indian hordes, when John Bradford, a 
                        Virginia
                     planter, was "subsidized" to establish a newspaper in
                            
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               — that portion of the Old Dominion, which was
                    anxious to become a state at the time of the adoption of the constitution.
            
               
                        Lexington
                    , the seat of government of the western 
                        Virginia
                     country at that time was the center of the ambitious colonists who saw great political
                    advantage of having a mouthpiece to express their views on statehood. Consequently in July, 1786,
                    the town voted to give John Bradford, this 
                        Virginia
                     planter, a town lot if he would establish a newspaper. Bradford considered the offer
                    seriously and procured a press and outfit from 
                        Philadelphia
                    . After a long and tedious flat—boat journey, the materials arrived and on
                    April 11, 1787, Bradford issued the first newspaper west of the Allegheny mountains.
            It was called the Kentucke Gazette, the word "Kentucke" carrying
                    the final "e", which was later changed to "y". The subscription
                    price of the Gazette was 18 shillings per annum, and "advertisements of
                    moderate length", 3 shillings.
            The first number was without a headline of any kind, and had only one advertisement, two short
                    original articles and the following apology by the editor: 
                        My customers will excuse this, my first publication, as I am much hurried to get an
                            impression by the time appointed. A great part of the types fell into pi in the carriage of
                            them from Limestone (Mays-ville) to this office and my pardner (his brother Fielder) which
                            is the only assistant I have, through an indisposition of the body has been incapable of
                            rendering the smallest assistance for ten days past.
                    
            
            
            The trip from Limestone to 
                        Lexington
                     was across swollen streams, over fallen trees and through the sniping crack of Indian
                    rifles, for the trail between the two towns had been blazed with human blood.
            The first issues show that Bradford had to carve his capital letters and rude cuts and ornaments out
                    of dog wood. Many editions of the Gazette during that early period were printed on
                    paper manufactured in 
                        Lexington
                    .
            Politics, demanding the separation of 
                        Kentucky
                     from 
                        Virginia
                    , caused the Gazette to be looked forward to as climaxing the efforts
                    of these back-woodsmen to crystallize the sentiment therefor, and post riders arriving in the
                    hamlets and villages would be a signal for the whole population to turn out while school-master or
                    squire would ceremoniously mount a stump to read the Gazette aloud.
            An editorial desk made of a smooth slab supported by a pair of crossed legs, a three legged stool, an
                    ink horn and a rifle composed the furniture of Editor Bradford's first sanctum.
            The Bradford family was connected with the establishment of the first three newspapers in 
                        Kentucky
                    , and it is also interesting to know that printers who gained their inspiration in the
                    profession in Bradford shops, established the first newspapers in Indiana and 
                        Missouri
                    .
            The civilization of the colonies which crept across the 
                        Virginia
                     mountains was scarcely ahead of the civilization which filtered across the Alleghenies
                    to the north, and attracted the adventuresome to go to the vast 
                        Ohio
                     territory.
            With the establishment of the government of the Northwest territory at Marietta, 0., William Maxwell,
                    the second postmaster of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , conceived the idea of establishing a newspaper. This he did and on November 9, 1793,
                        The Centinel of the Northwest Territory appeared, pledged as it was as
                    "Open to all Parties—Influenced by None."
            In 1796 Edward Freeman purchased this paper and changed the name to Freeman's
                        Journal, and in 1800 he moved the plant to 
                  Chillicothe, Ohio
               . Nathaniel
                    Willis is supposed to have started the Scioto Gazette in 1796, but it is known that in 1800 he
                    purchased the Freeman's Journal and if there  were two papers existant at that time, the name Scioto Gazette was
                    given to the consolidated papers. The Scioto Gazette is still in existence and carries its
                    foundation date as April 25, 1800–the oldest newspaper west of the Alleghenies in point
                    of continuous publication.
            Randall & Ryan in their History of 
                            Ohio
                        
                says the Gazette was the third paper established in 
                        Ohio
                    , giving the Western Spy and 
                            Hamilton
                         Gazette, published at 
                        Cincinnati
                     for the first time on May 28, 1799, as the second newspaper of 
                        Ohio
                    .
            Indiana was the third territory, the early civilization of which demanded the establishment of a
                    newspaper. Elihu Stout, a young 
                        Virginia
                     friend of Patrick Henry, gained the incentive to start his newspaper at 
                        Vincennes
                     while working in the office of the Bradfords at 
                  Frankfort, Kentucky
               .
            
               
                        Vincennes
                     was the territorial capital of Indiana and a rival of 
                        Lexington
                     and 
                        Cincinnati
                     in importance as a center of the social, legislative and judicial intelligence in the
                    wilderness.
            With the material assistance of the Bradfords, Stout bought three horses at 
                  Nashville, Tennessee
               , and procured a printing press and the necessary utensils and with
                    his three horses packed his valuable outfit to the Falls of the 
                        Ohio
                    , and flatboated his press and type down the 
                        Ohio
                     and back up the 
                        Wabash
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                    . His supply of paper he carried on horseback overland.
            The first issue of the Indiana Gazette appeared July 31, 1804. Stout continued the
                    Gazette until the spring of 1806 when fire destroyed his plant and he had to go back to 
                        Kentucky
                     for another outfit. Undaunted he came back and on July 4, 1807, resumed the publication
                    of his paper, this time calling it The Western Sun which name continues on the
                    weekly publication of the Sun—the second paper west of the Alleghenies
                    in point of continuous publication.
            While copies of Volume No. 1 of the 
                  
                            Kentucky
                         Gazette and the Centinel of the Northwest Territory are in
                    existence, there is no issue of the Indiana Gazette of Vol. I, No. 1 known to
                    exist. However, two copies of No. 2, issues of August 7, 1804, are extant, one in 
                        Harvard
                     Library and one in the American Antiquarian Society at 
                  Worcester, Massachusetts
               .
            
            As civilization forged its way westward, the water routes furnished the easiest access to the
                    pioneers, and the earlier Hoosier papers were established in river towns along the 
                        Ohio
                    , and many sprang up in the decade, following the Western Sun.
            
            In the western progress it is perhaps strange that there would be a skip in the geographical
                    continuity of territory when it came to the chronological order of founding newspapers but such is
                    true. 
                        Illinois
                     had to give way to 
                        Missouri
                     in this respect.
            Joseph Charless, a printer who had worked with the Brad-fords in 
                        Kentucky
                    , decided not to go into the 
                        Illinois
                     territory, but crossed the 
                        Mississippi
                     river and established 
                        Missouri
                    's first newspaper at 
                        St. Louis
                    , the 
                  
                            Missouri
                         Gazette, July 12, 1808.
            He, too, floated his materials down on a flatboat on the 
                        Ohio
                     and up the 
                        Mississippi
                     rivers. Joseph Hinkle, also a former 
                  Frankfort, Kentucky
               , printer,
                    assisted Charless in his venture. The action of Congress in naming and re-naming 
                        Missouri
                     territory kept Charless busy changing the name of his paper to the 
                        Louisiana
                     Gazette and back again to the 
                  
                            Missouri
                         Gazette in 1812. This paper continued down through the St. Louis
                        Republic, until its purchase in 1919 by the 
                        St. Louis
                    
                    Globe Democrat.
            
            
               
                        Detroit
                    , one of the chain of fortresses which ran from the Lake to the Gulf in those early
                    periods of the midwest history, was the home of 
                        Michigan
                    's first newspaper. 
                        Detroit
                     was under the rule of the Indiana territorial government established in 1800, and its
                    need for a newspaper was perhaps emphasized because of the excessive distance to 
                        Vincennes
                    . When the inhabitants in the southern part of Indiana territory wanted a second grade
                    form of government they petitioned the Governor, William Henry Harrison, for an election. Notice of
                    the election was given and the election held and the votes counted before the news of what was
                    happening got to 
                        Detroit
                    . Thereupon 
                        Detroit
                     citizens protested. The people of that town were a large percentage French, and James
                    Miller, assisted by Father Gabriel, decided to start 
                        Michigan
                    's  first newspaper, which appeared August
                    31, 1809. About one-tenth of the paper was printed in French. This paper continued for only two
                    months. The 
                  
                            Detroit
                         Gazette, the second paper, was started on July 25, 1817, and it continued for
                    13 years.
            
               
                        Illinois
                     territory, however, was closely allied to Indiana territory, especially through the
                    legislative and judicial proximity of 
                        Vincennes
                     on the boundary between the two. Clark had captured the stronghold of 
                        Kaskaskia
                    , and it was here that the first newspaper in 
                        Illinois
                     was established. Matthew Duncan, who acknowledged himself as the "Printer of
                    the Territorial and Publisher of the Laws of the Union," issued the 
                  
                            Illinois
                         Herald for the first time between June 24, 1814, and September 6,
                    1814–two dates given in 
                        Illinois
                     history.
            Duncan sold out soon afterwards and the paper changed its name to the 
                        Illinois
                     Intelligencer. When the seat of government of 
                        Illinois
                     was changed to Vandalia in 1820, the Intelligencer followed the
                    government.
            The 
                  
                            Illinois
                         Immigrant, started at Shawneetown in 1818, was the second newspaper in 
                        Illinois
                    . Five newspapers were established in the southern part of the state in the decade from
                    1814-1824.
            The northward growth of civilization from southern 
                        Illinois
                     was slow and it was not until after two decades had passed that the population which
                    had filtered into 
                        Wisconsin
                     territory saw its need for a newspaper. John V. Suydams and Albert G. Ellis were
                    pioneers in the 
                        Wisconsin
                     field when on December 11, 1833, they started the Green Bay
                    Intelligencer, which after a few numbers was conducted by Ellis alone until June 1, 1835. C. C.
                    P. Arndt was made a partner until June, 1836, and then the paper suspended, until united with the
                        
                  
                            Wisconsin
                         Free Press to form the 
                  
                            Wisconsin
                         Democrat in August, 1836. The Intelligencer was issued only
                    at intervals as Vol. I contains but 36 numbers covering a period from December, 1833, to September,
                    1835.
            It is interesting to note that shortly after the first mail route was established between Green Bay
                    and 
                        Chicago
                    , the Intelligencer announced in poetry and placed this refrain at the
                    head of its news column: 
                    
                        Three times a week, without any fail, At four o'clock we look for the
                            mail Brought with dispatch on an Indian trail.
                    
            
            The Belmont Gazette, the first 
                        Wisconsin
                     paper to be published west of Milwaukee, was started in October, 1836, by James Clarke.
                    At the close of the first session of the 
                  
                            Wisconsin
                         territorial legislature, it was removed to the new seat of government, 
                        Burlington
                     (now in 
                        Iowa
                    ), and there it was continued as the 
                        Wisconsin
                     Territorial Gazette. Its press and type were used in founding the Miner's Free Press at Mineral Point in June, 1837. M. D. Holbrook was the
                    founder, but William S. 
                        Hamilton
                    , a son of Alexander 
                        Hamilton
                    , came into possession of it and in March, 1838, sold it to Galena men and it was
                    continued at Galena as the Galena Democrat.
            
            It is interesting to note that the development of industry in a community has led to the necessity of
                    a newspaper. This was true in 
                        Iowa
                    , when John King, founder of the lead mines around 
                        Dubuque
                    , in 1834, decided to start The 
                            Dubuque
                         Lead Mines, 
                        Iowa
                    's first newspaper, May 11, 1836. June 3, 1837, this title changed to the 
                        Iowa
                     News, and on August 1, 1841, to the Miners’ Express.
            
            On April 19, 1851, appeared the 
                  
                            Dubuque
                         Herald and this publication caused the Miner's
                    Express to come out as 
                        Iowa
                    's first daily—the first daily newspaper north of 
                        St. Louis
                     and west of the 
                        Mississippi
                    .
            The second paper in 
                        Iowa
                     was published at Mt. Rose in 1836 by Dr. Isaac Glalland, who named it the Western Adventurer. In two years he took the plant to Ft. 
                            Madison
                        
                and sold it to James G. Edwards who, in March 24, 1838, converted it into a
                    Whig sheet, the Ft. 
                        Madison
                     Patriot. It was finally moved to 
                        Burlington
                     and is now known as the 
                  
                            Burlington
                         Hawkeye.
            
            August 4, 1838, appeared the 
                  
                            Iowa
                         Sun and Davenport and 
                            Rock Island
                         News, 
                        Iowa
                    's third newspaper.
            
               
                        Minnesota
                     while still a territory saw its first newspaper April 28, 1849, when James M. Goodhue,
                    an eastern newspaperman-lawyer, established The 
                            Minnesota
                         Pioneer. The first issue was delayed ten days in printing because it was
                    discovered after unloading the cargo of materials brought  with
                    them that they had forgotten to bring their chases. A blacksmith saved Goodhue further delay and
                    embarrassment. The paper was to be named "The Epistle of Saint Paul" but as the
                    editor acknowledged, "we found so many little saints in the territory, jealous of 
                        St. Paul
                    , that we determined to call our paper The 
                            Minnesota
                         Pioneer."
            The difficulties under which the Pioneer was issued was described by its editor in
                    a subsequent issue of the paper when he said: 
                        Not that we would find fault with pigs, for it is all owing to their bringing up, but really
                            our equanimity is somewhat ruffled, if our chair is not jostled by the movements of their
                            hard backs under the loose flooring.
                    
            
            Goodhue wielded a vitriolic pen, which led him into personal encounters, and in the last one he was
                    attacked by a Judge Cooper of whom he had written: 
                        He is lost to all sense of decency and self-respect. Off of the bench he is a beast, and on
                            the bench he is an ass, stuffed with arrogance, self-conceit, and a ridiculous affectation
                            of dignity!
                    
            
            Cooper stabbed Goodhue and Goodhue shot Cooper in return. The editor died shortly after the
                    encounter.

                        Nebraska
                     holds the distinction of having the first newspaper published for 
                        Nebraska
                     printed at St. Mary's, 
                        Iowa
                    , nearly opposite to Bellevue. This paper, the 
                  
                            Nebraska
                         Palladium, appeared July 15, 1854. The issue of November 15, 1854, was printed
                    in Bellevue, 
                        Nebraska
                    , and its publication was continued at that place until its suspension with the issue of
                    April 11, 1855. The name Palladium was given it by its editor, Mr. Reed, who had
                    been employed on the 
                  Worcester, Massachusetts
               , Palladium as a printer's devil years
                    before.
            Two months after the first 
                        Nebraska
                     newspaper was published, 
                        Kansas
                    ’ first newspaper was printed under an elm tree on the town site where 
                        Leavenworth
                     now is established. This paper was printed September 15, 1854. There was not a  house to be seen at that time, nor any definite sign of
                    civilization, and its editor challenged the pioneering instinct and proposed to lead instead of
                    follow and to blaze the trail in the Sunflower state. It was called The 
                        Kansas
                     Weekly Herald and lasted for five years. A second paper was founded at Kickapoo and
                    early in 1856 two others started in Lawrence. Founding of newspapers became infectious in 
                        Kansas
                     especially after 
                        Kansas
                     politics began to boil, and the newspaper was the chief outlet of its political
                    partisanship.
            As the dawn of civilization's sun kept moving its horizon westward, it crept next into South
                    Dakota, where the sturdy pioneers into these vast areas demanded a newspaper. The first one to
                    appear was at Sioux Falls July 2, 1859. This paper was destroyed in the Indian uprising of 1862.
                    Samuel J. Allbright was its founder, and he named his paper The Dakota Democrat.
                    The Dakotan established at Yankton June 6, 1861, was South Dakota's
                    second newspaper. It still thrives.
            Not until July 6, 1873, however, did 
                        North Dakota
                     boast of its first newspaper. Col. Clement A. Lounsberry established the Bismarck Tribune on that date. He was a 
                        Minnesota
                     newspaper man and after many hardships brought his equipment over the first train which
                    came through to Bismarck over the Northern Pacific railroad. The Fargo Express was
                    the second 
                        North Dakota
                     newspaper, established January 1, 1874.
            Having reviewed the beginnings of the first newspapers in the middle western states, the paramount
                    interest in this resume is to examine the conditions under which the very oldest papers of this
                    section were published.
            The papers were usually of four pages, with three or four columns to the paper. The 
                            Kentucky
                         Gazette started about the size of a half sheet of letter paper. The Centinel of the Northwest, 
                        Ohio
                    's first paper, was three columns, and the Indiana Gazette
                    was a four column folio. The type was usually of 12-point size, and the column widths varied,
                    usually 15 to 16 ems wide. Headlines were wanting, advertising displays void, and the editors had
                    little or no use with any column rule pieces except the full lengths.
            
            The papers were printed on the old hand-presses, on paper full rag and of durable quality.
                    Hand-rollers were used to distribute the ink, and the finished paper was no more than a proof sheet
                    of the hand-set forms.
            It was necessary to make a salutatory to the generous public by these early pioneer editors, and
                    Editor Maxwell of the Centinel of the Northwest Territory said in part: 
                        The Printer of the Centinel of the Northwestern Territory to the Public—having
                            arrived at 
                                Cincinnati
                             he has applied himself to that which has been the principal object of his
                            removal to this country, the publication of a news-paper.
                        This country is in its infancy, and the inhabitants are daily exposed to an enemy who is not
                            content with taking away the lives of men in the field have swept away whole families, and
                            burnt their habitations. We are well aware that the want of a regular and certain trade down
                            the 
                                Mississippi
                             deprives this country in a great measure of money at the present time. There
                            are discouragements, nevertheless I am led to believe the people of this country are
                            disposed to promote science and have the fullest assurance that the Press from its known
                            utility will receive proper encouragement.
                    
            
            Editor Stout, whose debut in the Hoosier wilderness was made to a circulation of readers consisting
                    mostly of creole French, Indians, a few pure English stock and a straggling number of old Dominion
                    hunters, trappers and traders, gave the following salutatory to that hererogeneous population:
                        
                        TO THE PUBLIC.
                        At length after great trouble and much expense the Public is presented with the first number
                            of the Indiana. Without deviation from the general rule of News-Paper Printers in the first
                            number the Editor addresses the Public, and lays down the principles which shall govern the
                            publication. His object shall be to collect and publish such information as will give a
                            correct account of the productions and natural advantages of the Territory, to give the
                            latest foreign and domestic intelligence—original essays, political, Moral,
                            Literary, Agricultural, and on Domestic Economics. To select such fugitive literary
                            productions as will tend to raise "the genius or mend the heart," etc.,
                            will be the second.
                        The political complection of the paper shall be truly republican; but it never shall be
                            prostituted to party. Essays of any political complection couched in decent language shall
                            find a ready insertion—but the Editor pledges himself that the columns of the
                            Gazette, shall never be tarnished with matter that can offend the eye of decency, or raise a
                            blush upon the cheek of modesty and virtue.
                        
                        With this outline the Indiana Gazette is submitted for patronage, to a generous and
                            enlightened public—and the Editor feels confident of encouragement, equal to his
                            merit—and though it is not always in our power to command success, yet he will
                            ever "endeavor to deserve it."
                    
            
            The policy of the paper announced, the circulation rates always occupied a conspicuous place. The 
                        Kentucky
                     Gazette charged 18 shillings a year, or possibly $2.25. The Indiana Gazette was $2.00 a year if paid in advance but in the event of a
                    delinquency, 50 cents additional was charged.
            No postal zone laws were sources of worry or letters to the editor's congressional friends,
                    as the printers explicitly stipulated in most cases, that "wherever papers are sent by
                    post, the person subscribing must pay the postage." Uncle Sam was running a c. o. d. system
                    then.
            The early papers of the territories were the official papers of their realms—this being
                    the chief source of revenue. The territorial government and the federal government published the
                    laws in the designated official papers and paid space rates for this service. This was the only
                    means of disseminating the laws to the people of the Northwest territory.
            Concerning the advertising and general content of the early newspaper permit me to refer more
                    specifically to research into the files of the Indiana Gazette as an example of
                    the general trend of business and the literary achievements of the early mid-west newspaper.
            The newspaper, however primitive, had to depend on advertising and though we shudder to think of the
                    contracts which the advertising managers, verily the editor himself, could swing with his mercantile
                    clientele of the early days, yet we find that the advertising rates were published each day. There
                    were no sliding scales, no cost plus rates, no display, reader, classified, foreign or domestic
                    rates but the simple: 
                        Advertisements of no more length than breadth inserted three times for one dollar and fifty
                            cents and twenty five cents for each continuance.
                    
            
            The theory of the income increment evidently justified the fourth insertion of advertisements,
                    perhaps not scientifically correct in the cost sheets of today.
            
            Nor was circulation of the early newspapers overlooked. No circulation sharks offered insurance
                    policies, cook books, coaster wagons or kitchen utensils as premiums in those days. There were no
                    inducements, save possibly the concessions, save the economic necessity of some editors to accept
                    merchandise in lieu of cash, and the threat of demanding cash when the editor's larder was
                    low.
            Friends were depended upon for the circulation of the papers. In one of the early files of the Indiana Gazette this request is found: 
                        The respective persons in whose hands subscription paper have been placed for the purpose of
                            procuring subscriptions for the Indiana Gazette will be pleased to forward them to the
                            editor as soon as possible.
                    
            
            No A B C statements were required by any of the advertisers of that day, nor was there any squabble
                    over what constituted a legitimate subscriber.
            The movement of the mails in those early days did not require aeroplanes but as the arteries of mail
                    movements were either over wilderness trails or on the flatboats which plied the streams, the
                    editors were often annoyed by their inefficient schedules.
            Imagine an irate sub walking into the office of an early Indiana newspaper down on the 
                        Ohio
                     river, shaking his cane at the editor and demanding why the paper did not have any more
                    news in it and threatening not to pay for it, nor bring in any more tallow or tobacco, and to have
                    it stopped immediately. To avoid such scenes the editor of this newspaper used discretion by the
                    following apology: 
                        The great dearth of news in this day's paper, is owing to the entire failure of the
                            eastern mail, which was due last Friday. We have received no papers by any mail since last
                            Tuesday week. The waters we believe have not been so high but the eastern mail might have
                            been received if proper exertions had been made by the contractor or carrier. Travelers we
                            are informed crossed them at the time the mail should have done so, which we think will
                            leave the carrier without excuse and he ought in our opinion to suffer the penalty incident
                            to negligence.
                        It is of great importance to the public that the mails should be transported regularly; yet
                            we find that failures are common, and that carriers most generally, we believe, get a
                            certificate from some P. M. on the route, which clears them of a fine. If postmasters would
                            not  give certificates unless they were confident that
                            there was evident danger of losing the mail, there would be fewer failures and the public
                            would be better accommodated for their money.
                    
            
            Thus the circulation department of the paper was rescued from a week of panic and explanations.
            The news departments of these early papers depended largely on the contributors. Aside from the
                    publication of the laws, the exchanges were freely overworked. Local news did not gain much
                    attention. An occasional marriage was recorded, a fire was given a line or two, but for the most
                    part the columns were devoted to what happened down East, or Napoleon's conquests in
                    Europe.
            However, with all the sparseness of local news, nevertheless the contemporaneous history of much of
                    the territory is gleaned from the files of the newspapers of the early days, and the most profound
                    care is taken of these early files in the state archives and repositories today.

                        Kentucky
                     State library has the early files of the 
                  
                            Kentucky
                         Gazette, and just recently, the State University of 
                        Michigan
                     arranged for the loan of these filed and photostatic views were made of them and sent
                    to subscribing state libraries.
            The earliest copies of the Indiana Gazette, two of Volume I No. 2, are in 
                        Harvard
                     library and in the American Antiquarian Society at 
                  Worcester, Massachusetts
               .
                    The Indiana State library has the twenty volumes from 1807-1827 at

                    .
            An incident of passing interest regarding the Western Sun, the successor to the Indiana Gazette, was revived by the National Republican several
                    years ago. In the Lincoln issue of 1921, Albert Reid, had a front page cartoon of Abraham Lincoln
                    standing in front of a 
                        Washington
                     hand-press gazing at the mechanism of a printing outfit for the first time.
            Lincoln, traveling from his old home in 
                        Spencer
                     county, Indiana, passed through 
                        Vincennes
                     to his new home near 
                  Springfield,
                            Illinois
               , in March of 1830. According to
                    the story connected with this incident Lincoln, then a youth of 21 years, spent the greater part of
                    his three days in 
                        Vincennes
                     in the office of the Western Sun. The National
                        Republican printed  the story and gave the title to the
                    cartoon: "First Meeting of the Nineteenth Century's Two Great
                    Emancipators."
            The fiery pens of these early editors were but as exam- ples of the intense partisanship in the
                    political discussions of the early territorial periods of these mid-western states. One example of
                    this is shown from the files of the Indiana Gazette of August 27, 1804. William McIntosh, a friend
                    of Aaron Burr's, took an exception to the official conduct of Benjamin Parke, the first
                    judge of Indiana territory. Parlre resented the insinuations of McIntosh and made the following pro-
                    nouncement in the Gazette concerning McIntosh: 
                        Circumstances have recently occurred which authorize me in pronouncing and publishing William
                            McIntosh an arrant knave, a profligate villiain, a dastardy cheat, a perfidious rascal, an
                            impertinent puppy, an absolute liar and a mean cowardly person.
                    
            
            This was followed by a challenge to an affair of honor, but was subsequently settled in the courts.
            Editor Goodhue of the 
                        Minnesota
                     Pioneer was equally as quick with his pen in describing the departure of a federal
                    agent of questionable repute, when he declared: 
                        He stole into the territory, he stole in the Territory, and then stole out of the
                        Territory.
                    
            
            It is more of passing interest in closing to note the humor cf these early newspapers. There was
                    lacking to be sure, the paragraphs columns, the comic strips or the colored sections, but a distinct
                    portion of the paper was usually set aside for humor and literary effort. It was usually called the
                    "Poetic Asylum" or some equally as high-sounding name. It contained extracts from
                    Goldsmith, a poem by Sir Walter Scott, an essay by Sam Johnson and then, too, some good wholesome
                    humor.
            The subject of the humor of that day was not unlike the hackneyed subjects of today-the Irishman, the
                    fish, the lover and the exaggerating litterati.
            From the Indiana Gazette of October 23, 1804, the follow- ing story was culled: 
                    
                        Strange If True.
                        An old gentleman of venerable appearance passed through this country a few days since, and
                            gave a number of our citizenship the following information:
                        That he was from the neighborhood of the Cayuga Lake, just as he started on his journey, he
                            saw a man, who informed him two men were fishing in the lake, when they beheld at a little
                            distance a monster in the shape of a snake rise out of the lake and stretch himself on the
                            bosom of the water. That his appearance was
                        "Fierce as ten furies, Terrible as hell."
                        That the fishermen with more than ordinary courage ventured near enough to reach him with a
                            rifle ball, and both firing at once fortunately dispatched him. On measurement he was found
                            to be 103 feet 4½ inches in length and his size was proportionately as great.
                            From his head projected a horn of considerable size.
                        Another century-old Hoosier paper had the following:
                        A Yankee Clown.
                        In one of the courts of judicature in 
                                Massachusetts
                             some 18 or 20 years ago, an uncouth fellow of the age of 18, was introduced in
                            the court as a witness for the plaintiff. The defendant arose and objected to his being
                            admitted as a witness, "For," said he, "he does not know enough
                            to understand the nature of an oath. Therefore he ought not be allowed his evidence in this
                            court, and to convince you, gentlemen, that this is the case, I will ask him a few
                            questions. He then turned to the young fellow and said: To which the fellow replied:
                            "I don't know, I 'twas Moses." "His answer,
                            gentlemen, I think is sufficient to convince you that what I have said respecting him is
                            true, without any further evidence." And he sat down. The young fellow by this time
                            began scratching his head, and feeling somewhat chagrined that he should be thus taken off,
                            and begged leave of the court to ask the gentleman, who had just interrogated him a few
                            questions. "Who made you, sir?" To carry on the joke a little farther upon
                            his awkward lad, he replied : "Don't know, 'spose 'twa
                            Aaron." "Well," said the fellow, "We read in the good
                            book, that Aaron made a calf, but I didn't know how the darned fool got
                            here." "Who made you?"
                    
            
            The imagination of the lover of the olden day had nothing to apologize to the jazz Romeos of 1924,
                    for the Ashtabula (
                        Ohio
                    ) Recorder of November 6, 1824, published the following under the title. of: 
                    
                        Superflumbunction.
                        The following is an extract from a very feeling address of a gentleman to a lady-to purchase
                            such an admirer a "world of diamonds would be cheap indeed"—
                        In the exhaustible infinitude of thy beautific perfections suffer thy most passionate adorer
                            one celestial smile on thy nectareous lips. Pardon, him, most enchanting of thy sex, if, in
                            the transporting paroxyism of seraphic admiration, he does one day hope for one electric
                            kiss on those cherubic corals, to lull his soul into a sweet delirium of agonizing ecstacy.
                            most egregiously benignant angel! To affix a value to a small hair of thy translucent head,
                            would be to estimate a world of diamonds, but to delineate thy beauty would be to paint a
                            heaven which we never saw, and to talk a language that we never knew.
                    
            
            Another striking example of the range of the vocabularies of the early newspaper writers is taken
                    from the Indiana Gazette of August 21, 1804: 
                        The following copy was brought by an officer from Tullamore in 
                                Ireland
                             and is offered as genuine:
                        Whereas: I, Colonel Thomas Crowe, has been truly informed that several audacious, nefarious,
                            pestiferous, infamous, intrepid, niglitwalking, garden-robbing, immature, peach-stealing,
                            rascals, all the spawns, rogues and cubs of hell, do frequently villainously and
                            burglariously assemble themselves together in my boats on the river Tullamore, therein
                            piping, swearing, sabbath-breaking, rogueing, duck-hunting, with many of the shameless and
                            evil acts, which the modesty of my pen cannot express. This is therefore to give you all
                            notice, Doharians, Delicarians, Capurnicarians, Tullimonarians, baseborn scoundrels, all
                            rascals of whatever nation you be, return me your bog-sticks, or by the gods, I will send my
                            man Jacob to Babylon for blood-hounds fiercer than tygers, and fleeter than the wind, and
                            with my cutting saber in hand, I will hunt you through Europe, Asia, Africa and America,
                            till I can center you in a cavern, under a great tree in Newfoundland, where the devil
                            himself can never find you. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, reptiles, tatterdemallions, thieves,
                            vagrants, vagabonds, lankjawed, herring-gutted plebians, that if one or any of ye, dare set
                            foot in my boats, I will send you to Charon, who will ferry you over the river Styx, and
                            deliver you to the arch-devil Lucifer, there to be dredged with the sulphur of Caueausus,
                            and roasted eternally before the everburning cinders of Aetna.
                    
            
            This has been a rambling story of early middlewest newspapers, touching only here and there on a few
                    high spots of a most interest subject. Suffice it to say, that while the scope  of the modern newspaper has widened and extended into the devious paths
                    of exploitations of all kinds, yet the influence of the early newspapers upon the history of its day
                    perhaps has had a more marked effect than have the periodicals of today.
            The history of the Northwest Territory has been marked by the great advancement of its newspapers,
                    and the newspaper in turn has been a light on the pathway of the middle west civilization for over
                    100 years.

            EARLY VEVAY
            By Perret Dufour.
            
            The wheat harvest for the present season being now nearly ready for the sickle, and the wet weather
                    we were having the past week reminds the writer that many years ago if such wet weather had set in,
                    many farmers would have predicted that the wheat would be "sick", that is, that
                    the flour made from such wheat when made into bread and eaten would have produced nausea and
                    vomiting. For well does he remember when he has eaten a meal, and eaten new wheat bread, how deathly
                    sick it has caused him to be. But it has been many years since there has been any
                    "sick" wheat in this country. What caused the "sick" wheat was
                    always a debatable question, nearly every one having his own theory to advance. Some seasons the
                    wheat crop would be very much damaged during such wet weather as we have had for the past week, by
                    the wheat sprouting after being cut and shocked, and often to sprout before being cut.
            In reading the accounts of passengers arriving in 
                  San
                        Francisco, California
               , from 
                        New York
                     City in six and eight days calls to the recollection of the writer the travels
                    performed by persons from this place to different points in the state years gone by. In 1817 or 1818
                    the trip from Vevay to 
                        Vincennes
                     was performed on horseback in the spring of the year in about six days, through mud,
                    rain and across swollen water courses. In many cases having to cross a stream through the water for
                    the distance perhaps of some two, three and oftentimes four miles.
            As late as the fall of 1832 the writer, in company with others, was over three days in reaching 
                        Indianapolis
                     from 
                        Vevay
                    , which at that time was as great an undertaking as a trip to 
                        St. Louis
                     or 
                        St. Paul
                     would be in these days of fast traveling.
            Of steamboat traveling much could be said that would be both amusing and instructive. Some of the
                    first steamboats  running on the 
                        Ohio
                     river that were of much importance or of any size were built about 1820 or 1821, but
                    the names of many of them are entirely forgotten. The "Velocipede," "Gen.
                    Green", "Plough Boy", "Highland Laddie" and
                    "Eliza" are the names of some of the early steamboats recollected on the 
                        Ohio
                     river. At one time the "Velocipede" was caught in a storm not far
                    from this place and had her upper deck damaged considerably. The "Gen. Green" at
                    one time struck a snag, sinking and damaging the cargo, which was principally coffee. The
                    "Plough Boy" was at one time running up the 
                        Wabash
                     river in the year 1822 or 1823’, or somewhere about that date, as appears
                    from the following notice dated 
                        Vincennes
                    , April 3, but the year can not be ascertained, as the notice is found on a scrap of an
                    old newspaper: 
                        On Tuesday morning last the citizens of this place were gratified by the appearance of the
                            steamboat "Plough Boy," Captain Beacon, bound for 
                                Terre Haute
                            , being the second boat that has ascended the 
                                Wabash
                            .
                    
            
            But steamboat traveling in those days was as expeditious in proportion as the travel by land, the
                    writer, as late as 1823, being two days and two nights in reaching 
                        Cincinnati
                     from Vevay on the "Highland Laddie", a small boat that was owned in
                    part by Duncan McCallum, one of the early Scotch settlers on Long Run.
            It would appear from the frequent and open violation of law in our midst that the population has in
                    no wise improved in morality since the early days of the county, although they have the opportunity
                    of hearing the Gospel preached much more frequently than then. For from about the year 1814 until
                    about 1827 there was perhaps no regularly organized church in Vevay or its immediate vicinity on the
                    Indiana side of the 
                        Ohio
                     river. But there was frequent preaching by the Baptist and Methodist ministers or local
                    preachers up to 1818 or 1819, when Dr. Jas. Welsh, the Presbyterian minister mentioned in a former
                    number, began preaching weekly of Sabbaths in the courthouse, and although there was no regularly
                    organized Presbyterian church he continued to preach until his suspension from the ministry by the
                    Presbytery of 
                        Cincinnati
                     about the year 1825.
            
            In 1824 a Presbytery was formed in Indiana, comprising seven ministers, thirty-one organized churches
                    and a missionary society, and embraced the whole of the state west of a line drawn due north from
                    the mouth of the 
                        Kentucky
                     river.
            On the 28th of January, 1828, a meeting of those persons friendly to the Presbyterian church was held
                    in Vevay for the purpose of electing ruling elders of the church to be formed in this place. Rev.
                    Ludwell G. Gaines acted as moderator, by order of the presbytery of 
                        Cincinnati
                    . Edward Patton was clerk of that meeting. 
                        Israel
                     R. Whitehead and James G. French were chosen to receive and count the votes. Three
                    elders, William French, Morgan Patton and David Walker, formerly a ruling elder in the church of Log
                    Lick, were elected.
            David Walker, it may not be improper here to state, was the father of Judge Charles E. Walker, of 
                        Madison
                    .
            The church thus organized during the winter and spring of 1828 raised by voluntary subscription about
                    $270 in sums from $1 to $30 and bought a lot on which the present
                    Presbyterian church stands, and during the summer and fall of that year had erected a church, built
                    of brick, but so badly put up that it did not last very long. In that building the church worshipped
                    until about 1838, when the church became nearly extinct. During this period of time the church
                    enjoyed the ministerial services of Rev. L. G. Gaines, Joshua L. Wilson, R. B. Dobbins, J. Thompson,
                    — Thomas, Peter Munfort, John Morral, William Lewis, H. Little, William J. Montieth,
                    James Hummer and George B. Bishop. 
                        The Rev. R. 
                                Hammond
                             was the first Methodist minister who preached in the state of Indiana. This was
                            in the year 1819, under a walnut tree near where the statehouse now stands.
                    
            
            The foregoing paragraph appears in the Religious Intelligence column of the 
                        Cincinnati
                    
                    Gazette of July 3, 1869, and it must certainly be an error. The Rev. Allen Wiley,
                    who was so long connected with the Methodist church, is known to have preached a funeral sermon in
                    Vevay sometime in the year 1816, and Abner Clarkson, who was residing in 
                        Madison
                     in 1813, says he heard Mr. Wiley preach in 
                        Madison
                     in that year.
            
            There was no regularly organized Methodist church in Vevay until about the year 1825. In 1837 the
                    Methodist congregation built a brick church on the lot where the present Ruter Chapel stands,
                    previous to which their meetings were held in the courthouse, schoolhouse, and in the old
                    Presbyterian church. The writer has forgotten the names of most of the Methodist ministers who
                    preached in this place, but recollects the names of Revs. Mr. Strange, Enoch G. Wood, Tarkington,
                    James Jones, H. J. Durbin and Allen Wiley, who were at different times on Vevay circuit as circuit
                    preachers or presiding elders.
            The Baptists held their meetings for many years in the schoolhouses of the town, but more frequently
                    in a log house which stood on Market street about where Ulysses P. Schenck's ice house now
                    stands. Among the earlier preachers of that persuasion who preached in that house may be named
                    Mordecai Jackson, father of Ibzan Jackson, of Posey township; John Graham, who resided for many
                    years on the left hand fork of Indian creek, H. D. Banta, and occasionally Mr. Clark, the father of
                    Lewis A. Clerk, preached in town. And although Mr. Clark was blind, and had been from his youth, if
                    he once had an introduction to a person, and conversed with him for a short time, if he should meet
                    that person long after, upon hearing his voice he would recognize him and call him by name. Mr.
                    Clark had a son (
                        Orange
                     Clark) living in 
                        Mississippi
                     whom he visited sometimes, traveling all the way by land with a small boy as his guide.
                    When passing through Vevay on one of his journeys to his son's, when asked whither he was
                    traveling, his reply was "to see my son in 
                        Mississippi
                    ."
            The Baptist congregation in 1834 contemplated building a meeting house, and in soliciting
                    subscriptoins among the citizens to defray the expense, and to obtain a lot on which to build it,
                    John F. Dufour executed to Henry D. Banta, William Price and Mordecai McKenzie, trustees of the 
                        Switzerland
                     Baptist church, a bond for a deed to the south-east half of lot No. 71, provided a
                    brick meeting-house were built on the same within 18 months, not less than 30 feet wide by 40 feet
                    long, and 13 feet high between the floor and ceiling. The house was built and completed and is the
                    one now used by  them. Some two years after, the trustees
                    represented to John F. Dufour that they had lost the bond, but wished him to make the deed, which he
                    did, but as the trustees were anti-missionary, they insisted on having the deed made to the
                    "Regular anti-missionary Baptist Church." This will account for the manner in
                    which the deed was thus made. It may not be amiss to state that the Baptist church in this place was
                    first organized in 1833.
            The engine mentioned in a former number, set up by Joshua Smithson as the first engine ever set up in 
                        Vevay
                    , was built by Frederick L. Grisard, who was carrying on the blacksmith business, and
                    Lewis Golay, who had served an apprenticeship at engine building with a person by the name of Tift.
                    All the wrought iron work about it was worked by F. L. Grisard, and the polishing and finishing was
                    done by Lewis Golay, and the engine set up and put in running order by him.
            In speaking of preaching in this vicinity in early times, I neglected to mention a custom that
                    existed among the Swiss colonists from their first settlement here until some later period, when
                    preaching became more frequent. It was their custom to meet together on the Sabbath for religious
                    services, such as singing psalms, reading prayers and some one of the number reading a sermon, at
                    which services the whole number of colonists would be present. The reading of the prayers and the
                    sermon was most frequently done by Daniel Dufour who was the oldest of the male colonists. Some of
                    the services were very impressive as the the sermons read were those which had been delivered in the
                    "Fatherland" by some of most eminent ministers of that period, belonging to the
                    Protestant church, and perhaps their delivery had been heard there by some of the eldest persons
                    present who heard the reading here, which must no doubt have recalled to their minds recollections
                    of their former homes, the friends and companions of their youth, far away from the macross the
                    broad Atlantic.
            About the earliest revivals of religion in this neighborhood commenced among the Baptists in Craig
                    township, under the preaching of Rev. Henry D. Banta and John Graham. They  preached in several different neighborhoods. They preached frequently
                    at the house of Mr. Thiebaud, being on the same farm where Justin Thiebaud now resides; and those
                    persons who were received as members were as a matter of course baptized in the 
                        Ohio
                     river. In this connection, an anecdote may be very appropriately related which will go
                    in some measure to show the depravity of the human heart when not under the influence of the Gospel,
                    which proclaims "On earth peace, good will to man." On one occasion there were
                    several persons who were about to receive the ordinance of baptism, and the officiating minister was
                    wading out to ascertain the condition of the bottom. It is said a person standing near by seized a
                    good sized dog by the neck and threw it into the water near the minister, exclaiming:
                    "There is one baptized."
            An anecdote that is related by some, that on one occasion Daniel Dufour had on the Sabbath, read a
                    very impressive and affecting sermon, which it is said brought tears into the eyes of many of his
                    hearers. In speaking of the reading of the sermon he remarked to some person who asked him if he had
                    preached, that he had, and that his hearers shed tears on hearing him. Some one remarked that it
                    must have been a very affecting sermon. He replied, yes, for he had shed tears also and "I
                    be damned if you had heard it you would have cried, too."
            There has never been any very extensive revival of religion in any one of the religious denominations
                    of 
                        Vevay
                    , except in the Methodist church, about the year 1840, when upwards of 150 were received
                    into the church on probation; but on many occasions there has been very marked interest manifested
                    by numbers who attended public worship in the several churches in the town, and they have slowly and
                    gradually increased in numbers.
            Many years ago, and while James Kirby, the father-in-law of George E. Pleasants, resided here, a
                    Universalist preacher came here, and it was announced that he would preach in the
                    "Barracks", a long frame building which stood on the corner of Market and Union
                    streets, on the lot now owned and occupied by John Melcher, which had received that name as by
                    common consent. Mr. Kirby called on Abner  Clarkson and wished
                    him to go and hear the true doctrine, and after much persuasion Mr. Clarkson consented to accompany
                    him. After hearing the preaching of the sermon, and on the way home Mr. Kirby remarked to Mr.
                    Clarkson "that's the doctrine," and appeared to be very much interested
                    in the "doctrine." The next day, after having slept over and thought of the
                    sermon, he met Mr. Clarkson and said to him, "Well, Clarkson, I believe the doctrine we
                    heard preached last night will do very well to live by, but will not do to die by."
            This Mr. Kirby, it was now recollected, was the owner of a steamboat in early days, perhaps about
                    1817, which was called "Vesta," and which was used in navigating the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     rivers. It is related that on one dark night, when ascending the 
                        Ohio
                     near to or above Big Bone creek, Mr. Kirby, who was acting as captain, perceived
                    something in the river near to the "Vesta" when he called out "Show your
                    lights!" And receiving no answer, and no light being shown, he directed the pilot to go
                    ahead, when suddenly the "Vesta" came up against a large rock, and the consequence
                    was the sinking of the "Vesta." That rock was for many years afterwards called
                    "Kirby's Rock". Whether that rock retains that name among steamboat men
                    of the present day, is not known to the writer.
            While on this subject it may not be improper to state that before the introduction of steamboats on
                    the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     river and their tributaries, the trading on the river was carried on with flatboats,
                    keelboats and barges. Keelboats and barges were used for bringing groceries and other heavy articles
                    up the 
                        Mississippi
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     rivers and their tributaries, and were propelled against the current with poles, and by
                    "cordeling".
            In this business James Kirby was engaged for some years, with one or two barges, one of which it is
                    believed he converted into a steamboat, by having an engine put up.
            Joseph Bosaw is about the only person now living in our midst who was engaged in the keelboat
                    business, he having perhaps made one or two trips to 
                        New Orleans
                     and back, and  several trips up to Kanawha Salines
                    with a loan, and returning laden with salt.
            About the year 1815, a person named Jackson made a trip from some place in 
                        Ohio
                    , perhaps Steubenville, down the 
                        Ohio
                     river with a keelboat laden with furniture and such other manufacturers of wood as was
                    much needed in this new country, stopping at Vevay for a few days. This Mr. Jackson made several
                    trips down the river with his keelboat laden each time with furniture. There is still in Vevay a set
                    of chairs purchased of Mr. Jackson about 1816, and any person having the curiosity of seeing a set
                    of chairs, which in those pioneer times were considered the best that could be made, may do so by
                    calling in at Mrs. Polly Dufour's on Liberty street.
            As these articles may now begin to be uninteresting to the readers of the Democrat, the writer will
                    begin to give something of more recent times, and will try and get up a few numbers, relating
                    incidents from about 1823 and a few years later.
            Anything that may have been related of individuals, has not been so related with any other view than
                    to give a history of the times, so far as the writer knows, and has been informed by others, without
                    the least intention of doing an injury to the feelings of any.
            Sometime in 1818, William C. Keen, who was brigadier general of Indiana militia, and resided in 
                        Vevay
                    , received two six-pounder iron guns from the state authorities, being the quota of that
                    grade of arms to be distributed in his brigade. One of those guns was sent to Rising Sun, where an
                    artillery company had been organized. The other was retained at this place, and a company was
                    organized, and Daniel V. Dufour was elected captain of that company. There was no person at the time
                    who knew much or anything of artillery practice, except the captain, he having attended a military
                    school in his native country. The company was organized and were regularly drilled, so that in a
                    short time it was what might be termed a No. 1 company, so far as manoeuvering with the guns was
                    concerned. The company was, after it had been organized three or four years, composed of young men
                    from 
                        Switzerland
                    , and sons of the Swiss about 
                        Vevay
                    , and a few  Americans. The names of some of them as
                    far as can be ascertained were: Captain Daniel V. Dufour, privates S. C. Jones, W. H. Jones, Chas.
                    Thiebaud, A. Raymond, R. Morerod, F. Morerod, J. Detraz, B. Detraz, G. Kessler, F. Desserens, J.
                    Vairin, A. Bornaud, P. Bettens, B. F. Siebenthal, Fred L. Grisard. After the first organization of
                    the company, many others became members, but none appear to have been near as expert gunners as some
                    of the old members, who were drilled and exercised in the management of the gun occasionally on
                    Sunday afternoons.
            In 1825, when it was known that General 
                        Lafayette
                     would certainly visit 
                        Cincinnati
                    , the company determined to visit that city at that time, and take with them their gun,
                    which, in after years received the name of "Old Betz." Some members of the company
                    were prevented from going to see the general, but a number of them embarked on a steamboat and
                    reached the city about an hour after the general and escort had crossed from 
                        Covington
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and were not present at the reception, but they had a fine time of it generally.
            Some members of the company who remained at home, predicted that on their arrival at 
                        Cincinnati
                    , those who did go would not be noticed by any persons among the thousands who would be
                    present to welcome the nation's guest.
            The company, on their arrival, were met at the landing by members of the committee on arrangements,
                    and of the artillery company of 
                        Cincinnati
                    , and when "Old Betz" was rolled off the boat on to the beach, and the
                    boys were ready to haul her up the bank by hand one of the officers of the day came riding up and
                    told them that in a short time a span of horses would be sent to take the piece up into the city and
                    enter the procession that was about being formed. In a short time a span of fine blacks was hitched
                    to the gun, and the boys marching along in martial order, soon became the observed of all observers.
            After the procession had marched through the principal streets, and had been dismissed, a firing of
                    cannon was commenced by the Vevay company, and soon after by the 
                        Cincinnati
                     company. The exercise of firing was very good, and the two companies vied with each
                    other which should excel. The  Vevay company by the rapidity
                    with which they loaded and fired their piece, so far outdid the 
                        Cincinnati
                     company that they received the praise of every person, and even Gen. 
                        Lafayette
                     who was introduced to the captain and his men by John J. Dufour, the father of the
                    captain, gave them the praise of being the most accurate in artillery tactics of any company he had
                    met with on his visit to the 
                        United States
                    . He enquired of the captain and his men where they had been instructed in the tactics
                    of artillery, and had quite a long conversation with them. He enquired very particularly how far
                    they had travelled to be present. When informed that they had come about 70 miles, he replied:
                    "My friends, you have put yourself to a great inconvenience to come so far to see me, who
                    am only a man."
            On introducing the general to the Swiss artillerists, John J. Dufour took occasion to make a speech
                    in which he referred to the services of the general during the War of the Revolution, and that the
                    Swiss who then stood before him, had come to the 
                        United States
                     to enjoy the blessings of the government he had been instrumental in securing for his
                    fellow man.
            After firing their gun for several hours, the cartridges gave out, and they had to procure others. It
                    is said that the members of the 
                        Cincinnati
                     company, chagrined on account of the correctness and the rapidity with which the Vevay
                    company went through the exercise of loading and firing, made cartridges for the Vevay gun too
                    large, with the view of retarding them in the rapidity of their firing, but still the Vevay company,
                    although the cartridges were too large, were still able to fire twice or three tomes to the 
                        Cincinnati
                     company's once.
            The two companies tried their skill in rapid firing on the following day, and bets of from one
                    hundred to one thousand dollars were freely offered that the Vevay company could fire two to one,
                    none of which bets were taken.
            The uniform of the company was rather an awkward and heavy one for summer wear. It consisted of a
                    blue dress coat trimmed in scarlet, a bear skin cap about one foot high, rather bell-crowned, and
                    trimmed with scarlet cord and tassel. Well does the writer, who in later years was a member of the
                    company,  remember how oppressive the great black cap and blue
                    cloth coat buttoned up to the chin, were on fourth of July occasions, when drawn up in line in the
                    hot sun. The uniform of the "Old Specks" of 1862 and 1863 although very oppressive
                    in warm weather, was nothing to compare with that of the old Swiss artillery company.
            Among those members who took part in manning the gun on the visit to 
                        Cincinnati
                     and participated in the festivities of the occasion were the Captain, J. and B. Detrax,
                    S. C. Jones, W. J. Jones, A. Raymond and F. Deserens. Others were of the numbers, but their names
                    are not now recollected.
            Some members of the company were unexpectedly prevented by unforseseen circumstances from being
                    present. Of that number R. Morerod, G. Kessler, J. Vairin and F. L. Grisard can be named, and it is
                    said that some of them were very much disappointed in not being with their comrades.
            The occasion of the visit of Gen. 
                        Lafayette
                     to 
                        Cincinnati
                     was an event that was heralded in the papers of that place and the surrounding country
                    for months before the appointed time for his arrival there.
            After the ceremonies of his reception and the incidents attending, the newspapers of
                            
                  Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington
               , and
                    all the smaller towns, for weeks after, were filled with accounts of the ceremonies, and of the many
                    incidents that occurred on that day; and all of them had to award the praise to the Swiss artillery
                    company of Vevay for the precision and rapidity with which they managed and fired their gun; and it
                    may be said that every member of that company felt proud of belonging to it, whether he was present
                    or absent on the occasion, which elicited so much praise from strangers.
            Many of the statements made in this number are from personal recollection, and others from facts
                    related by some members of the company who took part in the managemnet and firing of "Old
                    Betz" on that occasion.
            At some of the elections held in the early days of the county, some very amusing curcumstances in
                    relation to the candidates and the canvass might be given to show that often the voters cared not so
                    much for the talents of the candidates who were seeking their suffrages as to gratify their passions
                         of revenge, malice, and for sporting with the places of
                    honor and trust.
            At an election when a representative to the state legislature was to be chosen Samuel Merrill was a
                    candidate. Certain persons who were opposed to his election, and wishing to defeat him, met together
                    and determined on supporting Daniel Haycock as a candidate in opposition to Mr. Merrill. The canvass
                    was conducted with much spirit by the friends of both candidates. Mr. Merrill's claims on
                    the score of qualifications for the position, were not in the least questioned by any, but his
                    opponents urged against him that he was a Yankee adventurer; that their candidate was a man of the
                    people, and ought to be elected; and all the usual appliances of those early days were used to
                    induce the voters of the county to vote for Daniel Haycock, the peoples’ candidate,
                    against Samuel Merrill, the Yankee adventurer, who had come among us only to get office, which as
                    was urged, he could not get where he came from.
            In those days "whisky" might be said to be king, for with the aid of whisky, many
                    times men of bad habits were elected to fill the offices, while the deserving were left to take
                    "back seats".
            Mr. Merrill was elected, by the friends of Mr. Haycock in one of the townships, voting for a Mr.
                    Lacock, through mistake; or, as some of Haycock's friends alleged, Merrill's few
                    friends in that township putting out tickets with Lacock's name instead of
                    Haycock's on tickets which they had thus prepared for the express purpose of defeating
                    Haycock; be that as it may that error in the ticket secured Mr. Merrill's election to the
                    legislature, and contributed in no small degree to his future position in the state, as treasurer of
                    state for several years, and president of the State Bank of Indiana; for had the votes cast for
                    Lacock been cast for Haycock, he would have been elected by a small majority.
            At another election for a representative in the state legislature there was a candidate before the
                    people who was very acceptable to a great majority of the voters, and it was thought until within
                    ten days or two weeks of the election, he would have no opposition. However, some persons, for mere
                         sport, prevailed upon a person living above 
                        Vevay
                    , to consent that his name might be used by them as a candidate for representative, to
                    which he consented, and his name was thus announced as a candidate: 
                        To the voters of 
                                Switzerland county
                            : Having, at the solicitations of my friends and neighbors, consented to become
                            a candidate for Representative in the Legislature of Indiana, I pledge myself, if elected,
                            to use to the utmost my abilities to support such measures only as will be beneficial to the
                            county I represent, and the State at large.
                        Respectfully,
                        His X
                        ABRAHAM MILLER
                        Mark
                    
            
            Now, be it known that Mr. Miller was an honest old farmer, and. as was the case with many who were
                    raised in the western wilds, was an uneducated man; and in thus consenting to become a candidate no
                    doubt, was like his friends and neighbors, anticipating some rare sport during the remainder of the
                    canvass, and on election day.
            The day for holding the election came, and as Mr. Miller was a resident of Jefferson township, he
                    came to Vevay on the morning of election day, full of fun and frolic, electioneering to secure
                    votes, which he did with a great deal of success at the polls of Jefferson township. During the day,
                    his friends and he himself appeared to be confident of his election, for he went to some of the
                    prominent men about Vevay and assured them that he did not wish to be elected, that he and some of
                    his neighbors, seeing there was no opposition to the person who was a candidate, had determined to
                    have a candidate and some sport out of the matter.
            He appeared to be fearful he might be elected, and stated to some of his friends that if he was
                    elected he did not know what in the devil he would do, for he was not able to fill the place as he
                    ought to fill it, and such other expressions. He received a very fair proportion of the votes cast,
                    but was defeated by a majority of about fifty votes.
            On election days about that time, say from about 1818 to 1838, on entering a grocery where liquor was
                    sold a spectacle presented itself to the eyes of the beholder, that, in these  days would be such a sight as to horrify many. Persons who, in days
                    gone by, have seen such sights, and have been participants in them having the spectacle placed in
                    such a conspicuous position as to be seen of all the voters who might chance to step into one of
                    those groceries. The spectacle here meant was this: On the morning of elections, each candidate
                    would have a bottle filled with whisky, and his name printed in large letters on his bottle, so that
                    his supporters might drink of his whisky, and thus at a general election on the first Monday in
                    August when several officers were to be elected, and several aspirants for each office, there might
                    have been seen on the the counters from ten to fifteen bottles filled with whisky, with the name of
                    a candidate on each bottle; and as the voting proceeded through the day, those who were watching the
                    interests of their favorite candidates, would step into the grocery to see how the whisky of their
                    favorites was being drank. If the bottle of the friend was full enquiry would be made of the
                    barkeeper how many times he had filled that bottle: If it had been filled oftener than the bottle of
                    his favorite's opponent, he went away with a light heart, assured that his
                    favorite's friends were in the ascendancy.
            And thus the whisky bottle was regarded as the thermometer of the state of the public mind, in
                    relation to the success or defeat of the candidates who were asking them for their suffrages. The
                    time of such sights as this has passed, and many who have been candidates for office, and have had
                    their names placed on one of these thermometers, have been heard often to say that "Whisky
                    and whisky-sellers rule the legislature of Indiana."
            But even in those days, Indiana can boast of some of her most honest legislators; men who had the
                    best interests of the state at heart; men who were not always trying to initiate some scheme or new
                    measure, whereby they might fill their pockets at the expense of the honest farmers and tax payers
                    of the state. It is true, some of them had very crude notions of the best manner to develop the
                    resources of the state.
            As an example, a worthy senator who represented 
                        Switzerland
                     and 
                        Ripley
                     counties in the senate, conceived the singular idea of having a penitentiary erected in
                    such a manner that  it could be placed upon wheels and hauled
                    along some of the state roads that were then being opened and worked, and made so secure that
                    convicts might be locked up by night and employed during the day in working on the road. In that
                    manner he contended the labor of the convicts could be made available in opening and working the
                    roads throughout the state, that were established by legislative enactment. He advocated his
                    "rolling penitentiary", as it was termed, with much zeal, but failed in having it
                    made a law. This senator was George Craig, and let others have what opinions they may on the
                    subject, would it not be a profitable undertaking at this time?
            At a time when railroads were first spoken of in the legislature of Indiana it is said that a worthy
                    representative, representing one of the counties bordering on the 
                        Wabash
                    , and in whose county the land was in many localities swampy, that in order to have
                    roads that would be of sufficient firmness tc bear up the travel, it was necessary to make what is
                    usually called "corduroy bridges", which are made by placing round poles or split
                    rails lengthwise across the road—replied to a speech made by a real railroad member,
                    "In my county we have as good railroads as in any county in the state of Indiana, or in the
                    world for they are made of oak rails that can not be surpassed by those in any part of the country
                    for durability."
            It is said of another 
                        Wabash county
                     representative, that when a canal was spoken of being built in the 
                        Wabash
                     valley, and speaking of the cost of its construction, he declared it as his firm belief
                    that "the cost of the construction of a canal from Fort 
                        Wayne
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                     could be entirely paid in coon skins."
            Thinking some additional facts in relation to navigating the 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Mississippi
                     rivers and tributaries with barges, keel and flatboats, fifty and sixty years ago,
                    might not be unacceptable to the readers of these numbers, some few of those facts and some
                    incidents connected therewith, will be mentioned in this number.
            John and Joseph Bosseau, who came to Vevay in 1813 with their father and family, were both engaged in
                    navigating  those rivers soon after their arrival here; Joseph
                    being at this time 78 years of age, and residing on Bee-Tree Run, two and one-half miles from 
                        Vevay
                    , and his brother John, being his senior by five years, resides in Wood county, West 
                        Virginia
                    .
            Joseph, perhaps, made but one or two trips to 
                        New Orleans
                     and back, but made several to 
                        St. Louis
                     and back, on one occasion making the homeward bound voyage by land, on foot, which was
                    performed in six or seven days. One trip was made up the 
                        Mississippi
                     river to 
                        Prairie
                     du Chien, with provisions for the garrison stationed at that place. He also made two or
                    three trips up Cumberland river to 
                        Nashville
                    ; one or two trips up 
                        Tennessee
                     river to the Mussel Shoals, and but for the obstruction to navigation by those shoals,
                    would have gone farther up that river, having arrived at the shoals too late in the season to be
                    assisted in getting over them.
            Many trips were made by him up the 
                        Kentucky
                     river as far as Sublett's ferry, to which point iron and groceries of all
                    descriptions were taken and from which tobacco, whisky and bacon were brought down on the return
                    trip. The boat on which he was employed up the 
                        Kentucky
                     river was in the service of Lewis Sanders, who, about that time, was engaged quite
                    extensively in manufacturing near 
                  Lexington, Kentucky
               , and in merchandising. It is said that
                    John Sanders and Ab. Sanders were engaged in running boats up the 
                        Kentucky
                     river about this time, but the exact year the writer has not been able to ascertain.
            "Uncle Joe" has also put his shoulder to the pole and assisted in propelling keel
                    boats up the Monongahela river as far as 
                        Brownsville
                    , which, in those days was known by the appelation of "Redstone."
            It is said that in the very early days of navigating the 
                        Ohio
                     and its tributaries, the following dialogue, if it may be so termed, occurred between a
                    person on shore and the captain of a keelboat out in the stream, descending the 
                        Ohio
                    : "Hallo the boat." "Hallo." "What is the
                    name of that boat?" "Yellowstone." "Where is it
                    from?" "Redstone." "Where are you bound
                    to?" "Limestone." "What are you  loaded with?" "Grindstones."
                    "What is the Captain's name?" "Whetstone."
            Uncle Joe has gone up the Muskingum river in his keelboating to 
                        Zanesville
                    , several times up to Pittsburg and more times than he has fingers and toes up to
                    Kenawha Salines, taking up whisky, bacon, coffee, sugar and other groceries; and in all those
                    voyages he was said to be the most active and at the same time the best natured person of all the
                    crew, which was generally composed of from six to ten men with poles, and the captain or steersman.
                    The last trip he made in keelboating up to the Kenawha Salines, for Jacob R. Evertson, laden with
                    whisky, bacon, groceries, and a few dry goods, he had as companions several persons from this
                    vicinity, but cannot recollect any of them now except Andrew Roberts, the father of John James
                    Roberts of this place. Uncle Joe says, that, fearing Mr. Evertson would not be willing to allow them
                    rations of whisky, he provided himself with a gimlet, then removing a hoop on the barrel, he bored a
                    hole with his gimlet at which he filled a coffee pot with whisky, stopped the hole, replaced the
                    hoop, and in that way procured a sufficient supply of whisky for himself, Andrew Roberts, and two
                    others (which four made up the mess) during the trip.
            At one time, on leaving Pittsburg, a bet was made by the captain of the keel Uncle Joe was on board
                    of, and the captain of another boat, as to which would beat to 
                        Cincinnati
                    . The boat on which Uncle Joe belonged was to start one day ahead of the other boat. On
                    arriving at Biffingtons island, the water being quite low and not of a sufficient depth to admit the
                    passage of the boat, about 100 barrels of whisky were put overboard, and with a rope made fast
                    together by tacking the rope to the barrels. They were sent ahead to their destination at the mouth
                    of Big Sandy, and yet the boat could not pass until stone at the bottom were removed to deepen the
                    channel; and the boat, by this means, was gotten through the shallow channel. But that their
                    competitors might not profit by the channel being thus cleared, the stones thus removed together
                    with others, were thrown back into the channel from which they had been taken—thus making
                    the channel perhaps shallower than they found it. So, when the 
                    other boat arrived at that point, they could not pass, and were compelled to deepen the channel,
                    which delayed them and Uncle Joe and his companions landed their boat at 
                        Cincinnati
                     about three days in advance of their competitors.
            John and Joseph Bosseau are said to be the only survivors of those who were engaged in navigating the
                    western waters in those early days with keelboats.
            These facts and incidents are here related as told the writer by Uncle Joe himself, some days since,
                    not for any worth or merit attaching to them, but with the thought that perhaps fifty years hence
                    some of those who may then be on the stage of action may chance to read them, and learn what those
                    who preceded them in the voyage of life had been called upon to do and to suffer that the
                    necessaries of life might be conveyed from one point to another in this now great and prosperous
                    valley of the "father of waters," and his numerous tributaries.
            It is said that John Bosseau is to visit this county soon, and if so, let any ones who are curious to
                    hear from him and his brother Joseph's own lips a recital of their trials, hardships,
                    privations and pleasures, too, call, and perhaps what is here written of them and much more may be
                    learned.
            Some incidents which are said to have occurred at 
                        Cincinnati
                     in 1825, on the occasion of the visit of the Marquis de 
                        Lafayette
                    , which have been related and brought to the recollection of the writer by a member of
                    the artillery company of 
                        Vevay
                    , who was one of the party, it may be well to have recorded in these numbers, to be
                    handed down to those who come after the present generation.
            It is related that while the Vevay Swiss Artillerists were firing with great rapidity, by some means
                    some fire was dropped on the cartridges, which must have caused the explosion of the whole contents
                    of the box, but for the coolness and presence of mind of Andrew Bornand, whose position was to apply
                    the match to fire the gun, and whose attention was called to notice the coal of fire on one of the
                    cartridges on perceiving which he stepped up to the box very coolly and in a slow, cautious manner,
                    took the fire in his hand, threw it away, and thus saved the cartridges in the box from being set
                         on fire, and preventing an explosion, that in all
                    probability might have caused the death of some one of those engaged in manning the gun.
            On some other occasion, Mr. Bornand was priming the gun, the priming burned without setting off the
                    gun. Stepping up to the gun, he commenced to pour the priming from the powder horn by his side, when
                    the gun went off setting the powder in the horn on fire, causing it to explode, burning Mr.
                    Bornand's hand and face considerably, which caused him considerable pain for a few days.
            In the spring of 1826, Edward Patton was married, and as was then the custom among the members of the
                    company, "Old Betz" was on the day of the infair brought into requisition to
                    proclaim the joy of the members of the company. While in the act of ramming down a cartridge which
                    proved to be rather large, and which Phillip Betten who was ramming, was unable to get down, Rodolph
                    Morerod (the husband of Mrs. Henrietta Tardy), stepped up, took hold of the rammer with such force
                    as to cause the cartridges to burst, which it was thought was the cause of the gun going off, while
                    he was still in the act of ramming the cartridge home, horribly burning and bruising Mr. Morerod,
                    and melting the buttons on his coat. He was taken home, and after lingering in great suffering for
                    some days he died.
            To show the rapidity with which the company fired the gun at 
                        Cincinnati
                     at the time of the reception of 
                        Lafayette
                    , it is said that although the cartridges were made so large that it was with great
                    difficulty they could be rammed home they went through all the artillery exercise in loading and
                    fired twenty-nine times in a little over three minutes, which as heretofore stated, was very
                    generally spoken of by the 
                        Cincinnati
                     and other western newspapers, as the best artillery exercises ever performed in the
                    west, and perhaps in the 
                        United States
                    , up to that time.
            It is related that while 
                        Lafayette
                     was on the platform surrounded by many who were anxious to take by the hand the friend
                    of America when she stood in need of friends, there was observed in the crowd an old and feeble
                    female, who was evidently making her way through the crowd towards the  platform where 
                        Lafayette
                    , surrounded by the "bonton" of the surrounding country, was being
                    shaken by the hand and congratulated. At length the old lady gets through the crowd, ascends the
                    platform and taking 
                        Lafayette
                     by the hand, with streaming eyes calls on God to bless him; and addressing herself to
                    the brave and generous 
                        Lafayette
                    , she speaks to him thus: "Do you remember me, General?" He
                    informs her that he did not remember or recognize her. She then informed him that while he was
                    imprisoned in the castle of Olmutz she had waited on him during his imprisonment, carrying
                    refreshments to him. Then the General, with tearful eyes, recognizes her, and praying God to protect
                    and defend her, they separated.
            Among the Swiss who first came here were some who, besides being vine dressers in their native
                    country, at which they were occupied during the summer and autumn, some of them went to the
                    mountains with the cows to pasture, and there remained to attend to the cows, made the butter and
                    cheese, during the season best adapted for that purpose, some of the cheese made by them being of an
                    excellent quality. About 1824, some jersons came to this country and brought cheese that had been
                    made by some of the relatives of the Swiss colonists, which was said to be three or four years old,
                    and was so hard that it required a saw to cut it into slices. It was so rich that it would melt when
                    taken into the mouth, and was of an excellent flavor.
            Jean D. Morerod was one of the experts in making good butter and cheese, and many of the older
                    settlers here can bear witness of the quality of the cheese.
            It was remarked some time since that in the early days of the colony, three families united in the
                    purchase of a cow for their joint use. This remark was made by an old settler, but of its
                    correctness the writer cannot say anything, as he does not recollect ever having heard anything of
                    the circumstance until lately.
            It may be strictly correct, for in those days money in the wilderness was not so plenty as in these
                    days of "greenbacks," "bluebacks" and
                    "redbacks", and the settlers had as yet nothing to sell that would command money.
            
            The writer well recollects that even as late as 1827, there could not be raised by any one person a
                    sufficient amount of money to pay for the brick house and the lot at the corner of Main Cross and
                    Market streets, which was sold at sheriff's sale. John F. Dufour, 
                        Israel
                     R. Whitehead and Thomas Armstrong, joining together, could raise money enough to pay
                    the bid, which was made in the name of the three, and that amount was $307.
            At that time money was scarce and hard to be had, even though a person had produce to sell. Then
                    wheat was selling at about 311/4 cents per bushel; corn about 121/2, and other productions farmers
                    had to sell in proportion.
            Seeing an article in some newspaper lately, giving an account of the condition of Steven C. Stevens,
                    who has had the sad misfortune to have his mental faculties so shattered that it has been necessary
                    to have him placed in the Insane Asylum, has called to the mind of the writer that Judge Stevens,
                    who was first admitted to the practice of the law at the bar of the 
                        Switzerland
                     circuit court, in 1816, afterwards was prosecuting attorney, a representative in the
                    legislature of Indiana, and then a senator, and was appointed one of the judges of the supreme court
                    of Indiana; and that although he had talents of no ordinary kind, yet an Allwise Creator has
                    permitted disease, in the worst form, to overtake him in his riper years.
            Judge Stevens and Hon. Jeremiah Sullivan are the only surviving attorneys of the territorial courts
                    in this part of the state.
            In the early days of 
                        Vevay
                    , what few youth were about the town did not enjoy the privileges and benefits of having
                    good schools, such as the youth of Vevay have at the present day.
            In 1816, 1817, and 1818, the first school was opened, in which Greek and Latin, and the higher
                    branches of English literature were taught. The school was conducted by Alexander Holton, who gave
                    public notice of his school in the following card, published in the Indiana Register in November,
                    1817: 
                    
                        NOTICE
                        The subscriber has opened a school in the town of 
                                Vevay
                            , State of Indiana, which he calculates, personally, to superintend. The
                            branches of literature he will teach, and the terms of tuition per quarter, are as follows,
                            to wit: Reading, $3, Reading and Writing, $3.50; Mathematics, in its
                            various branches, Geography and English Grammar, $4; Greek and Latin Languages,
                            $5. He flatters himself that from the long habit of teaching the above branches
                            of literature, particularly the languages and mathematics, that he shall be enabled to give
                            satisfaction to all persons who shall favor him with their patronage.
                        ALEX. HOLTON
                        Vevay Nov. 18, 1817
                    
            
            Mr. Holton was an accomplished scholar, and his school was well patronized, considering the small
                    number of scholars in the town and vicinity to be taught.
            A Mr. Wilson, a Baptist preacher, taught school in Vevay in a small log house which stood on Ferry
                    street, on the lower part of the lot on which the Russell house now stands. That house had
                    previously been occupied as a horse mill, but about the time of its occupancy as a place where the
                    young idea was taught to shoot, the mill was removed from town. This was in the fall of 1815. In Mr.
                    Wilson's school, Orthography, Reading and Writing only were taught.
            James Rous, the father of Ladig and Percy Rous, in 1814 and 1815, taught school in the Seminary of 
                        Vevay
                    , which was a one story hewed log house, about twenty or twenty-five feet long by twelve
                    or fifteen feet wide, with a door in one end, and for windows, one log on each side, was cut out,
                    and a sash with perhaps twenty or twenty-five glass in each, in a single row, was fitted into the
                    opening made for the window. In this house the writer was a scholar for a year or more and among his
                    schoolmates who attended that school he can now name but few who are living: John Scott, now Dr.
                    Scott, of 
                        New York
                     city, brother-in-law of James Cole, Rebecca Cole, now the wife of Enos Littlefield,
                    Esq., who left this place about a year ago for 
                        Texas
                    , and perhaps Wm. W. Huston, of York township.
            Mrs. Julia L. Dumont, whose reputation as a successful teacher is well known in this community,
                    commenced teaching about the year 1820, and for many years delighted to give  instruction and her kind advice to the boys and girls who were placed
                    under her care for educational purposes. She was perhaps the most successful and efficient teacher
                    that ever imparted instruction in 
                        Vevay
                    . This, by no means is said to detract from the merits of any who have been called to
                    teach in our public schools since she ceased from teaching. Many of the present fathers and mothers
                    of 
                        Vevay
                    , who were pupils under Mrs. Dumont, and obtained their education under her teaching,
                    lived to see their children receive their education, so far as the English language was taught, by
                    her and under her instruction.
            Sylvanus Waldo, a brother to the father of 0. 5. and J. F. Waldo, taught school here, but the length
                    of time is not recollected nor the year during which he taught. He was taken sick while his school
                    was being carried on, and it is thought he died from the effects of that sickness.
            One James 
                        Brown
                     taught a school in the log house which stood on the lot on Main street now occupied by
                    R. F. Grisard. This school was kept for several years, and although Mr. 
                        Brown
                     was reputed a cross and severe teacher, yet his scholars improved rapidly under his
                    tuition. In that school the writer made most of his advance in his studies. Most of his schoolmates
                    in that school have removed from this place; but a majority of them have been called to
                    "that bourne from whence no traveler returns." This school was taught perhaps in
                    1820, ‘21 and ‘22.
            At one time, the exact date not recollected, one Wick commenced a school in a frame building which
                    stood on Main street nearly opposite the court house, which was continued but a short time, for want
                    of sufficient patronage. Sometime during the year 1822 or 1823, Isaac B. Kinsman, a downeastern,
                    from the banks of the Kennebec river, in the State of 
                        Maine
                    , came to 
                        Vevay
                    , and commenced school teaching. He was a good scholar, and capable of teaching Latin,
                    Greek and Hebrew. He continued teaching school at intervals until perhaps in the fall of 1825. He
                    was in the habit of indulging too freely in the use of intoxicating liquors, which unfitted him at
                    times for his avocation. He had a very good school, and gave general satisfaction in his teaching,
                    for he never  kept his school open while intoxicated. In April,
                    1824, he concluded to abandon school teaching and turn his attention to trading. Accordingly he gave
                    notice that he wished to purchase a large quantity of turkeys, ducks and good chickens, to be
                    delivered in Vevay on three days of the week following, for which he promised to pay in specie, for
                    chickens 50 cents per dozen for a single dozen or 621/2 cents per dozen for five dozen or more,
                    brought at one time by the same person. Same price for ducks and 25 cents apiece for turkeys.
            He collected together a good number of each and took them down the river, making quite a good
                    speculation by the operation. He was a ready writer, and the paper published in Vevay at the time
                    was made interesting by his contributions. One of his articles published in the Indiana Register,
                    September 17, 1824, reads thus: 
                        Mr. Keen—Report says the books belonging to the Auditor's office under
                            the territorial government have been lost. Will you have the goodness to let the people know
                            if that is the fact, who was the Auditor at the time, and what loss the State sustained in
                            consequence of the loss of the books, &c.?
                        Report says also that the Legislature once authorized the 
                                Jeffersonville
                             Canal Company to raise a certain sum of money by lottery—that
                            managers were appointed—a scheme published—many tickets sold for
                            cash—and the purchasers of tickets swindled out of their cash, as the lottery was
                            never drawn; do tell the people who were the managers and agents of this
                            business—who were the swindlers; and such other information on the subject as you
                            may be in possession of.
                        Report says that—will be a candidate for the senate of the 
                                United States
                            . The people have heard very strange stories about his conduct toward his wife;
                            that in consequence of his neglect &c. she pined, sorrowed and died. Please tell
                            them how it is.
                    
            
            In September, 1824, a man and wife were living near 
                        Vevay
                    , not very harmoniously together, the wife left the husband and went to live in the
                    family of a neighbor. As usual in such cases, the deserted husband gave notice in the public paper
                    that his wife had left his bed and board, and was living in adultery with the neighbor where she had
                    gone to stay. Kinsman hearing of the affair sought an opportunity to see the man with whom the
                    truant wife was living and advised him to publish a denial of the charges published by the deserted
                         husband. It was agreed that Kinsman should prepare the
                    notice, which appeared in the paper a short time after as follows: 
                        ATTENTION
                        The public are particularly requested to suspend their opinion for the present respecting the
                            publication signed—. have employed the woman he calls his wife to reside in my
                            family as a servant or housekeeper, and do not harbor her.
                    
            
            In the legislature of Indiana during the session of 1823 and ‘24 which was the last held
                    at Corydon, 
                        Switzerland county
                    , was represented by Stephen C. Stevens and Ralph Cotton. During that session the laws
                    of the state were revised, and in the revision of the bill relative to crime and punishment, the
                    following section was inserted, (see page 145 of Journal of proceedings of the Senate): 
                        Section 42, Every person who shall make, print or publish any slanderous or ridiculous
                            writing picture or sign with a malicious or mischievous design or intent towards government,
                            magistrates or indivduals, shall on convction be fined not exceeding five hundred
                        dollars.
                    
            
            As this obnoxious section was inserted in the revised bill, and was nowhere to be found in the
                    statutes before in force in this state, William Hendricks, the revisor, it was at the time intimated
                    would explain to the people his motive for introducing it.
            The bill passed through all the readings in both houses to the last reading in the senate, when Joh.
                    H. Thompson moved to strike it out and the ayes and noes being called for, were as follows:
                    Ayes—Wm. Graham, of Jackson; Jas. Gregory, of 
                        Marion
                    ; Elisha Harrison, of Vanderburg; John Jenckes, of Vigo; Samuel Milroy, of 
                        Washington
                    ; Isaac 
                        Montgomery
                    , of Gibson; Frederick Sholts, of Davies; James B. Slaughter, of Harrison; John H.
                    Thompson, of Clark. Noes—Samuel Chambers, of 
                        Orange
                    ; Daniel Grass, of Perry; John Gray, of 
                        Dearborn
                    ; Lewis Johnson, of 
                        Fayette
                    ; James Raridon, of 
                        Wayne
                    ; Jas. B. Ray, of 
                  Franklin; Milton
                Stapp, of Jefferson.
            The mass of the people were much opposed to such a law being in force in Indiana, and thought it
                    smacked very much of the gag law of John Adams passed in the reign of terror.
            
            During the next session of the legislature, which convened at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in January, 1825, and was the first held at that place, 
                        Switzerland county
                     was represented in the House by Stephen C. Stevens and William Guard, who were elected
                    on the first Monday of August, 1824.
            At that election the following candidates were voted for and received the number of votes set
                    opposite their respective names: Stephen C. Stevens, 358; William Guard, 319; Newton H. Tapp, 204;
                    Linus Scoville, 126; George Tague, 55; Robert McCorkle, 45; William 
                        Brandenburg
                    , 27.
            William Guard and Linus Scoville were nominated by a meeting held at 
                        Jacksonville
                     favorable to the removal of the seat of Justice from 
                        Vevay
                    . Stephen C. Stevens was elected speaker over David H. Maxwell by a vote of 23 to 20.
            At the August election of 1824 three members of congress were elected to represent the state in the
                    nineteenth congress.
            The legislature had at its last session remodelled the three congressional districts into which the
                    state was divided. The counties of 
                        Orange
                    , Perry, 
                  Spencer, Warrick
               , Vanderburg, Posey, Gibson, 
                        Pike
                    , Dubois, 
                        Knox
                    , Davies, Martin, Sullivan, Vigo, Parke, 
                        Monroe
                    , Lawrence, 
                  Wabash, Greene
               , Owen, Morgan, 
                  Putnam, Vermillion
               , Hendricks and 
                        Montgomery
                    , 25 counties forming the First district.
            The counties of Jefferson, Clark, Jackson, 
                        Washington
                    , Harrison, Crawford, Floyd, Scott, 
                        Bartholomew
                    , Jennings, 
                  Marion, Hamilton
               , Johnson, 
                  Shelby, Madison
                and 
                        Delaware
                    , 16 counties, forming the Second district.
            And the counties of Henry, Rush, 
                  Decatur, Randolph, Wayne, Franklin, Fayette, Dearborn, Union
               , 
                  Switzerland, Ripley
                and Allen, 12
                    counties, forming the Third district; making a total of 53 counties in the state.
            In the Third district the candidates were John Test, Daniel J. Caswell and James B. Ray. Test and
                    Caswell were in favor of John Q. Adams for President, but Mr. Test was pledged that if the choice of
                    President should be thrown into the House of Representatives he should be governed by the vote of
                    the people of the state or his district as expressed by the electors.
            Ray was in favor of Henry 
                        Clay
                     for President.
            
            John Test was elected, the vote in 
                        Switzerland county
                     being: Test, 238; Ray, 197; Caswell, 186. The vote of the district with the vote of one
                    county (
                        Randolph
                    ) not included stood: Test, 4,522; Ray, 2,936; Caswell, 1,457.
            In the Second district the candidates were Jeremiah Sullivan and Jonathan Jennings. Mr. Jennings was
                    elected, receiving in Harrison county, in which he resided, a majority of 994, while Mr. Sullivan
                    received in Jefferson county, in which he resided, a majority of 800.
            In the First district the candidates were William Prince, Ratliff 
                        Boone
                    , Thomas H. Blake and Jacob Call. William Prince was elected, but having no data from
                    which to give the vote, let this statement suffice.
            The contest for President in 1824 was perhaps no more exciting and spirited in any locality than in 
                        Switzerland county
                    , for on the 31st of January the friends of Henry 
                        Clay
                     met at the house of Thomas Armstrong and organized by appointing Colonel John F.
                    Siebenthal, chairman and Captain George G. 
                        Knox
                    , secretary. General William C. Keen, Stephen Whicher, Jr., and Nath. Cotton were
                    appointed a committee to draft a suitable address to the voters of the Third congressional district.
                    Henry 
                        Clay
                     was nominated as a candidate for President and Andrew Jackson for Vice President. In
                    the conclusion of the address to the people the committee thus spoke of Henry 
                        Clay
                    : "In the language of the children of 
                        Israel
                     on a certain occasion we say, ‘let this good man rule over
                    us’."
            On the same day a meeting, favorable to DeWitt Clinton for President met at the court house and was
                    organized by the appointment of Abner Clarkson as chairman and 
                        Israel
                     R. Whitehead as secretary. The meeting after being organized nominated DeWitt Clinton
                    for President and Andrew Jackson for Vice President. A committee was appointed to draw up an address
                    to the people, calling their attention to the great interest they had in using every proper measure
                    to procure the nomination of the gentleman nominated.
            On the 21st of February, 1824, a meeting of the citizens of the county friendly to the election of
                    Jackson as President was held at the court house in 
                        Vevay
                    . Daniel Dufour was  chosen chairman and Edward
                    Patton and William McCullough appointed secretaries. The meeting was addressed by Isaac B. Kinsman,
                    and pledged themselves to support Jackson for President and 
                        Clay
                     for Vice President.
            On the 19th of March, 1824, the following notice was published: 
                        WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD
                        The members of Congress having nominated William H. Crawford for president and Albert
                            Gallatin for vice-president it behooves all the steadfast friends to be up and doing. The
                            friends of Mr. Crawford are requested to meet at the courthouse in Vevay on Monday next at 2
                            o'clock, p. m., to take such measures as will be advisable to advance the interests
                            of said persons.
                        March 10th.
                        NOBILITY
                    
            
            Whether the meetings were held is not known, but the following week this notice was inserted in the
                    paper published in town: "Wm. C. Crawford.—Monday last was fixed on by the
                    friends of Wm. H. Crawford to meet at the Court House in Vevay to adopt measures to advance the
                    interests of Messrs. Crawford and Gallatin. The day came—it passed—not a soul
                    approached the edifice."
            Some of the prominent men and aspirants for office in this part of Indiana, particularly in the Third
                    congressional district, were opposed to the candidates for President on different grounds. Some
                    opposed 
                        Clay
                     and Jackson because they were slaveholders, and lived in slave states. Some opposed Mr.
                    Adams because as was asserted he lived in 
                        Washington
                     City, and was an owner of slaves.
            Some of the aspirants for congress in the Third district were said to favor the election of Jackson
                    while here in 
                        Switzerland county
                     and when in other counties where 
                        Clay
                     or Adams were more prominent, they advocated the election of the one or the other, as
                    the one or the other was the most prominent.
            At length the election came and it would appear from the result that outside of Vevay and the
                    vicinity the people cared nothing about who was the President. The result in 
                        Switzerland county
                     was as follows: Jackson, 161; 
                        Clay
                    , 108; Adams, 28.
            
            The election over, everybody glad "on it", as Brother Jonathan said. The friends of
                    the several candidates who previous to the election could not say a civil word of or to each other
                    soon began to harmonize and associate together as was their usual custom. The unusual small number
                    of votes cast was owing to several causes: Polls were opened in three townships only, and the votes
                    of but one counted— the returning judge from one township came in without the
                    return—the other brought his return, but not being in legal form it was rejected;
                    however, the judges reported it to the secretary of state specially. In Posey township Jackson had
                    66 and Adams 46 votes. In Cotton township Jackson had 25, Adams 23, and 
                        Clay
                     18.
            In these times of high taxes and burdens upon the tax payers of the county of which we hear so much
                    said every day where an assemblage of people are met, and of which we read in every newspaper
                    published in our land, it may be interesting to those who read these articles to know something
                    about the burdens and taxes borne by the people forty or fifty years ago.
            These things can be seen by any person who would take the trouble of examining the records of county
                    affairs on file in the auditor's office at 
                        Vevay
                    , so far as relates to the county of 
                        Switzerland
                     and the archives of state at 
                        Indianapolis
                     so far as relates to the state finances. But that every person and tax-payer of the
                    county who reads the Democrat may have a glimpse at these matters, a few statements in relation
                    thereto will be given in these numbers from time to time. The first will be a
                    "statement" of the financial concerns of 
                        Switzerland county
                     from the 16th of November, 1822, to the 12th of November, 1823, inclusive. It appears
                    that on the 15th of November, 1822, there was a deficit of $914.20, in other words the
                    county was in debt to that amount at that date. The amount of the duplicate placed in the hands of
                    the collector for the year 1823 amounted to the sum of $1,126.80, and the amount of the
                    other receipts were $288.64, making the total amount of receipts for the county provided
                    the whole amount on the duplicate was collected, $1,415.44. The total amount of
                    expenditures, including the $914.20, the amount of the  deficit for the year 1822 as above stated, was $2,387.05; from which it will be seen
                    that the indebtedness of the county on the 12th of November, 1823, was $971.61, showing
                    that instead of paying off the debt of the previous year, the indebtedness of the county was
                    increased.
            This statement shows that the whole amount of taxes collected and on the duplicate for that year
                    amounted to $1,415.44.
            At the August election, 1824, the number of votes cast for the three candidates for congress in the
                    county was 621. By dividing the amount of taxes imposed on the voters of the county for that year by
                    the number of votes will show that the taxes was about $2.28 for each voter. And yet
                    there was a deficit of $971.611/2 which would have required an additional tax of about
                    $1.56 on each voter to pay that deficiency, and would have required a tax of about
                    $3.84 on each voter for that year.
            About this time county orders were offered for sale by those holding them at 50 cents on the dollar,
                    without purchasers, except in suitable amounts for tax payers to pay their county taxes. How very
                    different from what these matters are at this time. The amount of taxes charged on the duplicate,
                    the receipts and expenditures of the county, and the number of voters in the county at present only
                    can make the reader realize the difference.
            It appears that the receipts and expenditures of the state from the commencement of the State
                    government in 1816 to the first of January, 1823, made an aggregate of $113,230.34
                    received at the state treasury during that period from taxes alone, to which is added revenue of the
                    territory, receipts on account of seat of government, salt springs and incidental receipts to make
                    the aggregate of receipts from all sources amount to $183,185.51 while the aggregate of
                    expenditures amounted to $170,686.53, and leaving a balance in the treasury on the first
                    of January, 1824, of $12,498.53; which, to the casual observer would appear to be a very
                    satisfactory financial condition for the young state to boast of, after an existence of only seven
                    years.
            But for all this good showing, the financial affairs of the 
                    state it is said were in a very unsatisfactory condition, for on the assembling of the legislature
                    on the first Monday in December, 1823, the governor communicated to that body the situation of the
                    affairs of the state. On taking a view of the financial concerns of the state, together with the
                    situation of the departments of the auditor and treasurer, it was deemed advisable to make a
                    thorough examination and exhibit of those departments from the beginning of the state government up
                    to the first of January, 1824. To do this would require the constant labor of a master book-keeper
                    and accountant for something near thirty days. Numbers of the members of the legislature could have
                    ably performed that service but none of them were willing to leave the house and their other
                    business entirely to attend to that; hence it became necessary to employ some person to perform that
                    service. The Hon. Isaac 
                        Blackford
                     was called upon, and although the task was almost Herculean yet he undertook it and in
                    about thirty days went through both departments from the first day of the state government up to the
                    first day of January, 1824, and made a detailed report in writing, exhibiting in a clear, plain and
                    satisfactory manner the true situation of the financial concerns of the state. The report was a
                    document of great importance, inasmuch as it was the foundation of a new era in the management of
                    the departments of the auditor and treasurer of state. The treasury department at the beginning of
                    that session of the legislature was much embarrassed and pressed for payment, and the legislature
                    was compelled to provide either by the re-issue of treasury notes or by loan, the sum of about
                    $20,000 to meet the payments of the state debts which were then due and daily becoming
                    due. The governor had recommended a loan and that plan for raising the required amount was adopted,
                    without hesitation, and an act passed authorizing a loan of any sum not exceeding
                    $19,000.
            The re-issue of treasury notes were opposed on the ground well known to all, that there were no funds
                    to redeem them, and that it would have been countenancing the odious principle of banking without
                    capital which in their opinion would have been an indirect species of swindling. It was supposed  by some that the system of loaning might at first be unpopular,
                    but firmly believing that it was the only true policy which could be adopted by which the credit of
                    the state could be preserved, and that it would stand the test of honesty, wisdom and time, it was
                    finally adopted without a dissenting voice.
            A law was passed by that legislature removing the seat of government from Corydon to 
                        Indianapolis
                     on the first day of January, 1825; and the next General Assembly was to convene there
                    on the second Monday in January, 1825.
            That General Assembly was constituted as follows: The House of Representatives consisted of 27
                    farmers, 3 mechanics, 5 doctors, 1 private gentleman, 4 merchants and 6 lawyers, making in all 46
                    members. The Senate consisted of 11 farmers, 2 tavern-keepers, 1 doctor, 1 merchant, and 3 lawyers,
                    making in all 18 members, including the lieutenant governor.
            At that session of the legislature the votes cast for and against the calling of a convention to
                    change the constitution of the state were examined and officially announced as follows: No
                    convention, 11,991; convention, 2,601; majority against a convention, 9,390. Nearly half the
                    counties neglected to make returns to the secretary of state.
            The financial operations of the state treasury for the year 1824 were more successful than was
                    anticipated by the most sanguine. Of the $19,000 supposed to be necessary to be procured
                    by loans only $5,971 was procured, and of that sum $975 was seminary funds
                    unemployed in the treasury. So beneficial to the treasury was the change of system that the current
                    expenditures were more easily and promptly met with that amount than they were the previous year by
                    a re-issue of $15,000 of treasury notes; and with the additional advantage, that on the
                    expenditures authorized by the legislature of the previous year the state paid interest on
                    $5,971 only, while on that authorized by the legislature at its preceding session
                    interest was paid on $15,000. In addition the public credit was maintained, the currency
                    restored to soundness and much of the public expenditure economized, in proportion as the currency
                    was rescued from depreciation.
            The receipts into the treasury during the year 1824  amounted to
                    $40,435.94, by which the treasury notes were redeemed in good faith, and the audited
                    warrants paid, and there was on the 10th of January, 1825, in the treasury in available funds
                    $12,508.
            The state debt amounted on the 1st of January, 1824, to $27,044.19. On the 1st of January,
                    1825, it amounted to $17,499.17 exclusive of interest. That indebtedness consisted of
                    $4,655 treasury notes then in circulation, $5,971 loan, $5,000 of
                    which the state owed to roads and canals and $1,373.17 on bonds transferred to the
                    treasury of the 
                        United States
                    . The state debt on the 10th of January, 1825, exclusive of interest, exceeded the
                    actual cash in the treasury, $4,991.15.
            The revenue for 1824, after deducting the per cent for collecting amounted to $39,294.86.
                    The current expenditures of the year 1825 were estimated not to exceed $21,000, and a
                    reduction of all contingent expenses was confidently expected.
            Sometime in the spring of 1824, the murder of some Indians on the frontier settlements of the state,
                    by whites, created a great sensation in the northern portion of the state. The perpetrators of that
                    murder were arrested and imprisoned in 
                        Madison
                     county. As 
                        Madison
                     county was a new county, sparsely settled, having no public buildings, it became
                    necessary for want of a proper jail in which to keep the prisoners, to maintain a guard over them
                    for safe keeping. The expenses of keeping up such guard from the month of March, 1824 until some
                    time in January, 1825, considering the newness of the county the sparseness of its population and
                    the deleterious effects of the case on its general prosperity the governor, in his message to the
                    legislature on its convening at 
                        Indianapolis
                    , on the 10th of January, 1825, recommended that the expenses incident to the safe
                    keeping of the prisoners for which the county might be liable, be paid out of the state treasury.
            The further details of this most unpleasant transaction appear to be that James Hudson, one of the
                    persons charged with the murder of Logan, an Indian chief, was at the October term, 1824, of the 
                        Madison
                     county circuit court, convicted and sentenced to be executed on the first day of
                    December, 1824; that previous to the day appointed for his execution he  escaped from prison, and that he might not escape the punishment of his
                    crimes by becoming a fugitive from justice, the time of his execution was, on the suggestion of the
                    presiding judge and the prosecuting attorney of that court, respited and postponed by the governor
                    of the state till the 12th of January, 1825.
            Whether the prisoner, James Hudson, was ever retaken and made expiate for his crimes by being
                    executed, the writer does not know.
            As a part of the history of the "slavery" controversy which has been brought to an
                    end by having slavery prohibited by the constitution of the 
                        United States
                    , it may be something new to many and may bring to the minds of others who have
                    forgotten it to here state that in 1824 the legislature of 
                        Georgia
                     passed a resolution proposing an amendment to the constitution of the 
                        United States
                     which would prohibit "the importation or ingress of any person of color into
                    any one of the 
                        United States
                    , contrary to the laws of such State;" and that resolutions were passed in 
                        Ohio
                     and 
                        Maine
                     disapproving of that resolution.
            The legislature of 
                        Ohio
                     about the same time adopted resolutions recommending to the legislatures of the several
                    states and to the congress of the 
                        United States
                    , a system providing for the gradual emancipation of slaves, and recommending the
                    passage of an act by the general government (with the consent of the slave holding states), by which
                    the children of such persons born after the passage of such act should on certain conditions be free
                    at the age of twenty-one years. These resolutions were received by the governor of Indiana and were
                    accompanied with requests that they be laid before the legislature of the state.
            In the legislature which met at 
                        Indianapolis
                     in January, 1825, 
                        Switzerland county
                     was represented in the Senate jointly with 
                        Ripley
                     county by George Craig, the father of Mrs. Tabitha 0. Kyle, and in the house as before
                    stated by Stephen C. Stevens and William Gard. In the Senate James Dill, of 
                        Dearborn county
                    , was elected secretary and John H. Farnham, of Clark county, was elected assistant
                    secretary. In the House Henry P. Thornton, of Scott county, was elected clerk and James 
                        Franklin
                     Doughty Lanier was elected assistant  secretary.
                    For the purpose of showing how the population of the counties has changed since then as shown by the
                    representation of some of the counties in the legislature then and now. Then 
                        Switzerland county
                     had two representatives and a senator jointly with 
                        Ripley
                     county. Now 
                        Switzerland county
                     is entitled to a representative jointly with 
                        Ohio county
                     and a senator jointly with 
                        Ripley
                     county. 
                        Ripley
                     county then had one representative and now has one, and one jointly with Jefferson
                    county. Then 
                  Hamilton, Marion, Madison
               , Henry,
                            
                  Shelby, Decatur
               , Rush and Johnson counties were entitled to one senator jointly, and
                            
                  Marion, Hamilton
                and 
                        Madison
                     were jointly entitled to one representative, and 
                  Decatur, Shelby
               , Rush and Henry were
                    jointly entitled to one representative. Now each of those counties is entitled to one senator with
                    one or two exceptions, and one county to two senators; each of them have one or more
                    representatives. Then 
                  Wayne, Randolph
                and Allen counties had one senator. Now each 
                        Wayne
                     and Allen have a senator. Then 
                        Wayne
                     had three representatives, now two, and in fact the whole state north of the second
                    tier of counties from the 
                        Ohio
                     river has settled and been organized into counties which have a stronger representation
                    in the state legislature than any of the counties on the 
                        Ohio
                     river, which would seem to establish the fact that that portion of the state last
                    organized into counties is better adapted to agriculture than those nearer the 
                        Ohio
                     river, thence the reason of their becoming more densely populated, and therefore
                    entitled to greater representation in our legislature.
            With the assembling of the legislature for the first time at the future permanent seat of government,
                    a host of persons came also seeking as usual to be officers and waiters on the noble representatives
                    of the people, as well as of the good people of the state, some who were willing for the good of the
                    people to exchange good, fat honorable offices for better ones, and many others who had none at all,
                    willing to take upon themselves the duties of any officer, provided they were well paid for it. Some
                    men in those days for a little money and an easy berth were willing to do anything to make an honest
                    living. How much better it would have been for many of those stout, able-bodied fellows, if they had
                    turned into the woods as many were doing and there have laid the axe at the  root of the tree, and have assisted in clearing away the rubbish. They
                    would have then have been doing permanent service to themselves, their families and the state, too.
                    But this would have been hard work, they did not like to undertake it. If they were talked to on the
                    subject, they would say "I cannot do it; my family would not like it,
                    &c.," making an hundred excuses to turn the subject to that of the favorite
                    subject, an office. One wished to go to the 
                        United States
                     senate, B. wished to be secretary of state, C. supreme or presiding judge, and so on to
                    the end of the alphabet.
            Then would come a long story to enlist the feelings of the representative addressed in favor of the
                    office seeker. One had been unfortunate; one was poor; one has a large family to maintain; with a
                    long list of arguments which had already become as familiar as the old mail carrier's horn,
                    when he had arrived in the vicinity of your postoffice. These things have not changed as rapidly as
                    many other things within the state and nation, for at every assembling of our legislatures there are
                    about half a dozen office seekers for each member, and instead of this thirst for office abating it
                    only increases as the population increases, and will continue increasing until every man shall be
                    compelled to take his turn in discharging the duties of the offices for a mere pittance as our grand
                    and traverse jurors are compelled to serve, each one taking his turn.
            Not long since the writer was looking over an old paper and came across the following notice, which
                    is given here as a specimen of what was done in Indiana nearly fifty years ago; the article reads
                    thus: 
                        DISGRACEFUL
                        Married—A few days since, in the vicinity of this place, by Abel Thornberry, Esq.,
                            Obadiah Anderson, a man of color to Betsy Freeman, a white woman, formerly both of 
                                Brookville
                            .
                    
            
            If such transactions took place in Indiana fifty years ago, may we not expect to hear and see the
                    same transactions enacted in this, our day and generation. Whether true or false think and ponder on
                    the probabilities of such affairs being of frequent occurrence in our midst, and that before many
                    years roll around.
         
         
         
            INTERURBAN RAILROADS OF INDIANA
            By Glen A. Blackburn, 
                        Indianapolis
                    
            
            Southern Indiana Gas & Electric Company
            
            September 18, 1901, the 
                        Evansville
                     & 
                        Princeton
                     Traction company ($10,000) was incorporated by 
                        Evansville
                     and 
                        Richmond
                     men.1 By September, 1902, construction on the 28-mile line had
                    advanced sufficiently to begin laying rails. The overhead construction and ballasting were not
                    finished until next year; and difficulties in connecting the substation power plants delayed the
                    opening of the line until December 8, 1903. The company desired that the line be extended north to 
                        Indianapolis
                     either by building to 
                        Vincennes
                     and 
                        Terre Haute
                     to make connection with the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Terre Haute
                     line under construction, or by building northeast toward 
                        Indianapolis
                    .2 The men proposed to build from 
                        Princeton
                     to Petersburg and also construct branch lines to Owensville, Poseyville and 
                        New Harmony
                    . The Murdocks and Marshalls of 
                        Lafayette
                    , who already controlled the 
                        Evansville
                     city lines, proposed the plan of building from 
                        Princeton
                     to 
                        Vincennes
                     and also to 
                        Washington
                     and Petersburg with that purpose, on June 28, 1906, the 
                  Evansville, Princeton
                & 
                        Vincennes
                     Interurban Railway company ($1,500,000) was incorporated. June 30 the stock
                    of the 
                        Evansville
                     & 
                        Princeton
                     Traction company passed into the hands of the new company and two years later the line
                    came under the control of its new owners.
            On December 24 of the same year a $4,500,000 corporation, the 
                        Evansville
                     & Southern Indiana Traction company was in corporated to take over the 
                        Evansville
                     city lines and the 
                  
                     1 The incorporators were Fred 
                                Van

                     2 Adopting the latter plan, the directors of the 
                                Evansville
                             & 
                                Princeton
                             Traction company who now were Joseph S. Heston, Samuel T. Hexton, Ed J.

                                Princeton
                            ; and Pinkney S. Armstrong of Owensville, incorporated July 20, 1904 the
                                    
                        Evansville, Princeton
                      & 
                                Indianapolis
                             Railway company ($12,000.)

                    -
                        Evansville
                     railway and build others, probably from 
                        Evansville
                     to 
                        Louisville
                    .3 The new company took over the interurban line and the 
                        Evansville
                     city railway properties at once. February 1, 1907, a $4,000,000 mortgage was
                    executed to the Trust Company of North America at 
                        Philadelphia
                     to retire old bonds and make improvements on the line.
            Within a few months the line between 
                        Evansville
                     and Darmstadt was straightened; and as a step in the plan of building to 
                        Vincennes
                    , the company began the construction of an extension from 
                        Princeton
                     to Patoka. By February 1, 1908, the grading was done and within a few months the
                    extension was placed in operation. October 1, 1908, the survey from Patoka to Hazelton was begun and
                    in the same month the directors voted to construct the line to 
                        Terre Haute
                     in the spring. A strike of the operators, together with financial losses,4 need for new ties and rails, which had caused the State Railroad commission to list the
                    line as "dead," made the financing of the extension impossible.5 In the summer of 1915 the proposal of the 
                        Terre Haute
                     extension was fruitlessly revived. A line from 
                        Evansville
                     would be a very desirable improvement because of the through traffic that could be
                    carried between the two large cities. Short lines radiating from a city never prove as profitable as
                    lines which obtain through traffic between two large cities and secure the local traffic as an
                    incident without much extra car service.
            Because more power was needed and it seemed inadvisable to construct a new and larger power plant the 
                        Evansville
                     & Southern Indiana Traction company merged with the 
                        Evansville
                     Public Service company in March, 1912.6 After a suit in circuit
                    court the merger was sustained and approved by the State Commerce commission January 5, 1917.7 June 10, 1912, the Public Service company of 
                        Evansville
                    , a six million dollar

            In the fall of 1899 there were rumors of foreign capital being interested in lines through 
                        Shelbyville
                     and leading out of 
                        Indianapolis

                    assembled for the purpose of encouraging the promoters.1 The first corporation
                    formed to build a line through

                    was done a controlling interest in the company was sold by Dr. Light to C. L. Henry, who had been
                    the moving spirit in the Union Traction company and was now interested in the

                     entire right-of-way from 
                        Indianapolis
                     to 
                  Hamilton, Ohio
               , was secured and the contract for the southern end let.
                    Effort was concentrated on the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Rushville
                     section, however, and on February 20, 1905, the track was opened for an irregular
                    schedule. The 
                        Connersville
                     extension was completed October 28, 1906.9
            
            Before the road had been completed to 
                        Connersville
                    , the directors of the company petitioned for a receiver, averring that the 
                        Rushville
                     and 
                        Shelbyville
                     divisions were showing gratifying increases in revenues, but, in order to meet damage
                    suits and costs of the extension, it was necessary to convert the bond issue into preferred stock or
                    second mortgage bonds, thereby making them more readily sold. Upon a request of the petitioners, Mr.
                    Henry was appointed receiver, July 3, 1906.
            After more than four years of effort Receiver Henry filed a report in August, 1910, stating that
                    reorganization had failed.10 The trustees for the investors wished to buy the
                    two millions of gold bonds outstanding at the rate of $1,200 new stock for each
                    $1,000, but the owners of $21,000 in bonds refused to submit to cancellation.
                    Furthermore, the holders of receiver's certificates which had been issued to complete the 
                        Greensburg
                     extension, refused to accept regular bonds in payment for the certificates. The
                    receiver asked for a judicial sale.
            Accordingly, November 10, 1910, the road was offered for sale and was purchased by John J. Appel for
                    the investors at the upset price of $1,045,000.11 The bond holders
                    who were the owners of the bankrupt line organized the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & 
                        Cincinnati
                     Traction Company with a capital stock of two million dollars common stock and one
                    million preferred stock. The new issue was used to cancel the two million dollars in bonds
                    outstanding and new bonds were issued to satisfy the receiver's certificates.12 The extension of the line to 
                        Cincinnati

                        Rushville

                     present time the citizens along the proposed line are
                    enthusiastic over the project, and as soon as financial conditions become more tranquil and bonds
                    can be placed an extension will probably be built from 
                        Rushville

            Evansville-Boonsville
            
            The 
                        Evansville
                    , Suburban & Newburg Railway company ($50,000) was incorporated
                    December 15, 1887, to build a steam line from 
                        Evansville
                     to Newburg and to Howell Station.1 Messrs. Howell and Wood
                    furnished the capital. The line to Newburg was constructed and operated as a steam line until March
                    9, 1904, when the stockholders voted to electrify the line. In 1905 an extension to Boonville was
                    begun and brought to completion in the spring of 1906.
            From 1907 until 1908 the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Traction company owning the Newburg-
                        Rockport
                     line operated its cars over the 
                        Evansville
                    -Newburg section of the 
                        Evansville
                    , Suburban & Newburg Railway company. A disagreement over division of fares
                    caused the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Electric railway to build its own line from 
                        Evansville
                    .
            From 1907 until 1911 there were plans made each spring to extend from Boonville to 
                        Oakland City
                    , Petersburg or northeast to Orleans and 
                        Mitchell
                    ; most of the agitation came from residents along the proposed routes. March 3, 1911,
                    the 
                        Evansville
                    , Chrisney & Eastern Railway ($50,000) was incorporated.2 In August the company surveyed a route from Boonville to Chrisney and in
                    April, 1912, some construction was done. In September a $400,000 bond issue was
                    authorized but nothing further was ever done with the project.

            In contrast to the failure to unite the traction system of Indiana with that of its western neighbor,
                    the McKinley system, connection with the 
                        Ohio
                     group was not only established early but was established at three different points.
                    While an 
                        Ohio
                     company,1 the 
                        Dayton
                     & Western Traction Company, was promoting and building a line from 
                        Dayton
                     to Eaton, 
                        Ohio
                    , traction men of Indiana were endeavoring to raise capital and secure subsidies and
                    franchises for a line from 
                        Richmond
                     to Eaton, 
                        Ohio
                    . A group of men headed by Dr. Lowes, the promoter of the 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               -Union City line, demanded a $100,000 subsidy at 
                        Richmond
                     in the fall of 1898; Frederick Wesson, a 
                        New York
                     millionaire, and Henry Dinden of 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , purchased part
                    of the right-of-way for a line and placed orders for part of the material in the spring of 1900.2 The owners of the 
                        Richmond
                     city railway line organized the 
                        Dayton

                        Richmond
                     Traction company and were given some franchises over the route.3
                    April 22, 1902, several Greenville, 
                        Ohio
                    , men incorporated a company which was to build from 
                        Richmond
                     to Greenville, 
                        Ohio

                        Dayton
                    -Eaton), was acquired by Valentine Winters of 
                  Dayton, Ohio
               , and extended to
                    the state line. Then, in order to build in Indiana to 
                        Richmond
                     a charter in this state was obtained December 7, 1903, for the 
                        Dayton
                     & Western Traction company of Indiana.5 After completion of
                    the roadway, the Indiana company was leased by the 
                        Ohio
                     parent line. The Schoepf-McGowan interests were eager to buy the road but refused to
                    pay the $3,000,000 which was asked.6 They selected another route and declared that a
                    competing line would be built.7 In the

                    , Suburban and Newburg railway was already operating but no other lines were constructed
                    until after the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Electric railway ($410,000) was incorporated April 9,
                        1904.4 September, 1904, the capital was increased to $600,000 to
                    defray construction expenses; but it was not until the spring of 1907 that the line was completed
                    from Newburg to 
                        Rockport
                    .5 The cars entered 
                        Evansville
                     over the tracks of the 
                        Evansville
                    , Suburban & Newburg railway until 1908. In 1907 a branch from Richland Junction
                    to Richland was begun and completed by the first of October. There was much sentiment in favor of
                    continuing the branch to Chrisney; in April, 1910, the town of Chrisney offered a bonus of
                    $20,000 and free right-of-way and grading if the project would be begun. A
                    $14,000 subsidy was voted in 
                        Hammond
                     township, 
                        Spencer
                     county, to aid the extension of the line from 
                        Rockport
                     to Grandview, St. Meinrad, Ferdinand and either Huntingsburg or 
                        Jasper

                    directors of the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Electric Railway company had made some eastern surveys. In the spring
                    of 1908 the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Electric Railway company surveyed routes to Tell City,
                            
                  Troy, Cannelton
                and Corydon and was so much encouraged by several subsidies
                    being voted that it incorporated the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern railway ($10,000) September 31, 1908, as a sub-corporation
                    for the purpose of building the eastern extension.6 In April of the next year
                    the route from 
                        Rockport
                     to Grandview was re-surveyed; in June construction was begun by the Tennis Construction
                    company; and in January, 1910, the six and one-half mile extension was completed.
            Mention has been made elsewhere of the trackage rights of the 
                        Evansville

                        Evansville
                    , Suburban & Newburg railway; as a result of a disagreement over the
                    distribution of receipts the 
                        Evansville
                     Terminal railway ($200,000) was incorporated March 7, 1908, by stockholders
                    in the 
                        Evansville
                     & Eastern Electric railway and by other 
                        Evansville
                     capitalists for the purpose of building a separate track over which the 
                        Rockport
                     cars could enter 
                        Evansville
                    . July 14 construction began upon the ten mile link and was finished late that year.7 The 
                        Evansville
                    , Suburban & Newburg failed in circuit court in an appeal to the State supreme
                    court to compel the 
                        Evansville
                     Terminal railway to use the former's track for a city entrance.

            Winona Interurban Railway Company
            
            The 
                        Winona
                     Interurban railway grew out of the need for a north and south railway running through 
                        Warsaw
                     where Winona Lake and its numerous assemblies could be easily
                    reached. The line is called the "connecting link" because it connects the north
                    and central traction systems of Indiana. In spite of its inviting prospects the line is not now a
                    good investment; it carries a few local passengers near Peru, Akron, 
                        Warsaw
                     and 
                        Elkhart
                     and so few through passengers except during the special seasons at the Park that the
                    abandonment of the line has been seriously considered. It is now in the hands of a receiver. The 
                        Winona
                     & 
                        Warsaw
                     Railway company, incorporated October 30, 1902, gave connection between the city of 
                        Warsaw
                     and the Lake. The cars were operated at first by a small steam engine.1
            
            July 5, 1904, the 
                        Winona
                     Interurban Railway company ($10,000) was incorporated to build from 
                        Wabash

                        Goshen

                    $500,000 was incorporated to construct lines of railways from 
                        Warsaw

                    object was to build the Peru-
                        Warsaw
                    -
                        Goshen
                     line.3 That summer work started on the route north from 
                        Warsaw
                     and in June, 1906, cars began to run. Work began on the south line in May, 1906. Much
                    difficulty was met in grading the region around Mentone because of the sinking of the grade; the
                    ground was so soft that ox teams wre used in places.
            For the Peru-Chili section the company leased the old Eel River railroad which
                    was nine miles long and included a $40,000 bridge several years old.4
                    The piece of line was electrified and began operations in May, 1907.5 In
                    January, 1908, cars ran as far north from Peru as Akron; the 
                        Warsaw
                    -Mentone section was opened in March, 1909, and February 4, 1910, the first Peru-
                        Warsaw
                     car ran over the 69 mile line that connected two of the great interurban systems in
                        Indiana.6
            
            The line was built by bond issues, the stock being held by directors of the 
                        Winona
                     Assembly and representing control only. All dividends were to be paid into the
                    endowment funds of the colleges at 
                        Winona
                    .7 Being promoted and owned by a religious association, there was
                    much agitation over the Sunday operation of cars.8 It was rumored several times
                    that connecting electric and steam lines, realizing the profit to be obtained from the Sunday
                    traffic that would be carried to and from such a popular resort, endeavored to force seven-day
                    operation, and failing, sought to buy the line. Certain directors tabled all motions pertaining to
                    Sunday operation whenever they were proposed. In June, 1908, the Electrical Installations company of 
                        Chicago
                     entered a bill of complaint against the 
                        Winona
                     Interurban railway, the 
                        Winona
                     Assembly Summer Schools Association and the 
                        Warsaw
                     & 
                        Winona
                     Railway company asking that the companies be compelled to operate their lines seven
                    days a week and petitioning for a receiver.

            The plaintiff alleged that there had been a verbal agreement to operate on Sunday.9 The ground for complaint was that the railway, because of insufficient traffic, could not
                    pay interest on $425,000 in bonds which the builders had received as part payment. After
                    a bitter struggle the directors voted to appease the complainant by operating seven days a week;
                    accordingly, Sunday service was inaugurated March 9, 1909.10 June, 1907, the

                     company had charge of the building of the line. The section
                    between

                        Van
                     Buren was completed first and on the first day of December the entire line between 
                        Marion
                     and Bluffton was finished. July 1, 1907, the 
                        Marion
                    , Bluffton & Eastern Traction company assumed control.
            September 26, 1908, the first through car was operated from 
                        Kokomo
                     to Bluffton over the tracks of the

                & Western
                    Traction company and the 
                        Marion
                    , Bluffton & Eastern Traction company. A site was purchased for a joint freight

                    .
            Two years after the completion of the line the Moore-Mansfield Construction company, alleging that
                    $50,000 was yet unpaid on the construction contract, instituted a suit in equity to
                    recover that amount.3 The expense of laying new ties and reballasting the
                    roadbed, which the Indiana Railroad commission had ordered, and the interest on the
                    $850,000 trust deed was more than the company could pay since no sinking fund was
                    maintained. On July 7, 1912, a wreck near 
                        Marion
                     caused many damage claims which further embarrassed the company.4
                    July 24, 1912, the court appointed a receiver who operated the road for nearly two years. June 1,
                    1914, the stockholders reorganized for the purpose of refinancing the line. The capital was reduced
                    to $216,000.5 July 1,1914, the new 
                        Marion
                     & Bluffton Traction company assumed control of the line. There are seven
                    directors of the company at the present time.6 Thirty-three miles of track are
                    owned by the 
                        Marion
                     & Bluffton Traction company, and seven passenger and two freight cars are
                    operated.

            Gary Street Railway
            
            The most stupendous project in Indiana in electric railways was the 
                        Chicago
                    -
                        New York
                     Electric Airline Railroad company ($1,000,000).1 The
                    route chosen between the two cities was 742 miles long and was claimed to be 200 miles shorter than
                    any steam line. The promoters promised to carry passengers between the two points for a fare of
                    $10. The syndicate endeavored to purchase the city lines along the route in order to
                    provide ready and suitable entrances to the various cities through which the line was to pass.
            One of the subsidiary companies, which was organized to construct the piece of roadway between 
                        Goshen
                     and Gary, was the 
                  Goshen, South Bend
                & 
                        Chicago
                     Railroad company, 1,485 of whose shares were owned by the Airline company.2 The Laporte-Gary section was begun first. In March, 1908, upon petition of
                    2,000 shares of capital stock, a receiver was appointed for the Airline3 after
                    charges of unfair practices were placed against the president of the company, but the order for
                    receiver was vacated by motion of the Airline's attorneys twenty-four hours after being
                        issued.4
            
            The line westward from Laporte was operated as far as Westerville in 1908; the grade to Chesterton
                    was completed in December, 1910, and a few months later cars began running. Operation ceased within
                    a few months and the line was permanently abandoned.5

                    gap by building from Gary to Woodville Junction. This railway was begun in 1911 and placed in
                    operation in July, 1912. Very soon afterwards the railway was merged into the Gary &
                    Interurban railway and was operated in connection with the

                     that summer.3 In the spring of 1910 the enlarged plan included a line to 
                        Portland
                     and for that purpose a million dollar mortgage was executed with a 
                        Dayton
                     bonding company. The plans failed, only to be revived the next summer after which

                        Toledo

                        Chicago
                     scheme. In January, 1907, nine miles of right-of-way between Waterloo and 
                        Butler
                     was condemned. On the 21st of the same month the capitalists in the 
                        Toledo
                     & Indiana Traction company incorporated under the laws of Indiana. The
                    authorized capital stock was $100,000.9 The 
                        Ohio
                     corporation built the line now operating between 
                        Toledo
                     and Bryan, 
                        Ohio
                    . The extension of the line west from Bryan was halted by a struggle for supremacy in
                    the directory; the company was unable to pay the contractors of the finished section and finally had
                    its properties sold by the receiver, C. M. F. Miles, January 18, 1910.10 C. S.
                    Schenck, representing the bondholders, bought the holdings and turned them over to the 
                        Toledo
                     & Indiana railway ($10,000).11 Since the sale of
                    the road there has been nothing done toward a western extension.
            The newly completed 
                        Toledo
                     & 
                        Chicago
                     railway owed a total of $540,000 which seemed too large an indebtedness to
                    pay and the company saw no means of building the line into 
                        Chicago
                    . Upon recommendation of W. L. Taylor, a stockholder, the circuit court appointed James
                    D. Mortimer receiver on January 1, 1908.12 After four years of management by
                    receiver the road was sold because of inability to pay interest on bonds13 and
                    the owners were reorganized as the Ft.

            In Lake county several condemnation suits were instituted to appropriate land for the roadway.
                    Several rival companies contested the city franchises, for the Calumet region was at that time
                    becoming an important manufacturing region and offered a fertile field to the promoter of suburban
                    railways.

                        Illinois
                     Central railroad, in order to secure an entrance for its limited cars. Arrangements
                    were completed and cars began entering 
                        Chicago
                     in April, 1909.18 The traffic was so heavy that it was necessary to
                    double-track the road from Gary to Pullman, 
                        Illinois

                    $4,427,000, due in 1916 but still outstanding by mutual agreement, is held by the 
                        Cleveland
                     Trust company, who also holds 49,985 shares of stock. The road has a heavy traffic: in
                    1912-13 the gross receipts totaled $469,410, leaving a net profit of $29,088;
                    in 1921 the receipts had nearly doubled and the net profit was $296,696.20

                     Traction company ($10,000) November 12, 1908. Ground was broken at Hobart,
                    May 14, 1909. Some bonds were sold after a short piece of track had been graded but the promoters
                    were unable to further interest capital in the scheme.
            U. P. Hord and J. B. Price, of 
                  Aurora, Illinois
               , organized the Gary, Hobart &
                    Eastern Traction company which was incorporated January 27, 1911.23 Part of the
                    five mile right-of way was donated. The short line was first operated in 1912 by gasoline electric
                    cars which proved too heavy for the roadway and were abandoned. After suspending operations for two
                    years, the bonds of the road were pooled and, with the financial assistance of Aldia T. Ewing, of 
                        Chicago
                    , the line was electrified. The company was thrown into receivership after one
                    year's operation and sold to Mr. Ewing and William Earle in the spring of 1917.24 The line of the reorganized company, now known as the Gary & Hobart
                    Traction company, is operated as a part of the Gary Street Railway company.25

            May 25, 1908, the Gary & Southern Traction company ($10,000) was incorporated.26 Mr. Seaman furnished the capital for the proposed line. Work started the next
                    summer, but very little was done until April, 1911. In January, 1912, cars began running between the
                    steel mills in Gary and Lottas-ville, a distance of eight miles.27 The southern
                    extension to Crownpoint was pushed rapidly, so that on the 30th day of June the line from Gary to
                    Crownpoint was formally opened.

            Nothing has ever been done toward the proposed extension of the line to Cedar Lake, 
                        Lowell

            The Gary & Southern Traction company operates three passenger and one flat car over its
                    eleven miles of racks. The capital stock was raised August 11, 1911, to $300,000 which is
                    divided into equal parts of common and preferred stock. October 1, 1916, the bonded indebtedness was
                    reduced from $250,000 to $150,000, which is now outstanding. The original
                    directors are now serving except Mr. Wood who has been replaced by C. L. Wildermuth.29

            Although interurban cars began running into 
                        Indianapolis
                     from Greenwood on January 1, 1900, over the tracks of the Citizens Street Railway
                    company by virtue of a franchise granted the 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Greenwood & 
                        Franklin
                     Railroad company the question of whether each interurban must build its own private
                    track or all use the then existing city lines, was not brought to the front until several months
                    later when the number of prospective lines into the city made it necessary to establish a policy. If
                    each company constructed its own entrance the city was threatened with an unsightly and dangerous
                    network of tracks; 
                        Indianapolis
                     residents opposed such a scheme. On the other hand the use of the city street car lines
                    would hamper the service of both the city and intercity cars. The city railway asked a larger rent
                    than the interurban officials thought reasonable. City officials, with the eye always open for new
                    ways of obtaining public revenues, obdurately refused to grant any more franchises for use of city
                    lines or for private right-of-ways unless the contracts provided for a certain desired car rate. The
                    Union Traction company accepted the terms of the city officials with very little protest, while the
                    other lines waged a fight for a reduced rate. In March, 1900, Mr. C. L. Henry1,
                    W. G. Irwin2 and W. N. 
                  
                     28 Jitney competition has recently caused the officials of the Gary
                            & Southern Traction company to consider seriously the abandonment of services.

                     Harding3 sought franchises before the board
                    of works. The question of taxes dragged on until November, 1901, when the 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Greenwood &

                     Rapid Transit company, Central Traction company (
                        Indianapolis
                    -Peru), 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Martinsville Rapid Transit company and 
                  Indianapolis, Shelbyville
               
                    & Southeastern Traction company filed a petition for a franchise to build a single line for
                    all petitioners, to construct a union station and common car barns and to charge a three cent fare
                    inside the city limits with transfers.4 The companies argued that unless they
                    owned and operated their own tracks it was illegal for the city to tax them, because, if they paid
                    to the city railway, which was already taxed, any direct interurban tax would be double taxation.
            By March, 1902, there Were two more companies in the contest: 
                  Indianapolis, Lebanon
                & 
                        Frankfort
                     Traction company and the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Western Traction company, and, as the board of works was strongly opposed to
                    any more tracks being constructed, the lines petitioned for a terminal site franchise and the
                    privilege of using the city railway tracks under terms of separate agreements. It was urged that the
                    city railway company build the terminal building and that instead of the various interurban lines
                    being taxed, a single equivalent tax directed against the terminal company be levied. The blocking
                    of streets by waiting interurban cars had already caused the city officials to demand that the
                    interurban companies provided a yard or shed where all the cars could be stored and loaded.
            July 26,1902, a franchise was agreed upon by the attorneys for the Citizens Street Railway company
                    and the city permitting the use by the interurbans of the tracks of the city railway company, which
                    was to build a union terminal station within the rectangle bounded by 
                        New York
                    , Senate, 
                        Georgia

                        New Jersey
                     or East streets. All companies signed the contract, which was dated August 4, and which
                    required a tax of one cent per car for thirty-one years.5 While this

                     franchise was being discussed, Mr. George J. Marott offered to
                    build a terminal station and construct a belt line around the business district and offered a large
                    cash price for the charter.6
            
            The 
                        Indianapolis
                     Traction & Terminal company franchise was ratified by the city council and
                    signed by the mayor August 16, 1902. The tax paid by the Terminal company on cars was four cents per
                    car for the first eleven years; six cents for the following ten years; and nine cents for the last
                    ten years of the duration of the franchise.7 There were several proposed sites
                    for the terminal station: the northwest corner of Capitol and Market; the southwest corner of 
                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Illinois

                        Maryland
                     and 
                        Pennsylvania

                  Maryland,
                            Illinois

                        Kentucky
                     streets; and at the location of St. Mary's church and contiguous territory.8 The Miller Block was purchased in December, 1902, for $475,000,9 and the entire area surrounded by 
                        Illinois
                    , Market, Capitol and 
                        Ohio
                     streets was razed except the northeast and southwest quarters.

                        Indianapolis
                     Traction & Terminal company increased its capitalization to five million
                    dollars and December 30, 1912, leased the Citizens Street railway.10 Of the
                    capital stock $1,500,000 was given as a bonus to the lessor who was also to receive 21/2%
                    dividends during 1903 and 1% increase each year until 1907, when 6% should thereafter be the rate.
                    Hugh McGowan resigned the presidency of the city railway company and was elected to the same office
                    in the Terminal company. H. P. Wasson and James M. Jones were vice-presidents; W. Kesley Schoepf,
                    Arthur Brady and John J. Appel were also directors; $25,000 was filed by the company for
                    fulfillment of lease.
            An architect, D. H. Burham, of 
                        Chicago

                    bids was rejected because they were thought to be too high. In July contracts were let.

            September 12, 1904, the Terminal building was opened to the public. Such a station used by all the
                    lines radiating from 
                        Indianapolis
                     facilitated the transfer of passengers and freight and the ownership by one company of
                    all electric rail entrances to the city made regulation of interurban traffic much more simple.
                    Interline tickets were sold after July 1, 1905; and by the same month all interurban companies had
                    occupied freight offices in the Terminal building. The Terminal company enjoyed a profitable
                    revenue, as evidenced by the voluntary raise in wages of employees in November, 1905, while other
                    companies were complaining of "hard times".11

                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company purchased 95% of
                    the capital stock of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Traction & Terminal company. The Terminal Realty company, which now operates a
                    freight depot in the same square west of the Terminal building, was incorporated November 9, 1916.
                    December 2, the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company leased it for
                    twenty years and sub-leased it to the 
                        Indianapolis
                     Street Railway company.
            There were frequent controversies over the hauling of freight over the down town streets and over the
                    question of rates. After a series of conferences between railway officials and a committee of
                    merchants, of which J. L. Keach was chairman, an agreement was made in August, 1902, fixing the
                    minimum rate at 80% and the maximum at 100% of the steam railroad tarigs of January 1, 1902, for
                    first, second, third and fourth class freight. No live stock could be hauled through the city
                    between 12:30 P. M. and 4:30 A. M.12 The interurban lines were required by their
                    franchises to carry freight, though a few cases were reported when freight was refused.13
            
            Present Status of the Interurban Railway
            
            During the first few years of the present century Indiana had a more extensive and better organized
                    system of electric railways than any other state in the Union, and, it was sometimes

                    one of the first states to develop electric traction she is not so favored in population and
                    geographic conditions as others. The interurbans spread over the state rapidly. The rapid rise and
                    decline of interest in electric railway building is difficult to account for. The first to
                    demonstrate that electric traction was a feasible means of transportation over rough country
                    districts as well as over city streets, were the lines constructed around 
                        Marion
                     and Anderson in 1898 and 1899, and from 
                        South Bend
                     to 
                        Goshen
                     in 1899. These lines returned a larger profit than their builders expected and
                    immediately there was a rush to obtain franchises and charters authorizing the construction of lines
                    that would likewise surely reward the builders most lavishly. The very suddenness with which this
                    conviction swept the investing public probably caused men to be carried away with undue enthusiasm.
                    The energy of each promoter's neighbor excited him all the more, until an astonishing
                    proportion of citizens in the commonwealth were sanguinely awaiting rich reward each from his
                    $100 share of capital stock. The first five years of the twentieth century was the most
                    active period; as a writer in the 
                  
                            Indianapolis
                         Sentinel said concerning these early years, "The people of the Gas
                    Belt count that day lost whose sun in setting, shines on no new electric railway scheme."
            The earlier promotions took place in the Gas Belt and the larger cities. Each group of promoters had
                    its rivals; and when the competition became too strong in those places the small towns in the less
                    densely populated districts were visited by the ubiquitous surveyor or way-getter. The vast number
                    of schemes that progressed so far as to secure charters and franchises and to sell enough of the
                    capital stock to make a survey is a remarkable fact. In general the first promotions and most of the
                    later ones projected in the small towns contemplated short lines. This fact betrays the prevalent
                    idea that electric railways were adapted to short hauls. The carrying of freight and through
                    traffic, it was thought, could never be wrested from the powerful steam roads who were already on
                    the ground. A few years’ experience convinced traction men that the electric railways
                    were adapted to long hauls as well as short ones.
            
            The statutory right of interurbans to carry freight has been advocated and opposed many times. The 
                        Washington
                     Street merchants of 
                        Indianapolis
                     at first opposed the use of up town streets for freight cars;1 the
                    merchants sought to compel the electric lines to carry heavy freight four years later when one of
                    the lines entering 
                        Indianapolis
                     wished to abandon the service.2 The authority of interurbans to
                    carry freight was finally established by an act of the state legislature passed during the special
                    session of 1920.
            In 1907 the 
                        United States
                     Express company began using space in the cars of the 
                        Indianapolis
                     & Northwestern Traction company and the 
                        Winona
                     Interurban railway.2 The Ft. 
                        Wayne
                     & 
                        Wabash
                     Valley Traction company and the Murdock system around 
                        South Bend
                     soon afterwards signed contracts with the same company and were followed in May, 1909,
                    by the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company and the Indiana
                    Union Traction company.
            Like the steam roads the electric railways are depending more and more upon their freight traffic as
                    a source of income. Because the volume of the freight traffic and the operating cost per ton-mile is
                    more advantageous for long hauls, there is a considerable field for new business that the
                    interurbans can draw upon. During the last ten years the receipts from freight traffic have
                    increased much more rapidly than from the passenger traffic. For the fiscal year 1912-1913 the
                    Evans-ville, Suburban & Newburg railway earned $77,797 conveying passengers and
                    $43,795 freight hauling; in 1921 there was an increase of 194% in passenger receipts and
                    an increase of 256% in freight receipts.3
            
            It is now evident after pursuing the wrong policy from the beginning, that short radiating lines from
                    the larger cities ending at small towns can make but poor returns on an investment. Indiana has no
                    cities with suburban districts sufficiently large for a system of suburban railways such as
                            
                  Chicago, Philadelphia
               , and 
                        New York
                    .
            At last traction men realized the weakness of a short line and began extending and consolidating the
                    various units. At

                     the present time the best paying lines are those that connect
                    two large cities. The Interstate Public Service company, operating the 
                        Indianapolis
                    -
                        Louisville
                     line, connects cities with a combined population of 549,000. The company operates seven
                    limited trains daily, some with trailer, and maintains a schedule of one each hour as far as
                    Greenwood or 
                        Franklin
                    . In 1915 the company's gross earnings were $682,699 with a surplus
                    above all expenses of $99,061. During the period of the World war there was no deficit
                    while other companies were struggling to keep their funded debt payments from going by default. In
                    1920 the gross earnings were $2,232,694 and in 1921, $4,021,172, leaving above
                    all expenses a net profit of $207,229 for the last year. The eastern division of the
                            
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                Eastern connects cities with a total population of
                    467,000; but 
                        Dayton
                     is not a city with as extensive a commerce as the 
                        Ohio
                     river city. 
                        Terre Haute
                    , a city of 66,000 population, is not large enough for a good terminus. The cities of
                            
                  Noblesville, Tipton, Kokomo
               , and Peru are not
                    large; but the line connecting them, and the east and west divisions of the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern are among the best paying lines in the
                    state. The least profitable are the short lines that have a small city for a terminus; such are the
                    lines to Martinsville, 
                  Greensburg, Connersville
               , Danyule, 
                        Crawfordsville

                        Newcastle
                    . Besides the short spurs that center in 
                        Indianapolis
                     there are four short ones out of 
                        Evansville
                    , three from 
                        Terre Haute
                    , two from Ft. 
                        Wayne
                    , and a spur from 
                        Muncie
                     to 
                        Portland

            The map of interurban railways in the state impresses the observer with the need for several
                    connections to obtain more through traffic. There are hopes and plans nearly every year for the
                    realization of these extensions, but there is no money available for the construction of interurban
                    lines. The

                        Terre Haute
                     lines should be joined at 
                        Vincennes
                    ; connection should be established between

                  Toledo, Ohio
               , by closing the
                    gap to Bryan, 
                        Ohio
                    ; Anderson and 
                        Newcastle
                     should be joined by completing the Anderson-
                        Middletown
                     spur; and 
                        Lafayette
                     should make connection either with 
                  Danville, Illinois
               , or with
                    the Calumet region, though the latter extension would be of doubtful success because of the few
                    cities along the route.
            While these connections would reward the electric railway owners with a great increase in traffic,
                    there is small likli-hood of their construction because of the impossibility of financing any new
                    interurban project. Traction officials are unanimous in saying that no more new lines are needed;
                    only a few badly needed connections are advisable. The early builders invested so much capital in
                    unwise ventures that the industry must suffer enormous loss until it can without too much waste
                    abandon or connect the various units. The owners of the unprofitable ventures have been loathe to
                    abandon their lines because they hoped that ultimately the investment of so much capital would be
                    rewarded; but many of the short lines that are a financial burden must be abandoned.
            A powerful enemy was found in the steam roads who opposed the traction lines by every means that
                    could be employed. A railroad which had expended enormous sums of money upon its road-bed and
                    rolling stock very naturally considered the interurban an unscrupulous rival when it boldly built
                    its roadway alongside that of the older line. The operating charges of the railroad are nearly
                    constant, regardless of fluctuations in the volume of traffic; when the interurbans deprived the
                    steam lines of a portion of their passenger and light freight traffic it would seem that the profits
                    were eliminated while the expense of maintaining the schedule was the same as formerly. The real
                    effect upon the old lines was not so serious as might have been expected; although it may have been
                    due to a disinclination to admit loss, the railroads denied any large losses, asserting that the
                    very gradual encroachment of the interurban lines upon their business was more than offset by
                    natural increase in traffic. A very prevalent opinion in those days was that the new form of
                    transportation would win the passenger traffic and leave the heavy freight hauling to the old lines.
                    Steam operators conceded no such spheres of activities.
            
            A means of combatting the traction lines was to compel them to construct expensive crossings. By the
                    provisions of an Indiana statute when a railway crosses another line the building company must bear
                    all the expense of constructing the crossing; this provision afforded the older steam lines a
                    convenient weapon. The opposition of the 
                        Pennsylvania
                     at 
                        Columbus
                     to the 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Greenwood & 
                        Franklin
                     Railroad company and the demands of the Lake Erie & Western railroad at 
                        Elwood
                     upon the Union Traction line have been related.
            Another means of combating the interurbans was to refuse to interchange freight. This was not a very
                    serious handicap for the electric lines in their early existence because no strong effort was made
                    to secure the freight trade. In September, 1907, however, the Indiana Railroad commission, in the
                    case of Farmland Stove company, Farmland, vs. Big Four and Union Traction company held that the
                    interurbans were "common carriers" and, therefore, the steam roads were bound to
                    interchange freight with them.
            Besides the financial waste in duplicating expensive equipment when the traction lines constructed
                    lines parallel to the steam roads there were other serious mistakes committed in the industry itself
                    that will require many years of unprofitable service before the industry can be placed upon an
                    economical basis. At first the newly constructed roads required very little repairs and the novelty
                    of electric traction gave an unnatural though short-lived stimulus to the building of lines of
                    railway. Moreover electric street cars had been used less than a score of years before inter-city
                    traction was begun, and the first cars used in the country were city cars. To meet the sudden demand
                    for cars better adapted to the high speed and greater capacity necessary for the rural lines the
                    manufacturers hastily designed a new type of car. The use of electricity as a motive power was a
                    recent application. While motors, generating machinery, and transmission of current at high voltage
                    for long distances were still in the experimental stage there was a sudden and wide spread demand
                    for electric cars and stationery equipment.
            As a consequence the investors in interurban stocks and bonds 
                    invested enormous sums in machines and materials that were experiments which could result only in
                    loss-a loss which could have been avoided if the growth of interurban systems had been more slow and
                    engineering problems worked out during a long period of years.
            The experimentation injured the roads in another way. The service on the 
                        Marion
                    -Anderson-
                        Indianapolis
                     line and the 
                        Greenfield
                     and 
                        Shelbyville
                     lines was very unreliable during the first two or three years of their operation
                    because of a broken wire or burned out motor.4 After a short time pieces of
                    track, trolley wires, and power plant machinery had to be replaced in many instances.5 Such mistakes are common to any new industry, but the experience was felt heavily by
                    Indiana interurban railway builders because of the investment of so much capital in the untried
                    machinery. The cost of electrical equipment has increased so much within the last few years that an
                    operating company cannot afford to discard antiquated and inefficient equipment as long as it is
                    possible to use it at all.6
            
            Within the last nine years there have been no electric railway lines built. Just before the World war
                    there was a revival of interest in interurbans, many new projects were promoted, and, in some cases,
                    considerable grading was done. Since the year 1913, when the shadow of the crisis was first seen in
                    the financial world, there has been no extensions or new constructions except for double tracking,
                    sidings or switches.
            An evil that early began to handicap the rapidly growing industry was the inflation of stock. The

                     Traction company issued $4,500,000 capital stock and sold a bond issue of
                    the same amount. The capital per mile of track was $144,000-quite too heavy a
                    capitalization for such a line. Although few railways were burdened by such excessive issues of
                    stocks and bonds the interurban lines were generally over capitalized;7 as a
                    consequence many 
                  
                     4 Newspapers of that time abound in incidents in which traffic was
                            interrupted. The frequent breaking of the trolley cable was a serious danger to the
                            passengers.

                     of them are now struggling hopelessly to keep funded debt
                    interest payments from going by default and the payment of dividends is impossible. A great number
                    of the hopelessly burdened lines allowed the mortgages to be foreclosed in order to be placed upon a
                    more sound basis.8 Three lines,

                    that the distress occasioned by excessive capitalization checked the building of interurban lines
                    and rendered impossible extensions and improvements on existing lines by destroying confidence in
                    electric railway investments.9
            
            After the interurban system has recovered from inflation, unwise promotions, and over-hasty
                    construction there will still be serious hindrances to any extensive increase in mileage. The
                    gasoline automobile was being developed about the same time that the interurban lines were spreading
                    over the state. The development of the automobile for cross country travel has come within the last
                    decade along with a widespread interest in and resulting improvement of the public highways of the
                    state.
            If a man drives from his suburban home to his office in the city it is a much more costly though more
                    rapid transportation than riding on electric or steam cars, but he persists in driving his car
                    because he can come and go when he chooses and travel by himself without the annoyance of bumping
                    into

                    excursion trips to "the city" no longer attract crowds of pleasure seekers: those
                    erstwhile excursionists are now driving half way across the state to spend the evening with an
                    intimate friend. The cost per passenger mile for the man who drives his own car is very much greater
                    than for railway transportation; but the freedom of a private car is the deciding factor.
            The recent application of the gasoline vehicle for commercial transportation is a grave menace to the
                    freight and passenger traffic of the interurban lines. The highest development of the jitney bus has
                    been in the east; in a certain town in 
                        New Jersey
                     one-fourth of the city passenger traffic is carried by jitneys.10
                    In 
                        Massachusetts
                     several suburban lines have been forced to stop running cars, and many others have
                    curtailed their schedule. The state legislature of 
                        Maryland
                     gave the public service commission control of the jitneys in 1914, a step that might
                    well be followed by all other states.
            During the last two years many jitneys have begun operation in and around 
                        Indianapolis
                    . The city street railway waged a successful fight against those that were operating on
                    streets over which city car lines were operated; but the interurban companies have not been able to
                    secure relief because the regulation of jitneys has never been entrusted to the Indiana Public
                    Service Commission.

                        Kentucky

                    passengers, except the Ben Davis line of buses whose terminal is at the intersection of 
                        Kentucky
                     and Capitol Avenues.11 There are now eight independent companies
                    operating buses to Southport, Greenwood, 
                        Shelby
                    -ville, Martinsville, 
                  Bloomington,
                            Noblesville
               , and 
                        Franklin
                    . Ninety-two buses arrive at the station each day.12
            
            Although several cars have been removed from the schedule of some lines, notably the Interstate
                    Public Service company, traction officials deride the existence of a real menace to their

                     traffic. Nevertheless the interurbans are today facing nearly
                    the same difficulty that they themselves thrust upon the steam roads two decades ago. A very
                    pertinent question is, "Does the interurban railway possess a means of preservation from
                    successful competition such as the steam road had in its freight traffic" and through
                    passenger service? That means may be found in a development of light parcel delivery or
                    of heavy freight transportation; or it may be discovered in long distance passenger carrying. Again,
                    there may be no need to surrender even short distance hauling to the jitneys, either because of the
                    inability of the jitney to bear up under traffic conditions, or because the jitney may largely
                    develop its own trade, perhaps working in harmony with the interurbans. Many traffic officials very
                    wisely refrain from assailing the jitney on the grounds that it is an uneconomical and unreliable
                    carrier, and advocate co-operation with it.13 As a forerunner and developer of
                    traffic in new districts and as a feeder in regions unsuited to railway building, the jitney would
                    no longer be a rival. Such use is that of the Anderson-Nobles-ville jitney line whose schedule
                    appears in the Union Traction company time table, and the 
                        Bloomington
                    -Martinsville jitney line which sells tickets at

                     by way of the 
                  Terre Haute, Indianapolis
                & Eastern Traction company line
                    for entire distance to 
                        Indianapolis
                    .
            Owing to the lack of detailed, authoritative, and long-time data upon jitney operation there can be
                    but little said upon the relative utility of the two forms of transportation under discussion.
                    Interurban operators are arguing that it is unfair to permit the jitneys to operate over publicly
                    maintained highways, while the electric railways must build their own roadway. The jitneys are
                    accused of being irresponsible and tending to create traffic jams on city streets; the jitneys are
                    more irregular in schedule and are likely to withdraw from operation during unfavorable weather. The
                    absence of any responsibility by the jitneys for adhering to a schedule is unfair to the interurbans
                    who must maintain a fixed schedule under all conditions; but it is doubtful whether a jitney or a
                    bulky 
                  
                     13 Engineers state that the coefficient of friction between rubber and
                            concrete as compared to steel on steel is 3 to 1.
               
                     traction car presents the more serious difficulty to the
                    policeman at the street corner. An honest contest between commercial jitneys and the interurbans
                    would result in a readjustment that would be for the best interests of the carriers and the public.;
                    but an unregulated warfare, especially by the Ford owner who finds himself out of employment and
                    "picks up" a few passengers while operating for an indefinite period is
                    economically destructive. Time will test the utility of the jitney and relegate it to its proper
                    economic sphere.
            Failures
            
            Any account of the development of electric railways in Indiana would be incomplete without some
                    attention being paid to the vast number of fruitless promotions. All schemes that related to the
                    existing lines have been mentioned in their appropriate place; but a surprising number of proposed
                    electric traction lines that were never built were planned in regions not only where no lines are
                    now operating but where no line could profitably operate because of the sparce population and
                    engineering difficulties that interpose. As separate historical facts, these schemes possess little
                    value but considered in relation to the other successful promotions, and studied as facts indicative
                    of the popular and professional attitude toward the new and rapidly spreading system of traction
                    they are of considerable interest.
            During the early years of the present century speculators were impressed by the success of the few
                    lines then operating and wished to have their share of the gains. A charter for the construction of
                    an electric line was thought to be of great value while entailing but small personal liability to
                    the owners.
            A few of these early promotions are to be treated separately and with some detail; but in order to
                    avoid monotony the remaining companies are arranged alphabetically and the date of incorporation,
                    capitalization, names of organizers, proposed route and all other available information is given in
                    a very brief form. All incorporated companies sold enough capital stock to make a survey; if any
                    construction was done, mention is made of the fact. In general, the cause of failure of the schemes
                    was lack of capital. Most of the promotions  were not feasible;
                    and many of the few which were practicable died during the financial crises of 1896, 1906-7 and
                    1913—14.
            Columbia City-Ligonier
            
            September 21, 1895, the 
                  Huntington, Columbia
                City & 
                        Ligonier
                     Electric Railway company ($50,000) was incorporated by Vallorous 
                        Brown
                    , George W. Ruch, Joseph H. Ruch, Thomas R. Marshall and William F. McNagny to build a
                    line in and from 
                        Columbia
                     City to the cities of 
                        Huntington
                    , Albion and 
                        Ligonier
                    . Some franchises were granted but, probably owing to the approaching panic of 1896-97,
                    nothing was done. February 16, 1903, the project of connecting 
                        Huntington
                     and 
                        Columbia
                     City was revived by men who organized the 
                  Huntington, Columbia
                City
                    & Northern Traction company ($50,000).1
            
            Two years later the directors voted to increase the capital stock for the purpose of building to 
                        Indianapolis
                     from 
                        Huntington
                    . The American Engineering company was given the contract for grading.
            By March, 1907, the grade between 
                        Goshen
                     and Wawasee Lake was completed and steel was being laid in 
                        Syracuse
                    . After a mile of track was laid the company was unable to procure any more money and
                    William L. Self of 
                        Syracuse
                     was appointed receiver.2 About $100,000 had been spent
                    upon the twenty mile grade and one mile of track. Appraisers fixed the value of all holdings at
                    $9,640.33 and recommended that the line be abandoned.3 The properties
                    were ordered sold February 1, 1908.
            During these events the Kendallville & 
                        Goshen
                     Traction company ($10,000) was incorporated to build from Kendallville to 
                        Goshen
                     and southward to 
                        Syracuse

            Rochester-Wabash
            
            In the spring of 1896 Charles Everett, of Ft. 
                        Wayne
                    , secured several franchises and contracted for a part of the right-of-way for a line to
                    connect 
                        Rochester
                    , Roann, 
                  Wabash, Warren
               , Montpelier, 
                        Geneva
                     and Celina, 
                        Ohio
                    . Five years later an energetic campaign carried on along the route on another proposed
                    line of railway between 
                        Wabash
                     and 
                        Rochester
                     resulted in the voting of subsidies totaling $110,000.7
            The thirty-five miles of grade between the two cities was constructed; but the company found itself
                    able to pay its debts only, without any resources remaining to lay the track or overhead
                    construction. In the spring of 1904 capitalists from 
                        Pennsylvania
                     and 
                        Ohio
                     bought a controlling interest in the company and for a short time the prospects for the
                    completion of the line were excellent. A total of $130,000 had been expended upon
                    purchasing and grading the right-of-way. The Stanley Construction company who had built the grade,
                    applied for a receiver, alleging failure to pay $7,000.8
            
            In 1913 a contract was given to complete the line from 
                        Rochester
                     to the 
                        Winona
                     Interurban railway line at a point one mile north of Akron. The approaching war in
                    Europe prevented the company from financing construction.9

                     & Indiana Railway company ($50,000) was incorporated March 22, 1903,
                    by Charles J. Pilliard, Alphonso C. Wood, Stephen A. Powers, Leopold C. Stufel and John J. King. The
                    line was to be built from 
                        Angola
                     to the state line and into 
                        Ohio
                     where it was to connect with a 
                  Toledo,
                            Ohio
               , line either at Pioneer or Bryan, 
                        Ohio
                    . A piece of track was first built by the company, however, from 
                        Angola
                     to Lake James, a popular resort. Before completion, one of the chief promoters, J. L.
                    Kinnsey, became financially embarrassed and the line was thrown into receivership.10 The 
                        Angola
                     Railway and Power company11 purchased and completed the line but it
                    was not a paying proposition and was sold to the Indiana Utilities company who soon tore up the
                    tracks and sold them for junk. The increasing use of the automobile by the holiday seekers who were
                    the chief patrons of the line, probably was the principal reason for the failure of the railway.12

                     capitalists realized that it would be a profitable investment to construct a direct
                    line connecting northern Indiana with the cities of Lake Erie. The

                     from Ft.

                    A. Tennis, 
                  Garden City, Kansas

                    right-of-ways were secured, arrangements were made with the 
                        Toledo
                     & Indiana Railway company to furnish power, and in September, 1909, ground was
                    first broken.15 The road had an authorized bond issue of $18,000 per
                        mile.16 A little work was done near Ft. 
                        Wayne
                     in 1910 and by 1913 a fifteen mile grade between Ft. 
                        Wayne
                     and Harlan was completed and many bridges constructed. Construction lagged for several
                    months and with the breaking out of the World war material was so costly that Mr. Tennis, the chief
                    investor, abandoned the line.17

                    terminus was pushed with vigor the following year.18 Farmers donated part of the

            Shortly afterward the LaGrange-Metz extension was completed by the 
                        St. Joseph
                     Valley Railway company, a steam road that had leased the traction company's
                    properties in 1909. The original intention of the investors in the traction company was to connect
                    with a line running west from 
                        Toledo
                     to Pioneer, 
                        Ohio
                    , but since neither the traction company nor the steam line paid expenses of operation,
                    the project of joining the 
                        Ohio
                     line was hopeless.20 A traction company, which was practically a
                    holding company, received a nominal income and the line was maintained personally by Mr. Bucklen
                    until his death in 1917.21 After a short trusteeship the roads were thrown into
                    receivership and offered for sale as required by the terms of Mr. Bucklen's will. There
                    being no bids, the court ordered the road junked.22

                        Geneva
                     but not enough bonds could be sold to lay rails. The short piece of line proved
                    unprofitable and in 1917 the road was junked and the rails sent to

                    Roberts, the contractor, attempted to build the line by issuing script, which the merchants were
                    asked to accept as cash.31 After about six months’ work, the
                    situation demanded a receiver and Charles Harlan was appointed. Eleven miles of grading had been
                    done and two miles of track laid, for which $50,000 had been expended.
            October, 1908, the company was reorganized32 and again February 18, 1909, by

            PARKE COUNTY IN 1924
            Two distinctive features mark the accomplishments of the 
                        Parke County
                     Historical society during this year 1924. These are 1st:
            The celebration of 
                        Rockville
                     centennial in pageantry illustrating the progress of the town and community from
                    primeval forest and from the selection of this spot for the permanent capital of the county in 1824,
                    to this year of our Lord, 1924.
            The pageant was written by Miss Margaretta Stevenson, one of 
                        Rockville
                    's talented young women. Miss Flora M. Frick of State Teachers’
                    College, 
                        Minnesota
                    , pageant director. Mrs. I. R. Sanford, 
                        Rockville
                    , chairman of cast committee and assistant director. Miss Louise Rice, 
                        Rockville
                    , pianist.
            The prologue consisted of a dance of the years escorting TIME, clad in gray with silver coat of mail
                    carrying a silver hour-glass, who gave in clear and distinct tones, these lines: 
                        Turn back, O 
                                Rockville
                             years and let us see Some scenes and faces of antiquity. In This Centennial
                            year Time bids you pause— Why call to mind this history? Because The
                            lives these people lived, the deeds they've done Are what we call tradition; this a
                            cloth begun Of which we weave the pattern; they the warp and woof. Their lives to us a
                            standard, some a stern reproof To keep our pattern beautiful; the fabric hold aloof. Nor
                            time, nor change, nor passing years can dim The love and reverence mem'ry holds
                            them in.
                    
            
            First Episode-The naming of

                    . This scene was historically accurate. Named for a large granite boulder located on a
                    high spot in what is now the center of the town. In the first interlude the Spirit of the Rock
                    becomes the Spirit of 
                        Rockville
                     through her awakening and crowing by Progress accompanied by History and Vision. These
                    named the attendants of the Spirit of 
                        Rockville
                     to be Love, Honor and Fraternity.
            
            The dances of the Flowers and Butterflies followed by those of the Laughing Waters and the Clouds
                    made a most beautiful and artistic setting for this interlude.
            Episodes and interludes followed in prompt order, depicting the unfolding of the religious,
                    educational, political, commercial and social development of 
                        Rockville
                    , and also of the Spirit of Patriotism which has ever been a characteristic of town and
                    county.
            The Postlude-The dances of the Hours and the Years, during which TIME escorts the Spirit of
                    Rockkville giving her and the attendants into the hands of Futurity. All exit led by Progress,
                    History and Vision. The Epilogue spoken by MUTATION the inexorable companion of TIME: 
                        EPILOGUE Roll on, O

                             years, roll on! The Past is but a fragment which is gone. Mutation's
                            hand is restless, ruthless still—Tomorrow must be satisfied, its will Is law. So
                            build today to be The fabric of eternity, For Time and Change are never done, And 
                                Rockville

            This beautiful production was witnessed by an audience variously estimated from five to eight
                    thousand of Parke's population and returned exiles who never lose their love for the county
                    of their nativity.
            Among these visitors was the Honorable Joseph G. Cannon, who motored from 
                  Danville, Ills
               ., to witness the centennial exercises. When the audience learned that
                    this distinguished visitor was present a persistent call for a few words from him was made. Mr.
                    Cannon responded in a few gracious words of greeting and congratulation. Another visitor of whom
                    Parke county is proud was Dr. Harlow Lindley, director of State Historical commission-a Parke county
                    boy.
            Many other returned wanderers might be mentioned did time and space permit.
            Thus closed the 100 years of 
                        Rockville
                    's existence and we passed to larger and more unique phases of historical
                    activity in the second and greatest distinctive historical accomplishment of our society, viz: The
                    photo play of the entire county, setting forth on the screen authentic records of events past and
                    present, of beautiful and picturesque scenery, historic relics and remains, etc., in 12,000 feet of
                    film, almost 200,000 pictures comprising more than 600 scenes.
            
            All who were privileged to witness the reels of The Chronicles of America, which were shown during
                    the State History conference in 
                        Indianapolis
                     last December were duly impressed with the fact that from the standpoint of social
                    service, the enterprise undertaken by the Yale University Press to summarize and set forth on the
                    motion picture screen the entire history of the 
                        United States
                     in a series of Chronicles of America, was and ever will remain an undertaking of the
                    highest and finest educational and patriotic value conceived in this Century, because it not only
                    makes history visual, but makes it both interesting and educational.
            The thought came-Why, in a small way, should not our state or even the counties do what the Yale
                    University press is doing in a large way?
            The opportunity to test this theory came to us of Parke county in an unexpected and very gratifying
                    manner. Mr. Barnett Harris, of 
                        Chicago
                    , a former 
                        Rockville
                     boy, who attained distinction as a soldier in the World War, being promoted from
                    private to captain for meritorious service and who since that period has attained high honor as an
                    artist in the filming world, has perfected inventions in movie picture machinery of very great
                    value-and whether photoing silkworms, or mighty volcanoes in eruption in 
                        Japan
                    , or making the first moving picture of Niagara Falls from an airplane, or with the
                    astronomical expedition to view the total eclipse in the Pacific ocean, he has been a triumph of
                    energy, enterprise and success and we proudly hail him a true Rockvillian.
            When this busy man of large affairs, through happy memories of his boyhood days, offered to film our
                    county, contributing his time and labor, the completed film to cost us nothing except actual
                    expenses of material, travel, etc., we were wise enough to grasp such a magnanimous offer. But
                    historical societies, i. e., county ones, are generally poor as the proverbial church mouse, Parke
                    county is no exception. Again we  were under a lucky star. The
                    directors of our independent Chautauqua offered us a day in the Chautauqua programme to finance the
                    filming and pageant,if the historical society would assume the responsibility of the entire
                    enterprise; which offer we gladly accepted.
            Thus to the co-operation of Prof. J. A. Linebarger and his associates, we owe the completion of the
                    Parke county photoplay, as well as the production of the pageant.
            Capt. Harris began his filming in the spring before the schools of the various townships closed;
                    hence every school and school building in the county appears on the screen. Close-ups of the pupils
                    and teachers,-and their varied out-door activities.
            The churches and congregations, including the Sunday schools are given prominence. At Bloomingdale,
                    the Friends church is shown with congregation at fourth day service. This is the only church in our
                    county which still observes this midweek worship.
            The fraternal organizations, clubs, societies and industries, sites and remains of extinct
                    industries, such as tan-yards, potteries, iron foundries, etc., all filmed. Many of the oldest
                    citizens of the county also have their places of honor. Among these many interesting pictures is
                    that of the Hon. Joseph G. Cannon, at the home of a friend, Mr. A. C. Crays here in 
                        Rockville
                     and also at the old Cannon home in 
                        Annapolis
                    , under a tree which he himself planted more than 60 years ago.
            It so happened that Dr. Harlow Lindley was a 
                        Rockville
                     visitor during this filming and we are happy to have him caught in the movie with Capt.
                    Harris.
            Parke county is rich in beautiful and picturesque scenery. Capt. Harris with true artistic eye caught
                    many of these exquisite bits of nature's handiwork as well as some lovely results of
                    cultivation. One of these is an old-fashioned flower garden. A thing of delight in itself, but the
                    interest is greatly enhanced by the appearance of two old-fashioned young lovers in the quaint
                    costumes and manners of by-gone days. During this scene "An Old Fashioned Garden" was sung by Mr.
                    Joseph Ellett.
            
            The views along Sugar creek, Big and Little Raccoon, Mill creek and other streams of the county are
                    beyond my descriptive powers.
            Many scenes along the 
                        Wabash
                     illustrate beautifully Paul Dresser's famous song "On the Banks of
                    the 
                        Wabash
                    ." During the time these views were displayed a men's quartette sang,
                    "On the Banks of the 
                        Wabash
                    " the entire audience joining in the chorus.
            This pictured production of biography, history, natural scenery, agriculture and industries consists
                    as was said, of about 12,000 feet of film, in 12 reels. Captain Harris’ dedicatory lines,
                    describe the object.
            "These pictures made by Barnett Harris under the auspices of the 
                        Parke County
                     Historical Society are dedicated to the future generations of the County."
            A fine community spirit prevailed and made this vast undertaking possible. Perhaps special mention
                    should be made of the active and enthusiastic assistance of the county superintendent of schools, J.
                    H. Jollief, and the county agricultural agent, J. R. Meeks, for their invaluable work throughout the
                    county.
            This brief review gives a very inadequate idea of 
                        Parke County
                     Day, 1924. The work of preparing and putting on both the pageant and the film has
                    already produced a marked quickening of interest in local history. It has been well said, that:
                    "A people who takes no pride in the achievements of remote ancestors, will never achieve
                    anything worthy to be remembered by remote descendants." This cannot be said of Parke
                    county.
            As the production is shown from time to time with additions as the years come and go who can predict
                    what the results may be in creating an ever increasing respect and love for our country, our state
                    and our county, because under our government-`of the people, for the people, by the
                    people’ -such things are possible.

               History of 
                            Vanderburgh County
                        
               , By John. E. Iglehart. Day-ton (
                        Ohio
                    ) Historical Publishing Company, 1923, p. 566.
            About ten years ago Mr. Iglehart became interested in the history of southwestern Indiana. A casual
                    survey impressed him with the idea that his community had contributed a number of worthy characters
                    to the country. An examination of the historical literature dealing with the section left with him
                    the impression that a great part of it was inaccurate and still more was partial. A half century in
                    the practice of law had equipped him well for the task of weighing evidence.
            Judge Iglehart's first contribution was an eighty-page article in Volume XVII of the Indiana Magazine of History on Methodism in Southwestern Indiana. This was a
                    scholarly article and was widely appreciated.
            In the volume under review the author has devoted 140 pages to clearing up the early history of 
                        Evansville
                    . Earlier writers had confused the two Hugh McGarys. An investigation of this question
                    led the author to the early histories of 
                        Kentucky
                    , for Hugh McGary the elder was the companion of Daniel 
                        Boone
                     in the settlement of 
                        Kentucky
                     in 1775. The author justly contends that in all those qualities which have made 
                        Boone
                     famous in history McGary was his equal, but that "Excessive praise has been
                    given Daniel 
                        Boone
                     by the early historians. The highest authority exists for the statement that Marshall,
                    the father of 
                        Kentucky
                     early history championed 
                        Boone
                     and Boonesborough to the exclusion of any fair record of Harrodsburgh. Equal justice
                    has not been given to Hugh McGary the Elder."
            The latter moved to 
                        Knox county
                    , Indiana, between 1803 and 1806 and is buried at 
                        Princeton
                    . His son was the founder of 
                        Evansville
                    .
            It is not necessary further to discuss the problems met in such a work. They are common to all such
                    investigation. The author has sought information wherever it might be found -in the Draper Mss. in
                    the files of the first newspapers published in 
                        Evansville
                    , now in the Library of Congress, among the descendants of the settlers and in the
                    official records preserved at the county seats and state capital.
            
            While the volume is small it is a considerable and reliable addition to our state history. The judge
                    is as relentless in the pursuit of truth in writing history as formerly in the practice of law.
         
         
            
               In the Footsteps of the Lincolns, By Ida M. Tarbell. Harper and Bros., 1924, p. 418.
            The story opens with the settlement in Hingham, Mass., in 1637, of Samuel Lincoln, the
                    great-great-great-great grandfather of Abraham Lincoln. He was a weaver by trade, although in these
                    early times it was necessary for men to know a little of all trades in order to cope with the
                    dangers and hardships that were present in the infant colony. Mordecai Lincoln, the son of Samuel,
                    chose as his trade black-smithing and moved across the bay to Hull and later to Cohas-set an
                    outgrowth of Hingham. From 
                        Massachusetts
                     the story takes us into 
                        New Jersey
                     where Mordecai II with his brother Abraham settled in Monmouth county. They soon began
                    to acquire property both in Monmouth and Middlesex counties. In 1730 Mordecai II bought some 300
                    acres of land in Berks county, 
                        Pennsylvania
                    , on which he built a home and prospered, being one of the most prominent men there.
                    John, the son of Mordecai II, not content to remain on the land in 
                        New Jersey
                    , left him in his father's will bought land in Berks county. In 1768 he bought
                    600 acres of land in Augusta county, 
                        Virginia
                    , and went there to live. From 
                        Virginia
                     we follow the family into 
                        Kentucky
                     where Abraham Lincoln, the son of John, came to live in 1782 with his wife, Bathsheba,
                    and four children-Mordecai, Josiah, Mary, and Thomas. The exact boundaries of Abraham's
                    land is not known, although it is known that he owned much land along Green river. While clearing
                    his land one day he was shot by an Indian. In 1793 Bathsheba died and Thomas Lincoln, about whom we
                    are most interested, then spent most of his time with his brother Mordecai who was living in 
                        Washington
                     county. He soon bought some land about 12 miles from Elizabethtown. In 1806 he  was married to Nancy Hanks and went to live at Elizabeth-town.
                    However, Abraham Lincoln was born on a farm near Hodgenville, where the family had gone to live.
                    Another move took them into Knob Creek valley and some few years later to the free soil of southern
                    Indiana near 
                        Rockport
                    . It was here that the mother of Abraham Lincoln died. Eleven years later we find the
                    family in Macon county, 
                        Illinois
                    , where Abraham started out for himself. The rest of the book is filled with the long,
                    hard struggle through which Abraham Lincoln passed before his final success, a plain, honest, hard
                    working man meeting and solving the battles of life with unflinching courage. We know him as a
                    boatman, a store-keeper, a student of law, an orator, a member of the legislature, a debator.
                    Everywhere he made friends and kept them. His life of course was not without romance. One of the
                    greatest tragedies of his life was the death of his sweetheart, Ann Rutledge. He was married to Mary
                    Todd in 1842 and settled down in 
                        Springfield
                    . From then on his life was that of a politician. His staunch stand against slavery, his
                    public speeches, his successful debates against Douglas brought him to the front and made him one of

                        Illinois
                    . His fame soon spread until Abraham Lincoln was known over the whole country. In 1847
                    he began his first term in congress, after which in 1849 he went back to his law practice. The next
                    ten years of his life were given to successful public work, to the work of "educating 
                        Illinois
                    " to the existing conditions of the times. In 1860 he was the successful
                    candidate for the Presidency. Here the book leaves him.
            Ida M. Tarbell is one of the well known Lincoln writers. Some of her other books on this subject are
                    "He Knew Lincoln," "Life of Abraham Lincoln," "In
                    Lincoln's Chair." Her material is selected first hand, having made a
                    "pilgrimage" in 1922 for the purpose of collecting material for her work and for
                    correction of former material. More than one former tradition is broken down. She succeeds in
                    clearing up many vague and wrong impressions of the Lincolns. In no instance does she make a
                    correction which is not backed by sufficient evidence. Her book is written in a clear, readable
                    style.

            This volume is published by the 
                        North Carolina
                     Historical Commission and marks a rather interesting departure in the work of
                    preserving historical material. All the official papers and correspondence are here preserved as
                    well as the public addresses. The great advantage is that all his papers are now available. The
                    disadvantage is that interesting documentary material previous and subsequent must be omitted. No
                    editorial explanations in the form of footnotes are given. How much this will mean in the distant
                    future cannot be estimated now. It is a beautiful volume on good paper and substantially bound.

                    handy and useful book. Vol. I covers the alphabet from A to K inclusive, Vol. II finishes the
                book.
         
         
            
               Judge James Lockhart. Indiana Historical Society Publications Vol. VIII, No. 1.
                    By Georger R. Wilson, Indianap-polis, 1923, p. 69.
            In this pamphlet Mr. Wilson has added another to his list of Indiana biographies. Those who have read
                    his biographies of George H. Proffit and General W. Johnston know the satisfactory kind of work he
                    has done on Judge Lockhart. This biography was prepared for and read to the Southwestern Indiana
                    Historical Society, February 28, 1923. Judge Lock-hart was one of the most prominent citizens of
                    early Evans-ville, born in 
                        New York
                     1806 and died in 
                        Evansville
                     1857. His death was due to consumption brought on perhaps by over-work  and exposure in early political campaigns. Indiana has lost a number of
                    very promising men-Dunn, Bigger, Wright, Willard-in a similar man. Lockhart was well-known for his
                    work as a lawyer, judge, congressman and constitution maker. Mr. Wilson has done his work
                    thoroughly, adding a few selections from speeches delivered by Mr. Lockhart.
         
         
            
               The Outlaws of Cave-in-Rock. Historical Account of the Famous Highwaymen and River
                        Pirates Who Operated in Pioneer Days Upon the 
                            Ohio
                         and 
                            Mississippi
                         Rivers and Over the Natchez Trace. By Otto A. Rothert. The Arthur H. Clark Company, 1924, p. 364.
            The natural cave, located on the north bank of the lower 
                        Ohio
                    , was the rendezvous of the characters, who struck terror to the hearts of the pioneers
                    during the latter part of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries. Here have been
                    enacted some of the bloodiest and foulest deeds of the period. The cave, situated as it is, enabled
                    its tenants to prey upon the boats navigating both rivers, and also to waylay and rob the boatman
                    returning over the old trace. The Harpes, those peculiar and terrible arch-criminals, used it as a
                    base while perpetrating their outrages. Here, too, were made many crisp, new bills which passed for
                    legal tender on the frontier, where there was no standard money. The cave was also the hiding place
                    of the Masons with whom Little Harpe later sought refuge. This band stole money for the sake of
                    stealing and killed only when necessary. Many an immigrant has been robbed of his possessions by the
                    outlaws of Cave-in-Rock, and left to make his fortune again in the West, or perhaps was never heard
                    of again.
            The cave was one of the beauty spots along the river, and was visited by many famous travelers. Among
                    these were Victor Collot, Andrew Ellicott, Christian Shultz, and the naturalist Audubon, who have
                    left some mention of the fact in their writings.
            It was not only a den of outlaws, but sometimes was used as shelter for the families, moving into the
                    northwest, while new homes were built. At other times it was used as a place of religious worship,
                    as was proved by the finding of a small statue near the cave in 1918.
            
            Mr. Rothert is secretary of the Filson Club, succeeding Colonel Durrett. He has been interested in
                    the history of the 
                        Ohio
                     Valley for a number of years, and has written several books upon this subject. In this
                    volume he has attempted to correlate and verify the many traditions which have come down to our day.
                    He has presented his story very ably, in an interesting manner, with many bibliographical notes.

                    pamphlet form by the University and sent to all who requested it. Dr. Woodburn entered the
                    university as a freshman in 1872 and graduated in 1876. Having been born and reared in 
                        Bloomington
                     his memory goes back much beyond this fifty-year span. The only criticism one can
                    suggest on the 20 page pamphlet is that it should be extended 100 pages or more.
         
         
         
            
               A History of 
                            Minnesota
                        
               , By William Watts Folwell. In four volumes. Volume two. 
                        St. Paul
                    : 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society, 1924, p. 477.
            During February of the present year the 
                        Minnesota
                     Historical Society published the second volume of a history of the state of 
                        Minnesota
                    , to be completed in four volumes, by William Watts Folwell, president emeritus of the
                    Universty of Mnnesota.
            Mr. Folwell s a natve of 
                        New York
                     state and a graduate of Hobart college. Soon after hs graduaton he taught mathe-matcs
                    his Alma Mater, traveled ad studied in Europe and returned just in time to enlist and ser serve
                    three years in the Union army. He came to 
                        Minnesota
                     in 1869 as president of the State University which office he held for fifteen years. He
                    served the University twenty-three years more as librarian and professor of political science; he
                    retired from the University work in 1907. As a closing work of a very useful life Mr. Folwell has
                    written this history of 
                        Minnesota
                    .
            After reading the second volume with considerable care one retains his high opinion of this scholarly
                    piece of work. It follows in good order the first volume, givng a full account of the activities of
                    the people of 
                        Minnesota
                     during the days of early statehood, of the loyal support of the union during the Civil
                    war, something of the troubles at home with the Indians during this formative period, and an
                    interesting account of the first railroad of the state. Throughout the book the author keeps in
                    close touch with the people and gives the reader vivid pictures of the struggles of the early
                    pioneers of that state.
            The volume has received some adverse criticism on the ground of perspective. Such criticism is not
                    merited. A historian is bound by the facts of his investigation. The Indian wars monopolized the
                    attention of 
                        Minnesota
                     for three or four years and a history failing to leave this impression would be less
                    than truthful. In my judgment there is nothing better in the two volumes than the author's
                    account of these Indian troubles. The footnotes and bibliographical work maintains its former high
                    level. It is to be hoped the author will preserve
                     his critical attitude down through the period when
                    he was an active participant.

               Messages and Papers of Jonathan Jennings, Ratliff Boon, and William Hendricks,
                    1816-1825. Edited by LOGAN ESAREY, 
                        Indianapolis
                    , Indiana Historical Commission, 1824. Pp. xvi, 544.
            This volume is the twelfth of the Indiana Historical Collections and the third in
                    the series of Governor's Messages and Letters. It includes the messages and other official
                    papers o fthe three governors who served the state of Indiana from 1816 to 1825. It also presents a
                    number of speeches and letters of Governor Hendricks from the periods preceding and following his
                    term as governor. Very little of the correspondence of Governor Jennings has been discovered. In the
                    case of Governor Boon, simply his message of December 2, 1922, is included. In fact, this was his
                    only message, since he acted as governor for a few weeks only following the resignation of Governor
                    Jennings near the close of his second term.
            Doctor Esarey furnishes an introduction of twenty-five pages dealing in an interesting and
                    instructive manner with the political history of the territory and state from 1800 to 1825. In
                    addition, he presents brief biographical sketches of each of the three governors. He adheres to his
                    policy, followed in the preparation of the two preceding volumes in the series, of avoiding as far
                    as possible the use of footnotes and other editorial detail. Perhaps he is too modest in this
                    regard. The volume is well-printed, well-bound, and attractive. It gives pleasure to all who are
                    interested in the history of Indiana and the Middle West, to see these volumes come from the press.
                    The people of the state and the members of the General Assembly should be proud of the opportunity
                    to continue their support of the Indiana Historical Commission in the good work of publishing the
                    sources of the State's history.
